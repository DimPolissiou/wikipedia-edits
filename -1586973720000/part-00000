Starting in the 1880s he wrote a series of articles for the ''Correspondant'' on his trip into west Canada. He also published many works on his trip to Chicago, New York and [[Dakota Territory|Dakota]] in the United States of America, in which he put the French public on guard against what he saw as American \"[[imperialism]]\".\n\nMandat-Grancey also visited [[Madagascar]], the [[French Congo]] and the [[Congo Free State]] (owned by king [[Leopold II of Belgium]]) as well as [[Greece]] and [[Ireland]], writing memoirs of his trips there. At the turn of the century, the name of Mandat-Grancey would be associated with the [[Orl\u00e9anist|royalism]] of [[Charles Maurras]] and the [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]. He was one of the first contributors to the ''[[Revue d'Action fran\u00e7aise]]'' (founded by [[Henri Vaugeois]] and [[Maurice Pujo]] in 1899).

Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House.\n\nHouses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location.\n\n=====Green Street Houses=====\n* Hubbard House \u2013 Hubbard House is the residence of fictional President [[Selina Meyer]] from the HBO Show [[Veep]].

One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]]. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.\n\n====Clubs, sports, and organizations====\nIn addition to the 11 varsity sports, there are currently more than 200 clubs and organizations that cater to Smith students\u2019 variety of interests. There are options that can be found based on academic, political, cultural, and athletic interests. If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own.\n\n=====Athletics=====\nSmith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|title=A Smith First: The New Game of Basketball|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807101716/https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|archive-date=2019-08-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|title=Flashback Photo: Smith College Basketball Team, 1904|date=2014-03-24|website=New England Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708054411/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|archive-date=2019-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams\u2014and to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today.\n\nSmith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.\n\nSmith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then \"follows\" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.\n\n=====Cultural organizations=====\nThere are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students\u2019 Association (ASA), Black Students\u2019 Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students\u2019 Organization (ISO), Korean Students\u2019 Association (KSA), the Latin American Students\u2019 Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students\u2019 Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students\u2019 Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students\u2019 Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created.\n\n===Academic year events===\n'''[[Convocation]]''' signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique \"senior hats,\" to be worn for the first time at Convocation.\n\n'''[[Mountain Day]]''' is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve [[New England]] road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together.\n\n'''[[Otelia Cromwell]] Day''', named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year.\n\n'''Rally Day''' In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of [[George Washington]]'s birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social\u2014though always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, \"Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?\" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as '''Rally Day''' (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae.\n\n===Reunions and Commencement events===\nThe Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; \"off-year\" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the \"Class of 1776.\"\n\nTraditional reunion and [[Graduation|Commencement]] events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.\n\n[[File:Smith College - Ivy Day Seniors.jpg|thumb|220px|Ivy Day]]\n\n'''[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]''', the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college.\n\n'''Illumination Night''', beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Gardens]]. The major official event of the night is the '''Senior Step Sing''': seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the '''Sophomore Push''' committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and \"into the real world.\"\n\nUntil the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. \"Significant\" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.\n\nThere have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See [[Smith College commencement controversies]] to learn more.\n\n==Environmental sustainability==\n[[File:Paradise Pond.jpg|thumb|Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left)]]\n\nSmith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts.<ref name=\"smith.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |title=Smith College: Green Smith |publisher=Smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930235407/http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |archive-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of \"to-go\" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer \"To-Go\" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, [[biodegradable plastic]], and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed.\n\nFor Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of \"A-\" on the \"College Sustainability Report Card 2010\" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |title=Smith College \u2013 Green Report Card 2010 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201946/http://greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |archive-date=2010-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumnae==\n<!--Please see Talk page discussion of notability criteria------------------------------------>\n<!--and the possibility of moving this section in its entirety to [[List of Smith College people]] or other page-->\n{{Main|List of Smith College people}}\n\nAmong the more notable of Smith College's alumnae in chronological order are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Otelia Cromwell]] (class of 1900): first African-American graduate of Smith college and the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from Yale\n* [[Eunice Carter]] (class of 1921): first female African-American assistant district attorney for the state of New York, active in the prosecution of mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano\n* [[Margaret Mitchell]] (class of 1922): author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Julia Child]] (class of 1934): chef, author and television personality <ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Madeleine L'Engle]] (class of 1941): author\n* [[Betty Friedan]] (class of 1942): feminist and author of ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''\n* [[Nancy Reagan]] (class of 1943): [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989\n* [[Penny Chenery]] (class of 1943): sportswoman, racehorse breeder and owner, horse racing advocate\n* [[Jean Harris]] (class of 1945): headmistress of the [[Madeira School]] who murdered her ex-lover [[Herman Tarnower]] in a jealous rage\n* [[Rhoda Dorsey]] (class of 1946): historian and first woman president of [[Goucher College]]\n* [[Barbara Bush]] (class of 1947): former [[First Lady of the United States]], did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Natalie Babbitt]] (class of 1954): notable illustrator and author of ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]''\n* [[Sylvia Plath]] (class of 1955): poet, novelist and short story author\n* [[Gloria Steinem]] (class of 1956): founder of ''[[Ms.]]'' magazine and noted feminist, activist, and journalist\n* [[Lynden B.

Their successes inspired President [[Thomas C. Mendenhall (historian)|Thomas C. Mendenhall]] and Dean Alice Dickinson to officially expand the program. In January 1975, the '''Ada Comstock Scholars Program''' was formally established under President [[Jill Ker Conway]] and in the fall of that year forty-five women were enrolled. The students range in ages, backgrounds, and geographical locations. The growth of the program peaked just over 400 students in 1988.\n\nThe program is named for [[Ada Comstock|Ada Louise Comstock Notestein]] (1876\u20131973), an 1897 Smith graduate, professor of English and dean of Smith from 1912\u201323, and president of [[Radcliffe College]] from 1923\u201343.

This policy is intended to add to the camaraderie and social cohesion of its students. Unlike most institutions of its type, Smith College does not have dorms, but rather 36 separate houses, ranging in architectural style from 18th-century to contemporary. It is rumored the architecture of Chapin House was the inspiration for the Tara Plantation House in ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]''.

Each house is self-governing. While many students remain in the same house for the entirety of their four years at Smith, they are not obligated to do so, and may move to different houses on campus as space allows. While houses previously collected dues, in the 2019-2020 school year they were eradicated to avoid placing financial pressure on low-income students or students who were otherwise unable to pay without sacrificing funding for the House.\n\nHouses are found in four main regions of campus: Upper and Lower Elm Street, Green Street, Center Campus, and the Quadrangle. Each region can, in turn, be divided into smaller areas to more precisely provide the location of the house in question. In 2019, the college shifted from officially recognizing the four main areas of campus to instead categorizing houses in four neighborhoods: Ivy, Paradise, Mountain, and Garden. This change was largely internal, and categorizes houses by size rather than location.\n\n=====Green Street Houses=====\n* Hubbard House \u2013 Hubbard House is the residence of fictional President [[Selina Meyer]] from the HBO Show [[Veep]].

One such tale holds Sessions House is inhabited by the ghost of Lucy Hunt, who died of a broken heart after being separated from her lover, General Burgoyne. Reports of a ghost in Sessions House predate its history as a campus house. Built in 1751 by the Hunt family, the house has a secret staircase where, according to legend, the Hunt's eldest daughter Lucy would rendezvous with her lover, [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]]. The two were ultimately driven apart, and in the 1880s it was believed the ghost of a heartbroken Burgoyne haunted the staircase. Since Sessions House became part of college housing in the 20th century, the specter has taken on a decidedly feminine identity, and some former residents of Sessions claim to have seen Lucy's ghost in the stairwell.\n\n====Clubs, sports, and organizations====\nIn addition to the 11 varsity sports, there are currently more than 200 clubs and organizations that cater to Smith students\u2019 variety of interests. There are options that can be found based on academic, political, cultural, and athletic interests. If a student doesn't find an organization that fits their specific interest or need, they can create their own.\n\n=====Athletics=====\nSmith's athletic teams have been known as the Pioneers since 1986. The name expresses the spirit of Smith's students and the college's leadership role in women's athletics (the first women's basketball game was played at Smith in 1893).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|title=A Smith First: The New Game of Basketball|website=Smith College|language=en|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807101716/https://www.smith.edu/video/smith-first-new-game-basketball|archive-date=2019-08-07|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|title=Flashback Photo: Smith College Basketball Team, 1904|date=2014-03-24|website=New England Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708054411/http://www.newenglandhistoricalsociety.com/smith-college-basketball-team-1904/|archive-date=2019-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nA new spirit mark was unveiled to the Smith community in December 2008. The new visual identity for Smith's sports teams marks the culmination of a yearlong project to promote visibility and enthusiasm for Smith's intercollegiate and club teams\u2014and to generate school spirit broadly. The spirit mark is used for athletics uniforms, casual apparel and promotional items for clubs and organizations. As Smith was the first women's college to join the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], the new mark is seen as linking the college's pioneering alumnae athletes to their equally determined and competitive counterparts today.\n\nSmith College does not have college colors in the usual sense. Its official color is white, trimmed with gold, but the official college logo is blue and yellow (a previous logo was burgundy and white). NCAA athletic teams have competed in blue and white (or blue and yellow, in the case of the soccer, crew, swimming, and squash teams) uniforms since the 1970s, and selected Pioneers as the official name and mascot in 1986. Popular club sports are free to choose their own colors and mascot; both Rugby and Fencing have chosen red and black.\n\nSmith has a rotating system of class colors dating back to the 1880s, when intramural athletics and other campus competitions were usually held by class. Today, class colors are yellow, red, blue and green, with incoming first-year classes assigned the color of the previous year's graduating class; their color then \"follows\" them through to graduation. Alumnae classes, particularly at reunion, continue to identify with and use their class color thereafter.\n\n=====Cultural organizations=====\nThere are 11 chartered cultural organizations that fall under the UNITY title: the Asian Students\u2019 Association (ASA), Black Students\u2019 Alliance (BSA), Chinese Interregional Student Cultural Org (CISCO), South Asian Student Association of Smith (EKTA), Indigenous Smith Students and Allies (ISSA), International Students\u2019 Organization (ISO), Korean Students\u2019 Association (KSA), the Latin American Students\u2019 Organization (LASO), Multiethnic Interracial Smith College (MISC), Smith African and Caribbean Students\u2019 Association (SACSA), and the Vietnamese Students\u2019 Association (VSA). Smith College Website Multicultural Affairs The Black Students\u2019 Alliance is the oldest of all Unity organizations. In Fall 2012, as an effort to document the history of students of color on Smith campus, the Weaving Voices Archives Project was created.\n\n===Academic year events===\n'''[[Convocation]]''' signals the start of the fall semester. For new students it is the first chance to experience Smith College's tradition and spirit. Likewise, for some returning students, the annual event is like a big, welcome-home party as well as an occasion for celebration and an opportunity for creative attire. House communities develop imaginative themes for group fashion, and Smith seniors put special touches on favorite hats to create their own unique \"senior hats,\" to be worn for the first time at Convocation.\n\n'''[[Mountain Day]]''' is observed early in the fall semester. The President of the College selects a crisp, sunny, beautiful autumn day when the leaves are in full color, and announces the cancellation of classes by having bells rung on campus at 7:15 AM on the chosen day. The eager anticipation of Mountain Day leads to intense speculation meteorology by students in the weeks leading up to the surprise announcement. Traditional observance of Mountain Day by students might involve [[New England]] road trips or outdoor pursuits, and college dining services provides box lunches to be taken off-campus. Many of the Houses go apple picking together.\n\n'''[[Otelia Cromwell]] Day''', named for Smith's first African-American student, began in 1989 to provide students with an in-depth program specifically addressing issues of racism and diversity. Afternoon classes are cancelled, and students are invited to participate in lectures, workshops, symposia and cultural events focused on a different theme each year.\n\n'''Rally Day''' In February 1876, the College began an annual observance of [[George Washington]]'s birthday. In 1894, a rally became part of the day's events, and the focus of the celebration became primarily patriotic rather than exclusively social\u2014though always with a women's college twist. Students that year staged a mock debate on the subject, \"Does Higher Education Unfit a Man for Domestic Life?\" In 1906 the celebration was first referred to as '''Rally Day''' (although the name was not used officially by the College until 1992). In 1944, seniors made Rally Day the first public wearing of their graduation caps and gowns; since then, mortarboards have been replaced by wacky, often homemade hats. Today, the Rally Day Convocation is centered on a historical theme, and features a distinguished keynote speaker and the awarding of Smith College Medals to accomplished alumnae.\n\n===Reunions and Commencement events===\nThe Alumnae Association of Smith College hosts official class reunions every five years. All alumnae from all classes are welcome to return in any year; \"off-year\" alumnae attend campus-wide events as the \"Class of 1776.\"\n\nTraditional reunion and [[Graduation|Commencement]] events are linked, and celebrate the close ties between Smith's alumnae and its graduating seniors and their families. At the conclusion of final exams, most underclasswomen leave the campus, while seniors remain in their houses for a week to celebrate and prepare for Commencement. Alumnae arrive for reunions later in the week, and many alumnae arrange for official accommodations in the campus houses, right alongside senior residents.\n\n[[File:Smith College - Ivy Day Seniors.jpg|thumb|220px|Ivy Day]]\n\n'''[[Ivy stone|Ivy Day]]''', the day before Commencement, is the high point of reunion and a significant event for seniors as well. Junior ushers lead a parade through campus, carrying vines of ivy to be planted by the departing seniors as a symbol of their lifelong connection to the college. Alumnae (and, often, their children), dressed in white and wearing sashes in their class color, line up in reverse order by class along both sides of the route. Seniors line up nearest the end of the parade route, wearing traditional white outfits and each carrying a single red rose. All cheer each alumnae class as it marches past, then fall in to join the end of the parade. Many alumnae classes carry signs with humorous poems or slogans, or hold balloons or wear hats in their class color. Ivy Day festivities conclude in the Quad, where the seniors plant their ivy and speakers address alumnae on the progress of fundraising and the state of the college.\n\n'''Illumination Night''', beginning at dusk on the Saturday evening before Commencement, is a celebration of the campus and a send-off of sorts for graduating seniors. Throughout central campus, electric street lights are replaced for one night by multicolored Japanese-style paper lanterns, lit with real candles. These hang on both sides of every walking path and cast a soft glow over the buildings and lawns. Student a cappella singing groups and improv comedy troupes roam the campus, stopping occasionally to entertain the crowds. A jazz band, hired by the college, turns the science buildings' courtyard into a dance floor. Seniors, alumnae, faculty and their families spend the evening on walking tours of the illuminated campus and [[The Botanic Garden of Smith College|Botanic Gardens]]. The major official event of the night is the '''Senior Step Sing''': seniors gather on the steps of Neilson Library, where they are serenaded by members of the '''Sophomore Push''' committee, then are physically pushed off the stairs and \"into the real world.\"\n\nUntil the early 1990s, all alumnae reunions were held during Commencement weekend. However, as the number of returning alumnae grew beyond the capacity of the campus, reunions were split into Reunion I/Commencement Weekend and Reunion II, held the following weekend. \"Significant\" reunions (50-, 25- and 10- year, but also 2-year) and the earliest reunion classes (65-year and prior) are assigned to Reunion I; other reunions (5-, 15-, 20-, 30-year, and so on) are assigned to Reunion II.\n\nThere have been several controversies surrounding commencement over the years. See [[Smith College commencement controversies]] to learn more.\n\n==Environmental sustainability==\n[[File:Paradise Pond.jpg|thumb|Paradise Pond with portion of athletic fields visible (center left)]]\n\nSmith has taken numerous steps toward environmental sustainability, including a 30% reduction in energy use. Also, through a contract with Zipcar, the college has reduced the need for individually owned cars on campus. Complementing this effort, the college has also promoted sustainability through academics and through the arts.<ref name=\"smith.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |title=Smith College: Green Smith |publisher=Smith.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930235407/http://www.smith.edu/green/news.php |archive-date=2010-09-30 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn keeping with its sustainability efforts, all Smith dining locations have discontinued the use of \"to-go\" supplies which included paper cups and plates, as well as plastic utensils. They now encourage students to bring their own, reusable containers and utensils if they wish to bring food back to their rooms. Smith College provides all students with a reusable drink container at the beginning of each academic year. In past years, these containers have been variations on travel mugs, Sigg bottles, and nalgenes. Those dining halls that still offer \"To-Go\" options no longer provide paper bags, and instead use wax paper bags, [[biodegradable plastic]], and recyclable utensils made of vegetable cellulose. In the fall of 2017, Smith dining halls began to offer plastic tupperware containers students may borrow and return to the dining halls to be washed.\n\nFor Smith's efforts regarding sustainability, the institution earned a grade of \"A-\" on the \"College Sustainability Report Card 2010\" administered by the Sustainable Endowments Institute. Smith was lauded for many of the indicator categories, including student involvement, green building, and transportation, but was marked down for endowment transparency.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |title=Smith College \u2013 Green Report Card 2010 |publisher=Greenreportcard.org |date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620201946/http://greenreportcard.org/report-card-2010/schools/smith-college |archive-date=2010-06-20 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumnae==\n<!--Please see Talk page discussion of notability criteria------------------------------------>\n<!--and the possibility of moving this section in its entirety to [[List of Smith College people]] or other page-->\n{{Main|List of Smith College people}}\n\nAmong the more notable of Smith College's alumnae in chronological order are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=40em}}\n* [[Otelia Cromwell]] (class of 1900): first African-American graduate of Smith college and the first African American woman to receive a doctorate from Yale\n* [[Eunice Carter]] (class of 1921): first female African-American assistant district attorney for the state of New York, active in the prosecution of mob boss Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano\n* [[Margaret Mitchell]] (class of 1922): author of ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Julia Child]] (class of 1934): chef, author and television personality <ref name=\":0\" />\n* [[Madeleine L'Engle]] (class of 1941): author\n* [[Betty Friedan]] (class of 1942): feminist and author of ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]''\n* [[Nancy Reagan]] (class of 1943): [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1981 to 1989\n* [[Penny Chenery]] (class of 1943): sportswoman, racehorse breeder and owner, horse racing advocate\n* [[Jean Harris]] (class of 1945): headmistress of the [[Madeira School]] who murdered her ex-lover [[Herman Tarnower]] in a jealous rage\n* [[Rhoda Dorsey]] (class of 1946): historian and first woman president of [[Goucher College]]\n* [[Barbara Bush]] (class of 1947): former [[First Lady of the United States]], did not graduate from Smith\n* [[Natalie Babbitt]] (class of 1954): notable illustrator and author of ''[[Tuck Everlasting]]''\n* [[Sylvia Plath]] (class of 1955): poet, novelist and short story author\n* [[Gloria Steinem]] (class of 1956): founder of ''[[Ms.]]'' magazine and noted feminist, activist, and journalist\n* [[Lynden B.

Based on the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|fictional superhero team of the same name]], the story follows [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and the turtles, their meeting [[April O'Neil]] and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], and their confrontation with [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]] and his [[Foot Clan]]. It stars [[Judith Hoag]], [[Elias Koteas]], and the voices of [[Brian Tochi]], [[Robbie Rist]], [[Corey Feldman]] and [[Josh Pais]].\n\nThe film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the early ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comics, with several elements taken from the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|animated series]] airing at the time. The turtle costumes were developed by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]], one of Henson's last projects before his death shortly after the premiere.\n\n''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' became the highest-grossing [[independent film]] at the time,<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-untold-785653 |title='Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles': Untold Story of the Movie \"Every Studio in Hollywood\" Rejected |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2015-04-02 |accessdate=2016-07-22}}</ref> until 1999's ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]''; the ninth-highest-grossing film worldwide of 1990; and the highest-grossing film in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (film series)|series]] until the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|2014 reboot]]. It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->As a crime wave rises in [[New York City]], reporter [[April O'Neil]] correctly theorizes that the mysterious ninja [[Foot Clan]] may be behind the rising chaos. [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]], the Foot leader, orders April silenced. She is attacked by the Foot in a subway and knocked unconscious. [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], one of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], emerges from the shadows, defeats the Foot, and carries her to the turtles' hideout, unaware that one of the Foot is following him. [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], their rat master, explains to April that he and the turtles were once ordinary animals, but were mutated into intelligent creatures by [[toxic waste]], and trained by Splinter in the art of ninjitsu. After the turtles escort April home, they find their hideout ransacked and Splinter kidnapped. They return to April's apartment and spend the night there.\n\nDanny Pennington, the delinquent son of April's supervisor Charles Pennington, works for the Foot. After bailing Danny out of jail for robbery and truancy, Charles stops at April's apartment where Danny glimpses one of the turtles hiding. He reports this to Shredder.\n\nAfter an argument with [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], Raphael goes to the roof of April's apartment building, where the Foot ambush him. He is knocked unconscious and the turtles scramble to defend themselves, assisted by the vigilante [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], who had recently met Raphael. The building catches fire during the fight and the turtles retreat to a farm belonging to April's family. Raphael recovers and the turtles train while April and Casey fall in love. Leo contacts Splinter through [[telepathy]], and the turtles return to New York to rescue him.\n\nDanny has secretly been taking counsel from Splinter, who tells him the story of his master Hamato Yoshi's murder by a rival ninja, Oroku Saki, over the love of a woman, while Splinter was an ordinary rat. During the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken and he lunged at Saki's face, clawing and biting him. Saki threw Splinter to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. When Danny learns the Shredder intends to have Splinter killed, he and Casey set him free. Splinter reveals to the other teens who have been recruited by the Foot that the Shredder has been brainwashing them to do his dirty work. Realizing this, they all resign from the Foot.\n\nThe turtles engage the Foot in battle, easily defeating every Foot Clan ninja, but upon facing the Shredder, he defeats them singlehandedly. As the Shredder prepares to kill Leonardo, Splinter appears and challenges him to a fight. Splinter names Shredder as Oroku Saki; Saki removes his mask and touches his scar, remembering how Splinter gave it to him. He charges Splinter to spear him, who ensnares the Shredder's [[yari]] with [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo's]] [[nunchaku]], leaving him dangling over the roof's edge. In a final attempt to kill Splinter, Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter, but when Splinter reaches to catch it, his grip is released and Saki falls into a garbage truck. Casey pulls the lever \"accidentally\" to activate the compactor, crushing the Shredder. As the police arrive and arrest the Foot soldiers, the teens tell them the location of the Foot hideout. Reunited with Splinter, the turtles watch as April and Casey kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as [[April O'Neil]], a reporter for Channel 3 News\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], a streetwise vigilante and former [[ice hockey]] player who becomes an ally of the turtles\n* [[Jay Patterson]] as Charles Pennington, April's boss\n* Michael Turney as Danny Pennington, Charles's teenage son\n* [[Raymond Serra]] as Chief Sterns, the Police Chief of New York City\n* [[James Saito]] as [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Oroku Saki / The Shredder]], the founder of a network of runaways-turned-thieves and the main antagonist of the film\n* Toshishiro Obata as Tatsu, Shredder's second-in-command\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Head Thug\n\n[[Skeet Ulrich]] and [[Scott Wolf]] appear as unnamed members of the Foot Clan, but are uncredited.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Brian Tochi]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], the leader of the Turtles and the closest to Splinter\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], the brains of the Turtles<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Josh Pais]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], the rebellious and angry Turtle<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Robbie Rist]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], the youngest and fun-loving party Turtle\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], the Turtles' master. \n* David McCharen as Oroku Saki / The Shredder\n* [[Michael McConnohie]] as Tatsu\n\n===Puppeteers===\n* [[Martin P.

Production designer Roy Forge Smith and his art director, Gary Wissner, went to New York City four months prior to filming and took still photographs of rooftops and other various locations. While in NYC, Smith and Wissner were allowed to explore an abandoned [[Brooklyn]] subway line, as they could not gain access to a city sewer, but the structure of the subway had the same principle as a sewer. They also went to a water tunnel which had large pipes running through it.<ref name=\"turtlesmain\">{{cite web | author=| title=TMNT I | work=ninjaturtles.com| url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/movies/movie1.htm | accessdate=September 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAfter design sketches were created, the construction team used the studios' backlot to create some of the sets. There were problems with the manholes that led to the turtles' home, in that an eight-foot square room had to be constructed beneath them, but found water at about five-feet, and thus had to pour concrete into the underground rooms to keep the water out. In order to make the sewer authentic, a tide-mark was given, and it was covered with brick, plaster and stucco paint to give the walls a realistic look. The turtles were created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] in London.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> [[Jim Henson]] said that the creatures were the most advanced that he had ever worked with. The creatures were first made out of fiberglass, and then remolded out of clay.<ref>{{cite news|title= Mock Turtle Suits|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 30, 1990|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317054,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-07}}</ref> They were produced as molds to cast the whole body in foam rubber latex.

Editor [[Sally Menke]], who later edited many films by [[Quentin Tarantino]], was removed as production company [[Orange Sky Golden Harvest|Golden Harvest]] did not like her work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/238339/the-original-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-movie-is-still-amazing|title=The Original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Movie Is Still Amazing|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n===Marketing===\nLive Entertainment Inc. announced that the film would go to VHS via its [[Family Home Entertainment]] label on October 4, 1990.

Also, the scene of Shredder in the garbage shred was heavily edited and the [[Turtle Power]] song was edited to change the word 'ninja' to 'hero' as per the UK television series.

Furthermore, the German dubbing audio track contains several \"cartoon-like\" sounds in order to soften the violence of the fight scenes.

It stars [[Judith Hoag]], [[Elias Koteas]], and the voices of [[Brian Tochi]], [[Robbie Rist]], [[Corey Feldman]] and [[Josh Pais]].\n\nThe film is an [[Film adaptation|adaptation]] of the early ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comics, with several elements taken from the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|animated series]] airing at the time.

It was followed by two sequels, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'' (1991) and ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' (1993).\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE 400-700 WORDS. -->As a crime wave rises in [[New York City]], reporter [[April O'Neil]] correctly theorizes that the mysterious ninja [[Foot Clan]] may be behind the rising chaos. [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|The Shredder]], the Foot leader, orders April silenced. She is attacked by the Foot in a subway and knocked unconscious. [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], one of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], emerges from the shadows, defeats the Foot, and carries her to the turtles' hideout, unaware that one of the Foot is following him. [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], their rat master, explains to April that he and the turtles were once ordinary animals, but were mutated into intelligent creatures by [[toxic waste]], and trained by Splinter in the art of ninjitsu. After the turtles escort April home, they find their hideout ransacked and Splinter kidnapped. They return to April's apartment and spend the night there.\n\nDanny Pennington, the delinquent son of April's supervisor Charles Pennington, works for the Foot. After bailing Danny out of jail for robbery and truancy, Charles stops at April's apartment where Danny glimpses one of the turtles hiding. He reports this to Shredder.\n\nAfter an argument with [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], Raphael goes to the roof of April's apartment building, where the Foot ambush him. He is knocked unconscious and the turtles scramble to defend themselves, assisted by the vigilante [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], who had recently met Raphael. The building catches fire during the fight and the turtles retreat to a farm belonging to April's family. Raphael recovers and the turtles train while April and Casey fall in love. Leo contacts Splinter through [[telepathy]], and the turtles return to New York to rescue him.\n\nDanny has secretly been taking counsel from Splinter, who tells him the story of his master Hamato Yoshi's murder by a rival ninja, Oroku Saki, over the love of a woman, while Splinter was an ordinary rat. During the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken and he lunged at Saki's face, clawing and biting him. Saki threw Splinter to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. When Danny learns the Shredder intends to have Splinter killed, he and Casey set him free. Splinter reveals to the other teens who have been recruited by the Foot that the Shredder has been brainwashing them to do his dirty work. Realizing this, they all resign from the Foot.\n\nThe turtles engage the Foot in battle, easily defeating every Foot Clan ninja, but upon facing the Shredder, he defeats them singlehandedly. As the Shredder prepares to kill Leonardo, Splinter appears and challenges him to a fight. Splinter names Shredder as Oroku Saki; Saki removes his mask and touches his scar, remembering how Splinter gave it to him. He charges Splinter to spear him, who ensnares the Shredder's [[yari]] with [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo's]] [[nunchaku]], leaving him dangling over the roof's edge. In a final attempt to kill Splinter, Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter, but when Splinter reaches to catch it, his grip is released and Saki falls into a garbage truck. Casey pulls the lever \"accidentally\" to activate the compactor, crushing the Shredder. As the police arrive and arrest the Foot soldiers, the teens tell them the location of the Foot hideout. Reunited with Splinter, the turtles watch as April and Casey kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n===Live-action cast===\n* [[Judith Hoag]] as [[April O'Neil]], a reporter for Channel 3 News\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]], a streetwise vigilante and former [[ice hockey]] player who becomes an ally of the turtles\n* [[Jay Patterson]] as Charles Pennington, April's boss\n* Michael Turney as Danny Pennington, Charles's teenage son\n* [[Raymond Serra]] as Chief Sterns, the Police Chief of New York City\n* [[James Saito]] as [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Oroku Saki / The Shredder]], the founder of a network of runaways-turned-thieves and the main antagonist of the film\n* Toshishiro Obata as Tatsu, Shredder's second-in-command\n* [[Sam Rockwell]] as Head Thug\n\n[[Skeet Ulrich]] and [[Scott Wolf]] appear as unnamed members of the Foot Clan, but are uncredited.\n\n===Voice cast===\n* [[Brian Tochi]] as [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]], the leader of the Turtles and the closest to Splinter\n* [[Corey Feldman]] as [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]], the brains of the Turtles<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Josh Pais]] as [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]], the rebellious and angry Turtle<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/>\n* [[Robbie Rist]] as [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]], the youngest and fun-loving party Turtle\n* [[Kevin Clash]] as [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]], the Turtles' master. \n* David McCharen as Oroku Saki / The Shredder\n* [[Michael McConnohie]] as Tatsu\n\n===Puppeteers===\n* [[Martin P.

Production designer Roy Forge Smith and his art director, Gary Wissner, went to New York City four months prior to filming and took still photographs of rooftops and other various locations. While in NYC, Smith and Wissner were allowed to explore an abandoned [[Brooklyn]] subway line, as they could not gain access to a city sewer, but the structure of the subway had the same principle as a sewer. They also went to a water tunnel which had large pipes running through it.<ref name=\"turtlesmain\">{{cite web | author=| title=TMNT I | work=ninjaturtles.com| url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/movies/movie1.htm | accessdate=September 24, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAfter design sketches were created, the construction team used the studios' backlot to create some of the sets. There were problems with the manholes that led to the turtles' home, in that an eight-foot square room had to be constructed beneath them, but found water at about five-feet, and thus had to pour concrete into the underground rooms to keep the water out. In order to make the sewer authentic, a tide-mark was given, and it was covered with brick, plaster and stucco paint to give the walls a realistic look. The turtles were created by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] in London.<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter1\"/> [[Jim Henson]] said that the creatures were the most advanced that he had ever worked with.

The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also featured in several [[Disney]] theme parks, including the [[Indiana Jones Adventure]], [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril]], Indiana Jones Adventure: \nTemple of the Crystal Skull, and ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!|Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' attractions.\n\nJones is most famously portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] and has also been portrayed by [[River Phoenix]] (as the young Jones in ''The Last Crusade'') and in the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' by [[Corey Carrier]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]].

In consequence, Dr Jones travels the world to prevent them from recovering the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (see also [[Biblical archaeology]]). He is aided by [[Marion Ravenwood]] and [[Sallah]]. The Nazis are led by Jones's archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named Ren\u00e9 Belloq, and Arnold Toht, a sinister [[Gestapo]] agent.\n\nIn the 1984 prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty [[Thuggee]] cult. He is aided by [[Short Round]], a young boy, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott ([[Kate Capshaw]]). The prequel is not as centered on archaeology as ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and is considerably darker.\n\nThe third film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as [[Sallah]] and [[Marcus Brody]], a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at [[Barnett College]]), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous [[Nazi mysticism|Nazi mystics]], this time trying to find the [[Holy Grail]]. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his [[fear of snakes]], his use of a [[bullwhip]], the scar on his chin, and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that \"Indiana\" is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a [[buddy movie]] of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good [[MacGuffin|plot element]] to drive the next installment.<ref name=\"race against time\">{{cite magazine|author1=Nick de Semlyen |author2=Ian Freer |author3=Chris Hewitt |author4=Ian Nathan |author5=Sam Toy |title=A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV|page=100|magazine=Empire|date=2006-09-29}}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', is the latest film in the series. Set in 1957, 19 years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents bent on harnessing the power of an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] device discovered in South America. Jones is aided in his adventure by his former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), and her son\u2014a young [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] named [[Henry \"Mutt\" Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), later revealed to be Jones's unknown child.

[[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril|''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Peril'']] is a looping roller coaster engineered by [[Intamin]], designed by Walt Disney Imagineering, and opened in 1993.\n\nThe ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' is a live show that has been presented in the [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]] theme park of the [[Walt Disney World Resort]] with few changes since the park's 1989 opening, as Disney-MGM Studios. The 25-minute show presents various stunts framed in the context of a feature film production, and recruits members of the audience to participate in the show. Stunt artists in the show re-create and ultimately reveal some of the secrets of the stunts of the ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' films, including the well-known \"running-from-the-boulder\" scene.

Nearly 20 years later ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was novelized by James Rollins based on the script by David Koepp based on the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson and published May 2008 by Ballantine Books. In addition, in 2008 to accompany the release of ''Kingdom of Skulls'', Scholastic Books published juvenile novelizations of the four scripts written, successively in the order above, by Ryder Windham, Suzanne Weyn, Ryder Windham, and James Luceno. All these books have been reprinted, with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' being retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''. While these are the principal titles and authors, there are numerous other volumes derived from the four film properties.\n\n====Original novels====\nFrom February 1991 through February 1999, twelve original Indiana Jones-themed adult novels were licensed by Lucasfilm, Ltd. and written by three genre authors of the period. Ten years afterward, a thirteenth original novel was added, also written by a popular genre author. The first twelve were published by Bantam Books; the last by Ballantine Books in 2009.

One episode, \"Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues\", is bookended by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, rather than Hall. Later episodes and telemovies did not have this bookend format.\n\nThe bulk of the series centers around the young adult Indiana Jones and his activities during [[World War I]] as a 16- to 17-year-old soldier in the Belgian Army and then as an intelligence officer and spy seconded to French intelligence. The child Indy episodes follow the boy's travels around the globe as he accompanies his parents on his father's worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910.\n\nThe show provided some backstory for the films, as well as new information regarding the character. Indiana Jones was born July 1, 1899, and his middle name is Walton (Lucas's middle name). It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever, and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues. His relationship with his father, first introduced in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy. Indy damages or loses his right eye sometime between the events in [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|1957]] and the early 1990s, when the \"Old Indy\" segments take place, as the elderly Indiana Jones wears an eyepatch.\n\nIn 1999, Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases, and re-edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature-length stories. The series title was also changed to ''The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones''.\n\n===Video games===\nThe character has appeared in several officially licensed games, beginning with adaptations of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985 video game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', two adaptations of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (video game)|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (one with purely action mechanics, one with an adventure- and puzzle-based structure) and ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures|Indiana Jones's Greatest Adventures]]'', which included the storylines from all three of the original films.\n\nFollowing this, the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/indianajones/|title=Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> ''Emperor's Tomb'' sets up Jones's companion Wu Han and the search for [[Nurhaci]]'s ashes seen at the beginning of ''Temple of Doom''. The first two games were developed by [[Hal Barwood]] and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; ''Emperor's Tomb'' had David Esch fill the role and ''Staff of Kings'' starred John Armstrong.\n\n''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'' was the first Indy-based game presented in three dimensions, as opposed to 8-bit graphics and side-scrolling games before.\n\nThere is also a small game from Lucas Arts ''[[Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures]]''. A video game was made for young Indy called ''Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos'', as well as a video game version of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''.\n\nTwo [[Lego]] Indiana Jones games have also been released. ''[[Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]'' was released in 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/|title=LEGO Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> and follows the plots of the first three films. It was followed by ''[[Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues]]'' in late 2009. The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films, but focuses on the plot of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.\n\nSocial gaming company [[Zynga]] introduced Indiana Jones to their \"[[Indiana Jones Adventure World|Adventure World]]\" game in late 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewinski|first=John Scott|title=Indiana Jones raids Zynga's Adventure World|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57335066-1/indiana-jones-raids-zyngas-adventure-world/|accessdate=21 December 2012|newspaper=c{{!}}net|date=1 December 2011|location=San Francisco CA}}</ref>\n\n==Character description and formation==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harrison Ford]] as the mature Jones in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).]]\n\n\"Indiana\" Jones's full name is Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr.,<ref>The character's full name is stated in the [[Corey Carrier]] narration of the feature-length episode ''My First Adventure'' from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]].''</ref> and his nickname is often shortened to \"Indy\".\n\nIn his role as a college professor of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations.

[[Carl Barks]] created Scrooge in 1947 as a one-off relation for [[Donald Duck]] in the latter's self-titled comic book.<ref>\"Uncle Scrooge McDuck: His Life and Times\" Celestial Arts Press, Millbrae, Califormia, p.23, 1981. \"These four panels, from pages one and two of CHRISTMAS ON BEAR MOUNTAIN (1948), are the very first appearance of Scrooge McDuck.

Scrooge gradually evolved into a less stereotypical and more complex character.\"</ref> Barks realized that the character had more potential, so a separate ''Uncle Scrooge'' comic book series full of exciting and strange adventures in the company of his duck nephews was developed.

As a documentary of ''Raiders'' pointed out, the hat served a practical purpose. Following the lead of the old \"B\"-movies that inspired the ''Indiana Jones'' series, the fedora hid the actor's face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly. Examples in ''Raiders'' include the wider-angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall, and Indy sliding under a fast-moving vehicle from front to back. Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time.\n\nThe hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to put it back on. In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''. This created the urban legend that Ford stapled the hat to his head.<ref>{{cite web | title=Hat and Jacket featurette | publisher=Official site | date=2008-02-08 | url=http://www.indianajones.com/site/?deeplink=videos/1/v28 | accessdate=2008-02-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209233128/http://www.indianajones.com/site/?deeplink=videos%2F1%2Fv28 | archive-date=2008-02-09 | url-status=dead}}</ref> Anytime Indy's hat accidentally came off as part of the storyline (blown off by the wind, knocked off, etc.) and seemed almost irretrievable, filmmakers would make sure Indy and his hat were always reunited, regardless of the implausibility of its return. Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same.

For ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', jackets were made in-house at Bermans & Nathans in London based on a stunt jacket they provided for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.

Its distinctive feature is two vertical strips running from the shoulders to the bottom of the shirt tails and continued over both breast pockets. A common debate regards the original shirt color. Surviving samples of the original shirts seem to be darker in reality than they appear on screen. Most fans look for an off-white \"stone\" color for their replicas. The original shirts, however, may have been more of a \"tan\" or \"natural\" color. The shirt varied little from film to film, the only notable difference being the darker buttons in ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade''. Originally designed by Andreas Dometakis for the films, this shirt was once one of the hardest pieces of gear to find.\n* The trousers worn by Indiana Jones in all three films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks they are based on the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for ''Raiders'' are said to be more of a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade'' were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.\n* The [[satchel]] was a modified Mark VII [[gas mask]] bag that was used by British troops and civilians during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"TheRaider.net\"/>\n* The whip was an 8- to 10-foot (2.4 to 3.0 m) [[bullwhip]] crafted by David Morgan for the first three films. The whips for ''Crystal Skull'' were crafted by a variety of people, including Terry Jacka, Joe Strain and Morgan (different lengths and styles were likely used in specific stunts).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n* The pistol was usually a [[World War I]]-era revolver, including the [[Webley Revolver|Webley]] Government (WG) Revolver (''Last Crusade'' and ''Crystal Skull''), or a [[Smith & Wesson]] Second Model Hand Ejector revolver (''Raiders''). He has also used a [[Colt Official Police]] revolver (''Temple of Doom''), a [[Nagant M1883]] (''Young Indiana Jones''), and a 9&nbsp;mm [[Browning Hi-Power]] (''Raiders'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indygear.com/igguns.html|title=Indiana Jones Guns|publisher=IndyGear.com|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> The weapon is carried in a military pattern flap holster.\n* The shoes were made by [[Alden Shoe Company|Alden]].

However, Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for ''Magnum, P.I.'' was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for ''Raiders'' had concluded.\n\nSubsequently, [[Peter Coyote]] and [[Tim Matheson]] both auditioned for the role. However, after Spielberg suggested Ford again, Lucas relented, and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n\n===Archaeological influence===\nThe industry magazine ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' named eight past and present archaeologists who they felt \"embodied [Jones'] spirit\" as recipients of the Indy Spirit Awards in 2008.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\">{{cite magazine|last1=Peed|first1=Mike|title=Digging: Archaeologists and \"Indiana Jones\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/digging|magazine=The New Yorker|date=June 9, 2008}}</ref> That same year Ford himself was elected to the Board of Directors for the Archaeological Institute of America.

Since the release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film's release, the stereotypical image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lackluster professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=McGeough|first1=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|date=2006}}</ref> Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist was thought of as an adventurer consistently engaged in [[fieldwork]].<ref name=\"The Indiana Jones Effect\">{{cite journal|last1=Strong|first1=Meghan|title=The Indiana Jones Effect|journal=Lycoming College Archaeology Department|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nArcheologist Anne Pyburn described the influence of Indiana Jones as elitist and sexist, and argued that the film series had caused new discoveries in the field of archaeology to become oversimplified and overhyped in an attempt to gain public interest, which negatively influences archaeology as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pyburn|first1=Anne|title=Public Archaeology, Indiana Jones, and Honesty|journal=Archaeologies: Journal of the World Archaeological Congress|date=2008}}</ref> Eric Powell, an editor with the magazine ''Archaeology'', said \"O.K., fine, the movie romanticizes what we do\", and that \"Indy may be a horrible archeologist, but he's a great diplomat for archeology.

\"Indiana\" Jones Jr.''' is the [[title character]] and [[protagonist]] of the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' franchise]]. [[George Lucas]] created the character in homage to the action heroes of 1930s film serials. The character first appeared in the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', to be followed by ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' in 1984, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' in 1989, ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' from 1992 to 1996, and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' in 2008. The character is also featured in novels, comics, video games, and other media. Jones is also featured in several [[Disney]] theme parks, including the [[Indiana Jones Adventure]], [[Indiana Jones et le Temple du P\u00e9ril]], Indiana Jones Adventure: \nTemple of the Crystal Skull, and ''[[Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular!|Epic Stunt Spectacular!]]'' attractions.\n\nJones is most famously portrayed by [[Harrison Ford]] and has also been portrayed by [[River Phoenix]] (as the young Jones in ''The Last Crusade'') and in the television series ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' by [[Corey Carrier]], [[Sean Patrick Flanery]], and [[George Hall (actor)|George Hall]]. Doug Lee has supplied the voice of Jones for two [[LucasArts]] video games, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'', David Esch supplied his voice for ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'', and John Armstrong for ''[[Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings]]''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1363107/ Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings (Video Game 2009) \u2013 IMDb<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nJones is characterized by his iconic accoutrements ([[bullwhip]], [[fedora]], [[satchel]],<ref name=\"TheRaider.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theraider.net/information/indy_gear/shoulderbag.php |title=TheRaider.net \u2013 Indiana Jones' Gear |publisher=TheRaider.net |accessdate=4 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205090014/http://www.theraider.net/information/indy_gear/shoulderbag.php |archivedate=February 5, 2015 }}</ref><ref name=\"Gadsden Times 1988-12-14\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1891&dat=19881214&id=dzlHAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9_0MAAAAIBAJ&pg=2477,1773695|title=George Lucas claims copyright violation in suit|date=14 December 1988|newspaper=[[The Gadsden Times]]|accessdate=4 September 2014}}</ref> and [[leather jacket]]), wry, witty and sarcastic sense of humor, deep knowledge of ancient civilizations and languages, and [[fear of snakes]].\n\nSince his first appearance in ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', Indiana Jones has become one of cinema's most famous characters.

The character is an adventurer reminiscent of the 1930s film serial treasure hunters and [[pulp magazine|pulp]] action heroes. His research is funded by Marshall College (a fictional school named after producer Frank Marshall),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.com/News/statenews/200805260088|archive-url=https://archive.today/20080528045617/http://www.dailymail.com/News/statenews/200805260088|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-28|title=Indiana Jones teaches at Marshall|accessdate=2010-06-20|last=Fulks|first=Tricia|date=2008-05-26|work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]]}}</ref> where he is a [[professor]] of archaeology.

In consequence, Dr Jones travels the world to prevent them from recovering the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (see also [[Biblical archaeology]]). He is aided by [[Marion Ravenwood]] and [[Sallah]]. The Nazis are led by Jones's archrival, a Nazi-sympathizing French archaeologist named Ren\u00e9 Belloq, and Arnold Toht, a sinister [[Gestapo]] agent.\n\nIn the 1984 prequel, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', set in 1935, Jones travels to India and attempts to free enslaved children and the three Sankara stones from the bloodthirsty [[Thuggee]] cult. He is aided by [[Short Round]], a young boy, and is accompanied by singer Willie Scott ([[Kate Capshaw]]). The prequel is not as centered on archaeology as ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and is considerably darker.\n\nThe third film, 1989's ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'', set in 1938, returned to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as [[Sallah]] and [[Marcus Brody]], a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at [[Barnett College]]), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, and the return of the infamous [[Nazi mysticism|Nazi mystics]], this time trying to find the [[Holy Grail]]. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his [[fear of snakes]], his use of a [[bullwhip]], the scar on his chin, and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that \"Indiana\" is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a [[buddy movie]] of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, [[Henry Jones, Sr.]], often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good [[MacGuffin|plot element]] to drive the next installment.<ref name=\"race against time\">{{cite magazine|author1=Nick de Semlyen |author2=Ian Freer |author3=Chris Hewitt |author4=Ian Nathan |author5=Sam Toy |title=A Race Against Time: Indiana Jones IV|page=100|magazine=Empire|date=2006-09-29}}</ref>\n\nThe 2008 film, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'', is the latest film in the series. Set in 1957, 19 years after the third film, it pits an older, wiser Indiana Jones against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agents bent on harnessing the power of an [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] device discovered in South America. Jones is aided in his adventure by his former lover, [[Marion Ravenwood]] ([[Karen Allen]]), and her son\u2014a young [[greaser (subculture)|greaser]] named [[Henry \"Mutt\" Williams]] ([[Shia LaBeouf]]), later revealed to be Jones's unknown child. There were rumors that Harrison Ford would not return for any future installments and LaBeouf would take over the Indy franchise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2008/02/indy_update200802 |title=My Indiana Jones Crackpot Theory |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref> This film also reveals that Jones was recruited by the [[Office of Strategic Services]] during [[World War II]], attaining the rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], and implies very strongly that in 1947 he was forced to investigate on the [[Roswell UFO incident]], and that that investigation saw him involved in affairs related to [[Area 51|Hangar 51]].

Nearly 20 years later ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'' was novelized by James Rollins based on the script by David Koepp based on the story by George Lucas and Jeff Nathanson and published May 2008 by Ballantine Books. In addition, in 2008 to accompany the release of ''Kingdom of Skulls'', Scholastic Books published juvenile novelizations of the four scripts written, successively in the order above, by Ryder Windham, Suzanne Weyn, Ryder Windham, and James Luceno. All these books have been reprinted, with ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' being retitled ''Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark''. While these are the principal titles and authors, there are numerous other volumes derived from the four film properties.\n\n====Original novels====\nFrom February 1991 through February 1999, twelve original Indiana Jones-themed adult novels were licensed by Lucasfilm, Ltd. and written by three genre authors of the period. Ten years afterward, a thirteenth original novel was added, also written by a popular genre author. The first twelve were published by Bantam Books; the last by Ballantine Books in 2009.

One episode, \"Young Indiana Jones and the Mystery of the Blues\", is bookended by Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, rather than Hall. Later episodes and telemovies did not have this bookend format.\n\nThe bulk of the series centers around the young adult Indiana Jones and his activities during [[World War I]] as a 16- to 17-year-old soldier in the Belgian Army and then as an intelligence officer and spy seconded to French intelligence. The child Indy episodes follow the boy's travels around the globe as he accompanies his parents on his father's worldwide lecture tour from 1908 to 1910.\n\nThe show provided some backstory for the films, as well as new information regarding the character. Indiana Jones was born July 1, 1899, and his middle name is Walton (Lucas's middle name). It is also mentioned that he had a sister called Suzie who died as an infant of fever, and that he eventually has a daughter and grandchildren who appear in some episode introductions and epilogues. His relationship with his father, first introduced in ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'', was further fleshed out with stories about his travels with his father as a young boy. Indy damages or loses his right eye sometime between the events in [[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull|1957]] and the early 1990s, when the \"Old Indy\" segments take place, as the elderly Indiana Jones wears an eyepatch.\n\nIn 1999, Lucas removed the episode introductions and epilogues by George Hall for the VHS and DVD releases, and re-edited the episodes into chronologically ordered feature-length stories. The series title was also changed to ''The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones''.\n\n===Video games===\nThe character has appeared in several officially licensed games, beginning with adaptations of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (Atari 2600)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1985 video game)|Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'', two adaptations of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (video game)|Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' (one with purely action mechanics, one with an adventure- and puzzle-based structure) and ''[[Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures|Indiana Jones's Greatest Adventures]]'', which included the storylines from all three of the original films.\n\nFollowing this, the games branched off into original storylines with Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, ''[[Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'', ''[[Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb]]'' and ''[[Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/indianajones/|title=Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> ''Emperor's Tomb'' sets up Jones's companion Wu Han and the search for [[Nurhaci]]'s ashes seen at the beginning of ''Temple of Doom''. The first two games were developed by [[Hal Barwood]] and starred Doug Lee as the voice of Indiana Jones; ''Emperor's Tomb'' had David Esch fill the role and ''Staff of Kings'' starred John Armstrong.\n\n''[[Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine]]'' was the first Indy-based game presented in three dimensions, as opposed to 8-bit graphics and side-scrolling games before.\n\nThere is also a small game from Lucas Arts ''[[Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures]]''. A video game was made for young Indy called ''Young Indiana Jones and the Instruments of Chaos'', as well as a video game version of ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]''.\n\nTwo [[Lego]] Indiana Jones games have also been released. ''[[Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures]]'' was released in 2008<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lucasarts.com/games/legoindianajones/|title=LEGO Indiana Jones|publisher=Lucas Arts|accessdate=2007-12-11}}</ref> and follows the plots of the first three films. It was followed by ''[[Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues]]'' in late 2009. The sequel includes an abbreviated reprise of the first three films, but focuses on the plot of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.\n\nSocial gaming company [[Zynga]] introduced Indiana Jones to their \"[[Indiana Jones Adventure World|Adventure World]]\" game in late 2011.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewinski|first=John Scott|title=Indiana Jones raids Zynga's Adventure World|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57335066-1/indiana-jones-raids-zyngas-adventure-world/|accessdate=21 December 2012|newspaper=c{{!}}net|date=1 December 2011|location=San Francisco CA}}</ref>\n\n==Character description and formation==\n[[File:Indianajones4.jpg|left|thumb|[[Harrison Ford]] as the mature Jones in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]'' (2008).]]\n\n\"Indiana\" Jones's full name is Dr. Henry Walton Jones Jr.,<ref>The character's full name is stated in the [[Corey Carrier]] narration of the feature-length episode ''My First Adventure'' from ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]].''</ref> and his nickname is often shortened to \"Indy\".\n\nIn his role as a college professor of archaeology, Jones is scholarly and learned in a tweed suit, lecturing on ancient civilizations.

As a documentary of ''Raiders'' pointed out, the hat served a practical purpose. Following the lead of the old \"B\"-movies that inspired the ''Indiana Jones'' series, the fedora hid the actor's face sufficiently to allow doubles to perform the more dangerous stunts seamlessly. Examples in ''Raiders'' include the wider-angle shot of Indy and Marion crashing a statue through a wall, and Indy sliding under a fast-moving vehicle from front to back. Thus it was necessary for the hat to stay in place much of the time.\n\nThe hat became so iconic that the filmmakers could only come up with very good reasons or jokes to remove it. If it ever fell off during a take, filming would have to stop to put it back on. In jest, Ford put a stapler against his head to stop his hat from falling off when a documentary crew visited during shooting of ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''.

Although other hats were also used throughout the films, the general style and profile remained the same. Elements of the outfit include:\n* The fedora was supplied by [[Herbert Johnson (hatters)|Herbert Johnson Hatters]] in England for the first three films.<ref>[http://www.herbert-johnson.co.uk/history.html Herbert Johnson Hatters website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220151236/http://herbert-johnson.co.uk/history.html |date=2016-02-20 }} Retrieved July 2, 2018.</ref> An Australian model was used by costume designer Deborah Landis to show hat maker Richard Swales the details when making the iconic hat from \"the Poets\" parts.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.indygear.com/igfedora.html | title=The Indiana Jones Fedora | work=Indy Gear | accessdate=2013-12-15}}</ref> The fedora for ''Crystal Skull'' was made by Steve Delk and Marc Kitter of the Adventurebilt Hat Company of Columbus, Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adventurebilthats.com/indy.asp|title=Adventurebilt and Indiana Jones|publisher=Adventurebilt Hat Company|accessdate=2013-01-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121073440/http://www.adventurebilthats.com/indy.asp|archive-date=2013-01-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* The leather jacket, a hybrid of the \"Type 440\" and the [[A-2 jacket]], was made by Leather Concessionaires (now known as Wested Leather Co.) for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ''Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade''. For ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'', jackets were made in-house at Bermans & Nathans in London based on a stunt jacket they provided for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''. Tony Nowak made the jacket for ''Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indiana Jones Jacket: The Last Crusade|url=http://www.indygear.com/igjacket-LC.html|website=Indy Gear: The Indiana Jones Equipment Resource|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n* The Indiana Jones shirt is based on a typical safari-style shirt. Its distinctive feature is two vertical strips running from the shoulders to the bottom of the shirt tails and continued over both breast pockets. A common debate regards the original shirt color. Surviving samples of the original shirts seem to be darker in reality than they appear on screen. Most fans look for an off-white \"stone\" color for their replicas. The original shirts, however, may have been more of a \"tan\" or \"natural\" color. The shirt varied little from film to film, the only notable difference being the darker buttons in ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade''. Originally designed by Andreas Dometakis for the films, this shirt was once one of the hardest pieces of gear to find.\n* The trousers worn by Indiana Jones in all three films were based on original World War II Army and Army Air Corps officer trousers. Although not original Pinks they are based on the same basic design and do carry a slight pinkish hue. The trousers made for ''Raiders'' are said to be more of a greyish-brown whereas the trousers made for ''Temple of Doom'' and ''Last Crusade'' were supposedly a purer reddish brown. The trousers were made of a khaki wool-twill, pleated with seven belt loops, two scalloped button flap rear pockets, a button fly and a four-inch military style hem. They were all most likely subcontracted by the costume department and made by famed London based cinema costumers, Angels and Bermans, to be tailored perfectly for Harrison Ford for the production.\n* The [[satchel]] was a modified Mark VII [[gas mask]] bag that was used by British troops and civilians during [[World War II]].<ref name=\"TheRaider.net\"/>\n* The whip was an 8- to 10-foot (2.4 to 3.0 m) [[bullwhip]] crafted by David Morgan for the first three films. The whips for ''Crystal Skull'' were crafted by a variety of people, including Terry Jacka, Joe Strain and Morgan (different lengths and styles were likely used in specific stunts).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n* The pistol was usually a [[World War I]]-era revolver, including the [[Webley Revolver|Webley]] Government (WG) Revolver (''Last Crusade'' and ''Crystal Skull''), or a [[Smith & Wesson]] Second Model Hand Ejector revolver (''Raiders''). He has also used a [[Colt Official Police]] revolver (''Temple of Doom''), a [[Nagant M1883]] (''Young Indiana Jones''), and a 9&nbsp;mm [[Browning Hi-Power]] (''Raiders'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indygear.com/igguns.html|title=Indiana Jones Guns|publisher=IndyGear.com|accessdate=2008-07-02}}</ref> The weapon is carried in a military pattern flap holster.\n* The shoes were made by [[Alden Shoe Company|Alden]].

Shortly afterward [[pre-production]] began in earnest on ''Raiders of the Lost Ark''.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/> However, [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] refused to release Selleck from his contractual commitment to ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', forcing him to turn down the role.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/> One of Universal's concerns was that shooting for ''Magnum, P.I.'' conflicted with shooting for ''Raiders'', both of which were to begin about the same time. However, Selleck was to say later in an interview that shooting for ''Magnum, P.I.'' was delayed and did not actually begin until shooting for ''Raiders'' had concluded.\n\nSubsequently, [[Peter Coyote]] and [[Tim Matheson]] both auditioned for the role. However, after Spielberg suggested Ford again, Lucas relented, and Ford was cast in the role less than three weeks before filming began.<ref name=\"makingraiders\"/>\n\n==Cultural impact==\n\n===Archaeological influence===\nThe industry magazine ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' named eight past and present archaeologists who they felt \"embodied [Jones'] spirit\" as recipients of the Indy Spirit Awards in 2008.<ref name=\"The New Yorker\">{{cite magazine|last1=Peed|first1=Mike|title=Digging: Archaeologists and \"Indiana Jones\"|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2008/06/09/digging|magazine=The New Yorker|date=June 9, 2008}}</ref> That same year Ford himself was elected to the Board of Directors for the Archaeological Institute of America.

Since the release of ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' in 1981, the very idea of archaeology and archaeologists has fundamentally shifted. Prior to the film's release, the stereotypical image of an archaeologist was that of an older, lackluster professor type. In the early years of films involving archaeologists, they were portrayed as victims who would need to be rescued by a more masculine or heroic figure.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=McGeough|first1=Kevin|title=Heroes, Mummies, and Treasure: Near Eastern Archaeology in Movies|journal=Near Eastern Archaeology|date=2006}}</ref> Following 1981, the stereotypical archaeologist was thought of as an adventurer consistently engaged in [[fieldwork]].<ref name=\"The Indiana Jones Effect\">{{cite journal|last1=Strong|first1=Meghan|title=The Indiana Jones Effect|journal=Lycoming College Archaeology Department|date=2007}}</ref>\n\nArcheologist Anne Pyburn described the influence of Indiana Jones as elitist and sexist, and argued that the film series had caused new discoveries in the field of archaeology to become oversimplified and overhyped in an attempt to gain public interest, which negatively influences archaeology as a whole.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pyburn|first1=Anne|title=Public Archaeology, Indiana Jones, and Honesty|journal=Archaeologies: Journal of the World Archaeological Congress|date=2008}}</ref> Eric Powell, an editor with the magazine ''Archaeology'', said \"O.K., fine, the movie romanticizes what we do\", and that \"Indy may be a horrible archeologist, but he's a great diplomat for archeology.
