Subsequently, he did his clinical training in [[internal medicine]] and infectious diseases at [[UCLA School of Medicine]] (1978\u20131982) and [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (1982\u20131985), respectively. He was a resident in internal medicine at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles in 1981 when he came into contact with some of the first reported cases of what was later identified as AIDS.\n\n==Career==\nDr. Ho has been engaged in [[HIV/AIDS research]] since the beginning of the epidemic, initially focusing on clinical virology and select topics in HIV pathogenesis. In the mid 1990s, his research team conducted a series of elegant human studies to elucidate the dynamics of HIV replication in vivo.  This knowledge, in turn, formed the foundation for their pioneering effort to treat HIV \"early and hard\" and in demonstrating for the first time the durable control of HIV replication in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy. This was the turning point in the epidemic that an automatic death sentence was transformed into a manageable disease.  \n\nFor the past decade and a half, Dr. Ho has shifted his research focus to developing strategies to prevent HIV transmission. A protective vaccine against HIV remains elusive despite concerted research efforts. However, Dr. Ho has been leading non-vaccine approaches to block HIV transmission that have shown considerable promise. His group was the first to demonstrate protective efficacy of a long-acting antiretroviral drug as pre-exposure prophylaxis in [[rhesus macaques]]. In fact, one such agent, [[cabotegravir]], has been advanced into Phase-3 efficacy trials in high-risk populations, in collaboration with [[GlaxoSmithKline]]. In parallel, Dr. Ho's group has also engineered exquisitely potent antibodies that neutralize divergent strains of HIV. The most promising neutralizing agent is a [[bispecific monoclonal antibody]] that entered a first-in-human clinical trial in 2019 with the support of the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]]. The Ho Lab is funded by two NIH grants to pursue the use of engineered antibodies to purge the viral latent reservoir as a part of the international HIV cure effort. Currently, the Ho lab is funded by the [[Jack Ma]] Foundation to work on coronavirus projects.\n\nHo has published more than 500 research papers as of February 2020.<ref>(''Nature'' 1995; ''Science'' 1996)</ref> He championed the combination anti-retroviral therapy<ref>(''N.

In June 2006, an updated patch was released for the 10.4.7 {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} update for non-Apple computers using the 10.4.4 kernel.\n\nUp to the release of the 10.4.8 update, all OSx86 patches used the 10.4.4 kernel with the rest of the operating system at version 10.4.8. However, the newer frameworks relied on the newer kernels and this led to users of 10.4.8 encountering many problems. Apple also started making more use of [[SSE3]] instructions on their hardware making it even more difficult for users with CPUs supporting only SSE2 (such as older [[Pentium 4]]s) to get a fully compatible system running. To solve this problem, hackers from the community released kernels where those instructions were emulated with [[SSE2]] equivalents, although this produced a performance penalty.\n\nThroughout the years, many \"[[Software distro|distro]]s\" were released for download over the Internet. These distros were copies of the Mac OS X installer disc modified to include additional components necessary to make the OS run on the non-Apple hardware. A prominent member of the community, JaS, released many distros of Mac OS X Tiger containing patched kernels. Some other popular distros are iATKOS, Kalyway, iPC, iDeneb, and. Distros have fallen out of favour as the OSx86 community grew, as new bootloaders were developed that made it possible to use actual copies of the OS X Installer.\n\n=== OS X Leopard (10.5) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Image:Hackintosh Laptop.jpg|thumb|Mac OS X v10.5 installing on a [[Lenovo]] laptop computer.]]\n\nAs early as {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes that made it convenient for users to install {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}.  This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros.  Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity.  However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components.  The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created that removed the [[HPET]] requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.\n\n=== OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) ===\n\nWhen \"Snow Leopard\" was released, Russian hacker netkas created a version of Chameleon that can boot Mac OS X v10.6. The main problem was that many people were forced to modify DSDT or use kexts due to some specific issues. As soon as possible modbin and dmitrik released test versions of kernel that allow to boot Snow Leopard on AMD machines. Stable XNU kernels for v10.6 were released by Qoopz and Pcj. There are some popular builds based on Retail by the name Universal (Intel only), Hazard, and iAtkos. Since v10.6.2 Nawcom, Qoopz, and Andy Vandijck have been working on Legacy kernel for unsupported CPUs.\n\n=== OS X Lion (10.7) ===\nWhen Apple released the Developer Preview 1, a Russian Hackintosh developer usr-sse2 was the first who created a method to install Lion. The method consists of deploying Mac OS X v10.7 image on a flash drive, and booting from it via XPC UEFI Bootloader (See [[OSx86#DUET|DUET]] below). After some changes were made to the Chameleon source code, it became possible to boot Lion with an updated version of Chameleon. After a while Dmitrik also known as Bronzovka had luck with creating a kernel that supported AMD systems; after a few months (10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support) and iAtkos L2 (10.7.2 Only Intel) were released.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/28-nireshs-mac-os-x-1073-v2-with-amd-support/\n|title=Niresh's Mac OS X 10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support Version V2\n|date=4 December 2013\n|accessdate=2011-04-24\n}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ===\nShortly after the release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown developers managed to install this version of OS X to their PC by using a modified version of the Chameleon Bootloader. This version was released via the main project starting at version r1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/|title=Chameleon r1997 Mountain Lion}}</ref> to the general public. Due to the problems sourced during the Lion era,{{clarify|date=September 2012}} other ways of installing and required patches were never made public, which leaves the scene in an unknown state towards Mountain Lion.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSince the retail release of Mountain Lion several users have reported successful setups using installers purchased from the [[Mac App Store]], along with updated versions of Chameleon and other tools including distros.\nNiresh's Distro (10.8 Intel only)  was first released and then was updated to 10.8.2 (With AMD and Intel) and 10.8.5 (With UEFI Support, AMD and Intel Support) versions; iAtkos ML2 was released after Niresh's Release.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.tonymacx86.com/61-unibeast-install-os-x-mountain-lion-any-supported-intel-based-pc.html\n|title=UniBeast: Install OS X Mountain Lion on Any Supported Intel-based PC\n|date=14 August 2012\n|accessdate=2013-03-20\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.macbreaker.com/2012/07/install-mountain-lion-unibeast.html\n|title=How to install OS X Mountain Lion on your PC with Unibeast\n|date=25 July 2012\n|accessdate=2013-03-20\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/file/76-niresh-mountain-lion-1085-dvd-iso-image-with-amd-intel/\n|title=Niresh Mountain Lion 10.8.5 DvD ISO Image - With AMD & Intel\n|date=9 December 2013\n|accessdate=2020-03-07\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.macbreaker.com/2013/04/install-mountain-lion-hackintosh-niresh.html\n|title=How to install OS X Mountain Lion on your PC with Niresh\n|date=15 April 2012\n|accessdate=2013-04-20\n}}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mavericks (10.9) ===\nMultiple new kernels for Hackintosh 10.9 are in the works, although there still are minor issues with most of them. Most of these kernels aim to allow users to run Mavericks on AMD and older Intel CPUs, which lack certain instruction sets of the latest Intel CPUs. Significant efforts have been made to emulate instruction sets like [[SSSE3]], which are not present on AMD K10-based CPUs, and older Intel CPUs, like the Intel Core Duo.\nAMD's latest CPUs, from the '[[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]' architecture onwards, contain almost all the latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full [[SSE4]] support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks, which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to boot into Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro that was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/file/3736-amd-10910911092-kernel-update-iii-with-full-sse4-support/|title=AMD 10.9/10.9.1/10.9.2 kernel    UPDATE III     with full sse4 support|website=osx86.net}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/75-hackintosh-mavericks/|title=Hackintosh Mavericks - Hackintosh ISO (Hackintosh Distro) - HackintoshZone|website=HackintoshZone}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Yosemite (10.10) ===\nAfter the initial release of OS X Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various developers took on the role of updating their bootloaders for the system.

[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], a binary translator that made it possible to run PowerPC programs on Intel processors, (and later the kernel itself) required the support of the [[SSE3]] instruction set. To circumvent this, programmers in the community released patched kernels, which included support for emulating SSE3 instructions using [[SSE2]] equivalents. In October 2005, Apple released update 10.4.3 to developers that required [[NX bit]] microprocessor support;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53&Itemid=2 |title=Apple Seeds 10.4.3 Intel to Developers |access-date=2006-05-28 |date=October 16, 2005 |author=sHARD>> |publisher=OSx86 Money Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412082244/http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53&Itemid=2 |archive-date=2006-04-12 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> however, patches were released to circumvent this as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=56 |title=Hacked OSx86 Updated to 10.4.3 |access-date=2006-05-28 |date=October 30, 2005 |author=Jonathan Black |publisher=OSx86 $$$ Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906225712/http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=56 |archive-date=2006-09-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Patched kernels were also later released that supported AMD processors.\n\nWhen Mac OS X Leopard released on October 26, 2007, patches were created to remove the [[High Precision Event Timer|HPET]] requirement from the kernel. Efforts were also made to emulate the [[SSSE3]] instruction set for processors that did not support it. The kernel used by OS X Mavericks made use of SSSE3 instructions, requiring those patches.\n\n===Boot loaders and emulators===\n\n==== EFI emulation ====\n\n[[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. Since this method generally does not require copying or modification of macOS, it is considered{{by whom|date=August 2014}} to be the legal way of installing macOS on non-Apple computers (despite being untested in courts).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe work started with EFI emulation in the form of David Elliot (dfe)'s modified version of Boot-132 called \"Darwin/x86\", which has a \"FakeEFI\" system that emulates EFI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In early November 2007, a group of hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using Elliot's code, developed a method<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |title=netkas.org :: W00t - released<!-- '''reflinks''' title --> |access-date=2007-11-16 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65oGQUi4Y?url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |archive-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a minimum set of hardware requirements could now be \"seen\" as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, \"stock\" Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving a more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this innovative solution have arisen around the Internet. An explanation of this achievement along with a usage guide was provided by the website DigitMemo.com.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |title=HowTo: Install EFI patch and Use Unmodified OS X Kernel in Hackintosh |website=Digitmemo.com |date= |access-date=2009-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524052648/http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |archive-date=2009-05-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nTrue EFI emulation was a highly sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use macOS on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules that simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off \"[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]\" (unmodified) macOS kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions.  This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's End User License Agreement, which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden.<ref name=\"EULA\" />\n\nIn mid-2008, a new commercial product, EFi-X, was released that claims to allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a [[USB]]-attached device.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tuan |last=Nguyen |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/asem-efix-mac-chameleon,8617.html |title=Exclusive Report: EFI-X Mac Booter, A Scam? |website=Tomshardware.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> [[Rebel EFI]] is another commercial product that also seems to use Open Source software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netkas.org/?p=299|title=netkas.org \u00bb Enjoy|website=netkas.org}}</ref>\n\nIt was thought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC motherboards replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X due to the lack of a [[HFS+]] driver in the EFI implementation.\n\n==== Boot-132 ====\n\nBoot-132 is a bootloader provided by Apple for loading the XNU kernel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Boot-132|title=Boot-132|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came on to the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288|title=New modified Boot-132 allows you to boot retail DVDs|date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> This method allows users to conduct the Leopard-based OSx86 installation using a stock, retail-purchased copy of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} Leopard and eradicates the necessity of a hacked installation like JaS or Kalyway (mentioned previously).  The Boot-132 bootloader essentially preloads an environment on the system from which Leopard can boot and operate. The bootloader stores the necessary files (kext files) in a .img collection or simply a folder. The luxury of this new installation method includes the ability to boot and install from a retail Leopard DVD and update straight from Apple without breaking the DMCA. The only possible problem here is that it breaks the macOS EULA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21564/Building_a_Hackintosh_Apple_Can_t_Sue_You_For|title=Building a Hackintosh Apple Can't Sue You For|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThe bootloader behaves like the [[Linux]] kernel: one can use an mboot-compatible (a patched [[syslinux]] was used for the hack) bootloader that tells boot-dfe about the .img file (the [[ramdisk]] or [[initrd]], as it's known by Linux users), and boot-dfe will then use the kexts (or mkext) from it. This new boot-dfe has been tested with the retail Leopard DVD, and it can boot, install, run Leopard without having to build a modified DVD.\n\n==== Chameleon ====\nSince the early developer builds of Mac OS X v10.6, members of the OSx86 community had been booting the new operating system using yet another bootloader called PC EFI provided by Russian hacker Netkas or the bootloader of the Voodoo team's Chameleon. Chameleon is based on David Elliot's Boot-132. The bootloader supports ACPI, SMBIOS, graphics, ethernet, and some other injections. It allows to boot up macOS on non-Macintosh hardware. Chameleon supports a lot of AMD as well as Nvidia graphics cards. There are a lot of forks of it by different developers; the latest version upstream is 2.2 from 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chameleon: Bring Mac OS X Developers Together |url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/ |website=chameleon.osx86.hu |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Clover====\nClover is a GUI bootloader for multiple operating systems that supports either UEFI or the legacy BIOS mode. To support booting EFI code, one of the two methods are conventionally taken: either Elliot's FakeEFI was used, or an actual open-source EFI system based on Intel's [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface#Intel EFI|TianoCore]] called DUET (Developer's UEFI Emulation) was flashed into the motherboard.<ref>{{cite web |title=A BIOS to UEFI Transformation |url=http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/ |website=www.rodsbooks.com}}</ref> However, modern, non-Apple EFI firmware as well as Duet cannot directly load macOS due to various incompatibilities, mainly around the HFS+ file system but also due to the quirks of individual vendors. One more step was needed to load macOS systems: an EFI application to rectify these problems and bridge the gap.\n\nBeginning in March 2011, Slice discussed his idea with other community members, resulting in the development of a bootloader that can do both: emulate an EFI firmware of one's choice or use a Real UEFI firmware to boot Mac OS X. It contains EFI applications and drivers for correctly reading an HFS+ disk and patching EFI tables to prepare the system for starting macOS. As of 2020, it is actively maintained.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clover EFI bootloader |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/ |website=SourceForge |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== OpenCore ====\nOpenCore, started in 2019, is another bootloader developed to run macOS on UEFI or BIOS systems as well as old Mac devices that are no longer supported.<ref>{{cite web |title=acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |url=https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |website=GitHub |publisher=Acidanthera |date=8 March 2020}}</ref> Compared to Clover, it is said to provide overall better patching and emulation as well as a faster boot time. The project has also taken over the development of some patches, meaning future versions may only work with OpenCore.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenCore Vanilla Guide |url=https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/ |website=khronokernel-2.gitbook.io}}</ref>\n\n===Live DVD===\nIn March 2007, the OSx86 community made some significant progress with the development of a [[Live DVD]]. The Live DVD allows booting to a working system with Mac OS X v10.4.8.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x Live DVD could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working macOS desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=144128&st=0h |title=2009 Live DVD, how to make a simple, working osx livedvd |website=Insanelymac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>  The method was more reliable than previous methods because it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities and behaved as if the system were running off a network disk.

In June 2006, an updated patch was released for the 10.4.7 {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} update for non-Apple computers using the 10.4.4 kernel.\n\nUp to the release of the 10.4.8 update, all OSx86 patches used the 10.4.4 kernel with the rest of the operating system at version 10.4.8. However, the newer frameworks relied on the newer kernels and this led to users of 10.4.8 encountering many problems. Apple also started making more use of [[SSE3]] instructions on their hardware making it even more difficult for users with CPUs supporting only SSE2 (such as older [[Pentium 4]]s) to get a fully compatible system running. To solve this problem, hackers from the community released kernels where those instructions were emulated with [[SSE2]] equivalents, although this produced a performance penalty.\n\nThroughout the years, many \"[[Software distro|distro]]s\" were released for download over the Internet. These distros were copies of the Mac OS X installer disc modified to include additional components necessary to make the OS run on the non-Apple hardware. A prominent member of the community, JaS, released many distros of Mac OS X Tiger containing patched kernels. Some other popular distros are iATKOS, Kalyway, iPC, iDeneb, and. Distros have fallen out of favour as the OSx86 community grew, as new bootloaders were developed that made it possible to use actual copies of the OS X Installer.\n\n=== OS X Leopard (10.5) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[Image:Hackintosh Laptop.jpg|thumb|Mac OS X v10.5 installing on a [[Lenovo]] laptop computer.]]\n\nAs early as {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} v10.5 build 9A466 the community has maintained a version of Leopard that can run on non-Apple hardware. A hacker by the handle of BrazilMac created one of the earliest patching processes that made it convenient for users to install {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} onto 3rd party hardware by using a legally obtained, retail version of Apple {{nowrap|Mac OS X}}.  This simplification made the BrazilMac patch and its later revisions quickly the most popular choice for many distros.  Five of the most popular builds go by the name JaS, Kalyway, iATKOS, iPC and iDeneb - although more recently these builds are on the way out as the Boot-132 method (described below) gains popularity.  However, all of these compilations rely on the work of kernel hackers made by Lorem (build 9A466), SynthetiX (builds 9A499, 9A527 and 9A559), ToH (builds 9A581, 9B13 and 9B18) and more recently a group calling themselves StageXNU (now called Voodoo) (Darwin 9.4.0). Their contributions trickled down into the various Mac OSx86 installers, readily available on the Internet. They continue to be refined and updated builds released, not just to maintain compatibility with Apple releases but an ever-increasing number of third-party components.  The OSx86 community has been quick to make the necessary modifications to enable Apple's latest releases to run on non-Apple hardware. Within hours of Leopard's release, an AMD/Intel SSE2/3 Kernel Patcher was created that removed the [[HPET]] requirement from an original untouched mach_kernel file, a core component of the Mac OS.\n\n=== OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) ===\n\nWhen \"Snow Leopard\" was released, Russian hacker netkas created a version of Chameleon that can boot Mac OS X v10.6. The main problem was that many people were forced to modify DSDT or use kexts due to some specific issues. As soon as possible modbin and dmitrik released test versions of kernel that allow to boot Snow Leopard on AMD machines. Stable XNU kernels for v10.6 were released by Qoopz and Pcj. There are some popular builds based on Retail by the name Universal (Intel only), Hazard, and iAtkos. Since v10.6.2 Nawcom, Qoopz, and Andy Vandijck have been working on Legacy kernel for unsupported CPUs.\n\n=== OS X Lion (10.7) ===\nWhen Apple released the Developer Preview 1, a Russian Hackintosh developer usr-sse2 was the first who created a method to install Lion. The method consists of deploying Mac OS X v10.7 image on a flash drive, and booting from it via XPC UEFI Bootloader (See [[OSx86#DUET|DUET]] below). After some changes were made to the Chameleon source code, it became possible to boot Lion with an updated version of Chameleon. After a while Dmitrik also known as Bronzovka had luck with creating a kernel that supported AMD systems; after a few months (10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support) and iAtkos L2 (10.7.2 Only Intel) were released.\n<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/28-nireshs-mac-os-x-1073-v2-with-amd-support/\n|title=Niresh's Mac OS X 10.7.3 V2 With AMD Support Version V2\n|date=4 December 2013\n|accessdate=2011-04-24\n}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Mountain Lion (10.8) ===\nShortly after the release of Developer Preview 1, some unknown developers managed to install this version of OS X to their PC by using a modified version of the Chameleon Bootloader. This version was released via the main project starting at version r1997<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/|title=Chameleon r1997 Mountain Lion}}</ref> to the general public.

Most of these kernels aim to allow users to run Mavericks on AMD and older Intel CPUs, which lack certain instruction sets of the latest Intel CPUs. Significant efforts have been made to emulate instruction sets like [[SSSE3]], which are not present on AMD K10-based CPUs, and older Intel CPUs, like the Intel Core Duo.\nAMD's latest CPUs, from the '[[Bulldozer (microarchitecture)|Bulldozer]]' architecture onwards, contain almost all the latest instruction sets, and hence, some kernels with full [[SSE4]] support have also been released. After two months, Niresh's Distro was released for Mavericks, which supports AMD CPUs and latest Intel CPUs. It also has a custom kernel that allows Intel Atom processors to boot into Mavericks. Niresh's was the only free distro that was released for Mavericks, since the iAtkos Team decided to release their Mavericks distro for specific hardware on donation basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hackintoshosx.com/files/file/3736-amd-10910911092-kernel-update-iii-with-full-sse4-support/|title=AMD 10.9/10.9.1/10.9.2 kernel    UPDATE III     with full sse4 support|website=osx86.net}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hackintoshzone.com/files/75-hackintosh-mavericks/|title=Hackintosh Mavericks - Hackintosh ISO (Hackintosh Distro) - HackintoshZone|website=HackintoshZone}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n=== OS X Yosemite (10.10) ===\nAfter the initial release of OS X Yosemite 10.10 BETA, various developers took on the role of updating their bootloaders for the system.

[[Rosetta (software)|Rosetta]], a binary translator that made it possible to run PowerPC programs on Intel processors, (and later the kernel itself) required the support of the [[SSE3]] instruction set. To circumvent this, programmers in the community released patched kernels, which included support for emulating SSE3 instructions using [[SSE2]] equivalents. In October 2005, Apple released update 10.4.3 to developers that required [[NX bit]] microprocessor support;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53&Itemid=2 |title=Apple Seeds 10.4.3 Intel to Developers |access-date=2006-05-28 |date=October 16, 2005 |author=sHARD>> |publisher=OSx86 Money Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060412082244/http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=53&Itemid=2 |archive-date=2006-04-12 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> however, patches were released to circumvent this as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=56 |title=Hacked OSx86 Updated to 10.4.3 |access-date=2006-05-28 |date=October 30, 2005 |author=Jonathan Black |publisher=OSx86 $$$ Project |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906225712/http://www.osx86project.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=56 |archive-date=2006-09-06 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> Patched kernels were also later released that supported AMD processors.\n\nWhen Mac OS X Leopard released on October 26, 2007, patches were created to remove the [[High Precision Event Timer|HPET]] requirement from the kernel. Efforts were also made to emulate the [[SSSE3]] instruction set for processors that did not support it. The kernel used by OS X Mavericks made use of SSSE3 instructions, requiring those patches.\n\n===Boot loaders and emulators===\n\n==== EFI emulation ====\n\n[[Extensible Firmware Interface]] (EFI) is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware. Since this method generally does not require copying or modification of macOS, it is considered{{by whom|date=August 2014}} to be the legal way of installing macOS on non-Apple computers (despite being untested in courts).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe work started with EFI emulation in the form of David Elliot (dfe)'s modified version of Boot-132 called \"Darwin/x86\", which has a \"FakeEFI\" system that emulates EFI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In early November 2007, a group of hackers (fronted by a Russian hacker known as Netkas), using Elliot's code, developed a method<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |title=netkas.org :: W00t - released<!-- '''reflinks''' title --> |access-date=2007-11-16 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65oGQUi4Y?url=http://netkas.freeflux.net/blog/archive/2007/11/05/w00t.html |archive-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref> of emulating an EFI environment using a specially modified Darwin bootloader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tgwbd.org/darwin/boot.html |title=Darwin/x86 Boot Loader |website=Tgwbd.org |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref> In practical terms, this meant that regular PCs meeting a minimum set of hardware requirements could now be \"seen\" as real Macintosh computers by the OS, allowing the use of unmodified, \"stock\" Apple kernels (as long as the CPU supports it) and thus giving a more transparent and reliable operation. Several methods for real world deployment of this innovative solution have arisen around the Internet. An explanation of this achievement along with a usage guide was provided by the website DigitMemo.com.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |title=HowTo: Install EFI patch and Use Unmodified OS X Kernel in Hackintosh |website=Digitmemo.com |date= |access-date=2009-04-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524052648/http://www.digitmemo.com/articles/734/howto-install-efi-patch-and-enable-vanilla-os-x-kernel-in-hackintosh/ |archive-date=2009-05-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\nTrue EFI emulation was a highly sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use macOS on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules that simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off \"[[Vanilla software|vanilla]]\" (unmodified) macOS kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions.  This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's End User License Agreement, which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden.<ref name=\"EULA\" />\n\nIn mid-2008, a new commercial product, EFi-X, was released that claims to allow full, simple booting off official Leopard install disks, and a subsequent install, without any patching required, but this is possibly a repackaging of Boot-132 technology in a [[USB]]-attached device.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tuan |last=Nguyen |url=http://www.tomshardware.com/news/asem-efix-mac-chameleon,8617.html |title=Exclusive Report: EFI-X Mac Booter, A Scam? |website=Tomshardware.com |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2010-12-29}}</ref> [[Rebel EFI]] is another commercial product that also seems to use Open Source software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netkas.org/?p=299|title=netkas.org \u00bb Enjoy|website=netkas.org}}</ref>\n\nIt was thought{{by whom|date=August 2014}} that Windows 7's support of EFI would result in PC motherboards replacing BIOS with EFI. MSI announced the Efinity mainboard in early 2008. As of 2011, EFI-based computers have entered the market, however none can natively boot Mac OS X due to the lack of a [[HFS+]] driver in the EFI implementation.\n\n==== Boot-132 ====\n\nBoot-132 is a bootloader provided by Apple for loading the XNU kernel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osx86project.org/wiki/index.php/Boot-132|title=Boot-132|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref> In mid-2008, a new modified BOOT-132 came on to the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=113288|title=New modified Boot-132 allows you to boot retail DVDs|date=2008-06-30 |accessdate=2009-05-12}}</ref> This method allows users to conduct the Leopard-based OSx86 installation using a stock, retail-purchased copy of {{nowrap|Mac OS X}} Leopard and eradicates the necessity of a hacked installation like JaS or Kalyway (mentioned previously).  The Boot-132 bootloader essentially preloads an environment on the system from which Leopard can boot and operate. The bootloader stores the necessary files (kext files) in a .img collection or simply a folder. The luxury of this new installation method includes the ability to boot and install from a retail Leopard DVD and update straight from Apple without breaking the DMCA. The only possible problem here is that it breaks the macOS EULA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/21564/Building_a_Hackintosh_Apple_Can_t_Sue_You_For|title=Building a Hackintosh Apple Can't Sue You For|accessdate=2010-09-02}}</ref>\n\nThe bootloader behaves like the [[Linux]] kernel: one can use an mboot-compatible (a patched [[syslinux]] was used for the hack) bootloader that tells boot-dfe about the .img file (the [[ramdisk]] or [[initrd]], as it's known by Linux users), and boot-dfe will then use the kexts (or mkext) from it. This new boot-dfe has been tested with the retail Leopard DVD, and it can boot, install, run Leopard without having to build a modified DVD.\n\n==== Chameleon ====\nSince the early developer builds of Mac OS X v10.6, members of the OSx86 community had been booting the new operating system using yet another bootloader called PC EFI provided by Russian hacker Netkas or the bootloader of the Voodoo team's Chameleon. Chameleon is based on David Elliot's Boot-132. The bootloader supports ACPI, SMBIOS, graphics, ethernet, and some other injections. It allows to boot up macOS on non-Macintosh hardware. Chameleon supports a lot of AMD as well as Nvidia graphics cards. There are a lot of forks of it by different developers; the latest version upstream is 2.2 from 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chameleon: Bring Mac OS X Developers Together |url=http://chameleon.osx86.hu/ |website=chameleon.osx86.hu |accessdate=8 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Clover====\nClover is a GUI bootloader for multiple operating systems that supports either UEFI or the legacy BIOS mode. To support booting EFI code, one of the two methods are conventionally taken: either Elliot's FakeEFI was used, or an actual open-source EFI system based on Intel's [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface#Intel EFI|TianoCore]] called DUET (Developer's UEFI Emulation) was flashed into the motherboard.<ref>{{cite web |title=A BIOS to UEFI Transformation |url=http://www.rodsbooks.com/bios2uefi/ |website=www.rodsbooks.com}}</ref> However, modern, non-Apple EFI firmware as well as Duet cannot directly load macOS due to various incompatibilities, mainly around the HFS+ file system but also due to the quirks of individual vendors. One more step was needed to load macOS systems: an EFI application to rectify these problems and bridge the gap.\n\nBeginning in March 2011, Slice discussed his idea with other community members, resulting in the development of a bootloader that can do both: emulate an EFI firmware of one's choice or use a Real UEFI firmware to boot Mac OS X. It contains EFI applications and drivers for correctly reading an HFS+ disk and patching EFI tables to prepare the system for starting macOS. As of 2020, it is actively maintained.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clover EFI bootloader |url=https://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/ |website=SourceForge |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== OpenCore ====\nOpenCore, started in 2019, is another bootloader developed to run macOS on UEFI or BIOS systems as well as old Mac devices that are no longer supported.<ref>{{cite web |title=acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |url=https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg |website=GitHub |publisher=Acidanthera |date=8 March 2020}}</ref> Compared to Clover, it is said to provide overall better patching and emulation as well as a faster boot time. The project has also taken over the development of some patches, meaning future versions may only work with OpenCore.<ref>{{cite web |title=OpenCore Vanilla Guide |url=https://khronokernel-2.gitbook.io/opencore-vanilla-desktop-guide/ |website=khronokernel-2.gitbook.io}}</ref>\n\n===Live DVD===\nIn March 2007, the OSx86 community made some significant progress with the development of a [[Live DVD]]. The Live DVD allows booting to a working system with Mac OS X v10.4.8.\n\nOn January 2, 2009, InsanelyMac's Live DVD team published a new method by which a Mac OS X v10.5.x Live DVD could be produced, allowing users to boot a fully working macOS desktop from a DVD or USB flash drive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insanelymac.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=144128&st=0h |title=2009 Live DVD, how to make a simple, working osx livedvd |website=Insanelymac.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-28}}</ref>  The method was more reliable than previous methods because it manipulated Apple's existing Netboot and Imageboot functionalities and behaved as if the system were running off a network disk. It was easier to produce; requiring only a single script to be added to an existing installation. Distributions of the live DVD have been made since its inception. Since then, it is notable that this method has been shown to work on normal Apple Mac hardware.\n\n===Virtual machine===\nIt is possible to run macOS as a [[virtual machine]] inside other operating systems installed on standard PC hardware by using [[virtualization]] software such as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle's]] [[VirtualBox]]<ref>{{cite web|title=How to Run Mac OS X in VirtualBox on Windows|url=http://lifehacker.com/5583650/run-mac-os-x-in-virtualbox-on-windows}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How to Install Mac OS X Snow Leopard in VirtualBox on Windows 7|url=http://www.redmondpie.com/how-to-install-mac-os-x-snow-leopard-in-virtualbox-on-windows-7/}}</ref> (though this is not officially supported by Oracle<ref>{{cite web|title=Important notice regarding Mac OS X as Guest|url=http://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=31104}}</ref>).

He described Tanpa as an important Calusa town to the north of the Calusa domain, possibly under another chief. [[Archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]]. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by [[barrier island]]s, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century though the 18th century.

A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as \"San Fernando\". As late as 1774, [[Bernard Romans]] called Tampa Bay \"Bay of Espiritu Santo\", with \"Tampa Bay\" restricted to the Northwest arm (what is now Old Tampa Bay), and the northeast arm named \"Hillsborough Bay\". The name may have come from the Calusa language, or possibly, the [[Timucua language]].

A variant of the [[Weeden Island culture]] developed in the area by about 2000 years ago, with archeological evidence suggesting that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline and there is little evidence of farming.\n\nAt the time of European contact in the early 16th century, the [[Safety Harbor culture]] dominated the area, with indigenous peoples organized into three or four chiefdoms around the shores of the bay. Early Spanish explorers to visit the area interacted extensively (and violently) with the [[Tocobaga]], whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga (and the [[Calusa]], who lived far to the south), there is less surviving documentation describing the [[Pohoy]] chiefdom, which controlled the area near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. However, brief mentions by explorers along with surviving artifacts suggest that the Pohoy and other groups that once lived on Tampa Bay had very similar cultures and lifestyles as the better-documented Tocobaga.<ref>Milanich, Jerald T. 1995.

First, [[phosphate]] was discovered in the [[Bone Valley]] region southeast of Tampa in 1883. The mineral, vital for the production of [[fertilizer]]s and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter.\n\nThe discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa\u2014all in the mid-1880s\u2014were crucial to Tampa's development.

[[Ybor City]]'s factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many [[Italians|Italian]] and a few eastern European [[Jewish]] immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers. By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built [[West Tampa]], another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two \"Latin\" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the \"Cigar Capital of the World\".<ref>Mormino, Gary.

Average high temperatures range from the high-60s to low-70s&nbsp;\u00b0F (21\u201324&nbsp;\u00b0C) during the day to the low to mid- 50s&nbsp;\u00b0F (10\u201313&nbsp;\u00b0C) at night. Occasional [[cold front]]s push through the area during the season, usually bringing a brief period of rain followed by daytime highs in the 50s&nbsp;\u00b0F (10\u201313&nbsp;\u00b0C) and nighttime lows near 40s (5 C) for a day or two. Tampa averages two days of frost per year, although a winter or two may pass without any frost.\n\nSince the Tampa area is home to a diverse range of freeze-sensitive agriculture and [[aquaculture]], hard freezes, although quite rare, are a major concern. Hard freezes (defined as a temperature of {{convert|28|\u00b0F|1}} or below for several hours) occur rarely in the Tampa area; every five to twenty years depending on the exact location. The last widespread freeze occurred on the morning of January 18, 2018, when the official temperature at Tampa International Airport dropped to {{convert|29|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://w1.weather.gov/data/obhistory/KTPA.html |title=Tampa Bay Area National Weather Service Climate Page |date=February 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 15, 2015 |website=Tampa Bay Area National Weather Service |publisher=Tampa Bay Area National Weather Service |last=Cole |first=Brian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=National Weather Service - Tampa Bay: Record lows.

While temperatures in late spring approach summertime values, the rainy season does not usually begin until June, leading to the threat of [[brush fire]]s from approximately late March until May. Occasionally, a late-season cold front pushes through the area, potentially bringing a brief round of severe weather followed by a few days of unseasonably cool temperatures.\n\n====Monthly averages====\n{{Tampa, FL weatherbox}}\n\n{|style=\"width:100%;text-align:center;line-height:1.2em;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\"\n|-\n!Colspan=14|Climate data for Tampa\n|-\n!Month\n!Jan\n!Feb\n!Mar\n!Apr\n!May\n!Jun\n!Jul\n!Aug\n!Sep\n!Oct\n!Nov\n!Dec\n!style=\"border-left-width:medium\"|Year\n|-\n!Mean daily daylight hours\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF55;color:#000000;\"|14.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF44;color:#000000;\"|13.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF33;color:#000000;\"|12.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#F7F722;color:#000000;\"|11.0\n|style=\"background:#F0F011;color:#000000;\"|10.0\n|style=\"background:#FFFF35;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|12.2\n|-\n!Average [[Ultraviolet index]]\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|5\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|7\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|10\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11\n|style=\"background:#6b49c8;color:#000000;\"|11\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;\"|9\n|style=\"background:#f85900;color:#000000;\"|7\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|5\n|style=\"background:#f7e400;color:#000000;\"|4\n|style=\"background:#d8001d;color:#000000;border-left-width:medium\"|8.3\n|-\n!Colspan=14 style=\"background:#f8f9fa;font-weight:normal;font-size:95%;\"|Source: Weather Atlas<ref name=\"Weather Atlas\">{{cite web |url=https://www.weather-us.com/en/florida-usa/tampa-climate |title=Tampa, Florida - Detailed climate information and monthly weather forecast |publisher=Weather Atlas |access-date=27 February 2019 }}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{Main|Cityscape of Tampa, Florida}}\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods in Tampa, Florida}}\nThe city is divided into many neighborhoods, many of which were towns and unincorporated communities annexed by the growing city.

[[Archaeologist]] Jerald Milanich places the town of Tanpa at the mouth of [[Charlotte Harbor (estuary)|Charlotte Harbor]]. The entrances to Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor are obscured by [[barrier island]]s, and their locations, and the names applied to them, were a source of confusion to explorers, surveyors and map-makers from the 16th century though the 18th century.

A Spanish map of 1757 renamed Tampa Bay as \"San Fernando\". As late as 1774, [[Bernard Romans]] called Tampa Bay \"Bay of Espiritu Santo\", with \"Tampa Bay\" restricted to the Northwest arm (what is now Old Tampa Bay), and the northeast arm named \"Hillsborough Bay\".

A variant of the [[Weeden Island culture]] developed in the area by about 2000 years ago, with archeological evidence suggesting that these residents relied on the sea for most of their resources, as a vast majority of inhabited sites have been found on or near the shoreline and there is little evidence of farming.\n\nAt the time of European contact in the early 16th century, the [[Safety Harbor culture]] dominated the area, with indigenous peoples organized into three or four chiefdoms around the shores of the bay. Early Spanish explorers to visit the area interacted extensively (and violently) with the [[Tocobaga]], whose principal town was at the northern end of Old Tampa Bay near today's [[Safety Harbor, Florida|Safety Harbor]] in [[Pinellas County]]. While there is a substantial historical record of the Tocobaga (and the [[Calusa]], who lived far to the south), there is less surviving documentation describing the [[Pohoy]] chiefdom, which controlled the area near the mouth of the Hillsborough River near today's downtown Tampa. However, brief mentions by explorers along with surviving artifacts suggest that the Pohoy and other groups that once lived on Tampa Bay had very similar cultures and lifestyles as the better-documented Tocobaga.<ref>Milanich, Jerald T. 1995.

First, [[phosphate]] was discovered in the [[Bone Valley]] region southeast of Tampa in 1883. The mineral, vital for the production of [[fertilizer]]s and other products, was soon being shipped from the Port of Tampa in great volume. Tampa is still a major phosphate exporter.\n\nThe discovery of phosphate, the arrival of Plant's railroad, and the founding of Ybor City and West Tampa\u2014all in the mid-1880s\u2014were crucial to Tampa's development. The once-struggling village of Tampa became a bustling [[boomtown]] almost overnight and had grown into one of the largest cities in Florida by 1900.<ref name=\"Lastra, Frank 2006\"/>\n\n====Plant's railroad====\n[[Henry B. Plant]]'s narrow-gauge [[South Florida Railroad]] reached Tampa and its port in late 1883, finally connecting the small town to the nation's railroad system after years of efforts by local leaders. Previously, Tampa's overland transportation links had consisted of sandy roads stretching across the Florida countryside. Plant's railroad made it much easier to get goods in and out of the Tampa Bay area.

Proximity to [[Cuba]] made importation of \"clear Havana tobacco\" easy by sea, and Plant's railroad made shipment of finished cigars to the rest of the US market easy by land.<ref name=\"Lastra, Frank 2006\">Lastra, Frank.

[[Ybor City]]'s factories rolled their first cigars in 1886, and many different cigar manufacturers moved their operations to town in ensuing years. Many [[Italians|Italian]] and a few eastern European [[Jewish]] immigrants arrived starting in the late 1880s, opening businesses and shops that catered to cigar workers. By 1900, over 10,000 immigrants had moved to the neighborhood. Several thousand more Cuban immigrants built [[West Tampa]], another cigar-centric suburb founded a few years later by Hugh MacFarlane. Between them, two \"Latin\" communities combined to exponentially expand Tampa's population, economic base, and tax revenues, as Tampa became the \"Cigar Capital of the World\".<ref>Mormino, Gary.

[[Airbus Defence and Space]] is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the ''[[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]]'' programme. The rockets are launched by Arianespace  from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].\n\nAriane 5 succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch. Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, \"G\", \"G+\", \"GS\", \"ECA\", and most recently, \"ES\".  ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] spaceplane, and thus intended it to be [[Human-rating certification|human rated]] from the beginning.\n\nAriane 5 has a commonly used dual-launch capability where up to two large geostationary belt [[communication satellite]]s can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier (''Syst\u00e8me de Lancement Double Ariane,'' \"Ariane Double-Launch System\"). Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA (''Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane,'' \"Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure\"). Up to eight [[secondary payload]]s, usually small experiment packages or [[miniaturized satellite|minisatellites]], can be carried with an ASAP (''Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads'') platform.\n\n{{As of|February 2020}} Arianespace had signed contracts for Ariane 5 ECA launches up through 2023, approximately two to three years following the planned introduction of [[Ariane 6]] in late 2020 or early 2021.<ref name=mtg-s />\n\n==Vehicle description==\n===Cryogenic main stage===\n[[File:SNECMA Vulcain II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vulcain|Vulcain 2 engine]]|150px]]\nAriane 5's [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] H173 main stage (H158 for Ariane 5 G, G+, and GS) is called the EPC (''\u00c9tage Principal Cryotechnique''\u2014Cryotechnic Main Stage).

The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully, but it could not reach the intended orbit.\n\nA subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch (L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray observatory satellite.\n\nAnother partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] [[telecommunications satellite]] was able to reach its intended orbit on 31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental [[ion propulsion]] system.\n\nThe next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the [[Envisat]] [[environmental satellite]] successfully reached an orbit {{nowrap|800 km}} above the Earth in the 11th launch.

Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and [[Hot Bird]] 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5.

It is used to deliver payloads into [[geostationary transfer orbit]] (GTO) or [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO). \n\n[[Government of Germany|German]] and [[Government of France|French]] government agencies worked closely together to develop the Ariane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dokus.w4f.eu/2019/03/04/rocket-science-the-success-story-of-ariane-5-part-2/|title=Rocket Science - The success story of Ariane 5 - Part 2|date=2019-03-04|website=dokus4free|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401133623/http://dokus.w4f.eu/2019/03/04/rocket-science-the-success-story-of-ariane-5-part-2/|archive-date=2019-04-01|url-status=live}}</ref> Ariane 5 [[rocket]]s are manufactured under the authority of the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and the French space agency [[CNES|Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales]]. [[Airbus Defence and Space]] is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a multi-country consortium of other European contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by [[Arianespace]] as part of the ''[[Ariane (rocket)|Ariane]]'' programme. The rockets are launched by Arianespace  from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]].\n\nAriane 5 succeeded [[Ariane 4]], but was not derived from it directly as Ariane 5 was developed from scratch. Ariane 5 has been refined since the first launch in successive versions, \"G\", \"G+\", \"GS\", \"ECA\", and most recently, \"ES\".  ESA originally designed Ariane 5 to launch the [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] spaceplane, and thus intended it to be [[Human-rating certification|human rated]] from the beginning.\n\nAriane 5 has a commonly used dual-launch capability where up to two large geostationary belt [[communication satellite]]s can be mounted using a SYLDA carrier (''Syst\u00e8me de Lancement Double Ariane,'' \"Ariane Double-Launch System\"). Up to three, somewhat smaller, main satellites are possible depending on size using SPELTRA (''Structure Porteuse Externe Lancement Triple Ariane,'' \"Ariane Triple-Launch External Carrier Structure\"). Up to eight [[secondary payload]]s, usually small experiment packages or [[miniaturized satellite|minisatellites]], can be carried with an ASAP (''Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads'') platform.\n\n{{As of|February 2020}} Arianespace had signed contracts for Ariane 5 ECA launches up through 2023, approximately two to three years following the planned introduction of [[Ariane 6]] in late 2020 or early 2021.<ref name=mtg-s />\n\n==Vehicle description==\n===Cryogenic main stage===\n[[File:SNECMA Vulcain II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vulcain|Vulcain II engine]]|150px]]\nAriane 5's [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] H173 main stage (H158 for Ariane 5 G, G+, and GS) is called the EPC (''\u00c9tage Principal Cryotechnique''\u2014Cryotechnic Main Stage). It consists of a large tank 30.5&nbsp;metres high{{clarify|what is the diameter? with a source citation. The diameter statements in the infobox are unsourced|date=August 2019}} with two compartments, one for [[liquid oxygen]] and one for [[liquid hydrogen]], and a [[Vulcain|Vulcain 2]] engine at the base with a vacuum thrust of {{convert|1,390|kN|lbf|lk=on|abbr=off}}. The H173 EPC weighs about 189&nbsp;tonnes, including 175&nbsp;tonnes of propellant.<ref name=a5dsslr>{{cite web|title=Ariane 5 Data Sheet|url=http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/ariane5.html|website=Space Launch Report|accessdate=8 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108044627/http://www.spacelaunchreport.com/ariane5.html|archive-date=8 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After the main cryogenic stage runs out of fuel, it re-enters the atmosphere for an ocean splashdown.\n\n===Solid boosters===\nAttached to the sides are two P241 (P238 for Ariane 5 G and G+) [[solid rocket booster]]s (SRBs or EAPs from the French ''\u00c9tages d'Acc\u00e9l\u00e9ration \u00e0 Poudre''), each weighing about 277 tonnes full and delivering a thrust of about {{convert|7,080|kN|lbf|lk=on|abbr=off}}. They are fueled by a mix of ammonium perchlorate (68%) and aluminum fuel (18%) and [[hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene|HTPB]] (14%). They each burn for 130 seconds before being dropped into the ocean.

The Vulcain nozzle caused a roll problem, leading to premature shutdown of the core stage. The upper stage operated successfully, but it could not reach the intended orbit.\n\nA subsequent test flight (L503, on 21 October 1998) proved successful and the first commercial launch (L504) occurred on 10 December 1999 with the launch of the [[XMM-Newton]] X-ray observatory satellite.\n\nAnother partial failure occurred on 12 July 2001, with the delivery of two satellites into an incorrect orbit, at only half the height of the intended GTO. The ESA [[Artemis (satellite)|Artemis]] [[telecommunications satellite]] was able to reach its intended orbit on 31 January 2003, through the use of its experimental [[ion propulsion]] system.\n\nThe next launch did not occur until 1 March 2002, when the [[Envisat]] [[environmental satellite]] successfully reached an orbit {{nowrap|800 km}} above the Earth in the 11th launch. At {{nowrap|8111 kg}}, it was the heaviest single payload until the launch of the [[Jules Verne ATV|first ATV]] on 9 March 2008 (19,360&nbsp;kg).\n\nThe first launch of the ECA variant on 11 December 2002 ended in failure when a main booster problem caused the rocket to veer off-course, forcing its self-destruction three minutes into the flight. Its payload of two communications satellites (Stentor and [[Hot Bird]] 7), valued at about EUR 630 million, was lost in the ocean. The fault was determined to have been caused by a leak in coolant pipes allowing the nozzle to overheat. After this failure, Arianespace SA delayed the expected January 2003 launch for the [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] mission to 26 February 2004, but this was again delayed to early March 2004 due to a minor fault in the foam that protects the cryogenic tanks on the Ariane 5. As of June 2017, the failure of the first ECA launch was the last failure of an Ariane 5; since then, 82 consecutive launches have been successful, from April 2003 with the launch of [[INSAT-3A]] and [[Galaxy 12]] satellites,<ref name=pr-20170628>{{cite pr |url=http://www.arianespace.com/mission-update/arianespaces-ariane-5-launches-two-multi-mission-satellites-for-fixed-and-mobile-services/ |title= Arianespace's Ariane 5 launches two multi-mission satellites for fixed and mobile services |publisher=[[Arianespace]] |date=28 June 2017 |access-date=29 June 2017}}</ref> to [[Ariane flight VA241|flight 240]] in December 2017.\n\nOn 27 September 2003 the last Ariane 5 G boosted three satellites (including the first European lunar probe, [[SMART-1]]), in Flight 162.

The payload consisted of the XTAR-EUR military communications satellite, a 'SLOSHSAT' small scientific satellite and a MaqSat B2 payload simulator. The launch had been originally scheduled for October 2004, but additional testing and the military requiring a launch at that time (of a [[Helios 2A]] observation satellite) delayed the attempt.\n\nOn 11 August 2005, the first Ariane 5 GS (featuring the Ariane 5 ECA's improved solid motors) boosted Tha\u00efcom-4/iPStar-1, the heaviest telecommunications satellite to date at {{nowrap|6,505 kg}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ipstar-1.htm|title=iPStar 1 (Thaicom 4)|work=skyrocket.de|access-date=2010-10-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617220136/http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/ipstar-1.htm|archive-date=2011-06-17|url-status=live}}</ref> into orbit.\n\nOn 16 November 2005, the third Ariane 5 ECA launch (the second successful ECA launch) took place.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of Friesoythe, and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it after failed attempts and having sustained casualties, which included the death of the battalion's commander.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians who had not evacuated the town along with 4,000 other local inhabitants in the days prior to the attack, died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Other towns and cities elsewhere in Germany were heavily damaged by the Allied and the German armies in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of the US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], [[Maurice Rose]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff (military)#British and Commonwealth staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die]]}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent. The town's website records that of 381{{nbsp}}houses in the town proper, 231{{nbsp}}were destroyed and another 30&nbsp;badly damaged.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} A few days later, a Canadian nurse wrote home that the [[convent]] on the edge of town was the only building left standing.{{sfn|Hibbert|1985|p=84}} In the suburb of Altenoythe, 120{{nbsp}}houses and 110{{nbsp}}other buildings were destroyed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} In 2010, the author Mark Zuehlke suggested that, \"Not all of Friesoythe was burnt, but its centre was destroyed\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n{{Quote box|width=20em|align=left|quote=You should know our soldiers were kind to the children of our enemies, and kind to those in adversity.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of Friesoythe, and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it after failed attempts and having sustained casualties, which included the death of the battalion's commander.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians who had not evacuated the town along with 4,000 other local inhabitants in he days prior to the attack, died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Other towns and cities elsewhere in Germany were heavily damaged by the Allied and the German armies in  the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of the US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]], [[Maurice Rose]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff (military)#British and Commonwealth staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die]]}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

The two fall in love and marry, to Victor's dismay; however, Victoria refuses to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheats on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorces him, and he then moves in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later marries Nina out of obligation. He eventually develops genuine feelings for Nina; however, she has fallen in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Cole rejects Nina, she has a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tries to commit suicide and shoots herself in a struggle with Ryan; he is arrested for the shooting. Nina suffers short-term amnesia, and although she regains her memory and exonerates Ryan, they divorce. Ryan then ends up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia is very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accuses her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stops taking her birth control pills and they conceive a child; Ryan is against the idea, though he warms up to it. When she eventually miscarries, Tricia sees it as her punishment for having deceived her husband.\n\nTricia then becomes obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She runs Tony down in Megan's driveway, and is suspected of having done so intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons leave town, including Tricia, who leaves Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returns to Genoa City and asks Ryan to take her back; he refuses, as Victoria has become interested in him again. Tricia turns to Carter Mills, who is really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He uses her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide, but Ryan is able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunite, Victor has Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decide to remarry, and on their wedding day Tricia arrives in a wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locks her in a closet and takes her place at the altar, where she holds Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her instead. Victor breaks Victoria free, who enters the chapel; Tricia shoots twice at her, but Ryan jumps in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan dies from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone. Shortly after, Ryan appears to Victoria in a dream where they say their vows, and she awakes with a ring on her finger.\n\n==Reception==\nA syndicated article that appeared in ''The Fort Oglethorpe Press'' described Ryan's attempts to seduce Victoria as \"a path that's fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration\".<ref name=\"TFOP\">{{cite news|title=Laid-back lad loathsome as a lout |work = The Fort Oglethorpe Press |date=November 13, 1991 |page=6 |accessdate = April 6, 2013 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=392&dat=19911113&id=lv9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SD8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6273,1051408}}</ref> Over his duration on ''The Young and the Restless'', Reeves became popular with fans, and his performance was met with acclaim from his peers.

The two fall in love and marry, to Victor's dismay; however, Victoria refuses to consummate their relationship and Ryan cheats on her with Nina Webster. Victoria divorces him, and he then moves in with Nina and her son, [[Chance Chancellor|Phillip Chancellor IV]] ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), and he later marries Nina out of obligation. He eventually develops genuine feelings for Nina; however, she has fallen in love with novelist [[Cole Howard]] ([[J. Eddie Peck]]). After Cole rejects Nina, she has a nervous breakdown causing Ryan to sleep with [[Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]). Nina then tries to commit suicide and shoots herself in a struggle with Ryan; he is arrested for the shooting. Nina suffers short-term amnesia, and although she regains her memory and exonerates Ryan, they divorce. Ryan then ends up marrying Tricia, much to the disapproval of her father Keith Dennison (David Allen Brooks). However, Tricia is very jealous of Ryan's relationship with Phillip, who accuses her of breaking apart his family. In desperation, Tricia stops taking her birth control pills and they conceive a child; Ryan is against the idea, though he warms up to it. When she eventually miscarries, Tricia sees it as her punishment for having deceived her husband.\n\nTricia then becomes obsessed with destroying her sister [[Megan Dennison]]'s ([[Ashley Jones]]) relationship with [[Tony Viscardi]] ([[Nick Scotti]]). She runs Tony down in Megan's driveway, and is suspected of having done so intentionally. Eventually, all the Dennisons leave town, including Tricia, who leaves Ryan to move to [[London, England]]. Six months later, Tricia returns to Genoa City and asks Ryan to take her back; he refuses, as Victoria has become interested in him again. Tricia turns to Carter Mills, who is really rapist [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Matt Clark|Matt Clark]] ([[Rick Hearst]]). He uses her, leading Tricia to attempt suicide, but Ryan is able to stop her. After Ryan and Victoria reunite, Victor has Tricia move in with him to keep her away from them. They decide to remarry, and on their wedding day Tricia arrives in a wedding dress identical to Victoria's, locks her in a closet and takes her place at the altar, where she holds Ryan at gunpoint to remarry her instead. Victor breaks Victoria free, who enters the chapel; Tricia shoots twice at her, but Ryan jumps in front to save her life. Eventually, Ryan dies from the gunshot wounds, leaving Victoria devastated and alone. Shortly after, Ryan appears to Victoria in a dream where they say their vows, and she awakes with a ring on her finger.\n\n==Reception==\nA syndicated article that appeared in ''The Fort Oglethorpe Press'' described Ryan's attempts to seduce Victoria as \"a path that's fraught with peril and which forces the good-natured actor to search hard for inspiration\".<ref name=\"TFOP\">{{cite news|title=Laid-back lad loathsome as a lout |work = The Fort Oglethorpe Press |date=November 13, 1991 |page=6 |accessdate = April 6, 2013 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=392&dat=19911113&id=lv9LAAAAIBAJ&sjid=SD8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6273,1051408}}</ref> Over his duration on ''The Young and the Restless'', Reeves became popular with fans, and his performance was met with acclaim from his peers.
