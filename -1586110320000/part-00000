After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

They play against the teams they didn't play in the Preliminary Round, so each team plays 3 matches. All points from the Preliminary Round, except the points gained against the 4th place team in the preliminary group, are carried forward into the Main Round. Same round robin rules apply as in the Preliminary Round. Top 2 teams from each group advance to the semifinals, while the third placed team from each group advances to the 5th-6th Place Play-off, and the fourth placed team to the 7th-8th Place Play-off. \n*Final Round: 8 teams play in the final weekend of the championships. 3rd place teams from the Main Round play in the 5th-6th Place Play-off, and 4th place team to the 7th-8th Place Play-off.

are divided into four groups. They play each other in a single [[Round-robin tournament|round robin]] system, so each team plays three matches. A win is worth two points, while a draw is worth one point. The top three teams from each group advance to the Main Round.\n*Main Round: 12 teams are divided in two groups. They play against the teams they didn't play in the Preliminary Round, so each team plays 3 matches. All points from the Preliminary Round, except the points gained against the 4th place team in the preliminary group, are carried forward into the Main Round. Same round robin rules apply as in the Preliminary Round. Top 2 teams from each group advance to the semifinals, while the third placed team from each group advances to the 5th-6th Place Play-off, and the fourth placed team to the 7th-8th Place Play-off. \n*Final Round: 8 teams play in the final weekend of the championships. 3rd place teams from the Main Round play in the 5th-6th Place Play-off, and 4th place team to the 7th-8th Place Play-off. Other teams play in the semifinals. Losers of the semifinals advance to the 3rd-4th Place Play-off, and winners advance to the final.\n\n==Preliminary round==\n\n===Group A ([[Debrecen]])===\n\n{| class=wikitable

Diacetyl occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages and is added to some foods to impart its buttery flavor.\n\n==Chemical structure==\nA distinctive feature of diacetyl (and other 1,2-diketones) is the long C\u2013C bond linking the carbonyl centers. This bond distance is about 1.54&nbsp;\u00c5, compared to 1.45&nbsp;\u00c5 for the corresponding C\u2013C bond in [[1,3-butadiene]].

Because of this rule, the championship is defended across all of WWE's brands\u2014[[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]], [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]], [[205 Live (WWE brand)|205 Live]], [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]], and [[NXT UK (WWE brand)|NXT UK]]\u2014as well as outside of regular shows, often with videos posted on the promotion's website and social media accounts. The current champion is [[Mojo Rawley]], who is in his seventh reign.\n\nThe title was unveiled by [[Mick Foley]] on the May 20, 2019 episode of ''[[Monday Night Raw]]'', where [[Titus O'Neil]] from Raw became the inaugural champion. It is similar to the previous [[WWE Hardcore Championship]], which also had a 24/7 rule.

Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds.

Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.

Only seven other wrestlers have held the title for longer than a day: [[Carmella (wrestler)|Carmella]], [[Drake Maverick]], [[Elias (wrestler)|Elias]], [[Maria Kanellis]], [[Mojo Rawley]], and both [[The Singh Brothers|Singh Brothers]], Samir and Sunil. WWE announcer Mike Rome has the shortest reign, which lasted approximately 9 seconds. [[WWE Hall of Fame]]r [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at 78 years old (also making him the oldest title holder in WWE history), while [[Enes Kanter]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is the youngest, winning the title at 27. Former WWE wrestler [[Kelly Kelly]] was the first of six women to have won the title. WWE Hall of Famer [[Ted DiBiase|\"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase]] is the only title holder to become champion without winning the title; he purchased it from fellow Hall of Famer [[Alundra Blayze]], who was about to drop the belt into a trash can (reenacting the infamous incident of what she had done to the then-[[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWF Women's Championship]] when she joined [[World Championship Wrestling]] in 1995). [[The Revival (professional wrestling)|The Revival]] ([[Scott Dawson (wrestler)|Scott Dawson]] and [[Dash Wilder]]) are the only tag team to win the title, being recognized as co-champions.
