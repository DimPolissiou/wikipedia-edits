The premise of DNA barcoding is that, by comparison with a reference library of such DNA sections (also called \"[[DNA sequence|sequences]]\"), an individual sequence can be used to uniquely identify an organism to species, in the same way that a supermarket scanner uses the familiar black stripes of the [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcode]] to identify an item in its stock against its reference database.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibol.org/phase1/about-us/what-is-dna-barcoding/|title=What is DNA Barcoding? \u2013 iBOL|website=www.ibol.org|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref> These \"barcodes\" are sometimes used in an effort to identify unknown [[species]], parts of an organism, or simply to catalog as many [[Taxon|taxa]] as possible, or to compare with traditional taxonomy in an effort to determine species boundaries.\n\nDifferent gene regions are used to identify the different organismal groups using barcoding. The most commonly used barcode region for animals and some [[protist]]s is a portion of the [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I|cytochrome ''c'' oxidase I]] (COI or [[Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I|COX1]]) gene, found in [[mitochondrial DNA]]. Other genes suitable for DNA barcoding are the [[Internal transcribed spacer]] (ITS) [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] often used for fungi and [[RuBisCO]] used for plants.<ref name=Schoch-eal-2012>{{cite journal|last1=Schoch|first1=Conrad L.|last2=Seifert|first2=Keith A.|last3=Huhndorf|first3=Sabine|last4=Robert|first4=Vincent|last5=Spouge|first5=John L.|last6=Levesque|first6=C.

The relative ease of retrieving the sequence, and variability mixed with conservation between species, are some of the benefits of COI.

The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

Several different [[DNA extraction]] methods exist, and factors like cost, time, sample type and yield affect the selection of the optimal method.\n\nWhen DNA from organismal or eDNA samples is amplified using [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the reaction can be affected negatively by inhibitor molecules contained in the sample.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite journal|last=Schrader|first=C.|last2=Schielke|first2=A.|last3=Ellerbroek|first3=L.|last4=Johne|first4=R.|date=2012|title=PCR inhibitors \u2013 occurrence, properties and removal|journal=Journal of Applied Microbiology|volume=113|issue=5|pages=1014\u20131026|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2672.2012.05384.x|pmid=22747964|issn=1365-2672}}</ref> Removal of these inhibitors is crucial to ensure that high quality DNA is available for subsequent analyzing.\n\n[[Gene amplification|Amplification]] of the extracted DNA is a required step in DNA barcoding.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions.

The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed. Finally, the sequences are clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), using one of many clustering strategies.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample. Despite this, they are usually not identified below the family level because of the taxonomic expertise and time required.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Chironomidae|date=1995|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401043083|editor-last=Armitage|editor-first=Patrick D.|location=Dordrecht|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-0715-0|editor-last2=Cranston|editor-first2=Peter S.|editor-last3=Pinder|editor-first3=L.

V.}}</ref> This may result in different chironomid species with different ecological preferences grouped together, resulting in inaccurate assessment of water quality.\n\nDNA barcoding provides the opportunity to resolve taxa, and directly relate stressor effects to specific taxa such as individual chironomid species. For example, Beermann et al. (2018) DNA barcoded Chironomidae to investigate their response to multiple stressors; reduced flow, increased fine-sediment and increased salinity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beermann|first=Arne J.|last2=Zizka|first2=Vera M.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The parameters of bioinformatics [[Bioinformatics workflow management system|pipelines]] (for example OTU clustering, taxonomic assignment algorithms or thresholds etc.) are at the origin of much debate among DNA barcoding users.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\"/> Sequencing technologies are also rapidly evolving, together with the tools for the analysis of the massive amounts of DNA data generated, and standardization of the methods is urgently needed to enable collaboration and data sharing at greater spatial and time-scale.

The most important cause is probably the incompleteness and lack of accuracy of the molecular reference databases preventing a correct taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. Taxa not present in reference databases will not be found by eDNA, and sequences linked to a wrong name will lead to incorrect identification.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other known causes are a different sampling scale and size between a traditional and a molecular sample, the possible analysis of dead organisms, which can happen in different ways for both methods depending on organism group, and the specific selection of identification in either method, i.e. varying taxonomical expertise or possibility to identify certain organism groups, respectively primer bias leading also to a potential biased analysis of taxa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Estimates of richness/diversity ====\nDNA Barcoding can result in an over or underestimate of species richness and diversity.

The methods for sampling, preservation or analysis differ between those different types of sample.\n\n'''Tissue samples'''\n\nTo barcode a tissue sample from the target specimen, a small piece of skin, a scale, a leg or antenna is likely to be sufficient (depending on the size of the specimen). To avoid contamination, it is necessary to sterilize used tools between samples. It is recommended to collect two samples from one specimen, one to archive, and one for the barcoding process. Sample preservation is crucial to overcome the issue of DNA degradation.\n\n'''Bulk samples'''\n\nA bulk sample is a type of environmental sample containing several organisms from the [[taxonomic group]] under study. The difference between bulk samples (in the sense used here) and other environmental samples is that the bulk sample usually provides a large quantity of good-quality DNA.<ref name=\":15\" /> Examples of bulk samples include aquatic macroinvertebrate sample collected by kick-net, or insect samples collected with a Malaise trap. Filtered or size-fractionated water samples containing whole organisms like unicellular eukaryotes are also sometimes defined as bulk samples. Such samples can be collected by the same techniques as used to obtain traditional samples for morphology-based identification.\n\n'''eDNA samples'''\n\nThe [[environmental DNA]] (eDNA) method is a non-invasive approach to detect and identify species from cellular debris or extracellular DNA present in environmental samples (e.g. water or soil) through barcoding or metabarcoding. The approach is based on the fact that every living organism leave DNA in the environment, and this environmental DNA can be detected even for organisms that are at very low abundance. Thus, for field sampling, the most crucial part is to use DNA-free material and tools on each sampling site or sample to avoid contamination, if the DNA of the target organism(s) is likely to be present in low quantities. On the other hand, an eDNA sample always includes the DNA of whole-cell, living microorganisms, which are often present in large quantities. Therefore, microorganism samples taken in the natural environment also are called eDNA samples, but contamination is less problematic in this context due to the large quantity of target organisms. The eDNA method is applied on most sample types, like water, sediment, soil, animal feces, stomach content or blood from e.g. leeches.<ref>{{Citation|last=Jelger Herder|title=Environmental DNA - a review of the possible applications for the detection of (invasive) species.|date=2014|publisher=RAVON|doi=10.13140/rg.2.1.4002.1208|last2=A.

These databases contain the DNA barcodes assigned to previously identified taxa. Most reference libraries do not cover all species within an organism group, and new entries are continually created. In the case of macro- and many microorganisms (such as algae), these reference libraries require detailed documentation (sampling location and date, person who collected it, image, etc.) and authoritative taxonomic identification of the voucher specimen, as well as submission of sequences in a particular format. The process also requires the storage of voucher specimens in museum collections and other collaborating institutions.

Diat.barcode provides data for two genetic markers, ''rbc''L (Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA). The database also involves additional, trait information of species, like morphological characteristics (biovolume, size dimensions, etc.), life-forms (mobility, colony-type, etc.) or ecological features (pollution sensitivity, etc.).\n\n=== Bioinformatic analysis ===\nIn order to obtain well structured, clean and interpretable data, raw sequencing data must be processed using bioinformatic analysis. The [[FASTQ format|FASTQ]] file with the sequencing data contains two types of information: the sequences detected in the sample ([[FASTA format|FASTA]] file) and a quality file with quality scores ([[Phred quality score|PHRED]] scores) associated with each nucleotide of each DNA sequence. The PHRED scores indicate the probability with which the associated nucleotide has been correctly scored.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+PHRED quality score and the associated certainty level\n|10\n|90%\n|-\n|20\n|99%\n|-\n|30\n|99.9%\n|-\n|40\n|99.99%\n|-\n|50\n|99.999%\n|}\nIn general, the PHRED score decreases towards the end of each DNA sequence. Thus some bioinformatics pipelines simply cut the end of the sequences at a defined threshold.\n\nSome sequencing technologies, like MiSeq, use paired-end sequencing during which sequencing is performed from both directions producing better quality. The overlapping sequences are then aligned into contigs and merged. Usually, several samples are pooled in one run, and each sample is characterized by a short DNA fragment, the tag. In a demultiplexing step, sequences are sorted using these tags to reassemble the separate samples. Before further analysis, tags and other adapters are removed from the barcoding sequence DNA fragment. During trimming, the bad quality sequences (low PHRED scores), or sequences that are much shorter or longer than the targeted DNA barcode, are removed. The following dereplication step is the process where all of the quality-filtered sequences are collapsed into a set of unique reads (individual sequence units ISUs) with the information of their abundance in the samples. After that, chimeras (i.e. compound sequences formed from pieces of mixed origin) are detected and removed. Finally, the sequences are clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), using one of many clustering strategies.

The purpose is to guarantee food traceability, to minimize food piracy, and to valuate local and typical agro-food production.

However, DNA barcoding could improve traditional methods for the following reasons; DNA barcoding (i) can increase taxonomic resolution and harmonize the identification of taxa which are difficult to identify or lack experts, (ii) can more accurately/precisely relate environmental factors to specific taxa (iii) can increase comparability among regions, (iv) allows for the inclusion of early life stages and fragmented specimens, (v) allows delimitation of [[Species complex|cryptic]]/rare species (vi) allows for development of new indices e.g. rare/cryptic species which may be sensitive/tolerant to [[stressor]]s, (vii) increases the number of samples which can be processed and reduces processing time resulting in increased knowledge of species ecology, (viii) is a non-invasive way of monitoring when using [[Environmental DNA|eDNA]] methods.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Pawlowski|first=Jan|last2=Kelly-Quinn|first2=Mary|last3=Altermatt|first3=Florian|last4=Apoth\u00e9loz-Perret-Gentil|first4=Laure|last5=Beja|first5=Pedro|last6=Boggero|first6=Angela|last7=Borja|first7=Angel|last8=Bouchez|first8=Agn\u00e8s|last9=Cordier|first9=Tristan|date=2018|title=The future of biotic indices in the ecogenomic era: Integrating (e)DNA metabarcoding in biological assessment of aquatic ecosystems|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=637-638|pages=1295\u20131310|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.05.002|pmid=29801222|bibcode=2018ScTEn.637.1295P}}</ref>\n\n==== Time and cost ====\nDNA barcoding is faster than traditional morphological methods all the way from training through to taxonomic assignment. It takes less time to gain expertise in DNA methods than becoming an expert in taxonomy. In addition, the DNA barcoding workflow (i.e. from sample to result) is generally quicker than traditional morphological workflow and allows the processing of more samples.\n\n==== Taxonomic resolution ====\nDNA barcoding allows the resolution of taxa from higher (e.g. family) to lower (e.g. species) taxonomic levels, that are otherwise too difficult to identify using traditional morphological methods, like e.g. identification via microscopy. For example, [[Chironomidae]] (the non-biting midge) are widely distributed in both terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. Their richness and abundance make them important for ecological processes and networks, and they are one of many invertebrate groups used in biomonitoring. Invertebrate samples can contain as many as 100 species of chironomids which often make up as much as 50% of a sample. Despite this, they are usually not identified below the family level because of the taxonomic expertise and time required.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Chironomidae|date=1995|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789401043083|editor-last=Armitage|editor-first=Patrick D.|location=Dordrecht|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-0715-0|editor-last2=Cranston|editor-first2=Peter S.|editor-last3=Pinder|editor-first3=L. C. V.}}</ref> This may result in different chironomid species with different ecological preferences grouped together, resulting in inaccurate assessment of water quality.\n\nDNA barcoding provides the opportunity to resolve taxa, and directly relate stressor effects to specific taxa such as individual chironomid species. For example, Beermann et al. (2018) DNA barcoded Chironomidae to investigate their response to multiple stressors; reduced flow, increased fine-sediment and increased salinity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beermann|first=Arne J.|last2=Zizka|first2=Vera M.

For example, detecting target DNA in aquatic systems depends on the concentration of DNA molecules at a site, which in turn can be affected by many factors. The presence of DNA molecules also depends on dispersion at a site, e.g. direction or strength of currents. It is not really known how DNA moves around in streams and lakes, which makes sampling difficult. Another factor might be the behavior of the target species, e.g. fish can have seasonal changes of movements, crayfish or mussels will release DNA in larger amounts just at certain times of their life (moulting, spawning). For DNA in soil, even less is known about distribution, quantity or quality.\n\n==== Incomplete barcode reference libraries ====\nThe major limitation of the barcoding method is that it relies on barcode reference libraries for the taxonomic identification of the sequences. The taxonomic identification is accurate only if a reliable reference is available. However, most databases are still incomplete, especially for smaller organisms e.g. fungi, phytoplankton, nematoda etc. In addition, current databases contain misidentifications, spelling mistakes and other errors. There is massive curation and completion effort around the databases for all organisms necessary, involving large barcoding projects (for example the iBOL project for the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) reference database).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ibol.org/|title=The International Barcode of Life Consortium|website=International Barcode of Life|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.boldsystems.org/|title=Bold Systems v4|website=www.boldsystems.org|access-date=2019-04-02}}</ref> However, completion and curation are difficult and time-consuming. Without vouchered specimens, there can be no certainty about whether the sequence used as a reference is correct. DNA sequence databases like GenBank contain many sequences that are not tied to [[Zoological specimen#Voucher specimens|vouchered specimens]] (for example, herbarium specimens, cultured cell lines, or sometimes images). This is problematic in the face of taxonomic issues such as whether several species should be split or combined, or whether past identifications were sound. Therefore, best practice for DNA barcoding is to sequence vouchered specimens.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schander|first=Christoffer|last2=Willassen|first2=Endre|date=2005|title=What can biological barcoding do for marine biology?|journal=Marine Biology Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=79\u201383|doi=10.1080/17451000510018962|issn=1745-1000}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=S.

The parameters of bioinformatics [[Bioinformatics workflow management system|pipelines]] (for example OTU clustering, taxonomic assignment algorithms or thresholds etc.) are at the origin of much debate among DNA barcoding users.<ref name=\"ScienceDirect\"/> Sequencing technologies are also rapidly evolving, together with the tools for the analysis of the massive amounts of DNA data generated, and standardization of the methods is urgently needed to enable collaboration and data sharing at greater spatial and time-scale. This standardisation of barcoding methods at the European scale is part of the objectives of the European COST Action DNAqua-net <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dnaqua.net/|title=DNAquaNet|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref> and is also addressed by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization).<ref>CEN (2018) CEN/TC 230/WORKING GROUP 2 \u2013 Proposal for a new Working Group WG28 ''\u201cDNA and eDNA methods\u201d A plan to fulfil the DNA and eDNA standardization needs of EU legislation in Water Policy'' (Proposal following decisions of the 2017 Berlin Meeting of CEN/TC 230, its Working Groups and eDNA COST representatives)</ref>\n\nAnother criticism of DNA barcoding is its limited efficiency for accurate discrimination below species level (for example, to distinguish between varieties), for hybrid detection, and that it can be affected by evolutionary rates (Ref needed).\n\n==== Mismatches between conventional (morphological) and barcode based identification ====\nIt is important to know that taxa lists derived by conventional (morphological) identification are not, and maybe never will be, directly comparable to taxa lists derived from barcode based iendtification because of several reasons. The most important cause is probably the incompleteness and lack of accuracy of the molecular reference databases preventing a correct taxonomic assignment of eDNA sequences. Taxa not present in reference databases will not be found by eDNA, and sequences linked to a wrong name will lead to incorrect identification.<ref name=\":0\" /> Other known causes are a different sampling scale and size between a traditional and a molecular sample, the possible analysis of dead organisms, which can happen in different ways for both methods depending on organism group, and the specific selection of identification in either method, i.e. varying taxonomical expertise or possibility to identify certain organism groups, respectively primer bias leading also to a potential biased analysis of taxa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Estimates of richness/diversity ====\nDNA Barcoding can result in an over or underestimate of species richness and diversity.

These features guarantee high reliability and safety, even under the most extreme environmental conditions.\n\nThe KBA offers a wide range of firing modes: single shot; programmable rapid single shot with a rate of fire of up to 200 rds/min; and full automatic fire of 600 rds/ min. The cannon functions, such as cocking and firing, are electrically actuated by remote control unit or in auxiliary mode mechanically by a hand crank and a trigger pedal.\n\nThe Oerlikon KBA 25mm cannon has been designed for integration in various types of mounts, small size and low weight offer various integration possibilities such as: \n* Manned (1 or 2 operators) or remote controlled turrets on IFVs, APCs\n* Air defence gun mounts\n* Naval mounts\n* Helicopter mounts\n\nThe various types of available ammunition combined with the unique Instant Ammunition Selection Device (IASD) and different selectable firing modes with a rate of fire up to 600rds/min support any type of operational use.\n\n== History ==\nIn 1964 the American company [[TRW Inc.]] was entrusted with the development of a 25&nbsp;mm weapon while Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works assumed responsibility for developing the ammunition and interior ballistics for it.\n\nBoth were intended to meet the requirements for the armament of [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s of the 80's and 90's: \n* Ammunition performance: 25&nbsp;mm armour steel, 60\u00b0 (NATO) angle of impact, 1000m range, corresponding to the armour of a well-armoured infantry fighting vehicle.\n* \"Instant ammunition selection\" for engagement of different targets\n* Selectable firing mode: Accurate single shot, bursts with a rate of fire of more than 550 rds/min for engagement of aircraft\n* Compact structure: with low weight for installation in gun turrets of APC's\n* Simple to operate: and service in the hands of infantry\n\n[[File:KBA Draw.png|left|thumb|284x284px|Oerlikon KBA 25mm Part Description]]\nThree years later, at the beginning of 1967, technical tests and firing trials were carried out with the first two American prototype (recoil operated) cannons (TRW-6425)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bevfitchett.us/machine-gun-v5/mm-trw-automatic-cannon.html|title=Mm Trw Automatic Cannon - Machine Gun V5|website=www.bevfitchett.us|access-date=2017-03-30}}</ref> at Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works followed by the first demonstrations for another NATO country.\n\nIn the trials, however, the American prototypes displayed a number of basic functional deficiencies. This persuaded Oerlikon-Buehrle Machine Tool Works to undertake their own development work to effect system modifications, which then resulted in the required functional reliability and enabled the trials to be completed successfully. (1970, 10 gas-operated cannons). When the first prototype cannons became available, suitable gun turrets had also to be provided. In 1967 an agreement was signed between Machine Tool Works Oerlikon-Buehrle and a well-known and established sub-contractor, to collaborate in the development and manufacture of 25&nbsp;mm gun turrets. These gun turrets were in the first instance to be suitable for mounting on [[M113 armoured personnel carrier]] C&R of a NATO country's army. \nThe complete system, cannon, hand-driven turret and ammunition underwent detailed firing trials between 1969 and 1971. Special new development efforts were devoted to improve functional reliability, durability and firing precision, and in 1971 sufficient progress had been made for the weapon system to fulfil the strict specifications laid down, and to be delivered to the Netherlands.\n\nWithin the framework of the product support service Oerlikon improves the product and adapts it regularly to the latest requirements. An important step forward was made in 1982/83 when the ammunition penetration performance range of the 25&nbsp;mm APDS-T (sub-caliber) round was increased 150% from 1000 to 2500 m.\n\nThe wide range of strong points of the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon, such as high rate of fire, ammunition performance, good safety record, dual belt feeder with first-round response, no external power requirement and simple maintenance lead to a considerably increasing interest in the Oerlikon KBA 25&nbsp;mm cannon in years.\n\n== Ammunition ==\nA wide range of ammunition has been developed for this weapon specifically developed to engage and defeat both ground and air targets.\n\nThe ammunition complies with all handling and operational safety requirements according to MIL-STD\u2019s, and was subjected to intensive trials by NATO member countries prior to its introduction and standardization as NATO 25mmx137 ammunition.\n[[File:US Navy 090129-N-4774B-008 Gunner's Mate 2nd Class Nicholas Brassard

The seat has changed hands three times since then.\n\n== History ==\nA previous [[parliamentary borough]] form of constituency of the same name was created by the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] for the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]].  It elected two MPs using the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system until it was transformed in the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] for that year's [[1885 United Kingdom general election|general election]], the name being transferred to a single-seat county division which covered a wider geographical area.\n\nThis was abolished at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], partially replaced with a new [[Stroud and Thornbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Stroud and Thornbury]] county constituency. That was in turn abolished at the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], when the present entity was created.  Since this recreation the seat has had boundary changes.<ref name=offd>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf 2010 post-revision map non-metropolitan areas and unitary authorities of England]</ref>\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1955\u20131974''': The Urban Districts of Nailsworth and Stroud, the Rural Districts of Dursley, Stroud, and Tetbury, and part of the Rural District of Gloucester.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The Urban Districts of Nailsworth and Stroud, the Rural Districts of Dursley, Stroud, and Tetbury, and in the Rural District of Gloucester the parishes of Arlingham, Brookthorpe with Whaddon, Eastington, Elmore, Frampton on Severn, Fretherne with Saul, Frocester, Hardwicke, Harescombe, Haresfield, Longney, Moreton Valence, Quedgeley, Standish, Upton St Leonards, and Whitminster.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The District of Stroud wards of Berkeley, Bisley, Cainscross, Cam, Cambridge, Central, Chalford, Dursley, Eastington, Hinton, King's Stanley, Leonard Stanley, Minchinhampton, Nailsworth, Nibley, Painswick, Parklands, Randwick, Rodborough, Severn, Stonehouse, Thrupp, Trinity, Uley, Uplands, Vale, Whiteshill, Woodfield, and Wotton and Kingswood, and the District of Cotswold wards of Avening, Grumbold's Ash, and Tetbury.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': All the wards of the District of Stroud except the Wotton and Kingswood ward.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The District of Stroud wards of Amberley and Woodchester, Berkeley, Bisley, Cainscross, Cam East, Cam West, Central, Chalford, Coaley and Uley, Dursley, Eastington and Standish, Farmhill and Paganhill, Hardwicke, Nailsworth, Over Stroud, Painswick, Rodborough, Severn, Slade, Stonehouse, The Stanleys, Thrupp, Trinity, Uplands, Upton St Leonards, Vale, and Valley.\n\nThe extent of the constituency is almost all of the Stroud district (it also provides three wards to [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|The Cotswolds seat]]).  As such, the north-west boundary of the constituency is the [[River Severn]], which [[meander]]s from [[Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucester]] towards the River's [[estuary]].\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nStroud lies south of Gloucester, between the two larger Gloucestershire rural constituencies of [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|The Cotswolds]] and [[Forest of Dean (UK Parliament constituency)|Forest of Dean]]. Though partially situated in the [[Cotswold Hills]], Stroud is both smaller in area and more industrialised than these neighbours.\n\nMuch of the constituency is rural in character. Through the sparsely populated bulk, is a belt across the middle of the constituency that has a group of small but more urbanised villages, including Caincross, Cam and Rodborough.\n\nThe major market towns include Stroud itself, Dursley in the south of the constituency, and the smaller towns of Berkeley (which in fact has a smaller electorate than Chalford, but more facilities), Stonehouse and Nailsworth.\n\nWorkless claimants, registered jobseekers,  were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.1% of the population based on a statistical compilation by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics Unemployment claimants by constituency] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n=== Stroud parliamentary borough ===\n\n==== MPs 1832\u20131885 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{rayment-hc|s|5|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party!!colspan=\"2\"|Member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Party\n|-\n|[[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" | \n| [[David Ricardo (the younger)|David Ricardo]]\n| [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]<ref name=\"stooks-smith\">{{cite book\n |last=Stooks Smith\n |first=Henry.\n |editor=[[F.

Drew's 2017 win was one of 30 net gains the Labour Party made at that year's snap general election. Stroud has been relative to others a very marginal seat since 1992 as well as a swing seat, as the winning candidate's majority has not exceeded 9.1% of the vote since the 19.2% majority won at that year's election. The seat has changed hands three times since then.\n\n== History ==\nA previous [[parliamentary borough]] form of constituency of the same name was created by the [[Reform Act 1832|First Reform Act]] for the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]].  It elected two MPs using the [[Plurality-at-large voting|bloc vote]] system until it was transformed in the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]] for that year's [[1885 United Kingdom general election|general election]], the name being transferred to a single-seat county division which covered a wider geographical area.\n\nThis was abolished at the [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950 general election]], partially replaced with a new [[Stroud and Thornbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Stroud and Thornbury]] county constituency. That was in turn abolished at the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], when the present entity was created.  Since this recreation the seat has had boundary changes.<ref name=offd>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_iv.pdf 2010 post-revision map non-metropolitan areas and unitary authorities of England]</ref>\n\n== Boundaries ==\n'''1955\u20131974''': The Urban Districts of Nailsworth and Stroud, the Rural Districts of Dursley, Stroud, and Tetbury, and part of the Rural District of Gloucester.\n\n'''1974\u20131983''': The Urban Districts of Nailsworth and Stroud, the Rural Districts of Dursley, Stroud, and Tetbury, and in the Rural District of Gloucester the parishes of Arlingham, Brookthorpe with Whaddon, Eastington, Elmore, Frampton on Severn, Fretherne with Saul, Frocester, Hardwicke, Harescombe, Haresfield, Longney, Moreton Valence, Quedgeley, Standish, Upton St Leonards, and Whitminster.\n\n'''1983\u20131997''': The District of Stroud wards of Berkeley, Bisley, Cainscross, Cam, Cambridge, Central, Chalford, Dursley, Eastington, Hinton, King's Stanley, Leonard Stanley, Minchinhampton, Nailsworth, Nibley, Painswick, Parklands, Randwick, Rodborough, Severn, Stonehouse, Thrupp, Trinity, Uley, Uplands, Vale, Whiteshill, Woodfield, and Wotton and Kingswood, and the District of Cotswold wards of Avening, Grumbold's Ash, and Tetbury.\n\n'''1997\u20132010''': All the wards of the District of Stroud except the Wotton and Kingswood ward.\n\n'''2010\u2013present''': The District of Stroud wards of Amberley and Woodchester, Berkeley, Bisley, Cainscross, Cam East, Cam West, Central, Chalford, Coaley and Uley, Dursley, Eastington and Standish, Farmhill and Paganhill, Hardwicke, Nailsworth, Over Stroud, Painswick, Rodborough, Severn, Slade, Stonehouse, The Stanleys, Thrupp, Trinity, Uplands, Upton St Leonards, Vale, and Valley.\n\nThe extent of the constituency is almost all of the Stroud district (it also provides three wards to [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|The Cotswolds seat]]).  As such, the north-west boundary of the constituency is the [[River Severn]], which [[meander]]s from [[Gloucester (UK Parliament constituency)|Gloucester]] towards the River's [[estuary]].\n\n== Constituency profile ==\nStroud lies south of Gloucester, between the two larger Gloucestershire rural constituencies of [[The Cotswolds (UK Parliament constituency)|The Cotswolds]] and [[Forest of Dean (UK Parliament constituency)|Forest of Dean]]. Though partially situated in the [[Cotswold Hills]], Stroud is both smaller in area and more industrialised than these neighbours.\n\nMuch of the constituency is rural in character. Through the sparsely populated bulk, is a belt across the middle of the constituency that has a group of small but more urbanised villages, including Caincross, Cam and Rodborough.\n\nThe major market towns include Stroud itself, Dursley in the south of the constituency, and the smaller towns of Berkeley (which in fact has a smaller electorate than Chalford, but more facilities), Stonehouse and Nailsworth.\n\nWorkless claimants, registered jobseekers,  were in November 2012 significantly lower than the national average of 3.8%, at 2.1% of the population based on a statistical compilation by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/nov/17/unemployment-and-employment-statistics-economics Unemployment claimants by constituency] ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n\n=== Stroud parliamentary borough ===\n\n==== MPs 1832\u20131885 ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Election!!colspan=\"2\"|Member<ref name=\"rayment\">{{rayment-hc|s|5|date=March 2012}}</ref>\n!Party!!colspan=\"2\"|Member<ref name=\"rayment\"/>!!Party\n|-\n|[[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832]]\n|style=\"background-color: {{Whigs (British political party)/meta/color}}\" | \n| [[David Ricardo (the younger)|David Ricardo]]\n| [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]]<ref name=\"stooks-smith\">{{cite book\n |last=Stooks Smith\n |first=Henry.\n |editor=[[F.

Mallam Umaru Daudu Maza was inaugurated as the first emir of Lapai n 1832.</big>    \n\n'''<big>Historical Origin</big>'''\n\nIn the Katsina Emirate, there is a town known as Yantumaki, it was here a man called Dampami, lived a cow-fulani who had a son called Muhammad Jauro. Muhammadu Jauro had a large herd which was tended by himself and his children. Yantumaki is a famous and historical fulani settlement. A number of influential leaders migrated form this village, settled at places like became traditional rulers of those respective places.\n\nTowards the end of the eithteenth century Jauro left Yantumaki in search of the good pasture land until he entered Zaria kingdom. In course of time, because if his riches and generosity he became so popular in the kingdom of Zaria, that the king afterwards made him the leader of all the cow- fulanis in his command by giving him the title of '''DIKKO''' or '''Sarkin Fulani''' to His eldest son, Umaru.\n<br />{{Infobox settlement\n| official_name                   = Lapai\n| other_name                      = Birni Maza\n| native_name                     = \n| nickname                        = \n| settlement_type                 = Emirate\n| motto                           = \n| image_skyline                   = \n| imagesize                       = \n| image_caption                   = \n| image_flag                      = \n| flag_size                       = \n| image_seal                      = \n| seal_size                       = \n| image_map                       = \n| mapsize                         = \n| map_caption                     = \n| pushpin_map                     = Nigeria\n| pushpin_label_position          = \n| pushpin_mapsize                 = 250\n| pushpin_map_caption             = Location in Nigeria\n| subdivision_type                = Country\n| subdivision_name                = {{flag|Nigeria}}\n| subdivision_type1               = [[States of Nigeria|State]]\n| subdivision_name1               = [[Niger State]]\n| subdivision_type2               = \n| subdivision_name2               = \n| subdivision_type3               = \n| subdivision_name3               = \n| government_footnotes            = \n| government_type                 = Traditional state\n| leader_title                    = Etsu\n| leader_name                     = [[Umaru Bago Tafida]]\n| established_title               = \n| established_date                = <!-- Area    --------------------->\n| area_magnitude                  = \n| unit_pref                       = Metric\n| area_footnotes                  = \n| area_total_km2                  = \n| area_land_km2                   = <!--See table @ Template:Infobox Settlement for details on automatic unit conversion-->\n<!-- Population   ----------------------->| population_as_of                = \n| population_footnotes            = \n| population_note                 = \n| population_total                = \n| population_density_km2          = \n| population_density_urban_sq_mi  = \n| population_blank1_title         = Ethnicities\n| population_blank1               = \n| population_blank2_title         = Religions\n| population_blank2               = \n| population_density_blank1_km2   = \n| population_density_blank1_sq_mi = <!-- General information  --------------->\n| coordinates                     = {{coord|8|49|N|6|41|E|type:adm2nd_region:NG|display=inline,title}}\n| elevation_footnotes             = \n| elevation_m                     = \n| elevation_ft                    = \n| name                            = \n| Status                          = Fulani Emirate\n| Common languages                = Arabic (official), Fulani, Nupe\n| Religion                        = Sunni Islam\n| Government                      = Fula Oligarchy\n(1823 - 1938)\nAbsolute monarchy\n(1938 - Date)\n}}\n<br />\n\n==Rulers==\nThe emirate remains in existence, although it was subject first to British colonial rule and later to civilian or military rule of the independent state of Nigeria.

Photo-voltaic cells use [[sunlight]] as a source of energy and generate direct current [[electricity]]. A collection of PV modules is called a PV Panel, and a system of Panels is an Array. Arrays of a [[photovoltaic system]] supply [[solar electricity]] to electrical equipment.\n\nThe most common application of solar energy collection outside agriculture is [[solar water heating]] systems.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/sd.1547 |title=Comparing Solar Water Heater Popularization Policies in China, Israel and Australia: The Roles of Governments in Adopting Green Innovations |journal=Sustainable Development |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=160\u201370 |year=2013 |last1=Li |first1=Wei |last2=Rubin |first2=Tzameret H |last3=Onyina |first3=Paul A }}</ref>\n\n== Theory and construction ==\n{{See also|Solar cell}}\n[[File:From a solar cell to a PV system.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|From a [[solar cell]] to a [[PV system]]]]\n\n[[Photovoltaic]] modules use light energy ([[photon]]s) from the Sun to generate electricity through the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Most modules use [[Wafer (electronics)|wafer]]-based [[crystalline silicon]] cells or [[Thin film solar cell|thin-film cells]]. The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells. This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area (such as [[gallium arsenide]]) in a cost-effective way. \n\nSolar panels also use metal frames consisting of racking components, brackets, reflector shapes, and troughs to better support the panel structure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanindust.com/solar-panel-metal-stamping|title=Metal Stamped Parts for Solar Paneling {{!}} American Industrial|work=American Industrial|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Solar cell#History|Timeline of solar cells}}\n\nIn 1839, the ability of some materials to create an electrical charge from light exposure was first observed by [[Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Though the premiere solar panels were too inefficient for even simple electric devices they were used as an instrument to measure light.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.energymatters.com.au/panels-modules/ |title= The history of the invention of the solar panel summary. |accessdate=25 January 2019 |website=Engergymatters.com|first1=M |last1=Christian|publisher=Energymatters.com}}</ref> The observation by Becquerel was not replicated again until 1873, when [[Willoughby Smith]] discovered that the charge could be caused by light hitting selenium.

Equipment is carefully selected to optimize output, energy storage, reduce power loss during power transmission, and conversion from direct current to alternating current. \n\nScientists from Spectrolab, a subsidiary of [[Boeing]], have reported development of [[multi-junction solar cell]]s with an efficiency of more than 40%, a new world record for solar photovoltaic cells.<ref>KING, R.R., et al., Appl. Phys. Letters 90 (2007) 183516.</ref> The Spectrolab scientists also predict that concentrator solar cells could achieve efficiencies of more than 45% or even 50% in the future, with theoretical efficiencies being about 58% in cells with more than three junctions.\n\nCurrently, the best achieved sunlight conversion rate (solar module efficiency) is around 21.5% in new commercial products<ref>{{cite web |title=SunPower e20 Module |date=25 July 2014|url=http://us.sunpower.com/homes/products-services/solar-panels/e-series/}}</ref> typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolation.

The [[Light scattering|scattered]] [[light]] then travels along a longer path in the semiconductor, absorbing more photons to be converted into current. Although these nanocylinders have been used previously (aluminum was preceded by [[gold]] and [[silver]]), the light scattering occurred in the near infrared region and visible light was absorbed strongly. Aluminum was found to have absorbed the ultraviolet part of the spectrum, while the visible and near infrared parts of the spectrum were found to be scattered by the aluminum surface. This, the research argued, could bring down the cost significantly and improve the efficiency as aluminum is more abundant and less costly than gold and silver. The research also noted that the increase in current makes thinner film solar panels technically feasible without \"compromising power conversion efficiencies, thus reducing material consumption\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/improving-the-efficiency-of-solar-panels/article5265330.ece |title=Improving the efficiency of solar panels |publisher=The Hindu |date=24 October 2013 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref>\n* Solar panel efficiency can be calculated by MPP (maximum power point) value of solar panels.\n* [[Solar inverter]]s convert the DC power to [[Alternating current|AC]] power by performing [[maximum power point tracking|the process of maximum power point tracking]] (MPPT): solar inverter samples the output Power (I-V curve) from the solar cell and applies the proper resistance (load) to solar cells to obtain maximum power.\n* MPP (Maximum power point) of the solar panel consists of MPP voltage (V mpp) and MPP current (I mpp): it is a capacity of the solar panel and the higher value can make higher MPP.\n\nMicro-inverted solar panels are wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]], which produces more output than normal panels wired in [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]], with the output of the series determined by the lowest performing panel. This is known as the \"Christmas light effect\". Micro-inverters work independently to enable each panel to contribute its maximum possible output for a given amount of sunlight.<ref>{{cite web |title=Micro Inverters for Residential Solar Arrays |url=https://www.expertsure.com/uk/home/micro-inverters-for-residential-solar-arrays/ |accessdate=2017-05-10}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n{{Main article|Crystalline silicon|Thin film solar cell}}\n[[File:Global Market Share by PV Technology from 1990 to 2013.svg|thumb|Market-share of PV technologies since 1990]]\n\nMost solar modules are currently produced from crystalline silicon (c-Si) [[solar cells]] made of [[polycrystalline silicon|multicrystalline]] and [[monocrystalline silicon]]. In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels lost a little less than 0.05% of their overall efficiency per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/cleaning_solar_panels_often_not_worth_the_cost_engineers_at_uc_san_diego_fi |title=Cleaning Solar Panels Often Not Worth the Cost, Engineers at UC San Diego Find |date=August 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |website=UC San Diego News Center |publisher=UC San Diego News Center |last=Patringenaru |first=Ioana}}</ref> There may also be [[occupational hazards of solar panel installation]] and maintenance.\n\n== Recycling ==\nMost parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.<ref>Lisa Krueger {{cite web |title=Overview of First Solar's Module Collection and Recycling Program |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 23 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/2_Krueger_IEEE-Presentation-Final.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref> Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.<ref name= \"Wambach\"> {{cite web|title=A Voluntary Take Back Scheme and Industrial Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules |last = Wambach |first = K |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 37 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/3_4_PV-Module-RecyclingWambach.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nRecycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:\n* Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process.

Automotive solar panels may also include a [[car lighter]] and/or [[USB]] adapter. Indoor panels (including solar pv glasses, thin films and windows)  can integrate  [[microinverter]] (AC Solar panels).\n\n== Applications ==\nThere are many practical applications for the use of solar panels or photovoltaics. It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

The structural ([[Dead and live loads|load carrying]]) member of a module can be either the top layer or the back layer. Cells must be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones based on thin-film cells are also available. The cells are connected electrically in series, one to another to a desired voltage, and then in parallel to increase amperage. The wattage of the module is the mathematical product of the voltage and the amperage of the module.\n\nA PV [[junction box]] is attached to the back of the solar panel and functions as its output interface. External connections for most photovoltaic modules use [[MC4 connector]]s to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. A USB power interface can also be used.\n\nModule electrical connections are made [[Series circuits|in series]] to achieve a desired output voltage or [[Parallel circuits|in parallel]] to provide a desired current capability (amperes) of the solar panel or the PV system. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules are sized according to the ampacity and may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass [[diode]]s may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.\n\nSome special solar PV modules include [[Solar concentrator|concentrators]] in which light is focused by [[lens (optics)|lenses]] or mirrors onto smaller cells.

In 2013, crystalline silicon accounted for more than 90 percent of worldwide PV production, while the rest of the overall market is made up of [[thin film solar cells|thin-film technologies]] using [[CdTe PV|cadmium telluride]], [[CIGS panel|CIGS]] and [[amorphous silicon]]<ref>[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/downloads-englisch/pdf-files-englisch/photovoltaics-report-slides.pdf Photovoltaics Report, Fraunhofer ISE, 28 July 2014], pages 18,19</ref> \n\nEmerging, [[Thin film solar cell#Emerging photovoltaics|third generation]] solar technologies use advanced thin-film cells. They produce a relatively high-efficiency conversion for the low cost compared to other solar technologies. Also, high-cost, high-efficiency, and close-packed rectangular [[multi-junction solar cell|multi-junction (MJ) cell]]s are preferably used in [[solar panels on spacecraft]], as they offer the highest ratio of generated power per kilogram lifted into space. MJ-cells are [[compound semiconductor]]s and made of [[gallium arsenide]] (GaAs) and other semiconductor materials. Another emerging PV technology using MJ-cells is [[concentrator photovoltaics]] ( CPV ).\n\n=== Thin film ===\nIn rigid [[thin-film module]]s, the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production line. The cell is created on a glass [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]] or superstrate, and the electrical connections are created ''in situ'', a so-called \"monolithic integration\". The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back [[wikt:sheet|sheet]], usually another sheet of glass. The main cell technologies in this category are [[Cadmium telluride|CdTe]], or [[amorphous silicon|a-Si]], or [[micromorphous silicon|a-Si+uc-Si tandem]], or [[Copper indium gallium selenide|CIGS]] (or variant). Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6\u201312%\n\nFlexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the [[photoactive layer]] and other necessary layers on a [[flexible substrate]]. If the substrate is an [[insulator (electrical)|insulator]] (e.g. [[polyester]] or [[polyimide]] film) then [[Die (integrated circuit)|monolithic]] integration can be used. If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be used. The cells are assembled into modules by [[laminating]] them to a transparent colourless [[fluoropolymer]] on the front side (typically [[ETFE]] or [[Fluorinated ethylene propylene|FEP]]) and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other side.\n\n== Smart solar modules ==\n{{main article|Smart module|Solar micro-inverter}}\n\nSeveral companies have begun embedding electronics into PV modules. This enables performing MPPT for each module individually, and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module level. Some of these solutions make use of [[power optimizer]]s, a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic systems. As of about 2010, such electronics can also compensate for shading effects, wherein a shadow falling across a section of a module causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the module to fall to zero, but not having the output of the entire module fall to zero.\n\n== Performance and degradation ==\n{{original research|section|date=August 2013}}\n\n[[File:Actual output in volts, amps, and wattage from a 100 Watt Solar module in August.jpg|thumb]]\n\nModule performance is generally rated under standard test conditions (STC): [[irradiance]] of 1,000 [[W/m2|W/m<sup>2</sup>]], solar [[spectrum]] of [[Airmass|AM]] 1.5 and module temperature at 25\u00b0C. The actual voltage and current output of the module changes as lighting, temperature and load conditions change, so there is never one specific voltage, current, or wattage at which the module operates. Performance varies depending on time of day, amount of solar insolation, direction and tilt of modules, cloud cover, shading, state of charge, temperature, geographic location, and day of the year. The fluctuations in voltage and current can be logged with multimeter or data logger.\n\nFor optimum performance a solar panel needs to be made of similar modules oriented in the same direction perpendicular towards direct sunlight. The path of the sun varies by latitude and day of the year and can be studied using a sundial or a sunchart and tracked using a solar tracker. Differences in voltage or current of modules may affect the overall performance of a panel. Bypass diodes are used to circumvent broken or shaded panels to optimize output. \n\nElectrical characteristics include nominal power (P<sub>MAX</sub>, measured in [[watt|W]]), [[open circuit voltage]] (V<sub>OC</sub>), [[short circuit current]] (I<sub>SC</sub>, measured in [[ampere]]s), maximum power voltage (V<sub>MPP</sub>), maximum power current (I<sub>MPP</sub>), peak power, ([[watt-peak]], W<sub>p</sub>), and module efficiency (%).\n\nNominal voltage<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofengineering.com/definition/nominal-voltage.html|title=nominal voltage Definition and Meaning|website=www.dictionaryofengineering.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref> refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge; this is a leftover term from the days when solar modules were only used to charge batteries. Nominal voltage allows users, at a glance, to make sure the module is compatible with a given system.\n\nOpen circuit voltage or V<sub>OC</sub> is the maximum voltage that the module can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or system. V<sub>OC</sub> can be measured with a [[voltmeter]] directly on an illuminated module's terminals or on its disconnected cable.\n\nThe peak power rating, W<sub>p</sub>, is the maximum output under standard test conditions (not the maximum possible output). Typical modules, which could measure approximately {{convert|1|x|2|m|ft|sigfig=1}}, will be rated from as low as 75 W to as high as 350 W, depending on their efficiency. At the time of testing, the test modules are binned according to their test results, and a typical manufacturer might rate their modules in 5 W increments, and either rate them at +/- 3%, +/-5%, +3/-0% or +5/-0%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phoenixsolar-group.com/dms/produkte/module/pdf/en/FirstSolar_PD-5-401-03-Global-Series-3-Datasheet/PD-5-401-03%20Global%20Series%203%20Datasheet.pdf  |title=First Solar \u2013 FS-377 / FS-380 / FS-382 / FS-385 Datasheet |date= |accessdate=2012-06-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |title=TSM PC/PM14 Datasheet |accessdate=2012-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200512/http://www.trinasolar.com/images/PDF/datasheets/us/TSM-PA14_US.pdf |archive-date=29 October 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lubisolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Poly-260-275W.pdf |title=LBS Poly 260 275 Data sheet |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>\n\nThe ability of solar modules to withstand damage by rain, [[hail]], heavy snow load, and cycles of heat and cold varies by manufacturer, although most solar panels on the U.S. market are UL listed, meaning they have gone through testing to withstand hail.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://energyinformative.org/solar-panels-weather/|title=Are Solar Panels Affected by Weather? - Energy Informative|work=Energy Informative|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Many [[crystalline silicon]] module manufacturers offer a [[Warranty#Defects_In_Materials_and_Workmanship|limited warranty]] that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cti-solar.com/userfiles/file/brochlet%20CTI-SOLAR%20vers%20EN.pdf |title=CTI Solar sales brochure |work=cti-solar.com |accessdate=3 September 2010}}</ref> \n\n[[Potential induced degradation]] (also called PID) is a potential induced performance degradation in crystalline photovoltaic modules, caused by so-called stray currents. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/asset-management/11674/potential-induced-degradation-combatting-phantom-menace/|title=Solarplaza Potential Induced Degradation: Combatting a Phantom Menace|website=www.solarplaza.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>This effect may cause power loss of up to 30%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eicero.com/what-is-pid|title=What is PID? \u2014 eicero|last=(www.inspire.cz)|first=INSPIRE CZ s.r.o.|website=eicero.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>\n\nThe largest challenge for [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] technology is said to be the purchase price per watt of electricity produced. New materials and manufacturing techniques continue to improve the price to power performance. The problem resides in the enormous activation energy that must be overcome for a photon to excite an electron for harvesting purposes. Advancements in photovoltaic technologies have brought about the process of \"doping\" the silicon substrate to lower the activation energy thereby making the panel more efficient in converting photons to retrievable electrons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Solar Cells Work |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/solar-cell2.htm |website=HowStuffWorks |date=April 2000 |accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> \n\nChemicals such as [[boron]] (p-type) are applied into the semiconductor crystal in order to create donor and acceptor energy levels substantially closer to the valence and conductor [http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/section_16/6520efadc9fafd08d3043572e61e9765.jpg bands].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bonding in Metals and Semiconductors |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/principles-of-general-chemistry-v1.0/s16-06-bonding-in-metals-and-semicond.html |website=2012books.lardbucket.org|accessdate=2015-12-09}}</ref> In doing so, the addition of boron impurity allows the activation energy to decrease 20 fold from 1.12 eV to 0.05 eV. Since the potential difference (E<sub>B</sub>) is so low, the boron is able to thermally ionize at room temperatures. This allows for free energy carriers in the conduction and valence bands thereby allowing greater conversion of photons to electrons.\n\n== Maintenance ==\nSolar panel conversion efficiency, typically in the 20% range, is reduced by dust, grime, pollen, and other particulates that accumulate on the solar panel. \"A dirty solar panel can reduce its power capabilities by up to 30% in high dust/pollen or desert areas\", says Seamus Curran, associate professor of physics at the University of Houston and director of the Institute for NanoEnergy, which specializes in the design, engineering, and assembly of nanostructures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/engineering-topics/articles/energy/self-cleaning-solar-panels-maximize-efficiency |title=Self-Cleaning Solar Panels Maximize Efficiency |date=October 2012 |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers |publisher=ASME |last=Crawford |first=Mike}}</ref>\n\nPaying to have solar panels cleaned is often not a good investment; researchers found panels that had not been cleaned, or rained on, for 145 days during a summer drought in California, lost only 7.4% of their efficiency. Overall, for a typical residential solar system of 5 kW, washing panels halfway through the summer would translate into a mere $20 gain in electricity production until the summer drought ends\u2014in about 2 \u00bd months. For larger commercial rooftop systems, the financial losses are bigger but still rarely enough to warrant the cost of washing the panels. On average, panels lost a little less than 0.05% of their overall efficiency per day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/cleaning_solar_panels_often_not_worth_the_cost_engineers_at_uc_san_diego_fi |title=Cleaning Solar Panels Often Not Worth the Cost, Engineers at UC San Diego Find |date=August 2013 |accessdate=31 May 2015 |website=UC San Diego News Center |publisher=UC San Diego News Center |last=Patringenaru |first=Ioana}}</ref> There may also be [[occupational hazards of solar panel installation]] and maintenance.\n\n== Recycling ==\nMost parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metals.<ref>Lisa Krueger {{cite web |title=Overview of First Solar's Module Collection and Recycling Program |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 23 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/2_Krueger_IEEE-Presentation-Final.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref> Some private companies and non-profit organizations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life modules.<ref name= \"Wambach\"> {{cite web|title=A Voluntary Take Back Scheme and Industrial Recycling of Photovoltaic Modules |last = Wambach |first = K |publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] p. 37 |url=http://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/PRS_Agenda/3_4_PV-Module-RecyclingWambach.pdf |accessdate=2017-03-17}}</ref>\n\nRecycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules:\n* Silicon based modules: aluminum frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the process.

Automotive solar panels may also include a [[car lighter]] and/or [[USB]] adapter. Indoor panels (including solar pv glasses, thin films and windows)  can integrate  [[microinverter]] (AC Solar panels).\n\n== Applications ==\nThere are many practical applications for the use of solar panels or photovoltaics. It can first be used in agriculture as a power source for irrigation. In health care solar panels can be used to refrigerate medical supplies. It can also be used for infrastructure. PV modules are used in [[photovoltaic system]]s and include a [[Photovoltaic system#Other systems|large variety of electric devices]]:\n* [[Photovoltaic power station]]s\n* [[Rooftop solar PV]] systems\n* [[PV system#Standalone|Standalone PV systems]]\n* [[Solar hybrid power systems]]\n* [[Concentrated photovoltaics]]\n* [[Solar plane]]s\n*[[Solar-powered water purification in rural Africa|Solar-powered water purification]]\n* [[Solar-pumped laser]]s\n* [[Solar vehicle]]s\n* [[Solar panels on spacecraft]]s and [[space station]]s\n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Pollution and energy in production ===\nSolar panel has been a well-known method of generating clean, emission free electricity. However, it produces only direct current electricity (DC), which is not what normal appliances use. Solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV systems) are often made of solar PV panels (modules) and inverter (changing DC to AC). Solar PV panels are mainly made of solar photovoltaic cells, which has no fundamental difference to the material for making computer chips{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. The process of producing solar PV cells (computer chips) is energy intensive and involves highly poisonous and environmental toxic chemicals{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. There are few solar PV manufacturing plants around the world producing PV modules with energy produced from PV{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. This measure greatly reduces the carbon footprint during the manufacturing process{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}. Managing the chemicals used in the manufacturing process is subject to the factories' local laws and regulations{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}.\n\n=== Impact on electricity network ===\nWith the increasing levels of rooftop photovoltaic systems, the energy flow becomes 2-way. When there is more local generation than consumption, electricity is exported to the grid. However, an electricity network traditionally is not designed to deal with the 2- way energy transfer. Therefore, some technical issues may occur. For example, in Queensland Australia, more than 30% of households used rooftop PV by the end of 2017. The famous Californian 2020 [[duck curve]] appeared often for a lot of communities from 2015 onwards. An over-voltage issue may result as the electricity flows from  PV households back to the network.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Wendy |last2=Liu |first2=Aaron |last3=Amin |first3=Zakaria |last4=Wagner |first4=Andreas |title=Power Quality and Rooftop-Photovoltaic Households: An Examination of Measured Data at Point of Customer Connection |journal=Sustainability |volume=10 |issue=4 |year=2018 |pages=1224 |doi=10.3390/su10041224 |url=https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000082198/7829299 |doi-access=free }}</ref> There are solutions to manage the over voltage issue, such as regulating PV inverter power factor, new voltage and energy control equipment at the electricity distributor level, re-conducting the electricity wires, demand side management, etc. There are often limitations and costs related to these solutions.\n\nWhen electric networks are down, such as during the October [[2019 California power shutoff]], solar panels are often insufficient to fully provide power to a house or other structure, because they are designed to supply power to the grid, not directly to homes. <ref>{{cite news |last1=Martin |first1=Chris |title=Californians Learning That Solar Panels Don't Work in Blackouts |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-10/californians-learning-that-solar-panels-don-t-work-in-blackouts |work=Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg LP |date=10 October 2019 |location=New York NY}}</ref>\n\n=== Implication onto electricity bill management and energy investment ===\nThere is no silver bullet in electricity or energy demand and bill management, because customers (sites) have different specific situations, e.g. different comfort/convenience needs, different electricity tariffs, or different usage patterns. Electricity tariff may have a few elements, such as daily access and metering charge, energy charge (based on kWh, MWh) or peak demand charge (e.g. a price for the highest 30min energy consumption in a month). PV is a promising option for reducing energy charge when electricity price is reasonably high and continuously increasing, such as in Australia and Germany. However, for sites with peak demand charge in place, PV may be less attractive if peak demands mostly occur in the late afternoon to early evening, for example residential communities. Overall, energy investment is largely an economical decision and it is better to make investment decisions based on systematical evaluation of options in operational improvement, energy efficiency, onsite generation and energy storage.<ref>L.

{"title_page": "Pelagianism", "text_new": "{{redirect|Pelagians|the Italian movement of lay mystics known as Pelagians|Pelagians (Quietism)}}\n'''Pelagianism''' is a [[heterodox]] [[Christian theology|Christian theological]] position which holds that the [[original sin]] did not taint [[human nature]] and that mortal [[will (philosophy)|will]] is capable of choosing [[Goodness and value theory|good]] or [[evil]] without [[Grace (Christianity)#Augustine versus Pelagius|divine aid]] or assistance. This theological theory is named after the British monk [[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|420}} CE), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name. Pelagianism asserts human will, as created with its abilities by God, is sufficient to live a sinless life, although God's grace assists every good work. It has come to be identified with the view (whether taught by Pelagius or not) that human beings can earn salvation by their own efforts.\n\n==Pelagian controversy==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 135r 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pelagius Hereticus and [[John Chrysostom]] depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\n\n[[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}\u2013{{circa|420}} CE){{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} was a monk from the [[British Isles]] who moved to [[Rome]] as a young man.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} At the time, many Romans were converting to Christianity, but they did not necessarily follow the faith strictly.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} Pelagius criticized what he saw as an increasing laxity among Christians, instead promoting higher moral standards and [[Christian asceticism]].{{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} He defended asceticism from the accusation of [[Manicheanism]] and argued for the possibility of a [[sinless |sinless life]]. The rejection of [[original sin]] was not original to Pelagius, initially promoted by [[Rufinus the Syrian]]. Other prominent Pelagians included the former Roman aristocrat [[Caelestius]], described by [[Gerald Bonner]] as \"the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement\", and the apologist [[Julian of Eclanum]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} According to scholar [[Ali Bonner]], the ideas Pelagius actually promoted were not a \"new heresy\", as Augustine claimed, but mainstream in contemporary Christianity, advocated by such figures as [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] and [[Jerome]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonner |first1=Ali |title=In praise of Pelagius |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/31-august/features/features/in-praise-of-pelagius |accessdate=19 April 2020 |work=[[The Church Times]] |date=31 August 2018}}</ref> In Bonner's view, the heresy of Pelagianism was a \"deliberately invented fiction\" by [[Augustine]], and did not match what Pelagius actually taught.{{sfn|Bonner|2018|p=302}}\n\nAugustine maintained friendly relations with Pelagius until at least 413, initially only condemning Caelestius' teachings.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} In 415, the Gallic bishops [[Heros of Arles]] and [[Lazarus of Aix]] accused Pelagius of heresy; Pelagius defended himself by claiming not to teach what he was accused of and by ascribing some of the teachings to Caelestinus and disavowing them, leading to his acquittal at the [[Council of Diospolis]] (also known as Lydda or [[Lod]]. Following the verdict, Augustine led condemnation of Pelagius in Africa and persuaded Pope [[Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism, which he did in January 417, shortly before his death. Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus|Zosimus]], initially agreed to reopen the case against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}  Pelagianism was later condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)]],{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} after which Zosimus issued the ''Epistola tractoria'' [[excommunicating]] both Pelagius and Caelestinus.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} The condemnation of Pelagianism was ratified at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe strict moral teachings of the Pelagians were influential in southern Italy, where they were openly preached until the death of Julian of Eclanum in 455; in Sicily, where the anonymous \"[[Sicilian Briton]]\" wrote.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}} Despite repeated attempts to suppress Pelagianism and similar teachings by [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] clergy, some followers were still active in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (493\u2013553), most notably in [[Picenum]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] during the rule of [[Theoderic the Great]].{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=523}} Pelagianism was also reported to be popular in Britain, as [[Germanus of Auxerre]] had to make at least one visit (in 429) to denounce the heresy. Some scholars, including [[Nowell Myres]] and [[John Morris (historian) |John Morris]], have suggested that Pelagianism in Britain was understood as an attack on Roman decadence and corruption, but this has been criticized by others such as [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nThere is significant doubt as to what Pelagius actually taught.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Nevertheless, the doctrines associated with Pelagianism include the following:\n\n*Each time a Christian makes a choice, he has the ability to choose the right action, and therefore it is possible to live a sinless life.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}}\n*Pelagius taught that a human's ability to act correctly is a gift of God,{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} but the Pelagian heresy was claimed to assert that \"God\u2019s grace... is not the means of having the motive and the strength not to sin\".{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}}\n*Rejection of [[original sin]], instead belief that, because sin must be deliberate, infants are without fault. Pelagians therefore oppose [[infant baptism]].{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}}\n*Sin is not an inevitable result of [[human nature]], but instead comes about by [[free choice]].\n\nHistorian [[Eric Nelson (historian)|Eric Nelson]] defined genuine Pelagianism (as opposed to the term being used as an insult) as rejection of original sin or denial of original sin's effect on man's ability to avoid sin. According to Nelson, Pelagianism is a solution to the [[problem of evil]] that invokes [[libertarian free will]] as both the cause of human suffering and a sufficient good to justify it.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=3}} By positing that man could choose between good and evil without divine intercession, Pelagianism brought into question Christianity's core doctrine of [[Jesus]]' act of [[substitutionary atonement]] to expiate the sins of mankind.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=3, 51}} Augustine argued that if man \"could have become just by the law of nature and free will . . . amounts to rendering the cross of Christ void\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=3}} For this reason, Pelagianism became associated with [[nontrinitarian]] interpretations of Christianity which rejected the [[divinity of Jesus]],{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}} as well as other heresies such as [[Arianism]], [[Socinianism]], and [[mortalism]] (which rejected the [[hell in Christianity|existence of hell]]).{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=4}}\n\nOne of the most important distinctions between Christianity and [[Judaism]] is that the former conventionally teaches justice by faith, while the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the absense of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil, Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of  Judaism.{{sfn|Fu|2015|p=182}}  Critics frequently attacked Pelagianism for \"[[Judaizing]]\" tendencies.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}}\n\n==Comparison of teaching==\n[[File:The Myth of Pelagianism.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Myth of Pelagianism]]'', Ali Bonner argued that Pelagianism was a \"deliberately invented fiction\".]]\n===Pelagius's views on free will===\nPelagius was disturbed by the immorality he encountered in Rome and saw Christians using human frailty as an excuse for their failure to live a Christian life.<ref name=\"augnet.org\" /> He taught that the human will, as created with its abilities by God, was sufficient to live a sinless life, although he believed that God's grace assisted every good work. Pelagius did not believe that all humanity was guilty in Adam's sin, but said that Adam had condemned mankind through bad example. The value of Christ's redemption was, in his opinion, limited mainly to instruction and example.{{sfn|Pohle|1911}}\n\n===Church Fathers on free will===\nMany of the Church Fathers before Augustine taught that humans have the power of free will and the choice over good and evil.\n\n*[[Justin Martyr]] said that \"every created being is so constituted as to be capable of vice and virtue. For he can do nothing praiseworthy, if he had not the power of turning either way\".{{sfn|Justin Martyr|1885}}\n*[[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] (c.180) said, \"If, on the other hand, he would turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he would himself be the cause of death to himself.

Augustine contradicted this by saying perfection was impossible without grace because we are born sinners with a sinful heart and will. The Pelagians charged Augustine with departing from the accepted teaching (e.g.: [[John 8:11]]) of the Apostles and the Bible, demonstrating the doctrine of original sin amounted to [[Manichaeism]], which taught that the flesh was in itself sinful (and thus denied Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|came in the flesh]]). This charge would have carried added weight since contemporaries knew Augustine had himself been a Manichaean layman before converting to Christianity. Augustine also taught a person's salvation comes solely through a free gift, the [[efficacious grace]] of God, but this was a gift one had no free choice to accept or refuse.{{sfn|Stump|Kretzmann|2001|pp= 130\u2013135}}\n\n==Later responses==\n[[Thomas Bradwardine]] (c. 1290\u20131349) wrote ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum ad suos Mertonenses'' condemning Pelagianism, as did [[Gabriel Biel]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} Johann Pupper, also known as [[Johannes von Goch]] (c. 1400\u20131475), an [[Augustinian]], recommended a return to the text of the Bible as a remedy for Pelagianism.{{sfn|Webster|1980|p=783|loc=Johannes von Goch}}\n\n===Reformation===\nPelagianism became a common accusation during the [[Protestant Reformation]]; Reformers often used the epithet to critique what they saw as late-medieval Catholicism's undue emphasis on doing [[Justification (theology)|good works]]. [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564), and [[Cornelius Jansen]] (1585\u20131638) reacted in different ways against Pelagianism, and evaluations of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] theologies have often turned on the question of what is or is not Pelagian.{{sfn|Cottret|Cottret| Michel|2002}}\n===Contemporary responses===\nIn the book ''Guardare Cristo: Esercizi di fede, speranza e carit\u00e0'' (Looking at Christ: Exercises of faith, hope and charity),{{sfn|Ratzinger|1989|p=}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote: {{quote|the other face of the same vice is the Pelagianism of the pious.

This theological theory is named after the British monk [[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{circa|420}} CE), although he denied, at least at some point in his life, many of the doctrines associated with his name. Pelagianism asserts human will, as created with its abilities by God, is sufficient to live a sinless life, although God's grace assists every good work. It has come to be identified with the view (whether taught by Pelagius or not) that human beings can earn salvation by their own efforts.\n\n==Pelagian controversy==\n[[File:Nuremberg chronicles f 135r 2.jpg|thumb|right|Pelagius Hereticus and [[John Chrysostom]] depicted in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]\n\n[[Pelagius]] ({{circa|355}}\u2013{{circa|420}} CE){{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} was a monk from the [[British Isles]] who moved to [[Rome]] as a young man.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} At the time, many Romans were converting to Christianity, but they did not necessarily follow the faith strictly.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998}} Pelagius criticized what he saw as an increasing laxity among Christians, instead promoting higher moral standards and [[Christian asceticism]].{{sfn|Elliott|2011|p=377}} He defended asceticism from the accusation of [[Manicheanism]] and argued for the possibility of a [[sinless |sinless life]]. The rejection of [[original sin]] was not original to Pelagius, initially promoted by [[Rufinus the Syrian]]. Other prominent Pelagians included the former Roman aristocrat [[Caelestius]], described by [[Gerald Bonner]] as \"the real apostle of the so-called Pelagian movement\", and the apologist [[Julian of Eclanum]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} According to scholar [[Ali Bonner]], the ideas Pelagius actually promoted were not a \"new heresy\", as Augustine claimed, but mainstream in contemporary Christianity, advocated by such figures as [[Athanasius of Alexandria]] and [[Jerome]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonner |first1=Ali |title=In praise of Pelagius |url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2018/31-august/features/features/in-praise-of-pelagius |accessdate=19 April 2020 |work=[[The Church Times]] |date=31 August 2018}}</ref> In Bonner's view, the heresy of Pelagianism was a \"deliberately invented fiction\" by [[Augustine]], and did not match what Pelagius actually taught.{{sfn|Bonner|2018|p=302}}\n\nAugustine maintained friendly relations with Pelagius until at least 413, initially only condemning Caelestius' teachings.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} In 415, the Gallic bishops [[Heros of Arles]] and [[Lazarus of Aix]] accused Pelagius of heresy; Pelagius defended himself by claiming not to teach what he was accused of and by ascribing some of the teachings to Caelestinus and disavowing them, leading to his acquittal at the [[Council of Diospolis]] (also known as Lydda or [[Lod]]. Following the verdict, Augustine led condemnation of Pelagius in Africa and persuaded Pope [[Innocent I]] to condemn Pelagianism, which he did in January 417, shortly before his death. Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus|Zosimus]], initially agreed to reopen the case against Pelagius, but backtracked following pressure from the African bishops.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}  Pelagianism was later condemned at the [[Council of Carthage (418)]],{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} after which Zosimus issued the ''Epistola tractoria'' [[excommunicating]] both Pelagius and Caelestinus.{{sfn|Bonner|2004}} The condemnation of Pelagianism was ratified at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe strict moral teachings of the Pelagians were influential in southern Italy, where they were openly preached until the death of Julian of Eclanum in 455; in Sicily, where the anonymous \"[[Sicilian Briton]]\" wrote.<ref name=\"Knowles\" />{{better source|date=April 2020}} Despite repeated attempts to suppress Pelagianism and similar teachings by [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] clergy, some followers were still active in the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] (493\u2013553), most notably in [[Picenum]] and [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] during the rule of [[Theoderic the Great]].{{sfn|Cohen|2016|p=523}} Pelagianism was also reported to be popular in Britain, as [[Germanus of Auxerre]] had to make at least one visit (in 429) to denounce the heresy. Some scholars, including [[Nowell Myres]] and [[John Morris (historian) |John Morris]], have suggested that Pelagianism in Britain was understood as an attack on Roman decadence and corruption, but this has been criticized by others such as [[Wolf Liebeschuetz]].{{sfn|Bonner|2004}}\n\n==Beliefs==\nThere is significant doubt as to what Pelagius actually taught.{{cn|date=April 2020}} Nevertheless, the doctrines associated with Pelagianism include the following:\n\n*Each time a Christian makes a choice, he has the ability to choose the right action, and therefore it is possible to live a sinless life.{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}}\n*Pelagius taught that a human's ability to act correctly is a gift of God,{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Pelagius}} but the Pelagian heresy was claimed to assert that \"God\u2019s grace... is not the means of having the motive and the strength not to sin\".{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}}\n*Rejection of [[original sin]], instead belief that, because sin must be deliberate, infants are without fault. Pelagians therefore oppose [[infant baptism]].{{sfn|Kirwan|1998|loc=Grace and free will}}\n*Sin is not an inevitable result of [[human nature]], but instead comes about by [[free choice]].\n\nHistorian [[Eric Nelson (historian)|Eric Nelson]] defined genuine Pelagianism (as opposed to the term being used as an insult) as rejection of original sin or denial of original sin's effect on man's ability to avoid sin. According to Nelson, Pelagianism is a solution to the [[problem of evil]] that invokes [[libertarian free will]] as both the cause of human suffering and a sufficient good to justify it.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=3}} By positing that man could choose between good and evil without divine intercession, Pelagianism brought into question Christianity's core doctrine of [[Jesus]]' act of [[substitutionary atonement]] to expiate the sins of mankind.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|pp=3, 51}} Augustine argued that if man \"could have become just by the law of nature and free will . . . amounts to rendering the cross of Christ void\".{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=3}} For this reason, Pelagianism became associated with [[nontrinitarian]] interpretations of Christianity which rejected the [[divinity of Jesus]],{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}} as well as other heresies such as [[Arianism]], [[Socinianism]], and [[mortalism]] (which rejected the [[hell in Christianity|existence of hell]]).{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=3}}\n\nOne of the most important distinctions between Christianity and [[Judaism]] is that the former conventionally teaches justice by faith, while the latter teaches that man has the choice to follow divine law. By teaching the absense of original sin and the idea that humans can choose between good and evil, Pelagianism advocated a position close to that of  Judaism.{{sfn|Fu|2015|p=182}}  Critics frequently attacked Pelagianism for \"[[Judaizing]]\" tendencies.{{sfn|Nelson|2019|p=51}}\n\n==Comparison of teaching==\n[[File:The Myth of Pelagianism.jpg|thumb|In ''[[The Myth of Pelagianism]]'', Ali Bonner argued that Pelagianism was a \"deliberately invented fiction\".]]\n===Pelagius's views on free will===\nPelagius was disturbed by the immorality he encountered in Rome and saw Christians using human frailty as an excuse for their failure to live a Christian life.<ref name=\"augnet.org\" /> He taught that the human will, as created with its abilities by God, was sufficient to live a sinless life, although he believed that God's grace assisted every good work. Pelagius did not believe that all humanity was guilty in Adam's sin, but said that Adam had condemned mankind through bad example. The value of Christ's redemption was, in his opinion, limited mainly to instruction and example.{{sfn|Pohle|1911}}\n\n===Church Fathers on free will===\nMany of the Church Fathers before Augustine taught that humans have the power of free will and the choice over good and evil.\n\n*[[Justin Martyr]] said that \"every created being is so constituted as to be capable of vice and virtue. For he can do nothing praiseworthy, if he had not the power of turning either way\".{{sfn|Justin Martyr|1885}}\n*[[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] (c.180) said, \"If, on the other hand, he would turn to the things of death, disobeying God, he would himself be the cause of death to himself.

Augustine contradicted this by saying perfection was impossible without grace because we are born sinners with a sinful heart and will. The Pelagians charged Augustine with departing from the accepted teaching (e.g.: [[John 8:11]]) of the Apostles and the Bible, demonstrating the doctrine of original sin amounted to [[Manichaeism]], which taught that the flesh was in itself sinful (and thus denied Jesus [[Incarnation (Christianity)|came in the flesh]]). This charge would have carried added weight since contemporaries knew Augustine had himself been a Manichaean layman before converting to Christianity. Augustine also taught a person's salvation comes solely through a free gift, the [[efficacious grace]] of God, but this was a gift one had no free choice to accept or refuse.{{sfn|Stump|Kretzmann|2001|pp= 130\u2013135}}\n\n==Later responses==\n[[Thomas Bradwardine]] (c. 1290\u20131349) wrote ''De causa Dei contra Pelagium et de virtute causarum ad suos Mertonenses'' condemning Pelagianism, as did [[Gabriel Biel]] in the 15th century.{{sfn|Reese|1996|p=421}} Johann Pupper, also known as [[Johannes von Goch]] (c. 1400\u20131475), an [[Augustinian]], recommended a return to the text of the Bible as a remedy for Pelagianism.{{sfn|Webster|1980|p=783|loc=Johannes von Goch}}\n\n===Reformation===\nPelagianism became a common accusation during the [[Protestant Reformation]]; Reformers often used the epithet to critique what they saw as late-medieval Catholicism's undue emphasis on doing [[Justification (theology)|good works]]. [[Martin Luther]] (1483\u20131546), [[John Calvin]] (1509\u20131564), and [[Cornelius Jansen]] (1585\u20131638) reacted in different ways against Pelagianism, and evaluations of [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Calvinism|Reformed]], and [[Jansenism|Jansenist]] theologies have often turned on the question of what is or is not Pelagian.{{sfn|Cottret|Cottret| Michel|2002}}\n===Contemporary responses===\nIn the book ''Guardare Cristo: Esercizi di fede, speranza e carit\u00e0'' (Looking at Christ: Exercises of faith, hope and charity),{{sfn|Ratzinger|1989|p=}} [[Pope Benedict XVI]] wrote: {{quote|the other face of the same vice is the Pelagianism of the pious.

{"title_page": "Sick leave", "text_new": "{{short description|Policy allowing paid time off from work for health needs}}\n{{lead too short|date=July 2014}}\n\n'''Sick leave''' (or '''paid sick days''' or '''sick pay''') is time off from [[employment|work]] that workers can use to stay home to address their [[health]] and safety needs without losing pay. Paid [https://www.leaveapplication.co/ sick leave] is a statutory requirement in many nations. Most European, many Latin American, a few African and a few Asian countries have legal requirements for paid sick leave.\n\nIn nations without laws mandating paid sick leave, some [[employer]]s choose to offer it. Those that do offer sick leave do so as a matter of workplace policy or because it is in some or all of the employees' [[employment contract]]s or required by a [[collective bargaining agreement]]. Currently, ten US states (Arizona, California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington); 23 US cities; and two US counties (Montgomery County, MD and San Francisco County, CA) have laws mandating paid sick leave. Currently, there are additional US city, county and state jurisdictions with proposed legislation to enact paid sick leave.\n\n[[The Book of Leviticus]] prescribed (7) days of medical isolation for a skin condition in chapter 13. Already in 1500 BCE, at least some of the workers who built the tombs of Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s received paid sick leave as well as state-supported [[health care]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/02/17/even-the-ancient-egyptians-had-paid-sick-days/|title=Even the ancient Egyptians had paid sick days|author=Anne Austin|date=17 February 2015|work=Washington Post|accessdate=8 September 2015}}</ref>\n\ngenerally three types of leave can be granted to student and employee.\n\n'''[https://leaveapplication.co/sick-leave-application-formats-for-school-college-students/ Sick leave]:'''  sick leave can granted one and maximum seven day.

Some policies also allow paid sick time to be used to care for sick family members, to attend routine doctor or medical appointments, or to address health and safety needs related to domestic violence or sexual assault.\n\nAt least 145 countries ensure access to paid sick days for short- or long-term illnesses, with 127 providing a week or more annually.<ref>Jody Heymann, Alison Earle, and Jeffrey Hayes, [https://www.mcgill.ca/files/ihsp/WFEIFinal2007.pdf ''The Work, Family and Equity Index: How Does the United States Measure Up?''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813102042/http://www.mcgill.ca/files/ihsp/WFEIFinal2007.pdf |date=2015-08-13 }}, Institute for Health & Social Policy, 2007.</ref>{{Dead link|date=March 2020}}\n\nAn analysis from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) finds that around 39 percent of American workers in the private sector do not have paid sick leave.<ref>Bureau of Labor Statistics, [http://www.bls.gov/ncs/ebs/benefits/2009/ownership/private/table21a.pdf Table 30.

These platforms, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], provide centralized services to purchase and download digital content for either specific [[video game console]]s or PCs. Some platforms may also serve as [[digital rights management]] systems, limiting the use of purchased items to one account.\n\nDigital distribution of video games is becoming increasingly common, with major publishers and retailers paying more attention to digital sales, including [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[PlayStation Store]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Game (retailer)|GAME]], [[GameStop]], and others.

One of the first examples of digital distribution in video games was [[GameLine]], which operated during the early 1980s. The service allowed [[Atari 2600]] owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a [[Telephone line|phone line]] to a central server and rent a video game for 5\u201310 days. The GameLine service was terminated during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]]. From 1987 to 2003, Nintendo's Japan-only [[Family Computer Disk System#Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks|Disk Writer kiosks]] allowed users to copy from a [[jukebox]] style of rotating stock of the latest games to their floppy disks.

Among them were [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Meganet]] and [[Sega Channel]], released in 1990 and 1994 respectively, providing [[Sega Genesis]] owners with access to games on demand and other services. Nintendo released peripherals and services only in Japan: the [[Satellaview]] satellite subscription service for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] and the [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]] flash cartridge in-store kiosk system for Super Famicom and [[Game Boy]].\n\nOn PCs, digital distribution was more prevalent. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, prior to the widespread adoption of the internet, it was common for software developers to upload demos and [[shareware]] to [[Bulletin Board Systems]]. In most cases, demos or shareware releases would contain an advertisement for the full game with ordering instructions for a physical copy of the full game or software. Some developers instead used a licensing system where 'full versions' could be unlocked from the downloaded software with the purchase of a key, thereby making this method the first true digital distribution method for PC Software. Notable examples include the [[Software Creations BBS]] and [[ExecPC BBS]], both of which continue to exist today - albeit in a very different form. Bulletin Board systems however were not interconnected, and developers would have to upload their software to each site. Additionally, BBSs required users to place a telephone call with a [[modem]] to reach their system. For many users this meant incurring long distance charges. These factors contributed to a sharp decline in BBS usage in the early 1990s, coinciding with the rise of inexpensive internet providers.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, with the rise of the internet, early individual examples for digital distribution under usage of this new medium emerged, although there were no significant services for it. For instance, in 1997 the video game producer [[Cavedog]] regularly distributed additional content for the [[Real-time strategy]] [[computer game]] [[Total Annihilation]] as internet downloads via their website.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010330073657/http://www.cavedog.com/totala/dwnlds_frame.html TA downloadable units] on cavedog.com (archived in the [[Internet Archive]] on March 30, 2001)</ref>\n\nAlso, users used the internet to distribute their own content. Without access to the [[retail]] infrastructure that would allow them to distribute this content through physical media, [[Fan labor|user-created]] content such as game [[Mods (computer gaming)|modifications]], maps or [[fan patch]]es could only be distributed online.\n\n===2000s===\nBy this time, internet connections were fast and numerous enough such that digital distribution of games and other related content became viable.<ref name=\"newell2007\"/>\n\n====Consoles====\nThe proliferation of internet-enabled consoles allowed also additional buyable content that could be added onto full retail games, such as maps, in-game clothing, and gameplay. This type of content, called DLC ([[Downloadable content]]), become prevalent for consoles in the 2000s.\n\n====PC====\nAn early innovator of the digital distribution idea on the [[Personal computer|PC]] was [[Stardock]]. In 2001 Stardock released the [[Stardock Central]] to digitally distribute and sell its own [[Personal computer|PC]] titles, followed by a service called ''Drengin.net'' with a yearly subscription pay model in summer 2003. In 2004, the subscription model was substituted by ''TotalGaming.net'' which allowed individual purchases or pay an upfront fee for tokens which allowed them to purchase games at a discount. In 2008, Stardock announced [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]] a third-generation digital distribution platform, which included independent third-party games and major publisher titles.<ref name=\"ImpulseGoal\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/1180761|title=Stardock Impulse Details|website=Gamers With Jobs}}</ref> The platform was sold to [[GameStop]] in May 2011.<ref name=\"GameStopAcquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1544860 |title=GameStop Announces Acquisition of Spawn Labs and Agreement to Acquire Impulse, Inc. |publisher=GameStop|date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"JoystiqAcquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/31/gamestop-indulges-in-some-impulse-buying-no-seriously-it-bo/|title=GameStop indulges in some Impulse buying ... no seriously, it bought Impulse (and Spawn Labs)|author=Christopher Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131154411/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/31/gamestop-indulges-in-some-impulse-buying-no-seriously-it-bo/|archive-date=January 31, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe period between 2004 and now saw the rise of many digital distribution services on PC, such as [[Amazon.com#Amazon Publishing|Amazon Digital Services]], [[GameStop]], [[Games for Windows \u2013 Live]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], [[Direct2Drive]], [[GOG.com]],  [[GamersGate]] and several more.

This process has existed since the early 1980s, but it was only with network advancements in bandwidth capabilities in the early 2000s that digital distribution became more prominent as a method of selling games. Currently, the process is dominated by [[Digital distribution|online distribution]] over [[Internet access|broadband internet]].\n\nTo facilitate the sale of games, various video game publishers and console manufacturers have created their own platforms for digital distribution. These platforms, such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], provide centralized services to purchase and download digital content for either specific [[video game console]]s or PCs. Some platforms may also serve as [[digital rights management]] systems, limiting the use of purchased items to one account.\n\nDigital distribution of video games is becoming increasingly common, with major publishers and retailers paying more attention to digital sales, including [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[PlayStation Store]], [[Amazon.com]], [[Game (retailer)|GAME]], [[GameStop]], and others. According to study conducted by SuperData Research, the volume of digital distribution of video games worldwide was $6.2 billion per month in February 2016,<ref>https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2016/03/24/february-2016-digital-sales-report-industry-reaches-6-2-billion-console-sales-34/</ref> and reached $7.7 billion per month in April 2017.<ref>https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/25/superdata-digital-gaming-hit-7-7-billion-in-april/</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===1980s===\nBefore internet connections became widespread, there were few services for digital distribution of games, and physical media was the dominant method of delivering video games. One of the first examples of digital distribution in video games was [[GameLine]], which operated during the early 1980s. The service allowed [[Atari 2600]] owners to use a specialized cartridge to connect through a [[Telephone line|phone line]] to a central server and rent a video game for 5\u201310 days. The GameLine service was terminated during the [[North American video game crash of 1983|video game crash of 1983]]. From 1987 to 2003, Nintendo's Japan-only [[Family Computer Disk System#Disk Writer and Disk Fax kiosks|Disk Writer kiosks]] allowed users to copy from a [[jukebox]] style of rotating stock of the latest games to their floppy disks. They can keep each one for an unlimited time, and play at home on the [[Famicom]] and [[Famicom Disk System]] for {{JPY|500}}, then about {{US$|3.25}} and 1/6 of the price of many new games.<ref name=\"Mysterious curiosities of the FDS\">{{cite web | title=Mysterious curiosities of the Famicom Disk System | first=Brandon | last=Dalker | date=July 8, 2011 | work=Nsidr | url=https://www.nsidr.com/archive/mysterious-curiosities-of-the-famicom-disk-system | accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Revisiting the FDS\">{{cite web | title=Revisiting the Famicom Disk System: mass storage on console in 1986 | first=John | last=Linneman | work=Eurogamer | date=July 27, 2019 | url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2019-retro-revisiting-famicom-disk-system | accessdate=July 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Game Over\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/0966961706 |title=Game Over: How Nintendo conquered the world|last=Sheff|first=David|date=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|year=|isbn=9780307800749|edition=1st Vintage books|location=New York|pages=|oclc=780180879 | accessdate=July 27, 2019}}</ref>{{rp|75\u201376}} It was called \"truly ground-breaking for its time and could be considered a forerunner of more modern distribution methods [such as] Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and Steam\".<ref name=\"Slipped Disk\">{{cite web | title=Slipped Disk - The History of the Famicom Disk System | date=November 20, 2010 | first=Damien | last=McFerran | publisher=NintendoLife | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2010/11/feature_slipped_disk_the_history_of_the_famicom_disk_system | accessdate=September 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nOnly a few digital distribution services for consoles would appear in the 90s. Among them were [[Sega]]'s [[Sega Meganet]] and [[Sega Channel]], released in 1990 and 1994 respectively, providing [[Sega Genesis]] owners with access to games on demand and other services. Nintendo released peripherals and services only in Japan: the [[Satellaview]] satellite subscription service for [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] and the [[Nintendo Power (cartridge)|Nintendo Power]] flash cartridge in-store kiosk system for Super Famicom and [[Game Boy]].\n\nOn PCs, digital distribution was more prevalent. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, prior to the widespread adoption of the internet, it was common for software developers to upload demos and [[shareware]] to [[Bulletin Board Systems]]. In most cases, demos or shareware releases would contain an advertisement for the full game with ordering instructions for a physical copy of the full game or software. Some developers instead used a licensing system where 'full versions' could be unlocked from the downloaded software with the purchase of a key, thereby making this method the first true digital distribution method for PC Software. Notable examples include the [[Software Creations BBS]] and [[ExecPC BBS]], both of which continue to exist today - albeit in a very different form. Bulletin Board systems however were not interconnected, and developers would have to upload their software to each site. Additionally, BBSs required users to place a telephone call with a [[modem]] to reach their system. For many users this meant incurring long distance charges. These factors contributed to a sharp decline in BBS usage in the early 1990s, coinciding with the rise of inexpensive internet providers.\n\nIn the mid 1990s, with the rise of the internet, early individual examples for digital distribution under usage of this new medium emerged, although there were no significant services for it. For instance, in 1997 the video game producer [[Cavedog]] regularly distributed additional content for the [[Real-time strategy]] [[computer game]] [[Total Annihilation]] as internet downloads via their website.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010330073657/http://www.cavedog.com/totala/dwnlds_frame.html TA downloadable units] on cavedog.com (archived in the [[Internet Archive]] on March 30, 2001)</ref>\n\nAlso, users used the internet to distribute their own content. Without access to the [[retail]] infrastructure that would allow them to distribute this content through physical media, [[Fan labor|user-created]] content such as game [[Mods (computer gaming)|modifications]], maps or [[fan patch]]es could only be distributed online.\n\n===2000s===\nBy this time, internet connections were fast and numerous enough such that digital distribution of games and other related content became viable.<ref name=\"newell2007\"/>\n\n====Consoles====\nThe proliferation of internet-enabled consoles allowed also additional buyable content that could be added onto full retail games, such as maps, in-game clothing, and gameplay. This type of content, called DLC ([[Downloadable content]]), become prevalent for consoles in the 2000s.\n\n====PC====\nAn early innovator of the digital distribution idea on the [[Personal computer|PC]] was [[Stardock]]. In 2001 Stardock released the [[Stardock Central]] to digitally distribute and sell its own [[Personal computer|PC]] titles, followed by a service called ''Drengin.net'' with a yearly subscription pay model in summer 2003. In 2004, the subscription model was substituted by ''TotalGaming.net'' which allowed individual purchases or pay an upfront fee for tokens which allowed them to purchase games at a discount. In 2008, Stardock announced [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]] a third-generation digital distribution platform, which included independent third-party games and major publisher titles.<ref name=\"ImpulseGoal\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamerswithjobs.com/node/1180761|title=Stardock Impulse Details|website=Gamers With Jobs}}</ref> The platform was sold to [[GameStop]] in May 2011.<ref name=\"GameStopAcquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=130125&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1544860 |title=GameStop Announces Acquisition of Spawn Labs and Agreement to Acquire Impulse, Inc. |publisher=GameStop|date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=May 2, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"JoystiqAcquisition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/31/gamestop-indulges-in-some-impulse-buying-no-seriously-it-bo/|title=GameStop indulges in some Impulse buying ... no seriously, it bought Impulse (and Spawn Labs)|author=Christopher Grant|work=[[Joystiq]]|publisher=[[AOL]]|date=March 31, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150131154411/http://www.joystiq.com/2011/03/31/gamestop-indulges-in-some-impulse-buying-no-seriously-it-bo/|archive-date=January 31, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe period between 2004 and now saw the rise of many digital distribution services on PC, such as [[Amazon.com#Amazon Publishing|Amazon Digital Services]], [[GameStop]], [[Games for Windows \u2013 Live]], [[Origin (content delivery)|Origin]], [[Direct2Drive]], [[GOG.com]],  [[GamersGate]] and several more.
