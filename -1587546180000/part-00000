[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]]. As of 2011, there were 20.8 million [[Sikhism in India|Sikhs in India]]. [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] is the spiritual home of Sikhs, and is the only state in India where Sikhs form a majority.

The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

[[Gautama Buddha]], who founded Buddhism, was born to the [[Shakya]] clan just before [[Magadha]] (which lasted from 546\u2013324 BCE) rose to power. His family was native to the plains of [[Lumbini]], in what is now southern [[Nepal]]. [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] peaked during the reign of [[Ashoka the Great]] of the [[Mauryan Empire]], who patronised Buddhism following his conversion and unified the Indian subcontinent in the 3rd century BCE. He sent missionaries abroad, allowing Buddhism to spread across Asia.<ref name=\"Heehs_2002_106\">{{harvnb|Heehs|2002|p=106}}.</ref> [[Buddhism in India|Indian Buddhism]] declined following the loss of royal patronage offered by the [[Kushan Empire]] and such kingdoms as [[Magadha]] and [[Kosala]].\n\nThe decline of Buddhism in India has been attributed to a variety of factors, which include the resurgence of Hinduism in the 10th and 11th centuries under [[Sankaracharya]], the later Turkish invasion, the Buddhist focus on renunciation as opposed to familial values and private property, Hinduism's own use and appropriation of Buddhist and Jain ideals of renunciation and [[ahimsa]], etc. Although Buddhism virtually disappeared from mainstream India by the 11th century CE, its presence remained and manifested itself through other movements such as the [[Bhakti]] tradition, Vaishnavism and the [[Baul]]s of Bengal, who are influenced by the Sahajjyana form of Buddhism that was popular in Bengal during the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] period.\n\n=== Bhakti Movement ===\nDuring the 14th\u201317th centuries, when North India was under Muslim rule, the [[Bhakti movement|'' Bhakti'' movement]] swept through Central and Northern India. The Bhakti movement actually started in the eighth-century in south India (present-day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]]), and gradually spread northwards.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|p=1}} It was initiated by a loosely associated group of teachers or saints. [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]], [[Vallabhacharya]], [[Surdas]], [[Meera Bai]], [[Kabir]], [[Tulsidas]], [[Ravidas]], [[Namdeo]], [[Eknath]], [[Ramdas]]{{dn|date=February 2020}}, [[Tukaram]] and other mystics were some of the saints in the North. They taught that people could cast aside the heavy burdens of ritual and caste and the subtle complexities of philosophy, and simply express their overwhelming love for God. This period was also characterized by an abundance of devotional literature in vernacular prose and poetry in the ethnic languages of the various Indian states or provinces. The Bhakti movement gave rise to several different movements throughout India.\n\nDuring the Bhakti movement, many Hindu groups regarded as outside the traditional Hindu caste system followed Bhakti traditions by worshipping/following saints belonging to their respective communities. For example, Guru Ravidas was a [[Chamar]] of Uttar Pradesh; Guru Parsuram Ramnami was a [[Chuhra|Chura]]{{dubious|date=April 2020}} of Chhattisgarh, and Maharishi Ram Naval was a [[Bhangi]] of Rajasthan. In their lifetimes, several of these saints even went to the extent of fighting conversion from foreign missionaries, encouraging only Hinduism within their communities. In Assam for example, tribals were led by Gurudev Kalicharan Bramha of the Brahmo Samaj; in Nagaland by Kacha Naga; and in Central India by Birsa Munda, Hanuman Aaron, Jatra Bhagat, and Budhu Bhagat.\n\n=== Sikhism ===\n{{Main|Sikhism in India}}\n[[File:Darshani_Deori_27_September_2018.jpg|thumb|Sikh pilgrims at the causeway to the sanctum of the [[Harmandir Sahib]], the holiest Sikh [[Gurdwara]]]]\n[[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]] (1469\u20131539) was the founder of [[Sikhism]].

Around 8.5 million Buddhists live in India, about 0.7% of the total population. Buddhism as a religion is practised mainly in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]] and is a significant religion in [[Sikkim]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]], [[Ladakh]], [[Darjeeling]] in [[West Bengal]] and the Lahaul and [[Spiti]] districts of [[Himachal Pradesh]]. Besides, a significant number of Buddhists reside in [[Maharashtra]]. They are the Neo-Buddhists or [[Navayana]] Buddhists who, under the influence of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] embraced Buddhism in order to escape the casteist practices within Hinduism. Ambedkar is a crucial figure, along with [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] of [[Sri Lanka]] and Kripasaran Mahasthavira of [[Chittagong]] behind the revival of Buddhism in India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The escape of the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzing Gyatso]] to India fleeing Chinese occupation of [[Tibet]] in 1959 and the setting up of the [[Tibetan Government in Exile]] at [[Dharamshala]] in [[Mcleodganj]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]] has also accelerated the resurgence of Buddhism in India. The effective religion in [[Sikkim]], which joined the Indian Union in 1975 (making it India's 22nd state) remains [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and [[Padmasambhava]] or Guru Ugyen is a revered presence there.\n\n[[Jainism]] is a non-theistic Indian religion and philosophical system originating in [[Iron Age India]]. Jains compose 0.4% (around 4.45 million) of India's population, and are concentrated in the states of [[Gujarat]], Karnataka, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]], and [[Rajasthan]].<ref name=web123/>\n\n[[Sikhism]] began in fifteenth-century [[North India]] with the teachings of [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]] and nine successive human [[Sikh Gurus|gurus]].

Hindus worldwide recognise several Indian holy cities, including [[Allahabad]] (officially known as Prayagraj), [[Haridwar]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ujjain]], [[Rameshwaram]] and [[Vrindavan]]. Notable temple cities include [[Puri]], which hosts a major [[Jagannath]] temple and [[Rath Yatra]] celebration; [[Tirumala - Tirupati]], home to the [[Tirumala Venkateswara Temple]]; and [[Katra, Jammu and Kashmir|Katra]], home to the [[Vaishno Devi]] temple.\n\n[[Badrinath]], [[Puri]], [[Dwarka]] and [[Rameswaram]] compose the main pilgrimage circuit of ''[[Char Dham]]'' (''four abodes'') hosting the four holiest [[Hindu]] temples:  [[Badrinath Temple]], [[Jagannath Temple, Puri|Jagannath Temple]], [[Dwarkadheesh temple, Gujrat|Dwarkadheesh Temple]] and [[Ramanathaswamy Temple]] respectively. The [[Himalaya]]n towns of [[Badrinath]], [[Kedarnath]], [[Gangotri]], and [[Yamunotri]] compose the smaller ''[[Chota Char Dham]]'' (''mini four abodes'') pilgrimage circuit. The [[Kumbh Mela]] (the \"pitcher festival\") is one of the holiest of Hindu pilgrimages that is held every four years; the location is rotated amongst Allahabad (Prayagraj), Haridwar, [[Nashik]], and [[Ujjain]]. The [[Swamithope pathi|Thalaimaippathi]] at [[Swamithope]] is the leading pilgrim center for the [[Ayyavazhi]]s.\n\nAmongst the [[Buddhist pilgrimage#The Eight Great Places|Eight Great Places]] of Buddhism, seven are in India. [[Bodh Gaya]], [[Sarnath]] and [[Kushinagar]] are the places where important events in the life of Gautama Buddha took place. [[Sanchi]] hosts a Buddhist [[stupa]] erected by the emperor [[Ashoka]]. Many Buddhist monasteries dot the Himalayan foothills of India, where [[Buddhism]] remains a major presence. These include the [[Rumtek Monastery]], [[Enchey Monastery]] and [[Pemayangtse Monastery]] in [[Sikkim]], the [[Tawang Monastery]] in [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Kye Monastery]] and [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Spiti]], the [[Ghum Monastery]] in [[Darjeeling]],  and [[Durpin Dara]] Monastery in Kalimpong, the [[Thikse Monastery]] in [[Leh]], the [[Namgyal Monastery]] in [[Dharamsala|Dharamshala]], among many others.\n\nFor Muslims, the ''Dargah Shareef'' of Khwaza [[Moinuddin Chishti]] in [[Ajmer]] is a major pilgrimage site. Other Islamic pilgrimages include those to the Tomb of Sheikh [[Salim Chishti]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] in Delhi, and to [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in Mumbai. [[Dilwara Temples]] in [[Mount Abu]], [[Palitana]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Girnar]] and [[Shravanabelagola]] are notable pilgrimage sites ([[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]) in Jainism.\n\nThe [[Harmandir Sahib]] in [[Amritsar]] is the most sacred [[gurdwara]] of Sikhism, while the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed House of Worship#Delhi, India|Lotus Temple]] in Delhi is a prominent house of worship of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed faith.\n\nRelatively new pilgrimage sites include the [[samadhi]] of [[Meher Baba]] in [[Meherabad]], which is visited by his followers from around the world <ref>[http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf \"In His Service: A Newsletter From Meherabad\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927073059/http://www.ambppct.org/events/inhisservice/IHS_NL_11_June.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}.

The major aspects outlined above hold true for the majority of the Hindu population, but not all. Just as each state is home to an individual language, Hinduism harbors various sub-cultures whose traditions may or may not be shared by other Indians. A sect from Gujarat called the ''Prajapatis'' for example, holds water as the sacred ornament to every meal. Before and after a meal, an individual is expected to pour water in the palms of their right hand and sip the water three times.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">R. Blake Michael \u2013 The Origins of Virasaiva Sects, 1992 \u2013 Motilal Banarsidass Pub</ref> This is often seen as a purification gesture: food is regarded as being holy and every individual must purify themselves before touching their food.\n\nOther minor sects in India carry no specific name, but they are uniquely identified by the last names of each family. This convention is used more frequently in South India than in North India. For example, a relatively prominent sect in southern India prohibits making important decisions, commencing new tasks, and doing other intellectually or spiritually engaged actions after sunset. Historians believe that this tradition was derived from the concept of [[Rahukaalam]], in which Hindus believe that a specific period of the day is inauspicious. Stringent family beliefs are thought to have led to the development of a more constrained religious hierarchy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.astrojyotish.com/rahu-kalam/|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref> Over time, this belief was extended to discourage taking major actions and even staying awake for long periods after sunset. Examples of families which follow this tradition include ''Gudivada'', ''Padalapalli'', ''Pantham'', and ''[[Kashyap]]''.<ref name=\"reference\"/>\n\n== Religion and politics ==\n{{Main|Indian Mujahideen|Jamaat-e-Islami Hind|List of organizations banned by the Government of India}}\n{{See also|Status of religious freedom in India}}\n\n[[File: Takht Shri Hazoor Sahib Gurudwara Nanded.JPG|right|250px|thumb|[[Takht Sri Hazur Sahib]], [[Nanded]], built over the place where Guru Gobind Singh Ji was cremated in 1708, the inner chamber is still called ''Angitha Sahib''.]]\n\n=== Politics ===\nReligious politics, particularly that expressed by the [[Hindutva]] movement, has strongly influenced [[Politics of India|Indian politics]] in the last quarter of the 20th century.

The British Library Archives, London.</ref>]]\n\nCommunal conflicts have periodically plagued India since it became independent in 1947. The roots of such strife lie largely in the underlying tensions between sections of its majority Hindu and minority Muslim communities, which emerged under the Raj and during the bloody [[Partition of India]]. Such conflict also stems from the competing ideologies of [[Hindu nationalism]] versus [[Islamic fundamentalism]]; both are prevalent in parts of the Hindu and Muslim populations. This issue has plagued India since before independence. The lack of education among the masses and the ease with which corrupt politicians can take advantage of the same has been attributed as the major reason for religious conflicts in India. Even though Freedom of religion is an integral part of the India constitution, the inability to hold a communal mob's accountable has limited the exercise of religious freedom in India.\n\nAlongside other major Indian independence leaders, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and his ''Shanti sainiks'' (\"peace soldiers\") worked to quell early outbreaks of religious conflict in [[Bengal]], including riots in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now in [[West Bengal]]) and [[Noakhali District]] (in modern-day Bangladesh) that accompanied [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]'s [[Direct Action Day]], which was launched on 16 August 1946. These conflicts, waged largely with rocks and knives and accompanied by widespread looting and arson, were crude affairs. Explosives and firearms, which are rarely found in India, were far less likely to be used.<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|1987|pp=45\u201346}}.</ref>\n\nMajor post-independence communal conflicts include the [[1984 Anti-Sikh riots]], which followed [[Operation Blue Star]] by the [[Indian Army]]; heavy artillery, tanks, and helicopters were employed against the [[Khalistan movement|Sikh partisans]] inside the Harmandir Sahib, causing heavy damage to Sikhism's holiest [[Gurdwara]].

{"title_page": "Volkswagen advertising", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\nThroughout its history, the German automotive company [[Volkswagen]] has applied a myriad of '''advertising''' methods.\n\n==History==\nIn 1949, [[William Bernbach]], along with colleagues, Ned Doyle and Maxwell Dane, formed [[Doyle Dane Bernbach]] (DDB), the [[Manhattan]] [[advertising agency]] that would create the revolutionary [[Volkswagen]] ad campaigns of the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nBernbach's artistic approach to print advertising was innovative, and he understood that advertising did not sell products. The strategy was to keep customers by creating and nurturing them as ''brand ambassadors'', rather than attempting to attract the attention of those who were uninterested in the product.

Unethical behavior in this business transaction can become present when the non expert opinion of such influencers takes rule over that of experts. Consumers can be driven to purchase products endorsed by internet celebrities due to their extensive content and outreach which an expert such as a dermatologist, for example, does not have. A highly unethical conflict would arise as an influencer recommends the use of a product that they do not use or give their fraudulent opinion on, while receiving a monetary gain.[https://zoovu.com/blog/impact-of-celebrity-endorsement-on-consumer-buying-behavior/]\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Celebrity culture]]\n* [[List of Internet phenomena]]\n* [[Usenet celebrity]]\n* [[Internet activism]]\n* [[Socialite]]\n* [[Celebrity philanthropy]]\n* [[Charity dating]]\n* [[Role model]]\n* [[Vlogger]]\n* [[Comedian]]\n* [[Conspicuous leisure]]\n* [[Conspicuous consumption]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web | last=Feuer | first=Alan | last2=George | first2=Jason | title=Internet Fame Is Cruel Mistress for a Dancer of the Numa Numa | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=2005-02-26 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/nyregion/internet-fame-is-cruel-mistress-for-a-dancer-of-the-numa-numa.html | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n* {{cite web | title=The Dark Side of Web Fame | website=[[Newsweek]] | date=2010-03-13 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/dark-side-web-fame-93505 | ref={{sfnref | Newsweek | 2010}} | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090414035110/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rise_of_an_internet_star_parla.php \"Rise of an Internet Star - Parlaying YouTube Fame Into Big Business\"] at [[ReadWriteWeb]]\n* {{cite web | last=Tanz | first=Jason | title=Internet Famous: Julia Allison and the Secrets of Self-Promotion | website=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] | date=2008-07-15 | url=https://www.wired.com/2008/07/howto-allison/ | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}} {{see also|Julia Allison}}\n* {{cite web | last=Sorgatz | first=Rex | title=The Microfame Game | website=[[New York (magazine)|NYMag.com]] | date=2008-06-17 | url=https://nymag.com/news/media/47958/ | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Internet Celebrity}}\n[[Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats]]\n[[Category:Celebrity]]\n[[Category:Internet celebrities| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Someone who has become famous by means of the Internet}}\n{{redirect2|Key opinion leader|Influencer|the sociological phenomenon|Opinion leadership|Nogizaka46 single|Influencer (song)}}\nAn '''Internet celebrity''' (also known as a '''social media influencer''') is a [[celebrity]] who has acquired or developed their fame and [[notability]] through the [[Internet]].

Unethical behavior in this business transaction can become present when the non expert opinion of such influencers takes rule over that of experts. Consumers can be driven to purchase products endorsed by internet celebrities due to their extensive content and outreach which an expert such as a dermatologist, for example, does not have. A highly unethical conflict would arise as an influencer recommends the use of a product that they do not use or give their fraudulent opinion on, while receiving a monetary gain.[https://zoovu.com/blog/impact-of-celebrity-endorsement-on-consumer-buying-behavior/]\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Celebrity culture]]\n* [[List of Internet phenomena]]\n* [[Usenet celebrity]]\n* [[Internet activism]]\n* [[Socialite]]\n* [[Celebrity philanthropy]]\n* [[Charity dating]]\n* [[Role model]]\n* [[Vlogger]]\n* [[Comedian]]\n* [[Conspicuous leisure]]\n* [[Conspicuous consumption]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite web | last=Feuer | first=Alan | last2=George | first2=Jason | title=Internet Fame Is Cruel Mistress for a Dancer of the Numa Numa | website=[[The New York Times]] | date=2005-02-26 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/26/nyregion/internet-fame-is-cruel-mistress-for-a-dancer-of-the-numa-numa.html | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n* {{cite web | title=The Dark Side of Web Fame | website=[[Newsweek]] | date=2010-03-13 | url=http://www.newsweek.com/dark-side-web-fame-93505 | ref={{sfnref | Newsweek | 2010}} | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090414035110/http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/rise_of_an_internet_star_parla.php \"Rise of an Internet Star - Parlaying YouTube Fame Into Big Business\"] at [[ReadWriteWeb]]\n* {{cite web | last=Tanz | first=Jason | title=Internet Famous: Julia Allison and the Secrets of Self-Promotion | website=[[Wired (magazine)|WIRED]] | date=2008-07-15 | url=https://www.wired.com/2008/07/howto-allison/ | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}} {{see also|Julia Allison}}\n* {{cite web | last=Sorgatz | first=Rex | title=The Microfame Game | website=[[New York (magazine)|NYMag.com]] | date=2008-06-17 | url=https://nymag.com/news/media/47958/ | ref=harv | access-date=2018-01-11}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Internet Celebrity}}\n[[Category:Articles with inconsistent citation formats]]\n[[Category:Celebrity]]\n[[Category:Internet celebrities| ]]\n", "name_user": "2601:205:c200:1030:e99b:fb47:93c1:fa0b", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_celebrity"}
