In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.  At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department.  The occupation was ended by agreement after seven hours.\n\nFormer U-M student and noted architect [[Alden B. Dow]] designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety. But the Fleming Building's fortress-like narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and lack of exterior detail at ground level, led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof.

In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968, following the assassination of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff.

The plot, rich in the mix of murder and action, is set in modern and near-future Tokyo, and revolves around Rin Asougi, an [[immortality|immortal]] [[private investigator]]. A [[light novel]] and a [[manga]] adaptation have also been published.\n\n==Plot==\nA mysterious tree known as [[Yggdrasil]] would often appear in the world of the humans, releasing many small orbs into the human world. A small proportion of the orbs are special ones known as \"Time Fruits\". If a Time Fruit enters a female, she becomes Immortal. If a Time Fruit enters a male, he becomes a crazed winged being known as an \"Angel\". Rin Asougi is an immortal who runs a private investigation agency in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku]] district alongside her assistant, Mimi who is also immortal. Rin often converses with a mysterious unknown individual on the phone. She is often being hunted down by an assassin named Laura who was hired by Apos, an angel who persecutes immortals and is the current guardian of the Yggdrasil.\n\nThe story begins in the year 1990. During a search for a missing cat, Rin instead finds Koki Maeno, a young man with distorted memories. As she investigates his past, she discovers that he is a clone created by Sayara Yamanobe, a woman searching for immortality. After discovering this, Koki decides to work for Rin in her agency. In 2011, Koki marries a former client, Yuki. Sayara Yamanobe returns, kidnaps Rin and attempts to attack Japan with biological weapons. Koki, after becoming an Angel, sacrifices himself to save Rin and Japan. In 2025, Rin ends up investigating a case involving Koki's son, Teruki, after he meets his long-term cyber girlfriend in reality. Rin manages to save Teruki; however, she ends up sacrificing herself.\n\nIn the year 2055, Rin has lost her memory and goes by the name Tamaki Saito. She had fallen in love with a mortal man named Ihika. However, she regains her memories when Laura discovers she's alive and attempts to kill her. After Apos kidnaps Rin, Mimi and Teruki's daughter Mishio travel to Apos' castle to save her. Rin is locked in a room with an angel and kills him, later discovering him to be Ihika. It is revealed that the unknown man on the phone was Tajimamori, Rin's savior from a thousand years earlier, a former guardian of the Yggdrasil, and Apos' father. After impregnating Rin, he is killed by Apos, who is himself locked away in the roots of the Yggdrasil. Later, Rin gives birth to a baby boy, who will one day become the tree's new guardian.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Mnemosyne characters.jpg|thumb|200px|Main characters of ''Mnemosyne'': Mimi (left) and Rin (right)]]\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Rin Asougi}}|\u9ebb\u751f\u7947 \u71d0|As\u014dgi Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"jp cast\">{{cite web | url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html | title=XEBEC - \u30e0\u30cd\u30e2\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u306e\u5a18\u305f\u3061 - \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5 & \u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 | trans-title=Xebec \u2013 Daughters of Mnemosyne \u2013 Cast | publisher=[[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]] | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=June 30, 2015 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113064017/http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html | archive-date=January 13, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The [[protagonist]] of the series.

She usually wears a black suit and glasses. Her whimsical personality serves as a front for a cunning, ruthless mind and extraordinary martial art skills. She always keeps a number of throwing blades and a [[garrote]] wire concealed on her body. At some point in the past, a \"Fruit of Time\" (also known as a \"time fruit\") entered Rin's body, effectively making her immortal, unable to age, and capable of surviving and [[regeneration (biology)|regenerating]] from a phenomenal amount of bodily damage. In episode four, she is sucked inside a running [[jet engine]] and regenerates her entire body over 25 years, albeit at the cost of [[retrograde amnesia|all her memories]] (they return when she is briefly killed by Laura). In episode five, Apos removes Rin's time fruit, seemingly killing her just like Sayara and Maeno before, but it is revealed in episode six that an immortal's death is not permanent as long as her time fruit remains intact. Rin's time fruit is then brought to Apos' castle, where its proximity to [[Yggdrasil]], the fabled source of all time fruits, speeds up her revival, which would have normally taken many decades.

Mimi has a bright personality and is fond of [[alcoholic drinks]] despite having the appearance of someone in her teens.<ref name=\"design01\"/> Her job scope includes [[Managerial finance|financial management]], [[information processing]], and other miscellaneous tasks. She cares for Rin very much and would do anything to ensure her safety, even while nagging her to do the job properly. She feels indebted to Rin as Rin saved her from being devoured by an angel during their first encounter and has been protecting her ever since. She is a formidable [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] but is outmatched by Katsuyuki Kamiyama in episode four. After Rin disappears in episode four, she leaves with Genta and becomes a [[Bhikkhuni|Buddhist nun]]. In episode six, believing there still being a chance that Rin is still alive, Mimi constantly displays her resolve in rescuing Rin from Apos' sadistic scheme.\n\n===Maeno family===\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Kouki Maeno|Koki Maeno}}|\u524d\u57dc \u5149\u8f1d|Maeno K\u014dki}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Nobuyuki Hiyama]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Robert McCollum]]<ref name=\"btva\">{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/rin-daughters-of-mnemosyne/side-by-side/|title=RIN: Daughters of Mnemosyne Cast|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors|accessdate=July 14, 2016}}</ref>}}\n:A young man with distorted memory whom Rin accidentally saves in episode one. He is, in fact, a clone created by Aoyama Pharmaceutical company. The original Koki Maeno died during an experiment that involved his [[vivisection]]. His memory lacks realism, as it is actually the memory of the original Koki written into the clone's brain by artificial means. After discovering the truth, he chooses to keep on living and starts working at Asougi Consulting, where he spends the next twenty-one years. Some time between episodes two and three, he marries Yuki Shimazaki and has a son named Teruki with her.\n:In episode three, he is shot by Sayara while rescuing Rin, and has to consume Shogo Shimazaki's time fruit in order to survive as an angel. After saving Rin and having one last tender moment with her, he returns to consume Sayara, but is killed (unlike that of immortals, the death of an angel is permanent regardless the time fruit) by Apos before he can finish. Koki's time fruit is lost in the sea but is inexplicably found by Rin while she regenerates in the ocean between episodes four and five. His granddaughter Mishio acquires it after Rin's body is destroyed in episode five, unwittingly brings it to Apos' castle in episode six, and passes it to Rin as the latter is consumed by Yggdrasil. Koki's spirit then helps Rin to break free.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Yuki Maeno}}|\u524d\u57dc \u6709\u7d00|Maeno Yuki}} <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">[[n\u00e9e]]</span> {{Nihongo|Shimazaki|\u5cf6\u5d0e|Shimazaki}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Yoshino Takamori]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Cherami Leigh]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:Koki's wife, whom he meets in episode two. During Koki's involvement in the case of her brother Shogo, the two grow fond of each other and marry some time between episodes two and three. In episode three, they have a son named Teruki. After Koki's death, Yuki continued to raise Teruki alone.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Shougo Shimazaki}}|\u5cf6\u5d0e \u7701\u543e|Shimazaki Sh\u014dgo}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hideo Ishikawa]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Ian Sinclair (voice actor)|Ian Sinclair]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:Yuki's older brother, who becomes an angel prior to episode two. Although most angels succumb to their primal desires quickly, Shogo's exceptional willpower allows him to retain consciousness for a very long time, which he uses to exact revenge upon people who previously maltreated him. After he finally loses his consciousness and attacks Rin, she has to kill him by impaling him with a tree branch. Apos expresses desire to obtain Shogo's time fruit but Rin instead gives it to Maeno, who eventually uses it to become an angel himself, saving Rin from Sayara. After Maeno is killed by Apos, his time fruit falls into the ocean and is lost until episode five.\n;{{Nihongo|Teruki Maeno|\u524d\u57dc \u8f1d\u7d00|Maeno Teruki}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Emiri Kat\u014d]] (Child), [[Daisuke Hirakawa]] (Adult)|[[Brina Palencia]] (Young),<ref name=\"btva\"/> [[Chris Burnett (actor)|Patrick W.

Some time between episodes three and four, Rin saves his life in a car accident, and he states that he has felt watched over and protected by her ever since. Their formal introduction takes place in episode four, when Tamotsu brings him to Asougi Consulting due to his involvement in the Ruon case. He appears again in episode five, now the CEO of Maeno Holding Group company, with a teenage daughter named Mishio.\n;{{Nihongo|Mishio Maeno|\u524d\u57dc \u7f8e\u6c50|Maeno Mishio}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Kaori Nazuka]]|[[Luci Christian]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:Teruki Maeno's only daughter and Koki's granddaughter, first appearing as a teenager in episode five. Finding Teruki's old video of Rin, she starts investigating her, frequently comparing herself to [[Sherlock Holmes]]. Upon the first meeting, they quickly grow fond of each other, and Mishio sticks with Rin and Mimi for the rest of the series. In episode six, Rin explains that Mishio is the youngest of Tajimamori's descendants.\n\n===Antagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Apos}}|\u30a8\u30a4\u30dd\u30b9|Eiposu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Akira Ishida]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Todd Haberkorn]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The primary antagonist of the series. As revealed in episode five, Apos is a [[hermaphrodite]], or more properly an [[intersex]] person, possessing qualities of both an angel and an immortal, which, according to him, makes him a \"[[god]]\". He seems to have no concept of human [[morals]] but instead, has a sadistic sense of amusement and beauty. In the early episodes, Apos demonstrates interest in Rin, to the point that he hires mortal killers to target her. In episode three, he reveals that he is after Rin's time fruit. Apparently, time fruits contain the immortals' memories and Apos enjoys consuming them. It is also revealed that he has the ability to instantly remove the fruits from both immortals and angels (thus killing them). Anyone else wishing to kill an immortal must physically dig through their victim's flesh for the time fruit. In episode six, Apos is revealed to be the child of Tajimamori, the previous Guardian of Yggdrasil, and the current Guardian himself. Guardians are supposed to switch every once in a (long) while, but Apos desires to become a permanent guardian by sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Laura}}|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Clarine Harp]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:An assassin skilled with firearms and other weapons who is repeatedly sent to assassinate Rin by Apos. Although Rin kills Laura in most of the engagements, Apos resurrects her so that she can attack Rin again. In episode four, she becomes a [[cyborg]], though the extent of her transformation is left open. Episode five reveals that Laura is in possession of an android body designed to resemble Rin and telepathically linked to Apos' torture victim, and she further elaborates in episode six that only her brain remains immortal, apparently as the result of Apos' sadistic manipulations. Rin extracts the Fruit of Time from there and feeds it into Apos at Laura's own request so that he would feel her memory and pain.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Sayara Yamanobe}}|\u5c71\u4e4b\u8fba \u6c99\u8036\u7f85|Yamanobe Sayara}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rie Tanaka]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The head of the Aoyama Pharmaceutical research lab in [[Sayama]]. Originally researching [[bacteria]], she discovered one that could be the key to [[cloning]], moving on to conduct illegal cloning experiments aiming to achieve [[immortality]]. She has a [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] personality, often torturing her captives to death. In episode one, Sayara is last seen being surrounded by the delirious zombies she created. In episode three, she is revealed to have been saved by Apos in the last moment, who injects her with a time fruit after her body is already considerably mutilated. As a result, she remains forever crippled and waits twenty-one years until a [[powered exoskeleton]] capable of supporting her is invented. After one last confrontation with Rin and Maeno, she is finally killed by Apos, who removes and consumes her time fruit.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ruon Kamiyama}}|\u795e\u5c71 \u7460\u97f3|Kamiyama Ruon}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hitomi Nabatame]]|[[Tia Ballard]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The antagonist in episode four. The daughter of the \"modern [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]\" Katsuyuki Kamiyama, Ruon's consciousness was removed from her body by Katsuyuki and uploaded onto the net (2.0) as an [[artificial intelligence]], effectively killing her in real life (1.0). Katsuyuki implies that this event was the cause of Great Network Crisis of 2020. Ruon spends five years posing as an online [[sex doll]] until she becomes infatuated with Teruki because he is the first person to want to meet her offline. Following the events of the episode, her physical ([[Android (robot)|android]]) form is destroyed through an airplane jet engine.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tamotsu Yanagisawa}}|\u67f3\u6ca2 \u4fdd|Yanagisawa Tamotsu}}<ref name=\"design03\"/>\n:{{anime voices|[[Yasunori Matsumoto]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Christopher Bevins]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:A police investigator and a close acquaintance of Rin, first introduced in episode one.

The first informant is introduced in episode two and is mentioned to have died prior to episode four. The second informant is introduced as an assistant of the first one in episode three and inherits her position in the next episode. In return for their services, both demand sex with either Rin or Mimi. Mimi is extremely uncomfortable and unnerved by this at first but seems to have entered into some sort of relationship with the second informant by episode four. In episode six, the second informant is apparently dead as well, replaced by a third one, with whom Mimi keeps a strictly professional relationship. In episode 3 during their search for information on Rin, Koki Maeno was forced to watch the informants have sex with Mimi or else no information would be given.

He proposes to her twice in the episode but is killed by Laura soon after Rin accepts his second proposal. In episode six, Ihika is revived by Apos in his castle as an angel and chained next to Rin to torment her. Rin, seeing him in a berserk frenzy and about to break free, is then forced to kill him in self-defense, realizing his identity only as he turns into ashes.

He is seen talking to Rin on the phone throughout the series, often in an intimate or fatherly manner. In episode six, it is revealed that he and Rin fell in love with each other over a thousand years ago, but he chose to distance himself from her. He is also revealed to be the progenitor of the Maeno line which tied all his descendants' fate to Rin's.

Attracted by the explosion, he finds Rin's mutilated body and is visibly shaken by witnessing her regenerate. Later, Mimi explains to him that both Rin and herself are immortal because of the \"time fruit\" inside their bodies. She claims to not even remember how long the two of them have been immortal. In the meantime, several people including Rin's client are murdered and before long, she confirms that Yuki's brother turned into an \"angel\" due to contact with time fruit and committed the recent murders as acts of revenge. She also reveals that angels are natural enemies of immortal women like herself: in their presence, immortals are overcome with lust and angels use that time to devour them. Rin then deduces who Sh\u014dgo's final victim would be and confronts him only to seemingly give in to sexual desire. As the angel starts feasting on her, she manages to kill him.

She soon discovers that the girl displayed the same symptoms as subjects of a biological weapon \"Higan\", once tested on the so-called \"Death Island\". The Island has been officially demolished and Tamotsu Yanagihara, a police officer and Rin's friend, confirms that its former residents were among the victims of each recent bombing in Tokyo. Soon after that, Rin is captured and brought to Death Island. Mimi decides to visit Rin's informant (whose name is never mentioned in the series) who demands sex with her in return for information on Rin's whereabouts. She informs them that the group behind the bombings and Rin's capture is called \"Kudoru\" ({{lang-ja|italic=yes|Evil}}). Meanwhile on the Island, Rin discovers that Sayara Yamanobe survived as an immortal but has to rely on a powered exoskeleton to move. Surviving a [[vivisection]], Rin escapes but is chased and killed again. Sayara explains her plan to exterminate humans with Higan, leaving only immortals on Earth. She claims that without humans, the Earth will no longer suffer from overpopulation and environmental pollution, leaving it a paradise for immortals. Koki arrives on a helicopter to free Rin but is fatally shot by Sayara. With his last strength, he consumes Sh\u014dgo's time fruit and turns into an angel. He carries Rin away from the ship to safety, thanking her for his life and kissing her goodbye. He then returns to devour Sayara but Apos arrives to remove both their time fruits, killing them instantly. The next day, Rin and Mimi are in their office, both mourning Koki's death.

Mimi explains that Ruon is actually an [[artificial intelligence|AI]] created by Katsuyuki Kamiyama, a modern [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]. Rin takes Teruki for a walk but they are attacked by Laura, now a cyborg, who mutilates Rin considerably. Teruki is shaken by the sight of Rin regenerating and suffers a brief nervous breakdown after she reveals the truth about time fruits and immortals to him. Mimi and Tamotsu discover that Ruon was created during \"Project [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam|L'Isle-Adam]]\", based on Kamiyama's daughter whom he killed. Ruon calls to invite Teruki to 2.0 but they are attacked by Kamiyama and Mimi severs the connection. Immediately thereafter, commandos attack the office forcing them to flee. En route, Mimi explains that Ruon might have been an attempt to create \"[[The Future Eve]]\". The military attacks again and Teruki is taken away. Back in the office, Rin and Mimi realize that the girl Teruki met in 1.0 was an [[Android (robot)|android]] with Ruon's AI. Tamotsu calls to tell the flight number that Teruki is on but is fatally shot by a sniper. Rin boards the plane as it takes off, only to find Kamiyama shot by android Ruon. Ruon is revealed to have manipulated the military to get Teruki, the only person she cares about. Rin pushes Teruki out of the plane with a parachute and after a brief fight, she and Ruon fall out of the plane and into its jet engine together. Some time later, Teruki finds that Rin's office was demolished. Mimi is shown bringing flowers to where Tamotsu was shot. Rin's fate is uncertain.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Holy Nights Don't Shine Brightly\n| AltTitle        = Seiya wa Kagayakanai\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u8056\u591c\u306f\u8f1d\u304b\u306a\u3044}})\n| Aux1            = 2055<ref name=\"xebec_ep5\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode05.html|title=''Mnemosyne'' - Episode 5 synopsis|publisher=[[Sunrise Beyond|Xebec]]|language=Japanese|date=2008-05-19|accessdate=2008-05-22|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66pNCttC9?url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode05.html|archive-date=2012-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|6|1}}\n| ShortSummary    = Thirty years after episode four, the borders between 1.0 and 2.0 have been erased completely and it is now possible to \"download\" things into the real world. Rin took 25 years to regenerate her body and suffered [[retrograde amnesia]] in process. Teruki became a successful businessman and Mimi, a Buddhist nun. Meanwhile, Apos had disguised Laura as Rin and made her hunt immortals for their time fruits. The episode begins with Teruki's daughter Mishio discovering his records of Rin and by chance, meeting her amnesiac self. Rin is working for a company whose CEO is an immortal who is soon killed by Laura. Mishio finds her body, and thinking that her killer was Rin, starts following her around. She witnesses a man named Ihika propose to Rin, which she refuses, telling him of her amnesia. After Mishio asks Teruki about Rin, he finds her but decides that it's better for her painful memories not to return and avoids contact. He then finds Mimi who tells him that Rin is apparently hunting immortals. Meanwhile, Rin accepts Ihika's new proposal and the two are about to have sex, when Laura attacks and kills them both. This returns Rin's memories and she escapes with Mishio to Teruki's estate. After a conversation with him, Rin and Mishio take a train to [[Kyoto]], where Mimi's temple is located.  Anticipating Laura's attack, Mimi invites three other immortals but Laura  brings along several angels who proceed to devour them. Rin arrives and defeats Laura and the angels, only to witness Mimi raped by Apos. Apos is then revealed to be an immortal angel hybrid and removes Rin's time fruit, presumably killing her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = And Then, to the Door of the Kingdom...\n| AltTitle        = Soshite \u014ckoku no Tobira e to...\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u305d\u3057\u3066\u738b\u56fd\u306e\u6249\u3078\u3068......}})\n| Aux1            = 2055\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|7|6}}<ref name=\"xebec_ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode06.html|title=''Mnemosyne'' - Episode 6 synopsis|publisher=[[Sunrise Beyond|Xebec]]|language=Japanese|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-06-19|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66pNDRkay?url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode06.html|archive-date=2012-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Shortly after the end of episode five, Rin wakes up in Apos' castle at the foot of [[Yggdrasil]], the mythical tree that generates time fruits, since Apos let her regenerate instead of consuming her time fruit. She is then locked in a room with a masked angel and kills him, only to discover that it was Ihika. Meanwhile, Mimi and Mishio desperately search for Rin and learn the location of Apos' castle from the informant. Tajimamori, former Guardian of Yggdrasil, invites them to his castle, explains that his son Apos aims to become the new eternal Guardian by sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, and opens a portal to Apos' castle for them. There, Rin is losing the battle against Laura but Apos double-crosses the assassin and Rin escapes. In retaliation, Laura teams up with Mimi and Mishio and leads them to Yggdrasil. Rin is already there and meets Tajimamori, her millennia-old love. They have sex until Apos arrives, kills his father, and pushes Rin into Yggdrasil. Mishio tries pulling Rin out and fails but Rin manages to grab Koki's time fruit (that Rin found in the sea after episode four and Mishio unwittingly brought to the castle) from her necklace. As Yggdrasil tries to merge with her, Rin consumes Koki's time fruit and his spirit helps her to break free. Mishio, revealed to be Tajimamori's descendant like all Maenos, pulls Rin out and back to the castle. Apos attacks them but Rin, now the new Guardian of Yggdrasil, pushes Apos into it himself. Before he is consumed, she feeds Tajimamori and Laura's time fruits to him.\n\nIn the epilogue, Rin gives birth to Tajimamori's son and continues living in Apos' castle with Mimi and Mishio. Her closing narration reveals that their son is linked to the Yggdrasil and this link will spread throughout mankind with his descendants.\n}}\n|}\n\n== Reception == \nZac Bertschy from [[Anime News Network]] regards ''Mnemosyne'' as a \"totally edgy anime for adults\" that he felt \"like halfway-decent dark erotica\" that presents some unique ideas for the plot. He acknowledges that \"it's difficult to honestly care about any of these characters\" but its confusing and yet compelling aspects grasp the audience's attention. He criticized the amount of violence and sex that resulted in exhaustion and unpleasantness that led to \"the whole trashy appeal\". In conclusion, this is a series that should not be taken seriously and recommended it to those who are looking for \"fun, weird, entertaining sleaze without a hint of irony or cutesiness\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rin/daughters-of-mnemosyne/dvd|title=Rin: ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~ DVD - Review|last=Bertschy |first=Zac|date=January 20, 2010|website=[[Anime News Network]]|language=en|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> Others differ from Bertschy's interpretation. Tom Tonthat argues that ''Mnemosyne'' features animation which is memorable and tells a good story, with mundane cases spiraling into sinister plots that endanger humanity itself, but is also a clearly adult series due to the level of nudity and sex.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/anime/7068-Anime-Review-RIN-Daughters-of-Mnemosyne|title=Anime Review: RIN ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~|last=Tonthat |first=Tom|date=January 25, 2010|website=The Escapist|language=en|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> He adds that while the anime series is an \"erotic thriller\" it has high production values with some beautifully animated and well-choreographed fights between characters. This is coupled with an engaging story and each episode representing a year of the timeline between 1990 to 2055, including different technological developments which either change characters or the plot. He ends the review by stating that this anime does a good job of telling a story, a \"guilty pleasure anime\" for which you should give much thought to the \"blood smoothie or angel sex,\" concluding it is a form of \"supernatural film noir\" worth a look at, although hindered by the \"heavy use of shocking sex and violence.\"\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed ''Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne'' among 38 anime and manga titles banned in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2015/06/12/china-bans-38-japanese-anime-manga-titles-including-attack-titan |title=China bans 38 anime & manga titles including ''Attack on Titan'' |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=2015-06-12 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|45em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.funimation.com/rin-daughters-of-mnemosyne Funimation's official ''Rin ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~'' website]\n*[http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/ Xebec's official ''Mnemosyne'' website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530011756/http://www.comic-valkyrie.com/main/contents/mnemosyne.htm Comic Valkyrie's official ''Mnemosyne'' manga website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|anime|8931|Mnemosyne}}\n* {{IMDb title|1196027|Mnemosyne}}\n\n{{Xebec}}\n\n[[Category:2008 Japanese television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:2008 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:2008 manga]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Censored television series]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:HJ Bunko]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related television shows]]\n[[Category:LGBT in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Neo-noir]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Supernatural anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Television censorship in China]]\n[[Category:Yuri (genre) anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Yuri (genre) light novels]]\n[[Category:Xebec (studio)]]\n[[Category:IG Port franchises]]\n[[Category:Works banned in China]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Mnemosyne\n| image           = Mnemosyne logo.jpg\n| caption         = \n| ja_kanji        = \u30e0\u30cd\u30e2\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u306e\u5a18\u305f\u3061\n| ja_romaji       = Munemoshune no Musumetachi\n| genre           = [[Action genre|Action]], [[science fiction]], [[supernatural fiction|supernatural]]<ref name=\"ANN_license\"/><!-- Genres should be based on what reliable sources list them as and not on personal interpretations.

The plot, rich in the mix of murder and action, is set in modern and near-future Tokyo, and revolves around Rin Asougi, an [[immortality|immortal]] female [[private investigator]]. A [[light novel]] and a [[manga]] adaptation have also been published.\n\n==Plot==\nA mysterious tree known as [[Yggdrasil]] would often appear in the world of the humans, releasing many small orbs into the human world. A small proportion of the orbs are special ones known as \"Time Fruits\". If a Time Fruit enters a female, she becomes Immortal. If a Time Fruit enters a male, he becomes a crazed winged being known as an \"Angel\". Rin Asougi is an immortal who runs a private investigation agency in Tokyo's [[Shinjuku]] district alongside her assistant, Mimi who is also immortal. Rin often converses with a mysterious unknown individual on the phone. She is often being hunted down by an assassin named Laura who was hired by Apos, an angel who persecutes immortals and is the current guardian of the Yggdrasil.\n\nThe story begins in the year 1990. During a search for a missing cat, Rin instead finds Koki Maeno, a young man with distorted memories. As she investigates his past, she discovers that he is a clone created by Sayara Yamanobe, a woman searching for immortality. After discovering this, Koki decides to work for Rin in her agency. In 2011, Koki marries a former client, Yuki. Sayara Yamanobe returns, kidnaps Rin and attempts to attack Japan with biological weapons. Koki, after becoming an Angel, sacrifices himself to save Rin and Japan. In 2025, Rin ends up investigating a case involving Koki's son, Teruki, after he meets his long-term cyber girlfriend in reality. Rin manages to save Teruki; however, she ends up sacrificing herself.\n\nIn the year 2055, Rin has lost her memory and goes by the name Tamaki Saito. She had fallen in love with a mortal man named Ihika. However, she regains her memories when Laura discovers she's alive and attempts to kill her. After Apos kidnaps Rin, Mimi and Teruki's daughter Mishio travel to Apos' castle to save her. Rin is locked in a room with an angel and kills him, later discovering him to be Ihika. It is revealed that the unknown man on the phone was Tajimamori, Rin's savior from a thousand years earlier, a former guardian of the Yggdrasil, and Apos' father. After impregnating Rin, he is killed by Apos, who is himself locked away in the roots of the Yggdrasil. Later, Rin gives birth to a baby boy, who will one day become the tree's new guardian.\n\n==Characters==\n===Main characters===\n[[File:Mnemosyne characters.jpg|thumb|200px|Main characters of ''Mnemosyne'': Mimi (left) and Rin (right)]]\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Rin Asougi}}|\u9ebb\u751f\u7947 \u71d0|As\u014dgi Rin}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Mamiko Noto]]<ref name=\"jp cast\">{{cite web | url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html | title=XEBEC - \u30e0\u30cd\u30e2\u30b7\u30e5\u30cd\u306e\u5a18\u305f\u3061 - \u30b9\u30bf\u30c3\u30d5 & \u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8 | trans-title=Xebec \u2013 Daughters of Mnemosyne \u2013 Cast | publisher=[[Xebec (studio)|Xebec]] | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=June 30, 2015 | language=Japanese | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113064017/http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/staff.html | archive-date=January 13, 2018 | url-status=dead }}</ref>|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The [[protagonist]] of the series.

She usually wears a black suit and glasses. Her whimsical personality serves as a front for a cunning, ruthless mind and extraordinary martial art skills. She always keeps a number of throwing blades and a [[garrote]] wire concealed on her body. At some point in the past, a \"Fruit of Time\" (also known as a \"time fruit\") entered Rin's body, effectively making her immortal, unable to age, and capable of surviving and [[regeneration (biology)|regenerating]] from a phenomenal amount of bodily damage. In episode four, she is sucked inside a running [[jet engine]] and regenerates her entire body over 25 years, albeit at the cost of [[retrograde amnesia|all her memories]] (they return when she is briefly killed by Laura). In episode five, Apos removes Rin's time fruit, seemingly killing her just like Sayara and Maeno before, but it is revealed in episode six that an immortal's death is not permanent as long as her time fruit remains intact. Rin's time fruit is then brought to Apos' castle, where its proximity to [[Yggdrasil]], the fabled source of all time fruits, speeds up her revival, which would have normally taken many decades.

He is, in fact, a clone created by Aoyama Pharmaceutical company. The original Koki Maeno died during an experiment that involved his [[vivisection]]. His memory lacks realism, as it is actually the memory of the original Koki written into the clone's brain by artificial means. After discovering the truth, he chooses to keep on living and starts working at Asougi Consulting, where he spends the next twenty-one years. Some time between episodes two and three, he marries Yuki Shimazaki and has a son named Teruki with her.\n:In episode three, he is shot by Sayara while rescuing Rin, and has to consume Shogo Shimazaki's time fruit in order to survive as an angel. After saving Rin and having one last tender moment with her, he returns to consume Sayara, but is killed (unlike that of immortals, the death of an angel is permanent regardless the time fruit) by Apos before he can finish. Koki's time fruit is lost in the sea but is inexplicably found by Rin while she regenerates in the ocean between episodes four and five. His granddaughter Mishio acquires it after Rin's body is destroyed in episode five, unwittingly brings it to Apos' castle in episode six, and passes it to Rin as the latter is consumed by Yggdrasil.

Upon the first meeting, they quickly grow fond of each other, and Mishio sticks with Rin and Mimi for the rest of the series. In episode six, Rin explains that Mishio is the youngest of Tajimamori's descendants.\n\n===Antagonists===\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Apos}}|\u30a8\u30a4\u30dd\u30b9|Eiposu}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Akira Ishida]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Todd Haberkorn]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The primary antagonist of the series. As revealed in episode five, Apos is a [[hermaphrodite]], or more properly an [[intersex]] person, possessing qualities of both an angel and an immortal, which, according to him, makes him a \"[[god]]\". He seems to have no concept of human [[morals]] but instead, has a sadistic sense of amusement and beauty. In the early episodes, Apos demonstrates interest in Rin, to the point that he hires mortal killers to target her. In episode three, he reveals that he is after Rin's time fruit. Apparently, time fruits contain the immortals' memories and Apos enjoys consuming them. It is also revealed that he has the ability to instantly remove the fruits from both immortals and angels (thus killing them). Anyone else wishing to kill an immortal must physically dig through their victim's flesh for the time fruit. In episode six, Apos is revealed to be the child of Tajimamori, the previous Guardian of Yggdrasil, and the current Guardian himself. Guardians are supposed to switch every once in a (long) while, but Apos desires to become a permanent guardian by sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Laura}}|\u30ed\u30fc\u30e9|R\u014dra}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Sayaka Ohara]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Clarine Harp]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:An assassin skilled with firearms and other weapons who is repeatedly sent to assassinate Rin by Apos. Although Rin kills Laura in most of the engagements, Apos resurrects her so that she can attack Rin again. In episode four, she becomes a [[cyborg]], though the extent of her transformation is left open. Episode five reveals that Laura is in possession of an android body designed to resemble Rin and telepathically linked to Apos' torture victim, and she further elaborates in episode six that only her brain remains immortal, apparently as the result of Apos' sadistic manipulations. Rin extracts the Fruit of Time from there and feeds it into Apos at Laura's own request so that he would feel her memory and pain.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Sayara Yamanobe}}|\u5c71\u4e4b\u8fba \u6c99\u8036\u7f85|Yamanobe Sayara}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Rie Tanaka]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Monica Rial]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The head of the Aoyama Pharmaceutical research lab in [[Sayama]]. Originally researching [[bacteria]], she discovered one that could be the key to [[cloning]], moving on to conduct illegal cloning experiments aiming to achieve [[immortality]]. She has a [[Sadomasochism|sadistic]] personality, often torturing her captives to death. In episode one, Sayara is last seen being surrounded by the delirious zombies she created. In episode three, she is revealed to have been saved by Apos in the last moment, who injects her with a time fruit after her body is already considerably mutilated. As a result, she remains forever crippled and waits twenty-one years until a [[powered exoskeleton]] capable of supporting her is invented. After one last confrontation with Rin and Maeno, she is finally killed by Apos, who removes and consumes her time fruit.\n;{{Nihongo|{{vanchor|Ruon Kamiyama}}|\u795e\u5c71 \u7460\u97f3|Kamiyama Ruon}}\n:{{anime voices|[[Hitomi Nabatame]]|[[Tia Ballard]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:The antagonist in episode four. The daughter of the \"modern [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]\" Katsuyuki Kamiyama, Ruon's consciousness was removed from her body by Katsuyuki and uploaded onto the net (2.0) as an [[artificial intelligence]], effectively killing her in real life (1.0). Katsuyuki implies that this event was the cause of Great Network Crisis of 2020. Ruon spends five years posing as an online [[sex doll]] until she becomes infatuated with Teruki because he is the first person to want to meet her offline. Following the events of the episode, her physical ([[Android (robot)|android]]) form is destroyed through an airplane jet engine.\n\n===Others===\n;{{Nihongo|{{visible anchor|Tamotsu Yanagisawa}}|\u67f3\u6ca2 \u4fdd|Yanagisawa Tamotsu}}<ref name=\"design03\"/>\n:{{anime voices|[[Yasunori Matsumoto]]<ref name=\"jp cast\"/>|[[Christopher Bevins]]<ref name=\"btva\"/>}}\n:A police investigator and a close acquaintance of Rin, first introduced in episode one.

In return for their services, both demand sex with either Rin or Mimi. Mimi is extremely uncomfortable and unnerved by this at first but seems to have entered into some sort of relationship with the second informant by episode four. In episode six, the second informant is apparently dead as well, replaced by a third one, with whom Mimi keeps a strictly professional relationship. In episode 3 during their search for information on Rin, Koki Maeno was forced to watch the informants have sex with Mimi or else no information would be given.

Rin, seeing him in a berserk frenzy and about to break free, is then forced to kill him in self-defense, realizing his identity only as he turns into ashes.

He is seen talking to Rin on the phone throughout the series, often in an intimate or fatherly manner. In episode six, it is revealed that he and Rin fell in love with each other over a thousand years ago, but he chose to distance himself from her. He is also revealed to be the progenitor of the Maeno line which tied all his descendants' fate to Rin's.

After knocking out several agents pursuing Koki, Rin takes him to her office where he tells her and her partner Mimi that although he is not amnesiac, he feels that his memories don't quite fit and he would like to know why he is being pursued. Through Rin's links, they find out that Koki is connected to the Aoyama Pharmaceutical company. With Mimi's help, they infiltrate its labs but are captured. Rin is tortured to death by the sadistic chief researcher Sayara Yamanobe, while Koki is revealed to be a runaway cloning test subject.

As the compromised facility is demolished by Aoyama Pharmaceutical, Rin escapes with Koki and hands him a gun, for him to decide what he wants to do with his life. After he seemingly commits suicide, Rin leaves the scene.

Meanwhile, Koki meets a girl named Yuki Shimazaki who is looking for an \"angel\" that may know the whereabouts of her missing brother Sh\u014dgo. Attracted by the explosion, he finds Rin's mutilated body and is visibly shaken by witnessing her regenerate. Later, Mimi explains to him that both Rin and herself are immortal because of the \"time fruit\" inside their bodies. She claims to not even remember how long the two of them have been immortal. In the meantime, several people including Rin's client are murdered and before long, she confirms that Yuki's brother turned into an \"angel\" due to contact with time fruit and committed the recent murders as acts of revenge. She also reveals that angels are natural enemies of immortal women like herself: in their presence, immortals are overcome with lust and angels use that time to devour them. Rin then deduces who Sh\u014dgo's final victim would be and confronts him only to seemingly give in to sexual desire. As the angel starts feasting on her, she manages to kill him. An apparition of Apos, the chief villain of the series, emerges nearby to claim Sh\u014dgo's time fruit but Rin gives it to Koki instead and he, in turn, to Yuki. In the final scene, Rin returns the stolen stamp to \"Professor\" who laments how his life was wasted on it.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 3\n| Title           = Flowers Don't Shed Tears\n| AltTitle        = Hana wa Namida o Nagasanai\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u82b1\u306f\u6d99\u3092\u6d41\u3055\u306a\u3044}})\n| Aux1            = 2011<ref name=\"xebec_ep3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode03.html|title=''Mnemosyne'' - Episode 3 synopsis|publisher=[[Sunrise Beyond|Xebec]]|language=Japanese|date=2008-03-28|accessdate=2008-05-22|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66pNBoiBm?url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode03.html|archive-date=2012-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|4|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Twenty years after the events of episode two, Koki is still working for Rin, is now married to Yuki, and has a son with her.

She soon discovers that the girl displayed the same symptoms as subjects of a biological weapon \"Higan\", once tested on the so-called \"Death Island\". The Island has been officially demolished and Tamotsu Yanagihara, a police officer and Rin's friend, confirms that its former residents were among the victims of each recent bombing in Tokyo. Soon after that, Rin is captured and brought to Death Island. Mimi decides to visit Rin's informant (whose name is never mentioned in the series) who demands sex with her in return for information on Rin's whereabouts. She informs them that the group behind the bombings and Rin's capture is called \"Kudoru\" ({{lang-ja|italic=yes|Evil}}). Meanwhile on the Island, Rin discovers that Sayara Yamanobe survived as an immortal but has to rely on a powered exoskeleton to move. Surviving a [[vivisection]], Rin escapes but is chased and killed again. Sayara explains her plan to exterminate humans with Higan, leaving only immortals on Earth. She claims that without humans, the Earth will no longer suffer from overpopulation and environmental pollution, leaving it a paradise for immortals. Koki arrives on a helicopter to free Rin but is fatally shot by Sayara. With his last strength, he consumes Sh\u014dgo's time fruit and turns into an angel. He carries Rin away from the ship to safety, thanking her for his life and kissing her goodbye. He then returns to devour Sayara but Apos arrives to remove both their time fruits, killing them instantly. The next day, Rin and Mimi are in their office, both mourning Koki's death. Koki's son, Teruki, asks his mother when his father will return home.

Rin takes Teruki for a walk but they are attacked by Laura, now a cyborg, who mutilates Rin considerably. Teruki is shaken by the sight of Rin regenerating and suffers a brief nervous breakdown after she reveals the truth about time fruits and immortals to him.

Apos is then revealed to be an immortal angel hybrid and removes Rin's time fruit, presumably killing her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = And Then, to the Door of the Kingdom...\n| AltTitle        = Soshite \u014ckoku no Tobira e to...\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u305d\u3057\u3066\u738b\u56fd\u306e\u6249\u3078\u3068......}})\n| Aux1            = 2055\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2008|7|6}}<ref name=\"xebec_ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode06.html|title=''Mnemosyne'' - Episode 6 synopsis|publisher=[[Sunrise Beyond|Xebec]]|language=Japanese|date=2008-06-02|accessdate=2008-06-19|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/66pNDRkay?url=http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/episode06.html|archive-date=2012-04-10|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Shortly after the end of episode five, Rin wakes up in Apos' castle at the foot of [[Yggdrasil]], the mythical tree that generates time fruits, since Apos let her regenerate instead of consuming her time fruit. She is then locked in a room with a masked angel and kills him, only to discover that it was Ihika. Meanwhile, Mimi and Mishio desperately search for Rin and learn the location of Apos' castle from the informant. Tajimamori, former Guardian of Yggdrasil, invites them to his castle, explains that his son Apos aims to become the new eternal Guardian by sacrificing Rin to Yggdrasil, and opens a portal to Apos' castle for them. There, Rin is losing the battle against Laura but Apos double-crosses the assassin and Rin escapes. In retaliation, Laura teams up with Mimi and Mishio and leads them to Yggdrasil. Rin is already there and meets Tajimamori, her millennia-old love. They have sex until Apos arrives, kills his father, and pushes Rin into Yggdrasil. Mishio tries pulling Rin out and fails but Rin manages to grab Koki's time fruit (that Rin found in the sea after episode four and Mishio unwittingly brought to the castle) from her necklace. As Yggdrasil tries to merge with her, Rin consumes Koki's time fruit and his spirit helps her to break free. Mishio, revealed to be Tajimamori's descendant like all Maenos, pulls Rin out and back to the castle. Apos attacks them but Rin, now the new Guardian of Yggdrasil, pushes Apos into it himself. Before he is consumed, she feeds Tajimamori and Laura's time fruits to him.\n\nIn the epilogue, Rin gives birth to Tajimamori's son and continues living in Apos' castle with Mimi and Mishio. Her closing narration reveals that their son is linked to the Yggdrasil and this link will spread throughout mankind with his descendants.\n}}\n|}\n\n== Reception == \nZac Bertschy from [[Anime News Network]] regards ''Mnemosyne'' as a \"totally edgy anime for adults\" that he felt \"like halfway-decent dark erotica\" that presents some unique ideas for the plot. He acknowledges that \"it's difficult to honestly care about any of these characters\" but its confusing and yet compelling aspects grasp the audience's attention. He criticized the amount of violence and sex that resulted in exhaustion and unpleasantness that led to \"the whole trashy appeal\". In conclusion, this is a series that should not be taken seriously and recommended it to those who are looking for \"fun, weird, entertaining sleaze without a hint of irony or cutesiness\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/rin/daughters-of-mnemosyne/dvd|title=Rin: ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~ DVD - Review|last=Bertschy |first=Zac|date=January 20, 2010|website=[[Anime News Network]]|language=en|accessdate=January 16, 2017}}</ref> Others differ from Bertschy's interpretation. Tom Tonthat argues that ''Mnemosyne'' features animation which is memorable and tells a good story, with mundane cases spiraling into sinister plots that endanger humanity itself, but is also a clearly adult series due to the level of nudity and sex.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://v1.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/reviews/anime/7068-Anime-Review-RIN-Daughters-of-Mnemosyne|title=Anime Review: RIN ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~|last=Tonthat |first=Tom|date=January 25, 2010|website=The Escapist|language=en|accessdate=November 19, 2019}}</ref> He adds that while the anime series is an \"erotic thriller\" it has high production values with some beautifully animated and well-choreographed fights between characters. This is coupled with an engaging story and each episode representing a year of the timeline between 1990 to 2055, including different technological developments which either change characters or the plot. He ends the review by stating that this anime does a good job of telling a story, a \"guilty pleasure anime\" for which you should give much thought to the \"blood smoothie or angel sex,\" concluding it is a form of \"supernatural film noir\" worth a look at, although hindered by the \"heavy use of shocking sex and violence.\"\n\nOn June 12, 2015, the Chinese Ministry of Culture listed ''Rin: Daughters of Mnemosyne'' among 38 anime and manga titles banned in [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbs.com.au/popasia/blog/2015/06/12/china-bans-38-japanese-anime-manga-titles-including-attack-titan |title=China bans 38 anime & manga titles including ''Attack on Titan'' |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=2015-06-12 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|45em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.funimation.com/rin-daughters-of-mnemosyne Funimation's official ''Rin ~Daughters of Mnemosyne~'' website]\n*[http://www.xebec-inc.co.jp/anime/mnemosyne/ Xebec's official ''Mnemosyne'' website] {{in lang|ja}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530011756/http://www.comic-valkyrie.com/main/contents/mnemosyne.htm Comic Valkyrie's official ''Mnemosyne'' manga website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ann|anime|8931|Mnemosyne}}\n* {{IMDb title|1196027|Mnemosyne}}\n\n{{Xebec}}\n\n[[Category:2008 Japanese television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2008 Japanese television series endings]]\n[[Category:2008 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:2008 manga]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Anime with original screenplays]]\n[[Category:Censored television series]]\n[[Category:Funimation]]\n[[Category:HJ Bunko]]\n[[Category:Japanese LGBT-related television shows]]\n[[Category:LGBT in anime and manga]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Neo-noir]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Supernatural anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Television censorship in China]]\n[[Category:Yuri (genre) anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Yuri (genre) light novels]]\n[[Category:Xebec (studio)]]\n[[Category:IG Port franchises]]\n[[Category:Works banned in China]]\n", "name_user": "Brujah93", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed diction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemosyne_(TV_series)"}
