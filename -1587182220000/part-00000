The series aired from 2003 to 2005 on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom. It also aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in the United States (as part of the [[Nick Jr. (block)|Nick Jr.]] block).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518075912/http://www.nickjr.com/shows/rubbadubbers/index.jhtml|title=Nick Jr. Parents--Play to Learn with Blue's Clues, Dora the Explorer, Little Bill and More!|archivedate=18 May 2007|accessdate=5 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nSeven anthropomorphic, friendly British bath toys called the Rubbadubbers live a peaceful life in the bathroom of a house in the fictional town of Bathsville City. The toys belong to two children who live at the house named Benjie and Sis (however, they are never seen on-screen). Whenever the children or anyone else are not present, the Rubbadubbers come to life and begin a fun activity.\n\nBut in every episode, one of the toys become dissatisfied with the way the activity or situation goes. He/she then wishes for it to go as planned by beginning the wish with 'if only...' . Suddenly, the Rubbadubber begins dreaming about an alternate reality where the wish comes true. Some of the other Rubbadubbers appear in the dream world as well, where they play different versions of their regular selves in order to either assist or hinder the character that made the wish.\n\nIt always turns out that the wish goes wrong in the dream world, much to the character's disappointment. The character then complains again with another 'if only...', which automatically stops the dream. From the dream, the character learns to be careful with what they wish for, and then decides that instead of changing the real-world situation to their will, they should simply leave it as it was and find a way to have fun with it. All the Rubbadubbers are then happy again. Each episode ends with Reg the robot, one of the Rubbadubbers, announcing to the others that Benjie and Sis are arriving for their bath. The toys then excitedly prepare themselves for it.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Rubbadubbers ===\n*Tubb (voiced by [[John Gordon Sinclair]]) is a male Scottish rubber frog and the [[leader]] of the Rubbadubbers. He is admired by everyone for his cool attitude and enjoys cleaning anything with his [[cotton bud]] and floating on a [[green]] [[Lily Pad|lily pad]]. Tubb's catchphrase is 'swimmin'!'\n*Sploshy (voiced by [[Maria Darling]]) is a female English starfish sponge. She speaks in a childish voice, is very energetic (she is often seen cartwheeling) and is known to have a short temper. Sploshy's catchphrase is 'splish, splash, splosh!'\n*Finbar (voiced by [[Sean Hughes (comedian)|Sean Hughes]]) is a male Irish wind-up shark. He often calls himself in third-person 'the mighty, scary shark', while often playing games involving pretend hunting and scaring. He also frequently uses the word 'mighty' in place of 'very' to describe things. In the dream worlds, he usually plays roles that rival the character that made the wish (such as robbers, monsters and even his regular self). Finbar's pirate-like catchphrase is 'arr, arr, arr!' (one which he uses countless times).\n*Terence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle who resembles a crocodile. He can blow bubbles out of his nose and heavily dislikes getting splashed, often avoiding water altogether. He has a favourite, red toothbrush for cleaning his one tooth. Terence also has several spots on his back and doesn't have a catchphrase.\n*Winona (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female purple rubber baby whale. She is mute, thus she cannot speak and make 'if only' wishes, but she can make squeaking sounds in order to communicate with the Rubbadubbers. She can also squirt water from her blowhole and perform tail tricks.\n*Reg (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male Australian toy robot and is the supporting leader of the Rubbadubbers. Just like Terence, he avoids water, as simply getting splashed makes him malfunction. He also stutters rather often. He plays with the others but is always on the lookout for Benjie and Sis' presence in order to make the Rubbadubbers prepare themselves for bath time. At the end of every episode, he announces their arrival with his catchphrase: 'Rubbadubbers! Rubbadubbers! Benjie and Sis/the children are coming! Bath time scramble!'\n*Amelia (voiced by Maria Darling) is a female English aeroplane-submarine hybrid toy. Likely named after [[Amelia Earhart]], she and the Rubbadubbers often call her 'the flying submarine'. She is very energetic (like Sploshy), is usually rather happy and loves to try new things, fly around the bathroom and perform tricks.\n\n=== Others ===\n*Lawrence (voiced by John Gordon Sinclair) is a male English soap bottle that resembles a crocodile. He only appears in the episode 'Terence's Double Trouble' and plays Terence's almost-fully-identical friend in Terence's dream. But the only differences to him and Terence are that the tie that he wears is blue (Terence has a red one), he doesn't have a toothbrush, he has two teeth (Terence has one) and can do better tie tricks than Terence.\n*Benjie and Sis are the two owners of the Rubbadubbers that are never seen on-screen. They are two young human siblings that are presumably British. Whenever they need to use the bathroom, Reg the robot alerts the Rubbadubbers to prepare for their arrival.\n\n==[[VHS]] and [[DVD]] Releases==\n\n* Rubbadubbers: Here Come the Rubbadubbers!\n* Rubbadubbers: Splish!
