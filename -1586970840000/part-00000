All recipients of new or replacement British passports issued in Bermuda, prior to 2002, received this passport, whether they possessed Bermudian status or not. The citizenship of the holder was indicated by rubber stamp in the appropriate field inside the passport. Prior to 1983, the citizenship for British citizens from the United Kingdom or the colonies was ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies''. After 1983, when citizens in the United Kingdom became ''British Citizens'', colonials became ''British Dependent Territories Citizens'' (as this was purely to enable the British Governments immigration authorities to distinguish and discriminate against colonials, this type of British Citizenship did not entitle the holder to right of abode in any British Dependent Territory, including Bermuda. Bermudian status was indicated by the addition of ''(Bermuda)'' after ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' on the rubber stamp), losing the right of abode in the United Kingdom unless already settled in the United Kingdom or having been born in, or having a parent who had been born in, the United Kingdom. Prior to 2002, it was not legal for a person to hold two British passports. A person who possessed both Bermudian status and right of abode (or ''settled'' status) in the United kingdom could have both indicated in the same passport. A ''British citizen'' who did not possess Bermudian status would receive the supposedly ''Bermudian passport'' if obtaining it in Bermuda, with the citizenship stamped as \"British Citizen\" only (unless the holder also possessed status in another territory or held yet another type of British Citizenship). Those who held neither Bermudian status nor the right of abode in the United Kingdom, but who were entitled to a British Passport would also receive the \"Bermudian\" Passport in Bermuda, with the appropriate citizenship stamped inside. Before 1983, a Bermudian ''Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies'', and, after 1983, a ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' with Bermudian status who did not possess the right of abode in the United Kingdom, who obtained a British Passport in the United Kingdom, or at a United Kingdom Consulate in a foreign country, received a normal British Passport (not the ''Bermudian'' passport) with the appropriate citizenship rubber stamped inside. In 1988, when the blue British Passports were replaced with a burgundy one of a common European Union pattern, the passports issued in the British Dependent Territories were changed accordingly (entitlement to free movement in the European Movement was indicated only on the passports on the United Kingdom type passports, with ''EUROPEAN UNION'' added above ''UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND'' on the outside of the front cover (where the ''Bermudian'' passport reads only ''BRITISH PASSPORT''). In 2002, ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'' was re-named ''British Overseas Territories Citizenship'', remaining as the default citizenship for British citizens born in what were at the same time re-designated the ''British Overseas Territories'', and the barriers that had been put in place in 1983 to end free movement of most colonials (excepting Falkland Islanders and later Gibraltarians) into the United Kingdom were removed. British Overseas Territories Citizens were also entitled to obtain ''British Citizenship'' by obtaining a normal British Passport with the citizenship stamped as ''British Citizen''. The restriction against holding more than one British passport was removed. The Department of Immigration was no longer permitted to issue new or replacement passports except for British Overseas Citizenship holders. The citizenship for these was entered only as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen''. Bermudian status was stamped in separately on one of the internal pages. Without the stamp indicating that the passport holder is registered as a Bermudian, a ''Bermudian'' Passport with the citizenship entered as ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'' is not sufficient to identify the holder as a Bermudian. The endorsement indicating the holder has Bermudian status can be stamped into any British Passport, with the citizenship entered as either 'British Overseas Territories Citizen'' or 'British Citizen''. As the ''Bermudian'' passport still lacked ''EUROPEAN UNION'' on the front cover, and used the country code ''BMU'' indicated inside instead of the ''GBR'' indicated in the British Citizen/United Kingdom passport, it is not necessarily accepted in other European Union countries as entitling the holder to free movement within the European Union. As a consequence, the only practical reason a Bermudian would obtain the ''Bermudian'' passport, whether in addition or in preference to the normal British passport with Bermudian status stamped inside, was for the purpose of entering the United States of America, which has lower entry restrictions on Bermudians than on other British nationals, but specifies they must present a British Passport with ''Government of Bermuda'' on the front, citizenship entered as either ''British Dependent Territories Citizen'' or ''British Overseas Territories Citizen'', and the endorsement stamped to show the holder has been registered as a Bermudian. Since the HM Passport Office in the UK became the sole issuer of all British passports in 2016, only the normal (UK-type) British Passport is issued, whatever the type of British Citizenship entered. Bermuda Immigration enters the Bermudian status stamp separately (passports applied for in Bermuda can be obtained by handing the application to the Department of Immigration in Bermuda, which forwards the it to HM Passport office and receives it back on behalf of the applicant).\n\n==Application==\n\nAdult applicants can apply for a standard Bermudian [[ePassport]] at a cost of US$160.

During the [[winter]] season, the area is home to [[flamingoes]] and other [[migratory birds]]. The 24th parallel north passes through Sir Creek.\n\nOn the Pakistani side, to the west of Sir Creek there are several other creeks most of which are part of the [[Keti Bunder South Wildlife Sanctuary]].\n\nSir Creek lies just to the west of the [[Great Rann of Kutch]] area of India. On the Indian side, Sir Creek is one of the six main creeks in this area, others being [[Vian Wari|Vian Wari Creek]] (Vianbari and Viyanbari), [[Pir Sanai Creek|Pir Sanai]], [[Pabevari Creek|Pabevari]], [[Padala Creek|Padala]] 16&nbsp;km southeast, and eastern most [[Kori Creek|Kori]] 34&nbsp;km southeast from Sir Creek.<ref name=hit2>[https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/21-months-on-bsf-still-bereft-of-hi-tech-tools-to-fight-nature-60378 21 months on, BSF still bereft of hi-tech tools to fight nature], The Tribune, 2015.</ref><ref name=hit1/> All of these creeks are within undisputed territory of India, except westernmost creek, i.e. the Sir Creek, is claimed by both India and Pakistan.<ref name=hit1/> These evershifting creeks, exit Indian territory, enter Pakistan, reenter India and vice versa, thus creating hard to patrol snake and scorpions infested marshy wetland border with no physical barrier or fencing.<ref name=hit1/>\n\nTwo channels, namely ''\"Harami Nala\"'' and ''\"Bondho Dhoro\"'', are of specific concern to India for preventing infiltration and illegal activities. The Vian Wari Creek (Vianbari and Viyanbari) on the Indian side enters Pakistan in the north where is it called ''\"Harami Dhoro\"'' (bastard's stream), turns east and reenters India where it is called ''\"Harami Nala\"'' (bastard's drain), then splits into two streams and one of which reenters Pakistan, which poses strategic challenge for India for guarding against infiltration from Pakistan. Bondho Dhoro channel, which enters India further north of Harami Nala in the [[Sujawal District]] of Sindh province of Pakistan, is another potential point of infiltration by boat.

Oye Cukwurah, ''The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law'', Manchester University Press, 1967, pp. 51 ''ff.''</ref> When Thalweg principle is applied, the [[UNCLOS]] (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) supports India's position, which ''\"would result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] under the [[United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea]].\"''<ref name=mani1/>\n\nIndia further sticks to its position that the boundary lies mid-channel as depicted in another map drawn in 1925, and implemented by the installation of mid-channel pillars back in 1924.<ref name=\"ipri\"/> Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the doctrine is not applicable in this case as it most commonly applies to non-tidal rivers, and Sir Creek is a tidal estuary. India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining the fact that the creek is navigable at [[high tide]] and that the thalweg principle is used for international boundaries in tidal waters, and that fishing trawlers use Sir Creek to go out to sea.\n\nAnother point of concern for Pakistan is that Sir Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated according to the thalweg principle applied to the current channel, Pakistan and India would both lose small amounts of wetlands territory that was historically part of their provinces.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Economic reasons of dispute===\nThough the creek has little military value, it holds immense economic gain. Much of the region is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed, and control over the creek would have a huge bearing on the energy potential of each nation. Also once the boundaries are defined, it would help in the determination of the maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points. Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of [[Exclusive Economic Zones]] (EEZs) and continental shelves. EEZs extend to 200&nbsp;nautical miles (370&nbsp;km) and can be subjected to commercial exploitation.<ref name=\"tribune\"/>\n\nThe demarcation would also prevent the inadvertent crossing over of fishermen of both nations into each other's territories. In contrary to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen of both countries get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, it is always a wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan ([[Wagha border]]) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.<ref name=\"OHRH\">{{cite web | title=The Plight of Indo-Pak Fishermen and the Need to Appreciate Economic Rights | website=Oxford Human Rights Hub | url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-plight-of-indo-pak-fishermen-and-the-need-to-appreciate-economic-rights/ | accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nPakistan built [[Left Bank Outfall Drain|LBOD]] canal between 1987 and 1997 to collect agriculture saline water and industrial effluents generated in the area located on the left side of the Indus main river. LBOD canal discharges the saline and contaminated water into the Sir Creek for disposal to the sea. LBOD is the better way to send the unwanted saline water without contaminating the fresh water available in the [[Indus River]]. LBOD construction is in violation of the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] (Article IV) causing material damage (i.e. inundating the creek area  exposed during the low tide) to India. Thus Pakistan has economic interest in keeping the dispute alive and not settled as per international conventions. If India is physically holding (partially or fully) the water area of the creek, India can settle the LBOD dispute as per the arbitration procedure available in Indus Waters treaty.<ref name=hit1/>\n\n===Incidences===\n\n====Atlantique incident====\n\nThis disputed region is known for the [[Atlantique Incident]] which occurred in August 1999.

Oye Cukwurah, ''The Settlement of Boundary Disputes in International Law'', Manchester University Press, 1967, pp. 51 ''ff.''</ref> When Thalweg principle is applied, the [[UNCLOS]] (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) supports India's position, which ''\"would result in the shifting of the land/sea terminus point several kilometres to the detriment of Pakistan, leading in turn to a loss of several thousand square kilometres of its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] under the [[United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea]].\"''<ref name=mani1/>\n\nIndia further sticks to its position that the boundary lies mid-channel as depicted in another map drawn in 1925, and implemented by the installation of mid-channel pillars back in 1924.<ref name=\"ipri\"/> Though Pakistan does not dispute the 1925 map, it maintains that the doctrine is not applicable in this case as it most commonly applies to non-tidal rivers, and Sir Creek is a tidal estuary. India rejects the Pakistani stance by maintaining the fact that the creek is navigable at [[high tide]] and that the thalweg principle is used for international boundaries in tidal waters, and that fishing trawlers use Sir Creek to go out to sea.\n\nAnother point of concern for Pakistan is that Sir Creek has changed its course considerably over the years. If the boundary line is demarcated according to the thalweg principle applied to the current channel, Pakistan and India would both lose small amounts of wetlands territory that was historically part of their provinces.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Economic reasons of dispute===\nThough the creek has little military value, it holds immense economic gain. Much of the region is rich in oil and gas below the sea bed, and control over the creek would have a huge bearing on the energy potential of each nation. Also once the boundaries are defined, it would help in the determination of the maritime boundaries which are drawn as an extension of onshore reference points. Maritime boundaries also help in determining the limits of [[Exclusive Economic Zones]] (EEZs) and continental shelves. EEZs extend to 200&nbsp;nautical miles (370&nbsp;km) and can be subjected to commercial exploitation.<ref name=\"tribune\"/>\n\nThe demarcation would also prevent the inadvertent crossing over of fishermen of both nations into each other's territories. In contrary to economic reasons described by India and Pakistan, common fishermen of both countries get trapped in conflict and their economic rights of earning get affected. It has seen that government of India and Pakistan regularly arrest fishermen of each other for crossing the boundary, however for a common fisherman, it is always a wonder to know where the boundary starts and ends in sea. This unawareness are added with wind flow, waves and turbulence that push the boat in sea. While UN law advocates for minimum penalty for this offence and release of boats, but government of India and Pakistan catch these prisoners and keep them in prisons for long time. It is more unfortunate that their release happens through land boundary of India and Pakistan ([[Wagha border]]) and these poor fishermen come to their home country without their boats.<ref name=\"OHRH\">{{cite web | title=The Plight of Indo-Pak Fishermen and the Need to Appreciate Economic Rights | website=Oxford Human Rights Hub | url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-plight-of-indo-pak-fishermen-and-the-need-to-appreciate-economic-rights/ | accessdate=15 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nPakistan built [[Left Bank Outfall Drain|LBOD]] canal between 1987 and 1997 to collect agriculture saline water and industrial effluents generated in the area located on the left side of the Indus main river. LBOD canal discharges the saline and contaminated water into the Sir Creek for disposal to the sea. LBOD is the better way to send the unwanted saline water without contaminating the fresh water available in the [[Indus River]]. LBOD construction is in violation of the [[Indus Waters Treaty]] (Article IV) causing material damage (i.e. inundating the creek area  exposed during the low tide) to India. Thus Pakistan has economic interest in keeping the dispute alive and not settled as per international conventions. If India is physically holding (partially or fully) the water area of the creek, India can settle the LBOD dispute as per the arbitration procedure available in Indus Waters treaty.<ref name=hit1/>\n\n===Incidences===\n\n====Atlantique incident====\n\nThis disputed region is known for the [[Atlantique Incident]] which occurred in August 1999.

After the 1999 Atlantic incidence, Pakistan deployed its 31st Creek [[Battalion]] headquartered at [[Sujawal]] responsible for the area from Haji Moro Jat creek in north to [[Korangi Creek Cantonment]] in [[Karachi]] in south. In 2019, Pakistan also deployed 32nd Creek Battalion headquartered at [[Gharo]] with the view to increase the troop strength to 3 [[brigade]]s by deploying more [[infantry]] and [[Amphibious warfare ship|amphibious]] battalions. Pakistan has procured 6 coastal defense boats for the coastal surveillance, and 4 of the newly acquired 18 [[Riverine Assault Craft|marine assault crafts]] will be deployed in the Sir Creek. Pakistan is planning to buy 60 more naval ships, including [[hovercraft]]s and [[Maritime patrol|offshore petrol boats]]. Pakistan has also set up 2 new marine posts west of the Pir Samadhi Creek in the area of Bandha Dhora and Harami Dhoro. Pakistan also has 21st Air Defense unit and 3 marine units at [[Gwadar Port]] as well [[Jinnah Naval Base]] at [[Ormara]].

The building was financed by the Citizens' Aid Society in memory of Lenora Hall Christian.  <br />\n1924:  A building boom greatly expanded the sanatorium campus. An addition housing a bakery and new kitchen linked the 1916 and 1921 administration buildings. A seven-floor East Wing was added and the sanatorium could serve 490 patients. Two residence buildings were constructed. A nurses' residence built north of the main campus also housed other female staff. A power plant and a residence for male employees were built across the road from the campus to the south (present-day Eden Prairie).<br />\n1925:  The West Wing opened. The capacity was increased to 600. The Christian family funded the [[Glen Lake Children's Camp]] on Birch Island Lake, a short distance south of the main sanatorium.

This building was the second to be financed by the Citizens' Aid \nSociety. Former offices in the other buildings were converted to patient rooms and the final capacity of Glen Lake Sanatorium was 680 patients.<br />\n1936:  The peak of the tuberculosis epidemic in Hennepin County occurred. The Glen Lake Sanatorium's population exceeded 700, with patients in hallways on gurneys and porches enclosed and transformed into wards. In 1936, the average stay by a patient at Glen Lake was 538 days.<br />\n1961: [[Chemotherapy]] had all but eliminated the need for extended stays in a sanatorium.  Hennepin County leased the Glen Lake Sanatorium campus to the State of Minnesota. The state's Department of Public Welfare converted the sanatorium to a psycho-geriatric nursing home to serve aging residents of its state hospital system. It was named Oak Terrace Nursing Home in reference to the original post office address of Glen Lake Sanatorium, which was Oak Terrace, MN. A portion of the main building continued to house tuberculosis patients and operated as the Minnesota State Sanatorium.<br />\n1976: The last tuberculosis patient was discharged and the facility became a state Nursing facility for Ward of the State patients; those with severe mental and or physical disabilities.  As other state facilities closed, patients were moved to Glen Lake Sanatorium, Which was then called \"Oak Terrace Nursing Home\". <br/>\n1990: The state closed the nursing home when the Department of Human Services (formerly DPW) moved to a decentralized system of care. <br />\n1993: The entire campus, excepting the children's camp which is located in [[Eden Prairie]], was razed.  The Glen Lake Golf and Practice Center operated by [[Three Rivers Park District]] now occupies the site.\n\n== Treatment ==\n\nThe Glen Lake Sanatorium was constructed on the Trudeau Sanatorium model, established at the [[Adirondack Cottage Sanitarium]] in [[Saranac Lake, New York]] by Dr. [[Edward Livingston Trudeau]]. The fresh-air-and-bed-rest treatment of tuberculous patients often meant open windows, even during Minnesota winters. Sun therapy, called [[heliotherapy]], was the other essential element of early treatment at Glen Lake. The 1921 Administration building and East and West Wings featured \"deck houses\" or uncovered porches running the entire length of the buildings' top floors. Patients would lie in beds entirely exposed to the sun's rays, wearing minimal clothing. Patients' rooms on other floors had floor-to-ceiling triple-hung windows that would slide up and allow beds to be wheeled onto small porches.\n\nIn 1922, Glen Lake Sanatorium doctors first adopted and performed a surgical procedure known as artificial [[pneumothorax]], which collapsed the [[lung]] affected by [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. Collapse inhibited the proliferation of tubercle bacilli and stimulated the formation of scar tissue that controlled the disease. Another method, called extrapleural thoracoplasty, involved removal of portions of several ribs to collapse the chest wall. [[Phrenic nerve]] interruption was introduced to Glen Lake in 1924. This paralysis of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] reduced movement of the affected lung.<ref>Myers. p.142-143.</ref>\n\nThe collapse era was followed by [[chemotherapy]]. [[Streptomycin]], a [[World War II]] development, was readily available by 1949. [[Isoniazid]] came into use in 1952 and, together with streptomycin, shortened patient stays from years to months.\n\n== Related books and movies==\nMinnesota author [[Frederick Manfred]] was a patient at Glen Lake Sanatorium from 1940 to 1942.  While there he met his future wife and fellow patient, Maryanna Shorba.  Manfred later fictionalized his stay in the book ''Boy Almighty'', published under his given name of Feike Feikema.<ref>Selected Letters of Frederick Manfred, 1932-1954. Arthur R.

In the movie, it represented the Catholic orphanage in which Christian Slater's character grew up. The bedside scene was filmed in the Children's Building and the other scene took place in the main first-floor hallway of the Administration Building. At the time of filming, the working title was \"Baboon Heart.\"\n\nThe video documentary ''From Beginning to End: Glen Lake Sanatorium and Oak Terrace Nursing Home'' was produced in 1990 as a tribute to the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Sanatorium.

Patients' rooms on other floors had floor-to-ceiling triple-hung windows that would slide up and allow beds to be wheeled onto small porches.\n\nIn 1922, Glen Lake Sanatorium doctors first adopted and performed a surgical procedure known as artificial [[pneumothorax]], which collapsed the [[lung]] affected by [[pulmonary tuberculosis]]. Collapse inhibited the proliferation of tubercle bacilli and stimulated the formation of scar tissue that controlled the disease. Another method, called extrapleural thoracoplasty, involved removal of portions of several ribs to collapse the chest wall. [[Phrenic nerve]] interruption was introduced to Glen Lake in 1924. This paralysis of the [[Thoracic diaphragm|diaphragm]] reduced movement of the affected lung.<ref>Myers. p.142-143.</ref>\n\nThe collapse era was followed by [[chemotherapy]]. [[Streptomycin]], a [[World War II]] development, was readily available by 1949. [[Isoniazid]] came into use in 1952 and, together with streptomycin, shortened patient stays from years to months.\n\n== Related books and movies==\nMinnesota author [[Frederick Manfred]] was a patient at Glen Lake Sanatorium from 1940 to 1942.  While there he met his future wife and fellow patient, Maryanna Shorba.  Manfred later fictionalized his stay in the book ''Boy Almighty'', published under his given name of Feike Feikema.<ref>Selected Letters of Frederick Manfred, 1932-1954. Arthur R.

It was used in educational campaigns against tuberculosis.<ref>Myers. p.576-577.</ref>\n\nThe opening black and white sequence of ''Untamed Heart'' was filmed at Glen Lake Sanatorium shortly before it was demolished. In the movie, it represented the Catholic orphanage in which Christian Slater's character grew up. The bedside scene was filmed in the Children's Building and the other scene took place in the main first-floor hallway of the Administration Building. At the time of filming, the working title was \"Baboon Heart.\"\n\nThe video documentary ''From Beginning to End: Glen Lake Sanatorium and Oak Terrace Nursing Home'' was produced in 1990 as a tribute to the 75th anniversary of the opening of the Sanatorium.

The alternative is for the web server itself to deliver a [[static web page]]. Scripts can be written in any of a number of server-side scripting languages that are available (see below). Server-side scripting is distinguished from [[client-side scripting]] where embedded scripts, such as [[JavaScript]], are run client-side in a [[web browser]], but both techniques are often used together.\n\nServer-side scripting is often used to provide a customized interface for the user. These scripts may assemble client characteristics for use in customizing the response based on those characteristics, the user's requirements, access rights, etc. Server-side scripting also enables the website owner to hide the source code that generates the interface, whereas with client-side scripting, the user has access to all the code received by the client. A down-side to the use of server-side scripting is that the client needs to make further requests over the network to the server in order to show new information to the user via the web browser. These requests can slow down the experience for the user, place more load on the server, and prevent use of the application when the user is disconnected from the server.\n\nWhen the server serves data in a commonly used manner, for example according to the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] or [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]], users may have their choice of a number of client programs (most modern web browsers can request and receive data using both of those protocols). In the case of more specialized applications, programmers may write their own server, client, and communications protocol, that can only be used with one another.\n\nPrograms that run on a user's local computer without ever sending or receiving data over a network are not considered clients, and so the operations of such programs would not be considered client-side operations.\n\n== History ==\nNetscape introduced an implementation of [[JavaScript]] for server-side scripting with [[Netscape Enterprise Server]], first released in December, 1994 (soon after releasing JavaScript for browsers).<ref name = \"Newscape JavaScript Guide-1998\">{{cite web|title=Server-Side JavaScript Guide|publisher=Netscape Communications Corporation|year=1998|url=http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/816-6411-10/getstart.htm|accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref><ref name = \"Morgan-Netcape LiveWie\">{{cite web|title=Using Netscape\u2122 LiveWire\u2122, Special Edition | author=Mike Morgan | url = http://vampire.rulez.org/onlinedoc/book/NetscapeLiveWire/ch6.htm | year = 1996 | publisher = Que }}</ref>\n\nServer-side scripting was later used in early 1995 by [[Fred DuFresne]] while developing the first web site for Boston, MA television station [[WCVB-TV|WCVB]]. The technology is described in [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect2=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&d=PALL&RefSrch=yes&Query=PN/5835712 US patent 5835712]. The patent was issued in 1998 and is now owned by [[Open Invention Network]] (OIN). In 2010 OIN named Fred DuFresne a [https://web.archive.org/web/20111110192158/http://openinventionnetwork.com/press_release06_07_11.php \"Distinguished Inventor\"] for his work on server-side scripting.\n\nToday, a variety of services use server-side scripting to deliver results back to a client as a paid or free service. An example would be [[Wolfram Alpha|WolframAlpha]], which is a computational knowledge engine that computes results outside the clients environment and returns the computed result back. A more commonly used service is [[Google|Google's]] proprietary search engine, which searches millions of cached results related to the user specified keyword and returns an ordered list of links back to the client. [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[Siri]] application also employs server-side scripting outside of a web application. The application takes an input, computes a result, and returns the result back to the client.\n\n== Explanation ==\nIn the earlier days of the web, server-side scripting was almost exclusively performed by using a combination of [[C (programming language)|C]] programs, [[Perl]] scripts, and [[shell script]]s using the [[Common Gateway Interface]] (CGI). Those scripts were executed by the [[operating system]], and the results were served back by the web server. Many modern web servers can directly execute on-line scripting languages such as [[Active Server Pages|ASP]], [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] either by the web server itself or via extension modules (e.g. [[mod_perl]] or [[mod_php]]) to the web server. For example, [[WebDNA]] includes its own embedded database system. Either form of scripting (i.e., CGI or direct execution) can be used to build up complex multi-page sites, but direct execution usually results in less overhead because of the lower number of calls to external interpreters.\n\nDynamic websites sometimes use custom web application servers, such as [[GlassFish|Glassfish]], [[Plack (software)|Plack]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]'s \"Base HTTP Server\" library, although some may not consider this to be server-side scripting. When using dynamic web-based scripting techniques, developers must have a keen understanding of the logical, temporal, and physical separation between the client and the server. For a user's action to trigger the execution of server-side code, for example, a developer working with classic ASP must explicitly cause the user's browser to make a request back to the web server. Creating such interactions can easily consume much development time and lead to unreadable code.\n\nServer-side scripts are completely processed by the servers instead of clients. When clients request a page containing server-side scripts, the applicable server processes the scripts and returns an HTML page to the client.\n\n== Languages ==\n<!-- Please don't list languages like Python, Perl, and Ruby here, see [[Talk:Server-side_scripting#Too_many_languages]] -->\nThere are a number of server-side scripting languages available, including:\n* [[ActiveVFP]] (*.avfp)\n* [[Active Server Pages|ASP]] (*.asp)\n* [[ASP.NET Web Forms]] (*.aspx)\n* [[ASP.NET Web Pages]] (*.cshtml, *.vbhtml)\n* [[Bigwig (programming language)|Bigwig]] (*.wig)\n* [[ColdFusion Markup Language]] (*.cfm)\n* [[Go (programming language)|Go]] (*.go)\n* [[Google Apps Script]] (*.gs)\n* [[Hack (programming language)|Hack]] (*.php)\n* [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] (*.hs) (example: [[Yesod (web framework)|Yesod]])\n* [[Java (programming language)|Java]] (*.jsp, *.do) via [[JavaServer Pages]]\n* [[JavaScript]] using [[Server-side JavaScript]] (*.ssjs, *.js) (example: [[Node.js]])\n* [[Lasso (programming language)|Lasso]] (*.lasso)\n* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] (*.lp *.op *.lua)\n* [[Parser (programming language)|Parser]] (*.p)\n* [[Perl]] via the [[CGI.pm]] module (*.cgi, *.ipl, *.pl)\n* [[PHP]] (*.php, *.php3, *.php4, *.phtml)\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]] (*.py) (examples: [[Pyramid (web framework)#Pyramid|Pyramid]], [[Flask (web framework)|Flask]], [[Django (Web framework)|Django]])\n* [[R (programming language)|R]] (*.rhtml) - (example: [[rApache]])\n* [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] (*.rb, *.rbw) (example: [[Ruby on Rails]])\n* [[SMX (computer language)|SMX]] (*.smx)\n* [[Tcl (programming language)|Tcl]] (*.tcl)\n* [[WebDNA]] (*.dna,*.tpl)\n* [[OpenEdge Advanced Business Language|Progress WebSpeed]] (*.r,*.w)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Client-side scripting]]\n* [[Content management system]] (CMS)\n* [[Edge Side Includes]]\n* [[JavaServer Pages|JSP]]\n* [[Node.js]]\n* [[Outline of web design and web development]]\n* [[Plack (software)|Perl/Plack]]\n* [[PHP]]\n* [[Server Side Includes]] (SSI)\n* [[Web development]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{dmoz|Computers/Programming/Internet/Server_Side_Scripting}};\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Server-Side Scripting}}\n[[Category:Scripting languages]]\n", "text_old": "{{See also|Dynamic web page#Server-side scripting}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Expert needed|Technology|reason=unfocused, scattered, unnecessary details|date=April 2012}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2008}}\n}}\n\n'''Server-side scripting''' is a technique used in [[web development]] which involves employing [[Scripting language|script]]s on a web server which produce a response customized for each user's (client's) request to the website.

It is also revealed that Mary somehow knew Azazel. Although Sam tries to protect the other children, various fights ensue, and the children are killed off one by one.

Once the Seals are all broken, Lucifer, the first fallen angel and chief adversary in the war of angels and demons, will be freed from Hell, bringing the [[Apocalypse]] upon the Earth. It is also revealed that Lucifer spawned all of the demons starting with Lilith who is now active. Castiel develops a friendship with Dean and helps him understand the upcoming events. Castiel also reveals the Winchesters' past and shows Dean the connection between the now deceased Demon Azazel and his family. He reveals that Dean's mom was a hunter and working cases around the time Azazel was making crossroad deals in 1973. She and her hunter family, the Campbells, tracked the yellow eyed Demon down and eventually the Demon was stopped, but not before the Demon possessed and killed Mary's father and mother and killed her then boyfriend John Winchester. Shockingly, Azazel makes a deal with Mary to bring back John in exchange for certain debts owed 10 years later. When Mary protests over the cost being her soul, Azazel says that he doesn't need her soul- just a favor years later. Dean is shocked that Mary's deal resulted in he and his brother's permanent lives as hunters.\n\nIt is revealed that in the months without Dean, Sam \u2013 depressed, drinking heavily, and carrying a death wish \u2013 tries to bargain with various Crossroads Demons in order to exchange his soul for Dean's.

They also learn that their father had an affair with Adam's mother resulting in him being born on September 24, 1990 and kept it secret so Adam could have a normal life, unlike the boys.  At the end, it is revealed that it was a ghoul (that wanted revenge on John for a previous hunt) and impersonating Adam who was killed but Dean saved Sam and the brothers burned Adam's body.\n\nSam's powers become an important part of the fourth season as they are shown to fluctuate \u2013 at times so weak that he can barely exorcise a demon,<ref name=\"rapture\">{{cite episode|title= The Rapture |series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=April 30, 2009 |season=4 |number=20 |minutes=}}</ref> whereas at other times they are strong enough to kill a demon.<ref name=\"OnTheHeadOfAPin\">{{cite episode|title= On the Head of a Pin |series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=March 19, 2009 |season=4 |number=16 |minutes=}}</ref> It is revealed that drinking demon blood makes Sam's powers grow stronger<ref name=\"OnTheHeadOfAPin\"/> while at the same time making him \"cold\" and \"arrogant\".

Dean finds and confronts them and tries to kill Ruby, but Sam intervenes. He and Dean argue about how to stop the Apocalypse, whereupon Dean tells Sam he's changing into a monster, leading to a vicious fight between the brothers. Sam is the victor and as he leaves, Dean tells him not to return \u2013 just as their father John, years ago, told Sam not to return when he left for college.<ref name=\"when the levee breaks\">{{cite episode|title= When the Levee Breaks |series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=May 7, 2009 |number=21 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\nAs Sam begins to feel the guilt over abandoning his brother, he and Ruby capture a demon that knows Lilith's location. Using his powers to torture the demon, she gives the location, but as Sam is about to drink her blood, the demon gives control to her human host, inciting immense guilt in Sam. A message from Dean, altered by the manipulative, arrogant angel Zachariah, manipulates Sam, pushing him to continue his original mission to kill Lilith; he then drains the woman of her blood anyway. Ruby and Sam go to St. Mary's Convent in [[Ilchester, Maryland]], where they find Lilith. As Sam attempts to kill Lilith, Ruby holds the doors shut to keep Dean, who has just arrived, from interfering. Sam hesitates when he hears his brother yelling for him, but when Lilith mocks him for his inability to do the job \u2013 even after becoming a monster to do so \u2013 he finishes her off, fulfilling his true destiny as the \"special child.\" Lilith's death breaks the final seal and begins forming a portal for Lucifer. At this point, Ruby reveals that she was leading Sam along the entire time so he would break the seal. Dean finally enters the room and kills Ruby with her own knife, while Sam holds her in place. Sam apologizes to his brother as a white light shows a portal beginning to open.<ref name=\"lucifer\">{{cite episode|title= Lucifer Rising |series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=May 14, 2009 |season=4 |number=22 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\n===Season 5===\nAs the portal for [[Lucifer]] opens, Sam and Dean are teleported onto an airplane by an unknown force (God).

A bright light shines and Dean looks upon an unconscious Sam as he opens the portal to Lucifer's prison. Although \"Sam\" says that he has Lucifer under control, it is shown that Lucifer was just taunting Dean. Lucifer closes the portal and takes the rings before disappearing. At an unknown location, Sam continues to fight Lucifer internally for control over his body. While talking through a mirror, Lucifer tries to persuade Sam to embrace their union by slaughtering demons that were watching Sam throughout his entire life.<ref name=\"swan song\">{{cite episode|title= Swan Song|series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=May 13, 2010|season=5|number=22 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\nDuring Lucifer's confrontation at [[Stull, Kansas|Stull Cemetery]] with Michael (using [[List of Supernatural characters#Adam Milligan|Adam]] as his vessel), he beats Dean, slamming him against the door of the Impala.

The sudden arousal of Sam's childhood memories and those of the bond of brotherhood he shares with Dean allows him to overpower Lucifer and regain control of his body. Sam takes out the rings, reopens the portal, and prepares to throw himself in. Having been temporarily banished by Castiel, Michael returns and attempts to stop him, but Sam jumps in, pulling Michael also with him \u2013 trapping both Lucifer and Michael in Lucifer's cage. The ground closes up with a stunned, devastated Dean watching. Later, it is shown that Dean fulfills his promise to Sam and has gone back to find Lisa.

In the season finale, Sam spends much of the episode attempting to recoup his shattered soul, including the memories of his soulless self and tortured self. Once complete, he reawakens, though still struggling with the visions of the Cage that his soul endured.\n\n===Season 7===\nAfter Castiel's actions result in the release of the Leviathans \u2013 God's first creations \u2013 Sam is left struggling with the restoration of his memories of his time in Hell, even if he remains dedicated to helping Dean and others stop the Leviathans. During this time, he has a reunion with his old [[Kitsune]] friend, Amy Pond, who has become a mortician feeding on the dead to sustain her, although Dean nevertheless kills her when he discovers that she has been killing to help her sick son. As Sam experiences hallucinations of Lucifer taunting him with the idea that he is still in Hell, he initially tries to control them by focusing on wounds he sustains in the real world, but matters become worse when he is forced to rely on information from the hallucination to save Dean. As his mental state becomes worse, Sam foregoes sleep to stop his visions, but is sent to an asylum when he is hit by a car while running away from Lucifer. While trying to find a healer who may be able to repair Sam, Dean encounters an amnesiac Castiel, who, when restored to his full powers, sacrifices himself by taking Sam's mental damage. Sam is shown to possess great guilt about this and rejects hope that Bobby's ghost may be helping them out after an attempt to communicate with him fails. Sam is initially happy when it is shown that Bobby's ghost is there helping them, but changes his mind after Bobby shows more and more signs of becoming a [[vengeful spirit]]. During the final battle at Sucrocorp, Sam rescues [[Kevin Tran (Supernatural)|Kevin Tran]] \u2013 a Prophet who can read the Word of God \u2013 and is horrified to hear of Dick Roman's plan to kill all the skinny people in the world through poison in their coffee creamers. He and Kevin head to the lab where they find Dick Roman being killed by Dean and Castiel. After Dick explodes, Dean and Castiel disappear and Crowley appears and takes Kevin, leaving Sam completely on his own, not knowing Dean and Castiel are now trapped in Purgatory.\n\n===Season 8===\nThe year Sam spends while Dean and Castiel are trapped in Purgatory is revealed through various [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s in the first half of the season. Now left on his own, Sam believes that Dean had been killed when Dick exploded, and gives up hunting. After several months, he accidentally runs over a stray dog and, panicked, takes it to an animal hospital. The veterinarian who saves the dog's life \u2013 Amelia Richardson \u2013 convinces Sam to take responsibility for the stray by adopting it.<ref name=\"weneedtotalkaboutkevin\">{{cite episode|title= We Need to Talk About Kevin |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Jeremy Carver Director: Robert Singer|network=CW |airdate=October 3, 2012 |season=8 |number=1 |minutes=}}</ref> Despite a rocky start, Sam and Amelia fall in love and even buy a house together in Kermit, Texas.<ref name=\"hunteriheroici\">{{cite episode|title= Hunteri Heroici |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Andrew Dabb Director: Paul Edwards|network=CW |airdate=November 28, 2012 |season=8 |number=8 |minutes=}}</ref> They later find out that her husband Don, who she had believed was [[killed in action]],<ref name=\"southerncomfort\">{{cite episode|title= Southern Comfort |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Adam Glass Director: Tim Andrew|network=CW |airdate=November 7, 2012 |season=8 |number=6 |minutes=}}</ref> was actually still alive.<ref name=\"hunteriheroici\" /> Sam wants to stay with Amelia, but ultimately decides to leave and give her the opportunity to reconnect with Don.<ref name=\"citizenfang\">{{cite episode|title= Citizen Fang |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Daniel Loflin Director: Nick Copus|network=CW |airdate=December 5, 2012 |season=8 |number=9 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\nIn the season premiere \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\", Sam runs into Dean and learns that Dean had just escaped from Purgatory; upon learning about what Sam had been doing the past year, Dean is upset that Sam had not even tried to save him or continued hunting.

Sam feels guilty and joins Dean in tracking down Kevin, who reveals that he has discovered a passage in the Word of God that would banish all demons from Earth forever.<ref name=\"weneedtotalkaboutkevin\" /> The spell requires three trials be performed by one person. Although Dean tries to do it himself in order to protect Sam from any possible consequence of the trials, Sam ends up completing the first trial (killing a hellhound and bathing in its blood) in \"Trial and Error\" to protect Dean; he persuades his brother to let him finish the rest by reasoning that Dean would be all-too-willing to sacrifice himself for the trials whereas Sam would fight so that both of them could live.

Martin contacts Sam in \"Citizen Fang\" to tell him that he believes Benny killed somebody, bringing the Winchesters to Carencro, Louisiana to help investigate. However, upon receiving an emergency text from Amelia and being unable to get a hold of her, Sam tears back to Kermit. He finds Amelia happily reunited with Don, and realizes that the text had been a trick by Dean to divert him from Benny. Enraged, Sam initially refuses to continue hunting with Dean in the following episode. Castiel \u2013 who has been mysteriously rescued from Purgatory \u2013 enlists his help in saving the angel Samandriel from being tortured by Crowley, forcing the brothers to reluctantly work together again.

Sam is on the verge of fully restoring Crowley's humanity when Dean finds out that completing the trials will kill Sam. Although Sam, having fallen into deep guilt and despair due to constant reminders from Dean of how he'd failed him, wants to finish the trials anyway, Dean convinces him to let it go. The effects of the trials remain, however, leaving Sam in dire condition in the final moments of the finale.<ref name=\"sacrifice\" />\n\n===Season 9===\nSam is close to death in the premiere, \"I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here\"; it is revealed that the trials have severely burned his internal organs as well as cut off [[oxygen]]-flow to his [[brain]], and that he has virtually no chance of survival. Having slipped into a [[coma]], Sam has a dream in which he realizes that he is dying and struggles between whether or not he should even try to fight, eventually electing to let himself die with the guarantee that this time he cannot be revived and cause anymore damage. However, the angel Gadreel is called in by Dean to save Sam through any means necessary. Disguised as Dean, Gadreel convinces Sam to let him save him and Sam agrees, unwittingly providing permission to Gadreel so that the angel can possess him due to Gadreel's ambiguously-worded question. Gadreel spends the next eight episodes healing Sam from within without Sam realizing it. In fact, Sam is completely unaware of Gadreel's presence, as the angel spends most of this time laying dormant in Sam's subconscious and he and Dean go to some lengths to prevent him finding out about it because Sam could prematurely expel Gadreel if he found out.\n\nSam is alerted to Gadreel's possession of him by Crowley in the later episode \"Road Trip\", at which point he revokes his permission and forcibly expels Gadreel from his body by ordering the angel out. To his horror, he also finds out that Gadreel has killed Kevin using his body to prove his loyalty to [[List of angels in Supernatural#Metatron|Metatron]]. Sam is appalled and angry at how far Dean will go to keep him alive, feeling betrayed that Dean not only helped Gadreel possess him and hid the truth from him but also for persuaded him not to finish the trials and thus kept the gates of Hell open and allowed demons to continue wreaking havoc, all to keep Sam alive. Sam lets a guilt-ridden Dean leave at the end of the episode. In the following episode \"First Born\", Sam works with Castiel to extract a lingering piece of Gadreel's grace (angelic energy) so that they can track him. Feeling guilty over the deaths he could have stopped, especially Kevin's, Sam urges Castiel to extract all of the grace still inside him, even though it may kill Sam because the grace is keeping him from reverting to his deathly state prior his possession. However, Castiel refuses to risk Sam's life. As a result, the amount of grace they gather is insufficient to track Gadreel.\n\nSam runs into Dean on the same case in \"Sharp Teeth\". Although Dean tries to divert Sam from the case so that they won't have to work together again, Sam reveals that he is willing to work with Dean again so long as it is on a strictly professional basis, telling him that they cannot work on a brotherly basis anymore because Dean has lost his trust. At the end of \"The Purge\", Sam responds to Dean's attempts to justify his decisions by saying that Dean's choices are not as selfless as Dean paints them and that he would not have done what Dean did given the same situation, which stuns Dean into silence.\n\nThe two eventually begin to come back together as Sam learns more about Abaddon's history and plans after he learns that she has been taking souls while leaving the victims 'alive', much like he was after his escape from Hell. They eventually manage to determine the location of a portal to Heaven that allows Castiel to trap Metatron while Dean kills Abaddon with the First Blade \u2013 acquired from Cain himself and the only weapon capable of killing a Knight of Hell \u2013 but Castiel is left dying of the grace he stole to regain his powers while Dean is transformed into a demon due to the First Blade's influence.\n\n===Season 10===\nAfter spending six weeks tracking the transformed Dean \u2013 along with a brief confrontation with a man named Cole whose father was killed by Dean on a prior hunt \u2013 Sam manages to capture Dean while he is distracted, taking him back to the bunker to treat him with the demon cure. Despite demon-Dean's attempts to undermine his and Sam's relationship through his demonically-warped perspective, Sam is eventually able to cure Dean and restore him to humanity, although he continues to be concerned about Dean's emotional state after his time as a demon and the possibility that the [[Mark of Cain]] could transform him again. After Dean kills their ancestor Cain, Sam is weary of his brother and wants to free him of the curse.\n\nWhen Dean meets with Death, he offers to remove Dean from society on the condition that he kill Sam because he'll likely intervene. Although he initially agrees, Sam is nearly killed by Dean who soon relents and kills Death instead. However, due to Sam's earlier machinations, the Mark is removed and the Darkness is unleashed regardless.\n\n===Season 11===\nWith the Darkness unleashed, Sam and Dean set out to try to find the Darkness, but are shaken to learn that the entity they are hunting is essentially God's sister, who was 'sacrificed' so that he could create the world. Manifesting as a woman who comes to call herself Amara, Sam learns Dean is drawn to her from a twisted attraction, but matters become even more complicated when Castiel consents to act the vessel for Lucifer when he becomes convinced that only an archangel has any chance against Amara. This strategy fails- speculated to be due to Lucifer's status as a ''fallen'' archangel- but the Winchesters are eventually contacted by the true God, now revealed to be Chuck Surely, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels, who is able to make peace with Amara and depart. Sam briefly believes Dean is dead and is kidnapped by a mysterious woman.\n\n===Season 12===\nSam is kidnapped by the British branch of the Men of Letters who torture him but he resists. Sam is later reunited with his brother and mother  attack the Winchesters to try to take control of America's hunters and Lucifer is left on the run trying to find a new vessel. Lucifer eventually takes the President of the United States as a vessel, but the Winchesters are able to banish him from this host.\n\nWhile the Winchesters discover that Lucifer conceived a child while possessing the President, they are left to guard the child's mother while Mary explores the possibility of an alliance with the British Men of Letters. Although Castiel concludes that Lucifer's child is worth protecting, the potential alliance with the Men of Letters ends when the group prove to be excessively ruthless, to the point of killing a hunter who had assisted the Winchesters on a case because she accidentally killed one of their members.\n\n===Season 13===\nThe Winchesters are eventually able to banish Lucifer to a parallel universe where the Apocalypse took place 'on schedule', in 2012, but this plan backfired when Lucifer alerted the alternate version of Michael to the existence of the original world, as well as leaving them with the complication of trying to raise Lucifer's suddenly-adult son, Jack Kline. (Jack is 6 months old, chronologically). Sam bonds with Jack who soon comes to see the Winchesters and a resurrected Castiel as his 'fathers', while they gain a new ally when they discover that Gabriel survived his death, in season 5, but although they are able to return to the Apocalypse World to rescue several humans (including alternate versions of Bobby Singer and Charlie Bradbury), the alternate Michael ,and Lucifer follow them into this world.\n\nStuck for options to stop Lucifer after he takes Jack's grace to charge his own powers, Sam is beaten by the Archangel until Dean agrees to act as Michael's vessel. Sam watches Dean defeats Lucifer, but is stunned when Michael takes control of Dean's body after Lucifer's death.\n\n===Season 14===\nWith Michael using Dean's body, Sam spends the next few weeks leading the refugees of Apocalypse world in hunts or adjusting to the new world. Sam later uses his reputation as a legendary hunter to abolish the position of Ruler of Hell, to any demon who seek to take control of Hell.\n\nSam is briefly reunited with his brother when Michael abandons Dean to continue his own plans while wearing down Dean's willingness to resist, but although Michael eventually takes Dean as his vessel again, with the aid of his family Dean is able to trap Michael in his subconscious. When Dean starts creating the Malik box, Sam is informed of his brother's plan but Dean accepts Sam's argument that they will still try and find another way first.\n\nSam is briefly reunited with his father after a pearl with magical abilities grants him that which his heart desires. Although Dean hoped that his heart desire would be Michael out of his head, the family reunion was heart touching. John was forced to return to his own time before an alternate time line could ensue.\n\nStill abandoning his plan to seal himself in the Malik box, Sam accompanies Dean, Castiel, and Jack in a fairly routine hunt. During this, Sam tends to Dean when he gets knocked unconscious only to wake and find that Michael has escaped his mind. After slaughtering many hunters in his wake, Michael tortures the Winchesters but is confronted and killed by Jack Kline, who uses his soul to draw on his angelic abilities. In killing Michael, Jack not only burned off his soul, but also absorbed the grace of Micheal, restoring him to his powerful state as a Nephilim. Due to this, Sam becomes increasingly more concerned with the condition of Jack\u2019s soul.\n\nParallel to this, the previous vessel of Lucifer engages in a plan to raise Lucifer from the empty. Jack is able to stop him in a grotesque killing which leaves Mary Winchester in a state of deep concern. Jack becomes frustrated and accidentally uses his powers to kill Mary. Dean finds out about his mother\u2019s death and starts into a fit of anger fueled by grief. On a mission to kill Jack, Chuck makes an appearance, supplying a gun which will do to the holder what it does to the victim. Sam is shocked when Dean accepts this as a solution for his building anger towards Jack but Sam becomes skeptical of God's intention and soon finds Dean aiming, point blank, at Jack.  Dean realizes that this is not the solution and drops the gun, eliciting an angered response from Chuck. Sam, Dean, and Castiel begin to realize that their lives have been nothing more than entertainment to Chuck, while he pulls the strings. Chuck kills Jack and Sam shoots God who soon releases every evil spirit from hell to attack the trio in a dramatic show of frustration, with a prequel statement \u201cStory\u2019s over. Welcome to the end.\u201d Sam characteristically takes a fighting stance as the swarm engulfs him, his brother, and Castiel.\n\n=== Season 15 ===\nAfter Chuck brings on the end breaking open the gates of hell, Sam, Dean, Castiel deals with the after effects dealing with a horde of zombies and ghosts. Sam meanwhile, discovers through nightmares and flashes of what he believes are God's memories that he's connected to Chuck through the gunshot wound that's not healing. While this is all going on Sam deals with his guilt from killing Rowena while also becoming close to Eileen. \n\nChuck traps Eileen and Sam and forces Sam to witness multiple possible futures, as what was preventing the gunshot wound from healing from Sam's hope that Sam, Dean, and all their allies would defeat Chuck. At the end Sam loses his hope, Chuck returns to full strength and Eileen leaves to deal with the events that Chuck put in place that made her a pawn to use against Sam.\n\nWith Chuck back at full health, he takes away whatever luck that Sam and Dean had that prevented them from experiences normal things like a common cold or toothache, as the answer a call from Garth.

Dean finds and confronts them and tries to kill Ruby, but Sam intervenes. He and Dean argue about how to stop the Apocalypse, whereupon Dean tells Sam he's changing into a monster, leading to a vicious fight between the brothers.

Using his powers to torture the demon, she gives the location, but as Sam is about to drink her blood, the demon gives control to her human host, inciting immense guilt in Sam. A message from Dean, altered by the manipulative, arrogant angel Zachariah, manipulates Sam, pushing him to continue his original mission to kill Lilith; he then drains the woman of her blood anyway. Ruby and Sam go to St. Mary's Convent in [[Ilchester, Maryland]], where they find Lilith. As Sam attempts to kill Lilith, Ruby holds the doors shut to keep Dean, who has just arrived, from interfering. Sam hesitates when he hears his brother yelling for him, but when Lilith mocks him for his inability to do the job \u2013 even after becoming a monster to do so \u2013 he finishes her off, fulfilling his true destiny as the \"special child.\" Lilith's death breaks the final seal and begins forming a portal for Lucifer. At this point, Ruby reveals that she was leading Sam along the entire time so he would break the seal. Dean finally enters the room and kills Ruby with her own knife, while Sam holds her in place.

A bright light shines and Dean looks upon an unconscious Sam as he opens the portal to Lucifer's prison. Although \"Sam\" says that he has Lucifer under control, it is shown that Lucifer was just taunting Dean. Lucifer closes the portal and takes the rings before disappearing. At an unknown location, Sam continues to fight Lucifer internally for control over his body. While talking through a mirror, Lucifer tries to persuade Sam to embrace their union by slaughtering demons that were watching Sam throughout his entire life.<ref name=\"swan song\">{{cite episode|title= Swan Song|series=Supernatural |network=CW |airdate=May 13, 2010|season=5|number=22 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\nDuring Lucifer's confrontation at [[Stull, Kansas|Stull Cemetery]] with Michael (using [[List of Supernatural characters#Adam Milligan|Adam]] as his vessel), he beats Dean, slamming him against the door of the Impala.

The sudden arousal of Sam's childhood memories and those of the bond of brotherhood he shares with Dean allows him to overpower Lucifer and regain control of his body. Sam takes out the rings, reopens the portal, and prepares to throw himself in. Having been temporarily banished by Castiel, Michael returns and attempts to stop him, but Sam jumps in, pulling Michael also with him \u2013 trapping both Lucifer and Michael in Lucifer's cage. The ground closes up with a stunned, devastated Dean watching. Later, it is shown that Dean fulfills his promise to Sam and has gone back to find Lisa.

In the season finale, Sam spends much of the episode attempting to recoup his shattered soul, including the memories of his soulless self and tortured self. Once complete, he reawakens, though still struggling with the visions of the Cage that his soul endured.\n\n===Season 7===\nAfter Castiel's actions result in the release of the Leviathans \u2013 God's first creations \u2013 Sam is left struggling with the restoration of his memories of his time in Hell, even if he remains dedicated to helping Dean and others stop the Leviathans. During this time, he has a reunion with his old [[Kitsune]] friend, Amy Pond, who has become a mortician feeding on the dead to sustain her, although Dean nevertheless kills her when he discovers that she has been killing to help her sick son. As Sam experiences hallucinations of Lucifer taunting him with the idea that he is still in Hell, he initially tries to control them by focusing on wounds he sustains in the real world, but matters become worse when he is forced to rely on information from the hallucination to save Dean. As his mental state becomes worse, Sam foregoes sleep to stop his visions, but is sent to an asylum when he is hit by a car while running away from Lucifer. While trying to find a healer who may be able to repair Sam, Dean encounters an amnesiac Castiel, who, when restored to his full powers, sacrifices himself by taking Sam's mental damage. Sam is shown to possess great guilt about this and rejects hope that Bobby's ghost may be helping them out after an attempt to communicate with him fails. Sam is initially happy when it is shown that Bobby's ghost is there helping them, but changes his mind after Bobby shows more and more signs of becoming a [[vengeful spirit]]. During the final battle at Sucrocorp, Sam rescues [[Kevin Tran (Supernatural)|Kevin Tran]] \u2013 a Prophet who can read the Word of God \u2013 and is horrified to hear of Dick Roman's plan to kill all the skinny people in the world through poison in their coffee creamers. He and Kevin head to the lab where they find Dick Roman being killed by Dean and Castiel. After Dick explodes, Dean and Castiel disappear and Crowley appears and takes Kevin, leaving Sam completely on his own, not knowing Dean and Castiel are now trapped in Purgatory.\n\n===Season 8===\nThe year Sam spends while Dean and Castiel are trapped in Purgatory is revealed through various [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s in the first half of the season. Now left on his own, Sam believes that Dean had been killed when Dick exploded, and gives up hunting. After several months, he accidentally runs over a stray dog and, panicked, takes it to an animal hospital. The veterinarian who saves the dog's life \u2013 Amelia Richardson \u2013 convinces Sam to take responsibility for the stray by adopting it.<ref name=\"weneedtotalkaboutkevin\">{{cite episode|title= We Need to Talk About Kevin |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Jeremy Carver Director: Robert Singer|network=CW |airdate=October 3, 2012 |season=8 |number=1 |minutes=}}</ref> Despite a rocky start, Sam and Amelia fall in love and even buy a house together in Kermit, Texas.<ref name=\"hunteriheroici\">{{cite episode|title= Hunteri Heroici |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Andrew Dabb Director: Paul Edwards|network=CW |airdate=November 28, 2012 |season=8 |number=8 |minutes=}}</ref> They later find out that her husband Don, who she had believed was [[killed in action]],<ref name=\"southerncomfort\">{{cite episode|title= Southern Comfort |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Adam Glass Director: Tim Andrew|network=CW |airdate=November 7, 2012 |season=8 |number=6 |minutes=}}</ref> was actually still alive.<ref name=\"hunteriheroici\" /> Sam wants to stay with Amelia, but ultimately decides to leave and give her the opportunity to reconnect with Don.<ref name=\"citizenfang\">{{cite episode|title= Citizen Fang |series=Supernatural |credits=Writer: Daniel Loflin Director: Nick Copus|network=CW |airdate=December 5, 2012 |season=8 |number=9 |minutes=}}</ref>\n\nIn the season premiere \"We Need to Talk About Kevin\", Sam runs into Dean and learns that Dean had just escaped from Purgatory; upon learning about what Sam had been doing the past year, Dean is upset that Sam had not even tried to save him or continued hunting.

Sam feels guilty and joins Dean in tracking down Kevin, who reveals that he has discovered a passage in the Word of God that would banish all demons from Earth forever.<ref name=\"weneedtotalkaboutkevin\" /> The spell requires three trials be performed by one person. Although Dean tries to do it himself in order to protect Sam from any possible consequence of the trials, Sam ends up completing the first trial (killing a hellhound and bathing in its blood) in \"Trial and Error\" to protect Dean; he persuades his brother to let him finish the rest by reasoning that Dean would be all-too-willing to sacrifice himself for the trials whereas Sam would fight so that both of them could live.

Martin contacts Sam in \"Citizen Fang\" to tell him that he believes Benny killed somebody, bringing the Winchesters to Carencro, Louisiana to help investigate. However, upon receiving an emergency text from Amelia and being unable to get a hold of her, Sam tears back to Kermit. He finds Amelia happily reunited with Don, and realizes that the text had been a trick by Dean to divert him from Benny. Enraged, Sam initially refuses to continue hunting with Dean in the following episode. Castiel \u2013 who has been mysteriously rescued from Purgatory \u2013 enlists his help in saving the angel Samandriel from being tortured by Crowley, forcing the brothers to reluctantly work together again.

Sam is on the verge of fully restoring Crowley's humanity when Dean finds out that completing the trials will kill Sam. Although Sam, having fallen into deep guilt and despair due to constant reminders from Dean of how he'd failed him, wants to finish the trials anyway, Dean convinces him to let it go. The effects of the trials remain, however, leaving Sam in dire condition in the final moments of the finale.<ref name=\"sacrifice\" />\n\n===Season 9===\nSam is close to death in the premiere, \"I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here\"; it is revealed that the trials have severely burned his internal organs as well as cut off [[oxygen]]-flow to his [[brain]], and that he has virtually no chance of survival. Having slipped into a [[coma]], Sam has a dream in which he realizes that he is dying and struggles between whether or not he should even try to fight, eventually electing to let himself die with the guarantee that this time he cannot be revived and cause anymore damage. However, the angel Gadreel is called in by Dean to save Sam through any means necessary. Disguised as Dean, Gadreel convinces Sam to let him save him and Sam agrees, unwittingly providing permission to Gadreel so that the angel can possess him due to Gadreel's ambiguously-worded question. Gadreel spends the next eight episodes healing Sam from within without Sam realizing it. In fact, Sam is completely unaware of Gadreel's presence, as the angel spends most of this time laying dormant in Sam's subconscious and he and Dean go to some lengths to prevent him finding out about it because Sam could prematurely expel Gadreel if he found out.\n\nSam is alerted to Gadreel's possession of him by Crowley in the later episode \"Road Trip\", at which point he revokes his permission and forcibly expels Gadreel from his body by ordering the angel out. To his horror, he also finds out that Gadreel has killed Kevin using his body to prove his loyalty to [[List of angels in Supernatural#Metatron|Metatron]]. Sam is appalled and angry at how far Dean will go to keep him alive, feeling betrayed that Dean not only helped Gadreel possess him and hid the truth from him but also for persuaded him not to finish the trials and thus kept the gates of Hell open and allowed demons to continue wreaking havoc, all to keep Sam alive. Sam lets a guilt-ridden Dean leave at the end of the episode. In the following episode \"First Born\", Sam works with Castiel to extract a lingering piece of Gadreel's grace (angelic energy) so that they can track him. Feeling guilty over the deaths he could have stopped, especially Kevin's, Sam urges Castiel to extract all of the grace still inside him, even though it may kill Sam because the grace is keeping him from reverting to his deathly state prior his possession. However, Castiel refuses to risk Sam's life. As a result, the amount of grace they gather is insufficient to track Gadreel.\n\nSam runs into Dean on the same case in \"Sharp Teeth\". Although Dean tries to divert Sam from the case so that they won't have to work together again, Sam reveals that he is willing to work with Dean again so long as it is on a strictly professional basis, telling him that they cannot work on a brotherly basis anymore because Dean has lost his trust. At the end of \"The Purge\", Sam responds to Dean's attempts to justify his decisions by saying that Dean's choices are not as selfless as Dean paints them and that he would not have done what Dean did given the same situation, which stuns Dean into silence.\n\nThe two eventually begin to come back together as Sam learns more about Abaddon's history and plans after he learns that she has been taking souls while leaving the victims 'alive', much like he was after his escape from Hell. They eventually manage to determine the location of a portal to Heaven that allows Castiel to trap Metatron while Dean kills Abaddon with the First Blade \u2013 acquired from Cain himself and the only weapon capable of killing a Knight of Hell \u2013 but Castiel is left dying of the grace he stole to regain his powers while Dean is transformed into a demon due to the First Blade's influence.\n\n===Season 10===\nAfter spending six weeks tracking the transformed Dean \u2013 along with a brief confrontation with a man named Cole whose father was killed by Dean on a prior hunt \u2013 Sam manages to capture Dean while he is distracted, taking him back to the bunker to treat him with the demon cure. Despite demon-Dean's attempts to undermine his and Sam's relationship through his demonically-warped perspective, Sam is eventually able to cure Dean and restore him to humanity, although he continues to be concerned about Dean's emotional state after his time as a demon and the possibility that the [[Mark of Cain]] could transform him again. After Dean kills their ancestor Cain, Sam is weary of his brother and wants to free him of the curse.\n\nWhen Dean meets with Death, he offers to remove Dean from society on the condition that he kill Sam because he'll likely intervene. Although he initially agrees, Sam is nearly killed by Dean who soon relents and kills Death instead. However, due to Sam's earlier machinations, the Mark is removed and the Darkness is unleashed regardless.\n\n===Season 11===\nWith the Darkness unleashed, Sam and Dean set out to try to find the Darkness, but are shaken to learn that the entity they are hunting is essentially God's sister, who was 'sacrificed' so that he could create the world. Manifesting as a woman who comes to call herself Amara, Sam learns Dean is drawn to her from a twisted attraction, but matters become even more complicated when Castiel consents to act the vessel for Lucifer when he becomes convinced that only an archangel has any chance against Amara. This strategy fails- speculated to be due to Lucifer's status as a ''fallen'' archangel- but the Winchesters are eventually contacted by the true God, now revealed to be Chuck Surely, the author who wrote the Winchester Gospels, who is able to make peace with Amara and depart. Sam briefly believes Dean is dead and is kidnapped by a mysterious woman.\n\n===Season 12===\nSam is kidnapped by the British branch of the Men of Letters who torture him but he resists. Sam is later reunited with his brother and mother  attack the Winchesters to try to take control of America's hunters and Lucifer is left on the run trying to find a new vessel. Lucifer eventually takes the President of the United States as a vessel, but the Winchesters are able to banish him from this host.\n\nWhile the Winchesters discover that Lucifer conceived a child while possessing the President, they are left to guard the child's mother while Mary explores the possibility of an alliance with the British Men of Letters. Although Castiel concludes that Lucifer's child is worth protecting, the potential alliance with the Men of Letters ends when the group prove to be excessively ruthless, to the point of killing a hunter who had assisted the Winchesters on a case because she accidentally killed one of their members.\n\n===Season 13===\nThe Winchesters are eventually able to banish Lucifer to a parallel universe where the Apocalypse took place 'on schedule', in 2012, but this plan backfired when Lucifer alerted the alternate version of Michael to the existence of the original world, as well as leaving them with the complication of trying to raise Lucifer's suddenly-adult son, Jack Kline. (Jack is 6 months old, chronologically). Sam bonds with Jack who soon comes to see the Winchesters and a resurrected Castiel as his 'fathers', while they gain a new ally when they discover that Gabriel survived his death, in season 5, but although they are able to return to the Apocalypse World to rescue several humans (including alternate versions of Bobby Singer and Charlie Bradbury), the alternate Michael ,and Lucifer follow them into this world.\n\nStuck for options to stop Lucifer after he takes Jack's grace to charge his own powers, Sam is beaten by the Archangel until Dean agrees to act as Michael's vessel. Sam watches Dean defeats Lucifer, but is stunned when Michael takes control of Dean's body after Lucifer's death.\n\n===Season 14===\nWith Michael using Dean's body, Sam spends the next few weeks leading the refugees of Apocalypse world in hunts or adjusting to the new world. Sam later uses his reputation as a legendary hunter to abolish the position of Ruler of Hell, to any demon who seek to take control of Hell.\n\nSam is briefly reunited with his brother when Michael abandons Dean to continue his own plans while wearing down Dean's willingness to resist, but although Michael eventually takes Dean as his vessel again, with the aid of his family Dean is able to trap Michael in his subconscious. When Dean starts creating the Malik box, Sam is informed of his brother's plan but Dean accepts Sam's argument that they will still try and find another way first.\n\nSam is briefly reunited with his father after a pearl with magical abilities grants him that which his heart desires. Although Dean hoped that his heart desire would be Michael out of his head, the family reunion was heart touching. John was forced to return to his own time before an alternate time line could ensue.\n\nStill abandoning his plan to seal himself in the Malik box, Sam accompanies Dean, Castiel, and Jack in a fairly routine hunt. During this, Sam tends to Dean when he gets knocked unconscious only to wake and find that Michael has escaped his mind. After slaughtering many hunters in his wake, Michael tortures the Winchesters but is confronted and killed by Jack Kline, who uses his soul to draw on his angelic abilities. In killing Michael, Jack not only burned off his soul, but also absorbed the grace of Micheal, restoring him to his powerful state as a Nephilim. Due to this, Sam becomes increasingly more concerned with the condition of Jack\u2019s soul.\n\nParallel to this, the previous vessel of Lucifer engages in a plan to raise Lucifer from the empty. Jack is able to stop him in a grotesque killing which leaves Mary Winchester in a state of deep concern. Jack becomes frustrated and accidentally uses his powers to kill Mary. Dean finds out about his mother\u2019s death and starts into a fit of anger fueled by grief. On a mission to kill Jack, Chuck makes an appearance, supplying a gun which will do to the holder what it does to the victim. Sam is shocked when Dean accepts this as a solution for his building anger towards Jack but Sam becomes skeptical of God's intention and soon finds Dean aiming, point blank, at Jack.  Dean realizes that this is not the solution and drops the gun, eliciting an angered response from Chuck. Sam, Dean, and Castiel begin to realize that their lives have been nothing more than entertainment to Chuck, while he pulls the strings. Chuck kills Jack and Sam shoots God who soon releases every evil spirit from hell to attack the trio in a dramatic show of frustration, with a prequel statement \u201cStory\u2019s over. Welcome to the end.\u201d Sam characteristically takes a fighting stance as the swarm engulfs him, his brother, and Castiel.\n\n=== Season 15 ===\nAfter Chuck brings on the end breaking open the gates of hell, Sam, Dean, Castiel deals with the after effects dealing with a horde of zombies and ghosts. Sam meanwhile, discovers through nightmares and flashes of what he believes are God's memories that he's connected to Chuck through the gunshot wound that's not healing. While this is all going on Sam deals with his guilt from killing Rowena while also becoming close to Eileen. \n\nChuck traps Eileen and Sam and forces Sam to witness multiple possible futures, as what was preventing the gunshot wound from healing from Sam's hope that Sam, Dean, and all their allies would defeat Chuck. At the end Sam loses his hope, Chuck returns to full strength and Eileen leaves to deal with the events that Chuck put in place that made her a pawn to use against Sam.\n\nWith Chuck back at full health, he takes away whatever luck that Sam and Dean had that prevented them from experiences normal things like a common cold or toothache, as the answer a call from Garth.
