He studied art at [[State University College at Buffalo]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], receiving a BFA in 1980; and subsequently received a MFA in art and film from [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1984 (working under [[Chris Burden]], [[Charles Ray (artist)|Charles Ray]], and [[Shirley Clarke]]. He lived and worked in [[Los Angeles]] from 1980 until 2017. From 1997 to 2017 he taught studio arts at [[Art Center College of Design]], [[Pasadena]]. He has had solo exhibitions at [[Kunsthalle Wien]], Vienna; the [[University of Houston]]; the [[Laguna Art Museum]], [[Laguna Beach]]; and [[Exit Art]], [[New York City|New York]], among others. He has participated in group exhibitions at the [[Orange County Museum of Art]], [[Newport Beach]], CA; the [[Getty Museum]], [[Los Angeles]]; Human Resources, Los Angeles, CA; [[MoMA PS1]], [[Long Island City]], NY; the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]; [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]], the Louisiana Museum of Art, Humbleb\u00e6k, Denmark; and [[Secession]], Vienna; and he has received awards and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], and Art Matters, among others.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\nArnold is best known for [[performance art]] actions in which he seeks to become an object named in the title of each work. For example, by loosely approximating the shape or style of a given object \u2013 usually but not always a sculptural artefact or architectural feature \u2013 Arnold has sought to resemble: a [[scarecrow]] in ''Scare Crow'' (Conklin Forks, New York, 1986), a [[closet]] in ''Closet Corner'' (Los Angeles, 1987), a [[sculpture]] in a [[fountain]] in ''A Sculpture in a Fountain'' (Los Angeles, 1988), a [[hood ornament]] in ''Hood Ornament'' (Sun Valley, California, 1992), a [[gargoyle]] in ''Gargoyle'' (Los Angeles, 1992), a [[statue]] in ''Statue'' (Los Angeles, 1993), an [[appendage]] (to a [[telephone pole]]) in ''Appendage'' (Los Angeles, 1993), part of a [[marquee (sign)|marquee]] in ''Marquee'' or the [[fa\u00e7ade]] of a building in ''Fa\u00e7ade'' (Geneva, 1996), or is shipped as [[freight]] from Austria to Germany in ''Freight'' (Linz to Cologne, 1993).\n\nArnold also makes [[video art]] works, including performances for camera, and short playful pieces that resemble skits, pranks or TV advertisements. Representative video works include ''Punch'' (1984), a video-sculpture that shows a 15-second loop of Arnold being punched hard in the gut and falling through the frames of two stacked monitors; the ''Activities Made for TV'' series (1983-1992) that involve him undertaking simple actions such as barking at a concealed dog in ''Antagination'' (1976), rolling his head along Saint Patrick's Wall in ''Roll'' (1986), or eating an olive in an [[X-ray]] machine in '' Skip Eats an Olive'' (1984); and the more recent ''Whipping'' series (2017), in which Arnold spins in circles with outstretched arms, and has edited the video such that his body resembles a ceiling fan.\n\nOther works involved Arnold undertaking durational tasks in public, such as navigating the [[Bermuda Triangle]] in ''B. T. Exploration'' (1996), funded by a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]; being installed underneath a sheet of glass at the entrance to the Basel Art Fair such that visitors had to walk over him to enter the event (''Gruezi'', 2002); being installed wrapped in plastic in a public square in Slovakia (''An Occurrence at Nove Z\u00e1mky'', 2002); or taking eight-hour showers daily for four days in a hotel room during the Gramercy International Art Fair (''Shower'', 1997).\n\nArnold also engages in long-term project-based works, for example ''Truffle Hunt'' (1998), a collaboration with artists [[Jason Rhoades]] and Hans Weigand. It was originally conceived for Rhoades\u2019s ''International Museum Project About Leaving and Arriving (I.M.P.A.L.A.)'', and involved Arnold, Rhoades, and Weigand journeying to Italy via Switzerland in search of truffles; in its exhibited form at [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]] in 2018 (January 28-April 8), it  included maps of their journey to different locations in the countryside, Polaroids, video clips, and related ephemera, as well as one of the truffles smuggled back to Los Angeles by the artists, installed on a turntable.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\nIn a widely reproduced manifesto, first published in 1993, Arnold has stated:\n\n<blockquote> The emphasis is on space and how/what my body does or can do. The work ranges from being extremely physical to extremely passive. <br /> To explore the relationships between self, place, and particular time. <br /> To explore fundamental gestures and concepts. <br /> My interest is the image and nothing else. <br /> I work in media that are evanescent, transient, consumed in passing, not collected. <br /> What is common to all my work is \"Skip.\" Skip is the artwork. The act of doing, my actions, my choices.<ref>http://skiparnold.com/</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nHis works are often comedic or slapstick in tone, or may appear violent or reckless.<ref>{{cite book|title=''Black Sphinx: On the Comedic in Modern Art''|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Welchman|location=Zurich|publisher=JRP Ringier|date=2008|isbn=978-0892369225|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780892369225}}</ref> His work resembles the work of fellow performance and multimedia artists associated with Los Angeles including [[Paul McCarthy]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Kim Jones (artist)|Kim Jones]], [[Eleanor Antin]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Bas Jan Ader]], or [[Chris Burden]], as well as the often-humorous work of some [[Conceptual art|Conceptual artists]] such as [[Jeffrey Vallance]] and [[John Baldessari]].

Representative video works include ''Punch'' (1984), a video-sculpture that shows a 15-second loop of Arnold being punched hard in the gut and falling through the frames of two stacked monitors; the ''Activities Made for TV'' series (1983-1992) that involve him undertaking simple actions such as barking at a concealed dog in ''Antagination'' (1976), rolling his head along Saint Patrick's Wall in ''Roll'' (1986), or eating an olive in an [[X-ray]] machine in '' Skip Eats an Olive'' (1984); and the more recent ''Whipping'' series (2017), in which Arnold spins in circles with outstretched arms, and has edited the video such that his body resembles a ceiling fan.\n\nOther works involved Arnold undertaking durational tasks in public, such as navigating the [[Bermuda Triangle]] in ''B. T. Exploration'' (1996), funded by a prestigious [[Guggenheim Fellowship]]; being installed underneath a sheet of glass at the entrance to the Basel Art Fair such that visitors had to walk over him to enter the event (''Gruezi'', 2002); being installed wrapped in plastic in a public square in Slovakia (''An Occurrence at Nove Z\u00e1mky'', 2002); or taking eight-hour showers daily for four days in a hotel room during the Gramercy International Art Fair (''Shower'', 1997).\n\nArnold also engages in long-term project-based works, for example ''Truffle Hunt'' (1998), a collaboration with artists [[Jason Rhoades]] and Hans Weigand. It was originally conceived for Rhoades\u2019s ''International Museum Project About Leaving and Arriving (I.M.P.A.L.A.)'', and involved Arnold, Rhoades, and Weigand journeying to Italy via Switzerland in search of truffles; in its exhibited form at [[Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art|ICALA]] in 2018 (January 28-April 8), it  included maps of their journey to different locations in the countryside, Polaroids, video clips, and related ephemera, as well as one of the truffles smuggled back to Los Angeles by the artists, installed on a turntable.<ref>https://www.theicala.org/en/exhibitions/8-skip-arnold-truffle-hunt</ref>\n\nIn a widely reproduced manifesto, first published in 1993, Arnold has stated:\n\n<blockquote> The emphasis is on space and how/what my body does or can do. The work ranges from being extremely physical to extremely passive. <br /> To explore the relationships between self, place, and particular time. <br /> To explore fundamental gestures and concepts. <br /> My interest is the image and nothing else. <br /> I work in media that are evanescent, transient, consumed in passing, not collected. <br /> What is common to all my work is \"Skip.\" Skip is the artwork. The act of doing, my actions, my choices.<ref>http://skiparnold.com/</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nHis works are often comedic or slapstick in tone, or may appear violent or reckless.<ref>{{cite book|title=''Black Sphinx: On the Comedic in Modern Art''|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Welchman|location=Zurich|publisher=JRP Ringier|date=2008|isbn=978-0892369225|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780892369225}}</ref> His work resembles the work of fellow performance and multimedia artists associated with Los Angeles including [[Paul McCarthy]], [[Mike Kelley (artist)|Mike Kelley]], [[Kim Jones (artist)|Kim Jones]], [[Eleanor Antin]], [[Bruce Nauman]], [[Bas Jan Ader]], or [[Chris Burden]], as well as the often-humorous work of the [[Conceptual art|Conceptual artists]] [[Jeffrey Vallance]] and [[John Baldessari]].
