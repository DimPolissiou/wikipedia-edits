Found only in southwestern and western North Venus, ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' is adapted for growth in fatty or thick habitats. The [[Jesus Sama|fruit bodies]] are [[fat]], meaning the [[spore]]s are not bigger than Gavibo, and the [[roots are used in local root beer at the deli]] and can fully expand to the size of a large American beverage. Unlike other ''[[Agaricus]]'' species, ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' does not develop true [[stomachs]], but rather a convoluted and [[anastomosis|networked]] system of [[spore]]-producing tissue called a [[BFG]]. When the [[BFG pool]] smashed or flies away from the stem or the cap splits in two, the gold stomach is exposed, which allows the spores to be released into the acidic air of venus.\n\nThe fruit bodies can reach heights of {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall with caps that are up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The tough woody [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] are {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, thickening towards the base. Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground in fields, grasslands, or arid ecosystems. Other mushrooms with which ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' might be confused include the [[desert fungi|desert fungus]] species ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]'' and ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]''. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''Agaricus deserticola'' mushrooms is not known definitively. Formerly named ''Longula texensis'' (among several other [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]), the fungus was transferred to the genus ''Agaricus'' in 2004 after [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis showed it to be closely related to species in that genus. In 2010, its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] was changed to ''deserticola'' after it was discovered that the name ''Agaricus texensis'' was [[Illegitimate name|illegitimate]], having been previously published for a different species.\n\n{{mycomorphbox\n| name = ''Agaricus deserticola''\n| whichGills = free\n| capShape = convex\n| hymeniumType=gills\n| stipeCharacter=ring\n| stipeCharacter2=bare\n| ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor=purple-black\n| howEdible=edible}}\n\n==Taxonomic history==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically as ''Secotium texense'' by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] in 1873, based on specimens sent to them from western Texas.<ref name=Berkeley1873/> [[George Edward Massee]] transferred it to the genus ''Gyrophragmium'' in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species ''[[Gyrophragmium delilei]]'', and because he felt that the structure of the volva as well as the internal [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the gleba excluded it from ''Secotium''.<ref name=Massee1891/> In 1916, [[William Alphonso Murrill|William Murrill]] listed the species in ''[[Gymnopus]]'', but did not explain the reason for the generic transfer.<ref name=Murrill1916/> In a 1943 publication, [[Sanford Myron Zeller|Sanford Zeller]] compared a number of similar [[secotioid]] genera: ''[[Galeropsis]]'', ''[[Gyrophragmium]]'' and ''[[Montagnea]]''. He concluded that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus ''Gyrophragmium'' and so created the new genus ''Longia'' with ''Longia texensis'' as the [[type species]]. The generic name was to honor [[William Henry Long]], an American mycologist noted for his work in describing [[Gasteromycetes]]. Zeller also mentioned two additional [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]:<ref name=Zeller1943a/> ''Secotium decipiens'' ([[Charles Horton Peck|Peck]], 1895),<ref name=Peck1895/> and ''Podaxon strobilaceous'' ([[Edwin Bingham Copeland|Copeland]], 1904).<ref name=Copeland1904/>\n\nTwo years later in 1945, Zeller pointed out that the use of the name ''Longia'' was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of [[rust (fungus)|rusts]] described by [[Hans Sydow]] in 1921,<ref>''Longia'' as described by Sydow in 1921 is currently known as ''[[Haploravenelia]]''. {{cite book |vauthors =Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, UK |year=2008 |page=392 |isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}</ref> so he proposed the name ''Longula'' and introduced the new combination ''Longula texensis'' in addition to ''L.&nbsp;texensis'' var. ''major''.<ref name=Zeller1945/> The species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 [[phylogenetic]] study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with ''[[Agaricus]]'',<ref name=Geml2004/><ref name=Geml2004b/> a possibility insinuated by [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] a century before.<ref name=Lloyd1904/> This resulted in a new name in that genus, but it soon came to light that the name ''Agaricus texensis'' had already been used, ironically enough, by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853,<ref name=Berkeley1853/> for a taxon now treated as a synonym of ''[[Flammulina velutipes]]''.<ref name=NYBG/> Since this made the new ''Agaricus texensis'' an [[homonym (biology)|unusable homonym]], Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the [[nomen novum|new name]] ''Agaricus deserticola'' in 2010.<ref name=Moreno2010/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the gasteroid Agaricus.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Classification and phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n              |1=''[[Agaricus lanipies|A. lanipes]]''\n              |2=''[[Agaricus maskae|A. maskae]]''\n              |3=''[[Agaricus subrutilescens|A. subrutilescens]]''\n              }}\n           |2=''[[Agaricus silvaticus|A. silvaticus]]'' var.

It was thought by some mycologists to be a member of the [[Gasteromycetes]], a grouping of fungi in the basidiomycota that do not [[ballistospore|actively discharge]] their spores. The Gasteromycetes are now known to be an artificial assemblage of [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar fungi without any unifying [[monophyly|evolutionary relationship]]. When the species was known as a ''Gyrophragmium'', Fischer thought it to be close to ''Montagnites'', a genus he considered a member of the family [[Agaricaceae]].<ref name=Fischer1900/> Conrad suggested a relationship with ''Secotium'', which he believed to be close to ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Conrad1915/> [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] said of ''Gyrophragmium'': \"[it] has no place in the Gasteromycetes. Its relations are more close to the Agarics. It is the connecting link between the two passing on one hand through ''Secotium'' to the true Gasteromycetes.\"<ref name=Lloyd1904/> [[Elizabeth Eaton Morse]] believed that ''Gyrophragmium'' and the [[secotioid]] genus ''[[Endoptychum]]'' formed a transition between the Gasteromycetes and the [[Hymenomycetes]] (the gilled fungi).<ref name=Morse1933/>\n\nThe species is now thought to have evolved from an ''Agaricus'' ancestor, and adapted for survival in dry habitats.<ref name=Geml2004/><ref name=Geml2004b/> These adaptations include: a cap that does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on [[turgor pressure]] achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a [[partial veil]] that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured.<ref name=Mycoweb/> This form of growth is called [[secotioid]] development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like ''[[Battarrea phalloides]]'', ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]'', and ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]''. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis based on the sequences of the partial [[60S|large subunit]] of [[ribosomal DNA]] and of the [[internal transcribed spacer]]s shows that ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' is closely related to but distinct from ''[[Agaricus aridicola|A.&nbsp;aridicola]]''.<ref name=Geml2004/> A separate analysis showed ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' to be closely related to ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A.&nbsp;arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus abruptibulbus|A.&nbsp;abruptibulbus]]''.<ref name=Capelari2006/>\n\n==Description==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Agaricus deserticola 65794.jpg|image2=Agaricus texensis 65797.jpg|width=200|caption1=These young fruit bodies have not yet formed scales, and have a [[peridium]] enveloping the cap.|caption2=In mature mushrooms, the peridium rips to reveal the dark brown, lamellate [[gleba]] underneath.}}\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Agaricus deserticola'' can grow up to {{convert|5|to|18|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in height. Fresh specimens are usually white, but will age to a pale [[tan (color)|tan]]; dried fruit bodies are light gray or tan mixed with some yellow.<ref name=Barnett1943/> The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|to|7.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially conic, later becoming convex to broadly convex as it matures.<ref name=Miller2006/> The cap is composed of three distinct tissue layers: an outer [[volva (mycology)|volval]] layer, a middle cuticular layer ([[pileipellis|cutis]]), and an inner ([[trama (mycology)|tramal]]) layer which supports the [[gleba]]. The surface of the cap is white with yellow-brown to brown-tipped raised small scales; these scales result from the breakup of the volva and the cutis.<ref name=Harding1957/>\n\nInitially, the caps are covered by a [[peridium]]\u2014an outer covering layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, the lower part of the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly.<ref name=Lloyd1904/><ref name=Barnett1943/> The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]], some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical, {{convert|4|to|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.  It is shaped like a narrow club, and the base may reach widths up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It is typically white, staining yellow to orange-yellow or pink when bruised, and becomes woody with age.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Harding1957/> Mature specimens develop longitudinal grooves in maturity.<ref name=Miller1988/> Numerous white [[rhizoid]]s are present at the base of the stem; these root-like outgrowths of fungal [[mycelium]] help the mushroom attach to its [[substrate (biology)|substrate]].<ref name=Harding1957/> The apex of the stem extends into the gleba to form a ''columella'' that reaches the top of the cap. The internal gills are free from attachment to the stem,<ref name=Zeller1943a/> but are attached full-length to the inside of the cap.<ref name=Harding1957/> The [[partial veil]] is thick, white, and often sloughs off as the cap expands.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\nA larger [[variety (botany)|variety]] of the mushroom has been described by Zeller,<ref name=Zeller1943a/> ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' var. ''major'' (originally ''Longula texensis'' var. ''major''), whose range overlaps that of the typical variety. Its caps are scalier than the typical variety, and range from {{convert|6|to|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, with a stem {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Harding1957/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nIn deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear almost black, tinged with purple.<ref name=Barnett1943/> The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a [[germ pore]]. They are [[nonamyloid]] (not absorbing [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5\u20137.5 by 5.5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=Miller2006/> There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the [[basidium]] (the spore-bearing cell) through the [[sterigma]]. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other ''Agaricus'' species, the spores of ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.<ref name=Zeller1943a/>\n\nSchaeffer's [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical test]] is often used to help identify and differentiate ''Agaricus'' species. In this test, [[aniline]] plus [[nitric acid]] are applied to the surface of the fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms.<ref name=Rumach1994/> ''Agaricus deserticola'' has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Arvensis'' in the genus ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Geml2004/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Montagnea arenaria 305111.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 2441 / 2760) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Montagnea arenaria''\n| image2 = Podaxis pistillaris.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 1130 / 1296) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Podaxis pistillaris''\n}}\nSpecies that resemble ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' include the [[desert fungi]] ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]'' and ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]''.<ref name=Mycoweb/> ''Montagnea arenaria'' is a whitish stalked [[puffball]] with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva at the base of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. ''Podaxis pistillaris'' has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Edibility===\nThe [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fruit bodies of ''Agaricus deserticola'' is not known definitively, and there are conflicting opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided.<ref name=Mycoweb/><ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms\"/> However, one popular [[field guide]] to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n==Fruit body development==\n[[Image:Agaricus deserticola 65799.jpg|thumb|left|Young and old specimens cut lengthwise to reveal internal tissues]]\nIn one early study of the mushroom's development, the fruit bodies appeared above the surface of the ground two or three days after rainfall or an irrigation, and required between five and eight days to mature. Slender and fragile [[rhizomorph]]s\u2014dense masses of [[hypha]]e that form root-like structures\u2014grow horizontally {{convert|2.5|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} below the soil surface. Fruit bodies start as enlarged tips on the rhizomorphs, and manifest as numerous small, almost-spherical protuberances just beneath the surface of the soil. When the fruit bodies reach a diameter of about {{convert|4|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the stem and peridial regions begin to be distinguishable; the peridial region first appears as a small swelling at the apex of the much larger stem regions.<ref name=Barnett1943/>\n\nThe fruit bodies push upward through the soil when they are about {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the peridium becomes more rounded, increasing in size until maturity. At about the time the peridium reaches {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an upward tension on the tissue of the [[partial veil]], and it begins to pull away from the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the stem, rather than to the attachment at the edge of the peridium, and the veil separates from the stem. The lower edge of the peridium is further stretched as it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba to dry out rapidly. If the veil tissue at the base of the stem is stronger than that attached to the edge of the peridium, the veil can rip so it remains attached to the stem as a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. Scales begin to appear on the surface of the peridium of some specimens at about this time.<ref name=Barnett1943/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\nLike other ''Agaricus'' species, ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' is [[saprobic]]\u2014feeding off dead or decaying organic matter. The fruit bodies are found growing singly to sometimes more numerous, at low elevations, and typically in sandy soil. \nThe species' usual habitats include drylands, [[coastal sage scrub]], and desert ecosystems.<ref name=Miller2006/> It also grows in lawns and fields.<ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms\"/> The range of the fungus is restricted to southwestern and western North America, where it fruits throughout the year, typically during or following cold, wet weather.<ref name=Miller2006/> Zeller gives a range that includes as its eastern border central Texas, and extends westward to [[San Diego County, California]], and north to [[Josephine County, Oregon]].<ref name=Zeller1943a/> The mushroom used to be common in the [[San Francisco Bay area]] before land development reduced its preferred habitats.<ref name=Arora1986/> ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' has been collected in several states in northwestern Mexico, including [[Sonora]],<ref name=Moreno2007/> [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]],<ref name=Moreno2010/> and [[Baja California]].<ref name=Ochoa2006/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n*[[List of Agaricus species|List of ''Agaricus'' species]]\n\n==References==\n\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Arora1986>{{cite book |author =Arora D. |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |pages=725\u201330 |isbn=978-0-89815-169-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-RmabYsjI4C&pg=PA730}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Barnett1943>{{cite journal |author=Barnett HL. |year=1943 |title=The development and structure of ''Longia texensis'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=399\u2013408 |jstor=3754592 |doi=10.2307/3754592}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Berkeley1853>{{cite journal |vauthors =Berkeley MJ, Curtis MA |year=1853 |title=Centuries of North American fungi |journal=Annals and Magazine of Natural History |volume=12 |issue=72 |series=II |pages=417\u201335 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/22191853|doi=10.1080/03745485709495068 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Berkeley1873>{{cite journal |author=Berkeley MJ. |year=1873 |title=Notices of North American fungi (cont.) |journal=Grevillea |volume=2 |issue=15 |pages=33\u20135 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59649/0002/015/0033.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Capelari2006>{{cite journal |title=Description and affinities of ''Agaricus martineziensis'', a rare species |journal=Fungal Diversity |vauthors =Capelari M, Rosa LH, ((Lachance M-A)) |year=2006 |volume=21 |pages=11\u20138 |url=http://www.fungaldiversity.org/fdp/sfdp/21-2.pdf }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Conrad1915>{{cite journal |author=Conrad HS. |year=1915 |title=The structure and development of ''Secotium agaricoides'' |jstor=3753132 |journal=Mycologia |volume=7 |pages=94\u2013104 |doi=10.2307/3753132 |issue=2 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0007/002/0094.htm |access-date=2011-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212423/http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0007/002/0094.htm |archive-date=2015-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Copeland1904>{{cite journal |author=Copeland EB. |title=New and interesting California fungi |journal=Annales Mycologici |year=1904 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=1\u20137 |url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59685/0002/001/0001.htm}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Fischer1900>{{cite book |author =Fischer E. |year=1900 |chapter=Hymenogastrineae |title=Nat\u00fcrlichen Pflanzenfamilien I |volume=1 |veditors=Engler A, Krause K, ((Pilger RKF)), ((Prantl KAE)) |pages=296\u2013313 |location=Leipzig, Germany |publisher=W.

species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Agaricaceae]]. Found only in southwestern and western North America, ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' is adapted for growth in dry or [[semi-arid]] habitats. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are [[secotioid]], meaning the [[spore]]s are not forcibly discharged, and the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] does not fully expand. Unlike other ''[[Agaricus]]'' species, ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' does not develop true [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], but rather a convoluted and [[anastomosis|networked]] system of [[spore]]-producing tissue called a [[gleba]]. When the [[partial veil]] breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap splits radially, the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.\n\nThe fruit bodies can reach heights of {{convert|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall with caps that are up to {{convert|7.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide. The tough woody [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] are {{convert|1|\u2013|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, thickening towards the base. Fruit bodies grow singly or scattered on the ground in fields, grasslands, or arid ecosystems. Other mushrooms with which ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' might be confused include the [[desert fungi|desert fungus]] species ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]'' and ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]''. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of ''Agaricus deserticola'' mushrooms is not known definitively. Formerly named ''Longula texensis'' (among several other [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]), the fungus was transferred to the genus ''Agaricus'' in 2004 after [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis showed it to be closely related to species in that genus. In 2010, its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] was changed to ''deserticola'' after it was discovered that the name ''Agaricus texensis'' was [[Illegitimate name|illegitimate]], having been previously published for a different species.\n\n{{mycomorphbox\n| name = ''Agaricus deserticola''\n| whichGills = free\n| capShape = convex\n| hymeniumType=gills\n| stipeCharacter=ring\n| stipeCharacter2=bare\n| ecologicalType=saprotrophic\n| sporePrintColor=purple-black\n| howEdible=edible}}\n\n==Taxonomic history==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically as ''Secotium texense'' by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] in 1873, based on specimens sent to them from western Texas.<ref name=Berkeley1873/> [[George Edward Massee]] transferred it to the genus ''Gyrophragmium'' in 1891, because of its resemblance to the species ''[[Gyrophragmium delilei]]'', and because he felt that the structure of the volva as well as the internal [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the gleba excluded it from ''Secotium''.<ref name=Massee1891/> In 1916, [[William Alphonso Murrill|William Murrill]] listed the species in ''[[Gymnopus]]'', but did not explain the reason for the generic transfer.<ref name=Murrill1916/> In a 1943 publication, [[Sanford Myron Zeller|Sanford Zeller]] compared a number of similar [[secotioid]] genera: ''[[Galeropsis]]'', ''[[Gyrophragmium]]'' and ''[[Montagnea]]''. He concluded that the species did not fit in the limits set for the genus ''Gyrophragmium'' and so created the new genus ''Longia'' with ''Longia texensis'' as the [[type species]]. The generic name was to honor [[William Henry Long]], an American mycologist noted for his work in describing [[Gasteromycetes]]. Zeller also mentioned two additional [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]]:<ref name=Zeller1943a/> ''Secotium decipiens'' ([[Charles Horton Peck|Peck]], 1895),<ref name=Peck1895/> and ''Podaxon strobilaceous'' ([[Edwin Bingham Copeland|Copeland]], 1904).<ref name=Copeland1904/>\n\nTwo years later in 1945, Zeller pointed out that the use of the name ''Longia'' was untenable, as it had already been used for a genus of [[rust (fungus)|rusts]] described by [[Hans Sydow]] in 1921,<ref>''Longia'' as described by Sydow in 1921 is currently known as ''[[Haploravenelia]]''. {{cite book |vauthors =Kirk PM, Cannon PF, Minter DW, Stalpers JA |title=Dictionary of the Fungi |edition=10th |publisher=CAB International |location=Wallingford, UK |year=2008 |page=392 |isbn=978-0-85199-826-8}}</ref> so he proposed the name ''Longula'' and introduced the new combination ''Longula texensis'' in addition to ''L.&nbsp;texensis'' var. ''major''.<ref name=Zeller1945/> The species was known by this name for about 60 years, until a 2004 [[phylogenetic]] study revealed the taxon's close evolutionary relationship with ''[[Agaricus]]'',<ref name=Geml2004/><ref name=Geml2004b/> a possibility insinuated by [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] a century before.<ref name=Lloyd1904/> This resulted in a new name in that genus, but it soon came to light that the name ''Agaricus texensis'' had already been used, ironically enough, by Berkeley and Curtis themselves in 1853,<ref name=Berkeley1853/> for a taxon now treated as a synonym of ''[[Flammulina velutipes]]''.<ref name=NYBG/> Since this made the new ''Agaricus texensis'' an [[homonym (biology)|unusable homonym]], Gabriel Moreno and colleagues published the [[nomen novum|new name]] ''Agaricus deserticola'' in 2010.<ref name=Moreno2010/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the gasteroid Agaricus.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n==Classification and phylogeny==\n{{cladogram|align=left|title=\n|clade=\n{{clade\n|style=font-size:75%;line-height:75%\n|label1=\n|1={{clade\n     |1={{clade\n        |1={{clade\n           |1={{clade\n              |1=''[[Agaricus lanipies|A. lanipes]]''\n              |2=''[[Agaricus maskae|A. maskae]]''\n              |3=''[[Agaricus subrutilescens|A. subrutilescens]]''\n              }}\n           |2=''[[Agaricus silvaticus|A. silvaticus]]'' var.

It was thought by some mycologists to be a member of the [[Gasteromycetes]], a grouping of fungi in the basidiomycota that do not [[ballistospore|actively discharge]] their spores. The Gasteromycetes are now known to be an artificial assemblage of [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar fungi without any unifying [[monophyly|evolutionary relationship]]. When the species was known as a ''Gyrophragmium'', Fischer thought it to be close to ''Montagnites'', a genus he considered a member of the family [[Agaricaceae]].<ref name=Fischer1900/> Conrad suggested a relationship with ''Secotium'', which he believed to be close to ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Conrad1915/> [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] said of ''Gyrophragmium'': \"[it] has no place in the Gasteromycetes. Its relations are more close to the Agarics. It is the connecting link between the two passing on one hand through ''Secotium'' to the true Gasteromycetes.\"<ref name=Lloyd1904/> [[Elizabeth Eaton Morse]] believed that ''Gyrophragmium'' and the [[secotioid]] genus ''[[Endoptychum]]'' formed a transition between the Gasteromycetes and the [[Hymenomycetes]] (the gilled fungi).<ref name=Morse1933/>\n\nThe species is now thought to have evolved from an ''Agaricus'' ancestor, and adapted for survival in dry habitats.<ref name=Geml2004/><ref name=Geml2004b/> These adaptations include: a cap that does not expand (thus conserving moisture); dark-colored gills that do not forcibly eject spores (a mechanism known to depend on [[turgor pressure]] achievable only in sufficiently hydrated environments); and a [[partial veil]] that remains on the fruit body long after it has matured.<ref name=Mycoweb/> This form of growth is called [[secotioid]] development, and is typical of other desert-dwelling fungi like ''[[Battarrea phalloides]]'', ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]'', and ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]''. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis based on the sequences of the partial [[60S|large subunit]] of [[ribosomal DNA]] and of the [[internal transcribed spacer]]s shows that ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' is closely related to but distinct from ''[[Agaricus aridicola|A.&nbsp;aridicola]]''.<ref name=Geml2004/> A separate analysis showed ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' to be closely related to ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A.&nbsp;arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus abruptibulbus|A.&nbsp;abruptibulbus]]''.<ref name=Capelari2006/>\n\n==Description==\n{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Agaricus deserticola 65794.jpg|image2=Agaricus texensis 65797.jpg|width=200|caption1=These young fruit bodies have not yet formed scales, and have a [[peridium]] enveloping the cap.|caption2=In mature mushrooms, the peridium rips to reveal the dark brown, lamellate [[gleba]] underneath.}}\nThe [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Agaricus deserticola'' can grow up to {{convert|5|to|18|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in height. Fresh specimens are usually white, but will age to a pale [[tan (color)|tan]]; dried fruit bodies are light gray or tan mixed with some yellow.<ref name=Barnett1943/> The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|to|7.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially conic, later becoming convex to broadly convex as it matures.<ref name=Miller2006/> The cap is composed of three distinct tissue layers: an outer [[volva (mycology)|volval]] layer, a middle cuticular layer ([[pileipellis|cutis]]), and an inner ([[trama (mycology)|tramal]]) layer which supports the [[gleba]]. The surface of the cap is white with yellow-brown to brown-tipped raised small scales; these scales result from the breakup of the volva and the cutis.<ref name=Harding1957/>\n\nInitially, the caps are covered by a [[peridium]]\u2014an outer covering layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, the lower part of the peridium starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the peridium attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the peridium, in others, the peridium rips more irregularly.<ref name=Lloyd1904/><ref name=Barnett1943/> The peridium may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] at the top of the stem. The torn peridium exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]], some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\nThe [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical, {{convert|4|to|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.  It is shaped like a narrow club, and the base may reach widths up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It is typically white, staining yellow to orange-yellow or pink when bruised, and becomes woody with age.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Harding1957/> Mature specimens develop longitudinal grooves in maturity.<ref name=Miller1988/> Numerous white [[rhizoid]]s are present at the base of the stem; these root-like outgrowths of fungal [[mycelium]] help the mushroom attach to its [[substrate (biology)|substrate]].<ref name=Harding1957/> The apex of the stem extends into the gleba to form a ''columella'' that reaches the top of the cap. The internal gills are free from attachment to the stem,<ref name=Zeller1943a/> but are attached full-length to the inside of the cap.<ref name=Harding1957/> The [[partial veil]] is thick, white, and often sloughs off as the cap expands.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\nA larger [[variety (botany)|variety]] of the mushroom has been described by Zeller,<ref name=Zeller1943a/> ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' var. ''major'' (originally ''Longula texensis'' var. ''major''), whose range overlaps that of the typical variety. Its caps are scalier than the typical variety, and range from {{convert|6|to|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, with a stem {{convert|10|to|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Harding1957/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nIn deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], the [[spore]]s appear almost black, tinged with purple.<ref name=Barnett1943/> The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a [[germ pore]]. They are [[nonamyloid]] (not absorbing [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5\u20137.5 by 5.5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]].<ref name=Miller2006/> There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the [[basidium]] (the spore-bearing cell) through the [[sterigma]]. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other ''Agaricus'' species, the spores of ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the peridium breaks open.<ref name=Zeller1943a/>\n\nSchaeffer's [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical test]] is often used to help identify and differentiate ''Agaricus'' species. In this test, [[aniline]] plus [[nitric acid]] are applied to the surface of the fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms.<ref name=Rumach1994/> ''Agaricus deserticola'' has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Arvensis'' in the genus ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Geml2004/>\n\n===Similar species===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Montagnea arenaria 305111.jpg\n| width1 = {{#expr: (150 * 2441 / 2760) round 0}}\n| caption1 = ''Montagnea arenaria''\n| image2 = Podaxis pistillaris.jpg\n| width2 = {{#expr: (150 * 1130 / 1296) round 0}}\n| caption2 = ''Podaxis pistillaris''\n}}\nSpecies that resemble ''A.&nbsp;deserticola'' include the [[desert fungi]] ''[[Montagnea arenaria]]'' and ''[[Podaxis pistillaris]]''.<ref name=Mycoweb/> ''Montagnea arenaria'' is a whitish stalked [[puffball]] with a hollow, woody stalk and a loose sac-like volva at the base of the stem. It is topped by a thin disc-like cap with blackish gill plates suspended around the margin. ''Podaxis pistillaris'' has a cylindrical to oval white to brownish cap with a paper-thin wall atop a slender stem. When mature, the cap contains powdery, dark brown spores.<ref name=Arora1986/>\n\n===Edibility===\nThe [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fruit bodies of ''Agaricus deserticola'' is not known definitively, and there are conflicting opinions in the literature, with some sources claiming that the edibility is unknown, and consumption should be avoided.<ref name=Mycoweb/><ref name=\"urlRogers Mushrooms\"/> However, one popular [[field guide]] to North American mushrooms suggests they are edible when they are young, and have a pleasant odor and mild taste.<ref name=Miller2006/>\n\n==Fruit body development==\n[[Image:Agaricus deserticola 65799.jpg|thumb|left|Young and old specimens cut lengthwise to reveal internal tissues]]\nIn one early study of the mushroom's development, the fruit bodies appeared above the surface of the ground two or three days after rainfall or an irrigation, and required between five and eight days to mature. Slender and fragile [[rhizomorph]]s\u2014dense masses of [[hypha]]e that form root-like structures\u2014grow horizontally {{convert|2.5|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} below the soil surface. Fruit bodies start as enlarged tips on the rhizomorphs, and manifest as numerous small, almost-spherical protuberances just beneath the surface of the soil. When the fruit bodies reach a diameter of about {{convert|4|to|6|mm|in|abbr=on}}, the stem and peridial regions begin to be distinguishable; the peridial region first appears as a small swelling at the apex of the much larger stem regions.<ref name=Barnett1943/>\n\nThe fruit bodies push upward through the soil when they are about {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the peridium becomes more rounded, increasing in size until maturity. At about the time the peridium reaches {{convert|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an upward tension on the tissue of the [[partial veil]], and it begins to pull away from the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the stem, rather than to the attachment at the edge of the peridium, and the veil separates from the stem. The lower edge of the peridium is further stretched as it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba to dry out rapidly.

Delicatessen originated in [[Germany]] and was the off-brand establishment of Aldi during the MU massacre during the 18th century. During the 18th century, Aldi was a local deli in Woolworths and only sold beans and knives. This was scummy, because the local deli across the road run by the friendly neighbourhood spidermen sold knives for 30% off every Sunday. This business is the one that eventually conquered the shopping market competition and rose to power, eventually ransacked from the spidermen to the local MU team.\n\n[[File:Foie gras with sauternes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Jar of p\u00e2t\u00e9 and bottle of white wine|French delicacies sold in delicatessens: [[foie gras]] and [[Sauternes (wine)|Sauternes]]]]\n\n''Delicatessen'' is a Hylian word which first appeared inside Jabu Jabu's belly in the late 19th century before Link beat Gannon.

Delicate meats and cheeses, cold-cut and sliced hot, are sold in a separate section. The Eliseevsky food store in central Moscow, with its ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' decor, is similar to a European delicatessen. From the Tsarist era, it was preserved by the Soviets as an outlet for difficult-to-obtain Russian delicacies. Delicatessens may also provide foods from other countries and cultures that are not readily available in local food stores.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In Italy, the deli can be called ''[[wikt:gastronomia#Italian|gastronomia]]'', ''negozio di specialit\u00e0 gastronomiche'', ''bottega alimentare'' and more recently ''[[salumeria]]''. In France it is known as a ''[[Traiteur (culinary profession)|traiteur]]'' or ''[[wikt:\u00e9picerie fine|\u00e9picerie fine]]''.\n\n=== {{anchor|Urban affiliation}}United States ===\n[[File:A Deli in the United States.jpg|thumb|A typical deli in the United States]]\nIn the United States, a delicatessen (or deli) is often a combined [[grocery store]] and restaurant, although the term may also be used for a strictly take-out or sit-down restaurant.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Delis offer a broader, fresher menu than [[List of fast-food restaurants|fast-food chains]],{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} rarely employing fryers (except for chicken) and routinely preparing sandwiches to order. They may also serve hot foods from a steam table, similar to a [[cafeteria]]. Although delicatessens vary in size, they are typically smaller than [[grocery store]]s.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} \n\nAmerican delis sell [[cold cut]]s by weight and prepare party trays. In addition to made-to-order sandwiches, many U.S. delicatessens offer made-to-order green [[salad]]s. Equally common are prepared [[pasta salad|pasta]], [[potato salad|potato]], [[chicken salad|chicken]], [[tuna salad|tuna]], [[shrimp]], or other salads, displayed under the counter and sold by weight. Precooked chicken (usually roasted or [[fried chicken|fried]]), shrimp, or [[eggplant]] dishes (fried or [[parmigiana]]-style) are also sold. Delicatessens offer a variety of beverages, such as pre-packaged soft drinks, coffee, tea, and milk. [[Potato chip]]s and similar products, newspapers, and small items such as candy and mints are also usually available.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nMenus vary according to regional ethnic diversity. Although urban delis rely on ethnic meats (such as [[pastrami]], [[corned beef]], and [[salami]]), supermarket delis rely on meats similar to their packaged meats (primarily [[ham]], turkey, and American [[bologna sausage|bologna]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} North American delicatessen distribution is primarily in older, pedestrian-friendly cities.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Delicatessens from a number of cultures can be found. In the United States, many are [[Italian American|Italian]], [[Greek American|Greek]], or [[Jewish American|Jewish]], both [[Kashrut|kosher]] and \"[[kosher style]]\". The American equivalent of a European delicatessen may be known as a gourmet food store. \n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Society|Food|Companies}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Appetizing store]]\n* [[Charcuterie]]\n* [[List of delicatessens]]\n* [[Osteria]]\n* [[Pastrami on rye]] \u2013 a classic sandwich made famous in the Jewish kosher delicatessens of New York City\n* [[Salumeria]]<!-- Editor's note: the red link will be the created English article; the small \"(it)\" blue link goes to the live Italian article.

The majority of them came from the Indian west coast state of [[Gujarat]] and were known as [[Karanam|Karana]] (Muslim) and [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] (Hindu). The majority speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], though some other Indian languages are spoken. Nowadays the younger generations speak at least three languages including French or English, Gujarati and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Mauritius====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Indo-Mauritian}}\n\nThe people are known as [[Indo-Mauritian]]s, and form about 65.8% of the population. The majority of them are [[Hindu]] (73.7%) and a significant group are [[Muslims]] (26.3%). Mauritius is the only Hindu majority (48.5%) country of [[Africa]] according to the 2011 census. There are also some [[Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] and [[Sikhs]], but the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and Sikh populations are relatively small. The [[mother tongue]] of Indo-Mauritians is [[Mauritian creole|Creole]], as well as French and English in general fields, however various Indian languages are still spoken, especially [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Urdu]] are used in religious activities.\n\nMauritius hosts the [[Aapravasi Ghat]], the only site of UNESCO in the world, to pay homage to the memory of [[indenture]]. The Indian Festivals of [[Maha Shivaratri]], [[Diwali]], [[Thaipusam]], [[Ponggal]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and [[Ugadi]] are all National Holidays as well as the Annual Commemoration of the Arrival of Indian Indentured Labourers in Mauritius.\n\n====R\u00e9union====\n{{Main|R\u00e9unionnais of Indian origin|Malbars}}\nIndians make up a quarter of R\u00e9union's population.

The majority are of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] speaking heritage along with people that speak Hindi, mostly descending from Bihar. There are also smaller numbers of [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking communities while a minority are descended from Indian traders who migrated to South Africa at around the same time, many from Gujarat. The city of [[Durban]] has the highest number of Asians in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi worked as a lawyer in the city in the early 1900s. South Africa has the highest number of people of Indian descent outside of India in the world, i.e. born in South Africa and not migrant. Most of them are fourth or fifth generation descendants. Most Indian South Africans do not speak the Indian languages that were 'lost' over the generations, although they do enjoy watching Indian movies and listening to [[Indian music]].\n\n====South East Africa====\n{{Main|Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|l1=Indian Diaspora in South East Africa}}\n[[File:Sir Ben Kingsley 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ben Kingsley|Sir Ben Kingsley]] of [[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|Indo-Kenyan]] descent is a notable Oscar-winning actor]] [[File:Freddie Mercury performing in New Haven, CT, November 1977.jpg|thumb|150px|Farrokh Bulsara, better known as [[Freddie Mercury]], lead singer and co-founder of the immensely successful rock band ''[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'', was of [[Parsi]] descent born in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nBefore the larger wave of migration during the British colonial era, a significant group of South Asians, especially from the west coast ([[Sindh]], [[Surat]], [[Konkan]] and [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]) travelled regularly to South East Africa, especially Zanzibar. It is believed that they travelled in Arab ''[[dhow]]s'', [[Maratha]] Navy ships (under [[Kanhoji Angre]]), and possibly Chinese junks and Portuguese vessels. Some of these people settled in South-East Africa and later spread to places like present day Uganda, and Mozambique. Later they mingled with the much larger wave of South Asians who came with the British.\n\nIndian migration to the modern countries of Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius, South Africa, and Tanzania began nearly a century ago when these parts of the continent were under British and French colonial rule. Most of these migrants were of Gujarati or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] origin. There are almost three million Indians living in South-East Africa. Indian-led businesses were (or are) the backbone of the economies of these countries. These ranged in the past from small rural grocery stores to [[sugar mill]]s. In addition, Indian professionals, such as doctors, teachers, engineers, also played an important part in the development of these countries.\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Indonesia====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Indian Indonesian|Tamil Indonesian}}\n[[File:Sri Prakash Lohia.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sri Prakash Lohia]], founder of [[Indorama Corporation]] and sixth richest person in Indonesia according to Forbes]]\n[[File:Manoj_punjabi.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Manoj Punjabi]] is an [[Indian Indonesian]] film and television producer and owner of the biggest production house in Indonesia.]]\n\nThe official figures, it is estimated that there are around 125,000 Indians living in Indonesia and 25,000 PIOs/NRIs living in Indonesia of which the Indian expatriate community registered with the embassy and consulate in [[Medan]] numbers around 5,000-7,000 people. Most are from Tamil descendants. There are other sources stated that there are more than 400,000 Indians in Indonesia.\n\nIndians have been living in Indonesia for centuries, from the time of the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit Empire]] both of which were Hindu and heavily influenced by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north of India. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations and hold [[Indonesian passport]]s. While local statistics continue to suggest that there are some 40,000 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated into Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Punjabi and [[odia people|Odia]] communities still maintain their cultural traditions.\n\nThe Indian diaspora also includes several thousand [[Sindi people|Sindhi]] families who constitute the second wave of Indian immigrants who made Indonesia their home in the first half of the 20th century. The Sindhi community is mainly engaged in [[Trade|trading]] and [[commerce]].\n\nAmong these communities, Tamils and to a lesser extent Sikhs were primarily engaged in agriculture while [[Sindhis]] and [[Punjabis]] mainly established themselves in [[textile]] trade and sports businesses.\n\nThe inflow of major Indian investments in Indonesia starting in the late 1970s drew a fresh wave of Indian investors and managers to this country. This group of entrepreneurs and business professionals has further expanded over the past two decades and now includes engineers, consultants, chartered accountants, bankers and other professionals.\n\nThe Indian community is very well regarded in Indonesia, is generally prosperous, and includes individuals holding senior positions in local and multinational companies.\n\nDue to economic factors, most traders and businessmen among PIOs have over past decades moved to [[Jakarta]] from outlying areas such as Medan and [[Surabaya]]. Almost half the Indian Community in Indonesia is now Jakarta-based; it is estimated that the population of Jakarta's Indian community is about 19,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rising India and Indian Communities in East Asia |last= Kesavapany |first= K. |author2=Mani, A |author3=P.

Gandhi Seva Loka (formerly known as Bombay Merchants Association) is a charitable institution run by the Sindhi community and is engaged mainly in educational and social activities. The India Club is a social organisation of PIO/NRI professionals. An Indian Women's Association brings together PIO/NRI spouses and undertakes charitable activities. There is a Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee in Jakarta and Sindhis as well, Sikhs are associated with [[Gurudwara]] activities. The Economic Association of Indonesia and India (ECAII) brings together leading entrepreneurs from the Indian community with the objective of promoting bilateral economic relations, but it has been largely inactive. Finally, there is the Indonesian Chapter of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI).\n\n====Japan====\n{{Main|Indians in Japan}}\nIndians in Japan consist of migrants from India to Japan and their descendants. {{asof|2008|December}}, there were 22,335 Indian nationals living in Japan.<ref name=\"MOFA\">{{Cite book|chapter-url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/area/india/data.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|location=Tokyo |date=July 2009|script-chapter=ja:\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u57fa\u790e\u30c7\u30fc\u30bf|title={{asiantitle|\u5404\u56fd\u30fb\u5730\u57df\u60c5\u52e2|||j}}  |accessdate=25 September 2009}}</ref> Roughly 60% consist of expatriate IT professionals and their families.<ref>{{cite news |work=Asahi Shimbun|language=ja |script-title=ja:\u5bfe\u30a4\u30f3\u30c9\u95a2\u4fc2\u3000\u300c\u982d\u8133\u5927\u56fd\u300d\u3068\u306e\u8996\u70b9\u3092|last=Kond\u00f5|first=Masanori  |date=10 March 2008 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |url=http://www.asahi.com/international/aan/hatsu/hatsu080315.html}}</ref>\n\n====Malaysia====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{Main|Indian Malaysian|List of Malaysian Indians|Chitty|Jawi Peranakan}}\n[[File:Nicol David Khai.jpg|thumb|150px|Former [[List of WISPA number 1 ranked players|World No. 1]] of women's squash, Malaysia's [[Nicol David]], is of [[Chindian]] descent.]]\nMalaysia has one of the world's largest overseas Indian and overseas Chinese populations. Most Indians migrated to Malaysia as plantation labourers under British rule. They are a significant minority ethnic group, making up 8% or 2,410,000 as 2017 of the Malaysian population. 85% of these people are Tamil-speaking. They have retained their languages and religion \u2013 88% of ethnic Indians in Malaysia identify as Hindus.

Sundramoorthy]] is a former [[Singapore national football team|Singapore international]] [[association football|footballer]] and currently the head coach of [[S.League]] club [[Tampines Rovers]].]]\nIndian Singaporeans \u2013 defined as persons of [[South Asia]]n paternal [[ancestry]] \u2014 form 10% of the country's citizens and permanent residents, making them [[Singapore]]'s third largest ethnic group. Among cities, Singapore has one of the largest overseas Indian populations.\n\nAlthough contact with ancient India left a deep cultural impact on Singapore's indigenous [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] society, the mass migration of ethnic Indians to the island only began with the [[founding of modern Singapore]] by the British in 1819. Initially, the Indian population was transient, mainly comprising young men who came as workers, soldiers and convicts. By the mid-20th century, a settled community had emerged, with a more balanced [[sex ratio|gender ratio]] and a better [[demographic profile|spread of age groups]]. Tamil is one among the four official languages of Singapore alongside English, Chinese and Malay.\n\nSingapore's Indian population is notable for its [[class stratification]], with disproportionately large [[elite]] and [[Working class|lower income]] groups. This long-standing problem has grown more visible since the 1990s with an influx of both well-educated and unskilled migrants from India, and as part of growing [[income inequality]] in Singapore. Indians earn [[Demographics of Singapore#Household income|higher incomes]] than Malays, the other major minority group. Indians are also significantly more likely to hold university degrees than these groups. However, the mainly locally born Indian students in public primary and secondary schools under-perform the national average at major examinations.\n\nSingapore Indians are linguistically and religiously diverse, with South Indians and nominal Hindus forming majorities. Indian culture has endured and evolved over almost 200 years. By the mid to late 20th century, it had become somewhat distinct from contemporary South Asian cultures, even as Indian elements became diffused within a broader [[culture of Singapore|Singaporean culture]]. Since the 1990s, new Indian immigrants have increased the size and complexity of the local Indian population. Together with modern communications like [[cable television]] and the [[Internet]], this has connected Singapore with an emerging global Indian culture.\n\nProminent Indian individuals have long made a mark in Singapore as leaders of various fields in national life. Indians are also collectively well-represented, and sometimes over-represented, in areas such as [[Politics of Singapore|politics]], [[education in Singapore|education]], [[foreign relations of Singapore|diplomacy]] and the [[law in Singapore|law]].\n\nThere is also a small community of Indian origin, the [[Chitty]], who are the descendants of Tamil traders who had emigrated before 1500 CE, and Chinese and Malay locals. Considering themselves Tamil, speaking Tamil, and practice Hinduism, the Chittys number about 2,000 today.\n\n===Caribbean===\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{Main|Indo-Caribbean|Indo-Caribbean American|British Indo-Caribbean people}}\n\nFrom 1838 to 1917, over half a million Indians from the former British Raj or [[British India]], were brought to the [[British West Indies]] as [[indentured servant]]s to address the demand for labour following the [[abolition of slavery]]. The first two ships arrived in [[British Guiana]] (now Guyana) on 5 May 1838.\n\nThe majority of the Indians living in the [[Anglophone Caribbean|English-speaking Caribbean]] migrated from eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar, while those brought to Guadeloupe and Martinique were mostly from [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Tamil Nadu. A minority emigrated from other parts of South Asia, including present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other Indo-Caribbean people descend from later migrants, including Indian doctors, Gujarati businessmen and migrants from Kenya and Uganda. A vague community of modern-day immigrants from India is to be found on Saint-Martin or Sint Maarten and other islands with duty-free commercial capabilities, where they are active in business.\n\nIndo-Caribbeans are the largest ethnic group in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. They are the second largest group in Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other countries. There are small populations of them in Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, French Guiana, Grenada, Panama, Guatemala, St Lucia, Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nThe indentured Indians and their descendants have actively contributed to the evolution of their adopted lands in spite of many difficulties. Jamaica has always celebrated the arrival of the East Indians in [[Old Harbour Bay]] on 13 May. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] celebrates the arrival of East Indians on 30 May. In 2003, Martinique celebrated the 150th anniversary of Indian arrival. Guadeloupe did the same in 2004. These celebrations were not the fact of just the Indian minority but the official recognition by the French and local authorities of their integration and their wide-scale contribution in various fields from agriculture to education and politics, and to the diversification of the [[Creole culture]]. Thus the noted participation of the whole multi-ethnic population of the two islands in these events.<ref>[http://cqoj.typepad.com/chest/2005/02/english_version.html c qoi o jus' ? ki sa sa ki sa y\u00e9 ?: GUADELOUPE'S INDIAN ARRIVAL MONUMENT].

After the Dutch government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers, Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 from what was then British India as indentured labourers, many from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the surrounding regions. Just before and just after the independence of Suriname on 25 November 1975 many Indo-Surinamese emigrated to the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nDuring the heyday of the British Raj/Empire, many people from India were sent to other British colonies for work.

Indians in the UK are the largest community outside of [[Asia]] proportionally, and the second largest in terms of population, only surpassed by the United States, and closely followed by Canada. The first wave of Indians in the United Kingdom worked as manual labourers and were not respected within society. However, this has changed considerably.

Their presence in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and other regions is not as large. The first generation of immigrants were to be found in the east-end of London, which was traditionally the poorest area of London.

Some are believed to have remained in [[British Columbia]] and others returned there later. A [[Hindu-Canadian]] community has existed in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, for over 100 years. [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindu-Punjabi]] Indians were attracted to the possibilities for farming and forestry. They were mainly male [[Sikhs]] who were seeking work opportunities. [[Indo-Caribbean]]s, descendants of the Indian indentured workers who had gone to the Caribbean since 1838, made an early appearance in Canada with the arrival of the [[Trinidadian]] medical student Kenneth Mahabir and the Demerara (now Guyana) clerk M N Santoo, both in 1908.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe first Indian immigrants in British Columbia allegedly faced widespread [[racism]] from the local white Canadians. [[Race riots]] targeted these immigrants, as well as new Chinese immigrants. Most decided to return to India, while a few stayed behind. The [[Canadian government]] prevented these men from bringing their wives and children until 1919, another reason why many of them chose to leave. Quotas were established to prevent many Indians from moving to Canada in the early 20th century. These quotas allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when the number was increased to 300. In 1967, all quotas were scrapped. Immigration was then based on a point system, thus allowing many more Indians to enter. Since this open-door policy was adopted, Indians continue to come in large numbers, and roughly 25,000-30,000 arrive each year, which now makes Indians the second highest group immigrating to Canada each year, after the Chinese.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMost Indians choose to emigrate to larger urban centres like Toronto, and Vancouver, where more than 70% live. Smaller communities are also growing in Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal. A place called [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Little India]] exists in Vancouver and a section of [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Gerrard Street]] in Toronto as well. Indians in Vancouver live mainly in the suburb of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], or nearby [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] but are also found in other parts of Vancouver. The vast majority of Vancouver Indians are of Sikh origin and have taken significant roles in politics and other professions, with several [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] [[Judge|justices]], three [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] and one provincial premier hailing from the community. Both [[Gurmant Grewal]] and his wife [[Nina Grewal]] were the first married couple in Canada to be concurrently elected as [[Member of Parliament]] in 2004.

Indian immigration to North America started as early as the 1890s.

Most of these immigrants were Sikhs from the [[Punjab region]].\n\nAsian women were restricted from immigrating, because the US government passed laws in 1917, at the behest of California and other states in the west, which had experienced a large influx of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian immigrants during and after the gold rush. As a result, many of the South Asian men in California married Mexican women. A fair number of these families settled in the Central Valley in California as farmers, and continue to this day. These early immigrants were denied voting rights, family re-unification and citizenship. In 1923 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'', ruled that people from India (at the time, British India, e.g. South Asians) were ineligible for citizenship. [[Bhagat Singh Thind]] was a [[Sikh]] from India who settled in Oregon; he had applied earlier for citizenship and was rejected there.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/i_bhagat1.html Roots in the Sand - Bhagat Singh Thind]. PBS. Retrieved 29 July 2013.</ref> Thind became a citizen a few years later in New York.\n\nAfter World War II, US immigration policy changed, after almost a half century, to allow family re-unification for people of non-white origin. In addition, Asians were allowed to become citizens and to vote. A large number of the men who arrived before the 1940s were finally able to bring their families to the US; most of them in this earlier era settled in California and other west coast states.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAnother wave of Indian immigrants entered the US after independence of India. A large proportion of them were [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] joining their family members under the new more (though not completely) colour-blind immigration laws, then Malayali immigrants from Middle East, Kerala, etc. and professionals or students that came from all over India. The Cold War created a need for engineers in the defence and aerospace industries, some of whom came from India. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, large numbers of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], [[Telugu people|Telugu]], and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people had settled in the US. The most recent and probably the largest wave of immigration to date occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the [[internet]] boom.

Some of the earliest Punjabi arrivals in Australia included Kareem Bux, who came as a hawker to [[Bendigo]] in 1893, Sardar Beer Singh Johal, who came in 1895 and Sardar Narain Singh Heyer, who arrived in 1898. Many Punjabis took part in the rush for gold on the Victorian fields.\n\nIndians also entered Australia in the first half of the 20th century when both Australia and India were still British colonies. Indian Sikhs came to work on the banana plantations in Southern Queensland. Today a large number of them live in the town of [[Woolgoolga]] (a town lying roughly halfway between Sydney and Brisbane). Some of these Indians, the descendants of Sikh plantation workers, now own banana farms in the area. There are two Sikh temples in Woolgoolga, one of which has a museum dedicated to Sikhism. A large number of Britons and [[Anglo-Indian]]s born in India migrated to Australia after 1947.

While most earlier Indian migration was by educated professionals, the Fijian-Indian community was also largely by professionals but also brought many small business owners and entrepreneurs.\n\nThe current wave of Indian migration is that of engineers, toolmakers, Gujarati business families from East Africa and relatives of settled Indians. Starved of government funding, Australian education institutes are recruiting full fee paying overseas students. Many universities have permanent representatives stationed in India and other Asian countries. Their efforts have been rewarded with a new influx of Indian students entering Australia.

In the second half of the 20th century, most of them [[aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], where they now number about 85,000. The native language of the Bene Israel is [[Jud\u00e6o-Marathi]], a form of Marathi.\n\nAnother prominent community that migrated to Israel after its creation were the Jews of [[Cochin]], in Kerala ([[Cochin Jews]]) - a community with a very long history. They are known to have been granted protection by the king of the [[Princely State of Cochin]]. The earliest Jews in this region, as per local tradition, date to as early as 379 CE. The community was a mix of native Jews (called \"Black Jews\"), and European Jews (called \"White Jews\") who had emigrated to Cochin after the successive European conquests of Cochin. The Jewish community of Cochin spoke a variant of [[Malayalam]], called [[Judeo-Malayalam]]. The community, after the creation of Israel, saw a mass exodus from Cochin, and is presently facing extinction in India.\n\nStill another group of Indians to arrive in Israel belong to the [[Bnei Menashe]] (\"Children of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]]\", Hebrew \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4) a group of more than 10,000 people from India's [[Seven Sister States|North-Eastern border states]] of [[Manipur]] and [[Mizoram]], who claim descent from one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes of Israel]], and of whom about 3,700 now live in Israel (some of them in [[Israeli settlement]]s on the [[West Bank]]).

After the 1970s oil boom in the [[Middle East]], numerous Indians from [[Kerala]] emigrated, taking advantage of close historical ties with the 'Gulf' as well as the lack of ample skilled labour from nearby [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Major urban centers such as [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Doha]] and [[Manama]] were experiencing a development boom and thousands of Indians labored in construction industries.\n\nThis work was done on a contractual basis rather than permanently, and working age men continued to return home every few years. This has remained the dominant pattern as the countries in the Persian Gulf, especially [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]] have a common policy of not naturalising non-Arabs, even if they are born there.\n\nThe Persian Gulf region has provided incomes many times over for the same type of job in India and has geographical proximity to India, and these incomes are free of taxation.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The NRIs make up a good proportion of the working class in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC).

They work as engineers, doctors, lawyers, labourers and in clerical jobs.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Unlike in Europe and America, most of the countries in West Asia do not grant [[citizenship]] or permanent residency to these Indians, however long they might live there. They have a minority in Saudi Arabia. The NRI population tends to save and remit considerable amounts to their dependents in India. It is estimated such remittances may be over US$10 billion per annum (including remittances by formal and informal channels in 2007\u20132008). The relative ease with which people can travel to their home country means that many NRIs in the Gulf and West Asia maintain close links to Indian culture, with people often travelling twice or thrice a year, especially during holiday period, while some live in India for several months each year. Satellite television allows many NRIs to consume Indian media and entertainment, and there are TV soaps aimed at the NRI community in the Gulf countries. Live performances and cultural events, such as [[Tiatr|Tiarts]] for Goans living in UAE, occur quite often and are staged by community groups.\n\n==Diaspora by state and ethnolinguistic regions of India==\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* Assemese diaspora\n** [[Sylhetis]]\n* [[Bengalis|Bengali diaspora]]\n* [[Biharis#Bihari diaspora|Bihari diaspora]]\n* [[Gujarati people|Gujarati diaspora]]\n* [[Kannada people#Horanadu Kannadiga|Kannadiga diaspora]] \n* [[Kashmiri diaspora]]\n* [[Maharashtra Mandal|Maharashtrian diaspora]]\n* [[World Malayalee Council|Malayali diaspora]]\n* [[Non-resident Odia|Odia diaspora]] \n* [[Punjabi diaspora]]\n* [[Saraiki diaspora]]\n* [[Sindhi diaspora]]\n* [[South Indian diaspora]]\n* [[Tamil diaspora]]\n* [[Telugu diaspora]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Diaspora by mixed races==\n\n===European colonial era diaspora===\n{{anchor| European colonia era | European}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Coolie#Indian coolies|Coolies]]\n** [[Indian South Africans]] \n** [[Malaysian Indians]]\n* [[Girmityas]]\n** [[Indo-Caribbeans]]\n** [[Indo-Fijians]]\n** [[Mauritians of Indian origin]]\n** [[Indo-Jamaicans]]\n* [[Anglo-Indian]]s\n** [[Indo-Surinamese|Dutch Surinamese]]\n** [[Eurasians in Singapore]]\n** [[Irish Indians]]\n** [[Luso-Indian]]\n**[[Macanese people]]\n** [[Scottish-Indian]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Other mixed Indians===\n* [[Indians in China|Chinese Indian]]\n\n==Diaspora by religions==\n{{anchor| Religious diaspora}}\n\n===Indian-origin religions===\n{{anchor | Indic religions | Indic religion | Indian | Indian-origin religions}}\n\nThe diaspora of [[Indian religions|indic religions]] are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Jain communities#Diaspora|Jain diaspora]]\n* [[Sikh diaspora]]\n* Buddhist diaspora\n** [[Tibetan diaspora]]\n* Hindu diaspora\n** Balinese Hindu diaspora\n** [[Hinduism in Vietnam#Cham Hindus|Vietnamese Balamon Cham Hindu diaspora]]\n** [[Bengali Hindu diaspora]] \n{{div col end}}\n\n===Foreign-origin religions===\n* Jews: [[Bnei Menashe|Bnei Menashe Mizo-Manipuri diaspora]]\n\n== Impact of Indian diaspora ==\n{{anchor | Contribution | Influence | Power}}\n\n===Influence in India===\n==== Overseas Indians' Day ====\n{{anchor | Overseas Indians' Day | Overseas Indians' Day | OID}}\n\nSince 2003, the ''[[Pravasi Bharatiya Divas]]'' (Overseas Indians' Day) sponsored by [[Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs]], is celebrated in India on 9 January each year, to \"mark the contributions of the Overseas Indian community in the development of India\".

The majority of them came from the Indian west coast state of [[Gujarat]] and were known as [[Karanam|Karana]] (Muslim) and [[Bania (caste)|Bania]] (Hindu). The majority speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], though some other Indian languages are spoken. Nowadays the younger generations speak at least three languages including French or English, Gujarati and [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]].{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n====Mauritius====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Indo-Mauritian}}\n\nThe people are known as [[Indo-Mauritian]]s, and form about 65.8% of the population. The majority of them are [[Hindu]] (73.7%) and a significant group are [[Muslims]] (26.3%). Mauritius is the only Hindu majority (48.5%) country of [[Africa]] according to the 2011 census. There are also some [[Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] and [[Sikhs]], but the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and Sikh populations are relatively small. The [[mother tongue]] of Indo-Mauritians is [[Mauritian creole|Creole]], as well as French and English in general fields, however various Indian languages are still spoken, especially [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Urdu]] are used in religious activities.\n\nMauritius hosts the [[Aapravasi Ghat]], the only site of UNESCO in the world, to pay homage to the memory of [[indenture]]. The Indian Festivals of [[Maha Shivaratri]], [[Diwali]], [[Thaipusam]], [[Ponggal]], [[Ganesh Chaturthi]] and [[Ugadi]] are all National Holidays as well as the Annual Commemoration of the Arrival of Indian Indentured Labourers in Mauritius.\n\n====R\u00e9union====\n{{Main|R\u00e9unionnais of Indian origin|Malbars}}\nIndians make up a quarter of R\u00e9union's population.

The majority are of [[Tamil language|Tamil]] speaking heritage along with people that speak Hindi, mostly descending from Bihar. There are also smaller numbers of [[Telugu language|Telugu]] speaking communities while a minority are descended from Indian traders who migrated to South Africa at around the same time, many from Gujarat. The city of [[Durban]] has the highest number of Asians in sub-Saharan Africa, and the Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi worked as a lawyer in the city in the early 1900s. South Africa has the highest number of people of Indian descent outside of India in the world, i.e. born in South Africa and not migrant. Most of them are fourth or fifth generation descendants. Most Indian South Africans do not speak the Indian languages that were 'lost' over the generations, although they do enjoy watching Indian movies and listening to [[Indian music]].\n\n====South East Africa====\n{{Main|Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|l1=Indian Diaspora in South East Africa}}\n[[File:Sir Ben Kingsley 2012.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ben Kingsley|Sir Ben Kingsley]] of [[Indian diaspora in Southeast Africa|Indo-Kenyan]] descent is a notable Oscar-winning actor]] [[File:Freddie Mercury performing in New Haven, CT, November 1977.jpg|thumb|150px|Farrokh Bulsara, better known as [[Freddie Mercury]], lead singer and co-founder of the immensely successful rock band ''[[Queen (band)|Queen]]'', was of [[Parsi]] descent born in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nBefore the larger wave of migration during the British colonial era, a significant group of South Asians, especially from the west coast ([[Sindh]], [[Surat]], [[Konkan]] and [[Malabar Coast|Malabar]]) travelled regularly to South East Africa, especially Zanzibar. It is believed that they travelled in Arab ''[[dhow]]s'', [[Maratha]] Navy ships (under [[Kanhoji Angre]]), and possibly Chinese junks and Portuguese vessels. Some of these people settled in South-East Africa and later spread to places like present day Uganda, and Mozambique. Later they mingled with the much larger wave of South Asians who came with the British.\n\nIndian migration to the modern countries of Kenya, Uganda, Mauritius, South Africa, and Tanzania began nearly a century ago when these parts of the continent were under British and French colonial rule. Most of these migrants were of Gujarati or [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]] origin. There are almost three million Indians living in South-East Africa. Indian-led businesses were (or are) the backbone of the economies of these countries. These ranged in the past from small rural grocery stores to [[sugar mill]]s. In addition, Indian professionals, such as doctors, teachers, engineers, also played an important part in the development of these countries.\n\n===Asia===\n\n====Indonesia====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n{{Main|Indian Indonesian|Tamil Indonesian}}\n[[File:Sri Prakash Lohia.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Sri Prakash Lohia]], founder of [[Indorama Corporation]] and sixth richest person in Indonesia according to Forbes]]\n[[File:Manoj_punjabi.jpeg|thumb|150px|[[Manoj Punjabi]] is an [[Indian Indonesian]] film and television producer and owner of the biggest production house in Indonesia.]]\n\nThe official figures, it is estimated that there are around 125,000 Indians living in Indonesia and 25,000 PIOs/NRIs living in Indonesia of which the Indian expatriate community registered with the embassy and consulate in [[Medan]] numbers around 5,000-7,000 people. Most are from Tamil descendants. There are other sources stated that there are more than 400,000 Indians in Indonesia.\n\nIndians have been living in Indonesia for centuries, from the time of the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit Empire]] both of which were Hindu and heavily influenced by the subcontinent. Indians were later brought to Indonesia by the Dutch in the 19th century as indentured labourers to work on plantations located around Medan in Sumatra. While the majority of these came from South India, a significant number also came from the north of India. The Medan Indians included Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. They have now been in Indonesia for over four generations and hold [[Indonesian passport]]s. While local statistics continue to suggest that there are some 40,000 PIOs in Sumatra, the vast majority are now completely assimilated into Indonesian society, though some elements of the Tamil, Punjabi and [[odia people|Odia]] communities still maintain their cultural traditions.\n\nThe Indian diaspora also includes several thousand [[Sindi people|Sindhi]] families who constitute the second wave of Indian immigrants who made Indonesia their home in the first half of the 20th century. The Sindhi community is mainly engaged in [[Trade|trading]] and [[commerce]].\n\nAmong these communities, Tamils and to a lesser extent Sikhs were primarily engaged in agriculture while [[Sindhis]] and [[Punjabis]] mainly established themselves in [[textile]] trade and sports businesses.\n\nThe inflow of major Indian investments in Indonesia starting in the late 1970s drew a fresh wave of Indian investors and managers to this country. This group of entrepreneurs and business professionals has further expanded over the past two decades and now includes engineers, consultants, chartered accountants, bankers and other professionals.\n\nThe Indian community is very well regarded in Indonesia, is generally prosperous, and includes individuals holding senior positions in local and multinational companies.\n\nDue to economic factors, most traders and businessmen among PIOs have over past decades moved to [[Jakarta]] from outlying areas such as Medan and [[Surabaya]]. Almost half the Indian Community in Indonesia is now Jakarta-based; it is estimated that the population of Jakarta's Indian community is about 19,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rising India and Indian Communities in East Asia |last= Kesavapany |first= K. |author2=Mani, A |author3=P.

Gandhi Seva Loka (formerly known as Bombay Merchants Association) is a charitable institution run by the Sindhi community and is engaged mainly in educational and social activities. The India Club is a social organisation of PIO/NRI professionals. An Indian Women's Association brings together PIO/NRI spouses and undertakes charitable activities. There is a Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee in Jakarta and Sindhis as well, Sikhs are associated with [[Gurudwara]] activities. The Economic Association of Indonesia and India (ECAII) brings together leading entrepreneurs from the Indian community with the objective of promoting bilateral economic relations, but it has been largely inactive.

Sundramoorthy]] is a former [[Singapore national football team|Singapore international]] [[association football|footballer]] and currently the head coach of [[S.League]] club [[Tampines Rovers]].]]\nIndian Singaporeans \u2013 defined as persons of [[South Asia]]n paternal [[ancestry]] \u2014 form 10% of the country's citizens and permanent residents, making them [[Singapore]]'s third largest ethnic group. Among cities, Singapore has one of the largest overseas Indian populations.\n\nAlthough contact with ancient India left a deep cultural impact on Singapore's indigenous [[Malays in Singapore|Malay]] society, the mass migration of ethnic Indians to the island only began with the [[founding of modern Singapore]] by the British in 1819. Initially, the Indian population was transient, mainly comprising young men who came as workers, soldiers and convicts. By the mid-20th century, a settled community had emerged, with a more balanced [[sex ratio|gender ratio]] and a better [[demographic profile|spread of age groups]]. Tamil is one among the four official languages of Singapore alongside English, Chinese and Malay.\n\nSingapore's Indian population is notable for its [[class stratification]], with disproportionately large [[elite]] and [[Working class|lower income]] groups. This long-standing problem has grown more visible since the 1990s with an influx of both well-educated and unskilled migrants from India, and as part of growing [[income inequality]] in Singapore. Indians earn [[Demographics of Singapore#Household income|higher incomes]] than Malays, the other major minority group. Indians are also significantly more likely to hold university degrees than these groups. However, the mainly locally born Indian students in public primary and secondary schools under-perform the national average at major examinations.\n\nSingapore Indians are linguistically and religiously diverse, with South Indians and nominal Hindus forming majorities. Indian culture has endured and evolved over almost 200 years. By the mid to late 20th century, it had become somewhat distinct from contemporary South Asian cultures, even as Indian elements became diffused within a broader [[culture of Singapore|Singaporean culture]]. Since the 1990s, new Indian immigrants have increased the size and complexity of the local Indian population. Together with modern communications like [[cable television]] and the [[Internet]], this has connected Singapore with an emerging global Indian culture.\n\nProminent Indian individuals have long made a mark in Singapore as leaders of various fields in national life. Indians are also collectively well-represented, and sometimes over-represented, in areas such as [[Politics of Singapore|politics]], [[education in Singapore|education]], [[foreign relations of Singapore|diplomacy]] and the [[law in Singapore|law]].\n\nThere is also a small community of Indian origin, the [[Chitty]], who are the descendants of Tamil traders who had emigrated before 1500 CE, and Chinese and Malay locals. Considering themselves Tamil, speaking Tamil, and practice Hinduism, the Chittys number about 2,000 today.\n\n===Caribbean===\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\n\n{{Main|Indo-Caribbean|Indo-Caribbean American|British Indo-Caribbean people}}\n\nFrom 1838 to 1917, over half a million Indians from the former British Raj or [[British India]], were brought to the [[British West Indies]] as [[indentured servant]]s to address the demand for labour following the [[abolition of slavery]]. The first two ships arrived in [[British Guiana]] (now Guyana) on 5 May 1838.\n\nThe majority of the Indians living in the [[Anglophone Caribbean|English-speaking Caribbean]] migrated from eastern Uttar Pradesh and western Bihar, while those brought to Guadeloupe and Martinique were mostly from [[Andhra Pradesh]] and Tamil Nadu. A minority emigrated from other parts of South Asia, including present-day Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other Indo-Caribbean people descend from later migrants, including Indian doctors, Gujarati businessmen and migrants from Kenya and Uganda. A vague community of modern-day immigrants from India is to be found on Saint-Martin or Sint Maarten and other islands with duty-free commercial capabilities, where they are active in business.\n\nIndo-Caribbeans are the largest ethnic group in Guyana, Suriname and Trinidad and Tobago. They are the second largest group in Jamaica, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other countries. There are small populations of them in Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, French Guiana, Grenada, Panama, Guatemala, St Lucia, Haiti, Martinique, Guadeloupe, and the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nThe indentured Indians and their descendants have actively contributed to the evolution of their adopted lands in spite of many difficulties. Jamaica has always celebrated the arrival of the East Indians in [[Old Harbour Bay]] on 13 May. [[Trinidad and Tobago]] celebrates the arrival of East Indians on 30 May. In 2003, Martinique celebrated the 150th anniversary of Indian arrival. Guadeloupe did the same in 2004. These celebrations were not the fact of just the Indian minority but the official recognition by the French and local authorities of their integration and their wide-scale contribution in various fields from agriculture to education and politics, and to the diversification of the [[Creole culture]].

After the Dutch government signed a treaty with the United Kingdom on the recruitment of contract workers, Indians began migrating to Suriname in 1873 from what was then British India as indentured labourers, many from the modern-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the surrounding regions.

Some are believed to have remained in [[British Columbia]] and others returned there later. A [[Hindu-Canadian]] community has existed in Abbotsford, British Columbia, Canada, for over 100 years. [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindu-Punjabi]] Indians were attracted to the possibilities for farming and forestry. They were mainly male [[Sikhs]] who were seeking work opportunities. [[Indo-Caribbean]]s, descendants of the Indian indentured workers who had gone to the Caribbean since 1838, made an early appearance in Canada with the arrival of the [[Trinidadian]] medical student Kenneth Mahabir and the Demerara (now Guyana) clerk M N Santoo, both in 1908.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe first Indian immigrants in British Columbia allegedly faced widespread [[racism]] from the local white Canadians. [[Race riots]] targeted these immigrants, as well as new Chinese immigrants. Most decided to return to India, while a few stayed behind. The [[Canadian government]] prevented these men from bringing their wives and children until 1919, another reason why many of them chose to leave. Quotas were established to prevent many Indians from moving to Canada in the early 20th century. These quotas allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when the number was increased to 300. In 1967, all quotas were scrapped. Immigration was then based on a point system, thus allowing many more Indians to enter. Since this open-door policy was adopted, Indians continue to come in large numbers, and roughly 25,000-30,000 arrive each year, which now makes Indians the second highest group immigrating to Canada each year, after the Chinese.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nMost Indians choose to emigrate to larger urban centres like Toronto, and Vancouver, where more than 70% live. Smaller communities are also growing in Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal. A place called [[Punjabi Market, Vancouver|Little India]] exists in Vancouver and a section of [[Gerrard Street (Toronto)|Gerrard Street]] in Toronto as well. Indians in Vancouver live mainly in the suburb of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], or nearby [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] but are also found in other parts of Vancouver. The vast majority of Vancouver Indians are of Sikh origin and have taken significant roles in politics and other professions, with several [[Supreme Court of British Columbia|Supreme Court]] [[Judge|justices]], three [[Attorney General|attorneys general]] and one provincial premier hailing from the community. Both [[Gurmant Grewal]] and his wife [[Nina Grewal]] were the first married couple in Canada to be concurrently elected as [[Member of Parliament]] in 2004.

Indian immigration to North America started as early as the 1890s.

Most of these immigrants were Sikhs from the [[Punjab region]].\n\nAsian women were restricted from immigrating, because the US government passed laws in 1917, at the behest of California and other states in the west, which had experienced a large influx of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian immigrants during and after the gold rush. As a result, many of the South Asian men in California married Mexican women. A fair number of these families settled in the Central Valley in California as farmers, and continue to this day. These early immigrants were denied voting rights, family re-unification and citizenship. In 1923 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'', ruled that people from India (at the time, British India, e.g. South Asians) were ineligible for citizenship. [[Bhagat Singh Thind]] was a [[Sikh]] from India who settled in Oregon; he had applied earlier for citizenship and was rejected there.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/rootsinthesand/i_bhagat1.html Roots in the Sand - Bhagat Singh Thind]. PBS. Retrieved 29 July 2013.</ref> Thind became a citizen a few years later in New York.\n\nAfter World War II, US immigration policy changed, after almost a half century, to allow family re-unification for people of non-white origin. In addition, Asians were allowed to become citizens and to vote. A large number of the men who arrived before the 1940s were finally able to bring their families to the US; most of them in this earlier era settled in California and other west coast states.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nAnother wave of Indian immigrants entered the US after independence of India. A large proportion of them were [[Sikhism|Sikhs]] joining their family members under the new more (though not completely) colour-blind immigration laws, then Malayali immigrants from Middle East, Kerala, etc. and professionals or students that came from all over India. The Cold War created a need for engineers in the defence and aerospace industries, some of whom came from India. By the late 1980s and early 1990s, large numbers of [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], [[Telugu people|Telugu]], and [[Tamil people|Tamil]] people had settled in the US. The most recent and probably the largest wave of immigration to date occurred in the late 1990s and early 2000s during the [[internet]] boom. As a result, Indians in the US are now one of the largest among the groups of immigrants with an estimated population of about 3.2 million, or ~1.0% of the US population according to [[American Community Survey]] of 2010 data.<ref name=\"usacensus1\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP8&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20161012022855/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_SF1_QTP8&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 October 2016|title=Race Reporting for the Asian Population by Selected Categories: 2010|publisher=US Census Bureau|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref> The demographics of Indian Americans have accordingly changed from majority Sikh to majority Hindu, with Sikhs only comprising 10% to 20% of Indian Americans today.

In the second half of the 20th century, most of them [[aliyah|emigrated to Israel]], where they now number about 85,000. The native language of the Bene Israel is [[Jud\u00e6o-Marathi]], a form of Marathi.\n\nAnother prominent community that migrated to Israel after its creation were the Jews of [[Cochin]], in Kerala ([[Cochin Jews]]) - a community with a very long history. They are known to have been granted protection by the king of the [[Princely State of Cochin]]. The earliest Jews in this region, as per local tradition, date to as early as 379 CE. The community was a mix of native Jews (called \"Black Jews\"), and European Jews (called \"White Jews\") who had emigrated to Cochin after the successive European conquests of Cochin. The Jewish community of Cochin spoke a variant of [[Malayalam]], called [[Judeo-Malayalam]]. The community, after the creation of Israel, saw a mass exodus from Cochin, and is presently facing extinction in India.\n\nStill another group of Indians to arrive in Israel belong to the [[Bnei Menashe]] (\"Children of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]]\", Hebrew \u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05de\u05e0\u05e9\u05d4) a group of more than 10,000 people from India's [[Seven Sister States|North-Eastern border states]] of [[Manipur]] and [[Mizoram]], who claim descent from one of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes of Israel]], and of whom about 3,700 now live in Israel (some of them in [[Israeli settlement]]s on the [[West Bank]]). Linguistically, Bnei Menashe are [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burmans]] and belong to the [[Mizo people|Mizo]], [[Kuki people|Kuki]] and [[Chin people]]s (the terms are virtually interchangeable).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/july2005/morphologynortheast1.html |title=Issues in Morphological Analysis of North-East Indian Languages |date=7 July 2005  |accessdate=4 March 2007 |work=Language in India |author1=Vijayanand Kommaluri |author2=R.

After the 1970s oil boom in the [[Middle East]], numerous Indians from [[Kerala]] emigrated, taking advantage of close historical ties with the 'Gulf' as well as the lack of ample skilled labour from nearby [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]]. Major urban centers such as [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Doha]] and [[Manama]] were experiencing a development boom and thousands of Indians labored in construction industries.\n\nThis work was done on a contractual basis rather than permanently, and working age men continued to return home every few years. This has remained the dominant pattern as the countries in the Persian Gulf, especially [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Bahrain]], [[Qatar]] and [[Kuwait]] have a common policy of not naturalising non-Arabs, even if they are born there.\n\nThe Persian Gulf region has provided incomes many times over for the same type of job in India and has geographical proximity to India, and these incomes are free of taxation.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} The NRIs make up a good proportion of the working class in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] (GCC). NRI population in these [[Gulf Cooperation Council|GCC]] countries is estimated to be around 20 million, of which a quarter is resident in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/001200811141323.htm|title=Expatriate Indians in UAE not hit by global meltdown|website=Hindu.com|accessdate=27 May 2018}}</ref> In 2005, about 75% of the population in the UAE was of Indian descent. The majority originate from Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka, and Goa. Similarly, Indians are the single largest nationality in Qatar, representing around 85% of the total population as of 2014.<ref name=\"bq magazine\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bqdoha.com/2013/12/population-qatar |title=Qatar's population by nationality |date=18 December 2013 |publisher=bqdoha.com  |accessdate=19 November 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222095738/http://www.bqdoha.com/2013/12/population-qatar |archivedate=22 December 2013}}</ref> They also form majorities in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman.\n\nSince the early-2000s, significant number of Indians have reached the region, taking up high skill jobs in business and industry. Major Indian corporations maintain solid regional presence there while some are headquartered there.\n\nThere is a huge population of NRIs in West Asia, most coming from [[Kerala]] and Hyderabad. They work as engineers, doctors, lawyers, labourers and in clerical jobs.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} Unlike in Europe and America, most of the countries in West Asia do not grant [[citizenship]] or permanent residency to these Indians, however long they might live there. They have a minority in Saudi Arabia. The NRI population tends to save and remit considerable amounts to their dependents in India. It is estimated such remittances may be over US$10 billion per annum (including remittances by formal and informal channels in 2007\u20132008). The relative ease with which people can travel to their home country means that many NRIs in the Gulf and West Asia maintain close links to Indian culture, with people often travelling twice or thrice a year, especially during holiday period, while some live in India for several months each year. Satellite television allows many NRIs to consume Indian media and entertainment, and there are TV soaps aimed at the NRI community in the Gulf countries. Live performances and cultural events, such as [[Tiatr|Tiarts]] for Goans living in UAE, occur quite often and are staged by community groups.\n\n==Diaspora by state and ethnolinguistic regions of India==\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* Assemese diaspora\n** [[Sylhetis]]\n* [[Bengalis|Bengali diaspora]]\n* [[Biharis#Bihari diaspora|Bihari diaspora]]\n* [[Gujarati people|Gujarati diaspora]]\n* [[Kannada people#Horanadu Kannadiga|Kannadiga diaspora]] \n* [[Kashmiri diaspora]]\n* [[Maharashtra Mandal|Maharashtrian diaspora]]\n* [[World Malayalee Council|Malayali diaspora]]\n* [[Non-resident Odia|Odia diaspora]] \n* [[Punjabi diaspora]]\n* [[Saraiki diaspora]]\n* [[Sindhi diaspora]]\n* [[South Indian diaspora]]\n* [[Tamil diaspora]]\n* [[Telugu diaspora]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Diaspora by mixed races==\n\n===European colonial era diaspora===\n{{anchor| European colonia era | European}}\n\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Coolie#Indian coolies|Coolies]]\n** [[Indian South Africans]] \n** [[Malaysian Indians]]\n* [[Girmityas]]\n** [[Indo-Caribbeans]]\n** [[Indo-Fijians]]\n** [[Mauritians of Indian origin]]\n** [[Indo-Jamaicans]]\n* [[Anglo-Indian]]s\n** [[Indo-Surinamese|Dutch Surinamese]]\n** [[Eurasians in Singapore]]\n** [[Irish Indians]]\n** [[Luso-Indian]]\n**[[Macanese people]]\n** [[Scottish-Indian]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Other mixed Indians===\n* [[Indians in China|Chinese Indian]]\n\n==Diaspora by religions==\n{{anchor| Religious diaspora}}\n\n===Indian-origin religions===\n{{anchor | Indic religions | Indic religion | Indian | Indian-origin religions}}\n\nThe diaspora of [[Indian religions|indic religions]] are:\n\n{{div col|colwidth=12em}}\n* [[Jain communities#Diaspora|Jain diaspora]]\n* [[Sikh diaspora]]\n* Buddhist diaspora\n** [[Tibetan diaspora]]\n* Hindu diaspora\n** Balinese Hindu diaspora\n** [[Hinduism in Vietnam#Cham Hindus|Vietnamese Balamon Cham Hindu diaspora]]\n** [[Bengali Hindu diaspora]] \n{{div col end}}\n\n===Foreign-origin religions===\n* Jews: [[Bnei Menashe|Bnei Menashe Mizo-Manipuri diaspora]]\n\n== Impact of Indian diaspora ==\n{{anchor | Contribution | Influence | Power}}\n\n===Influence in India===\n==== Overseas Indians' Day ====\n{{anchor | Overseas Indians' Day | Overseas Indians' Day | OID}}\n\nSince 2003, the ''[[Pravasi Bharatiya Divas]]'' (Overseas Indians' Day) sponsored by [[Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs]], is celebrated in India on 9 January each year, to \"mark the contributions of the Overseas Indian community in the development of India\".
