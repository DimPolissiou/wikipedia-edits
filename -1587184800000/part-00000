War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, with an average of 49 percent.<ref>[https://cwemancipation.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/slavery-and-secession-1860-census-statistics/ \"Date of Secession Related to 1860 Black Population\"], America's Civil War</ref> Of those states whose legislatures resolved for secession, the first seven voted with split majorities for unionist candidates Douglas and Bell ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 51% and [[Louisiana]] with 55%), or with sizable minorities for those unionists ([[Alabama]] with 46%, [[Mississippi]] with 40%, [[Florida]] with 38%, [[Texas]] with 25%, and [[South Carolina]], which cast [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes without a popular vote for president).<ref>Burnham, Walter Dean.

Speaking directly to the \"Southern States\", he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists.

While in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] the Union made significant permanent gains, in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], the battle was inconclusive during 1861\u20131862. Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.<ref name=\"proclamation\" /> To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the [[Reconstruction era]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Confederate States of America (1861\u20131863).svg|thumb|Confederate flag, the \"Stars and Bars\".]]\n\nThe American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]].

At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49\u201350}}\n\nWith the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190\u201393}}\nNorthern \"free soil\" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13\u201314}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = Sen.

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\n\n===Secession crisis===\nThe election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession.

The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the \"[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]\". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.

Men selected in the draft could provide substitutes or, until mid-1864, pay commutation money. Many eligibles pooled their money to cover the cost of anyone drafted.

The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Surdam |first1=David G. |year=1998 |title=The Union Navy's blockade reconsidered |journal=Naval War College Review |volume=51 |issue=4|pages=85\u2013107}}</ref> The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never tried it.

Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15&nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] worked to block this, and threatened war if any country officially recognized the existence of the Confederate States of America. In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance. It also helped to turn European opinion further away from the Confederacy. It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy.

The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

Gen. [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Burnside was soon defeated at the [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=571\u201374}} on December 13, 1862, when more than 12,000 Union soldiers were killed or wounded during repeated futile frontal assaults against Marye's Heights. After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]].\n[[File:Conf dead chancellorsville edit1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Confederate dead overrun at Marye's Heights, reoccupied next day May 4, 1863]]\n;Chancellorsville\nHooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army; despite outnumbering the Confederates by more than two to one, his Chancellorsville Campaign proved ineffective and he was humiliated in the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]] in May 1863.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=639\u201345}} Chancellorsville is known as Lee's \"perfect battle\" because his risky decision to divide his army in the presence of a much larger enemy force resulted in a significant Confederate victory.

That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]].\n\n;Gettysburg\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L.

Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (July 1 to 3, 1863).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=653\u2013663}} This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}} However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.\n\n==Western theater==\n{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland \n[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]\nThe primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

The Mississippi River was opened to Union traffic to the southern border of Tennessee with the taking of [[Battle of Island Number Ten|Island No. 10]] and [[New Madrid, Missouri|New Madrid]], Missouri, and then [[Memphis, Tennessee]].\n\nIn April 1862, the [[Union Navy]] [[Capture of New Orleans|captured New Orleans]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=418\u201320}} \"The key to the river was New Orleans, the South's largest port [and] greatest industrial center.\"<ref>Kennedy, p. 58.</ref> U.S. Naval forces under [[David Farragut|Farragut]] ran past Confederate defenses south of New Orleans.

The Union in turn did not directly engage him.{{sfn|Keegan|2009|p=220\u201321}} Its 1864 [[Red River Campaign]] to take Shreveport, Louisiana, was a failure and Texas remained in Confederate hands throughout the war.\n\n== Lower Seaboard theater ==\n{{details|Lower Seaboard Theater of the American Civil War}}\n\n=== Background ===\nThe Lower Seaboard theater refers to military and naval operations that occurred near the coastal areas of the Southeast (Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas) as well as southern part of the Mississippi River (Port Hudson and south). Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D. Porter]] attacked [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip|Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], which guarded the river approach to New Orleans from the south. While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history. The Confederates attempted to defend with the [[Bayou Teche Campaign]], but surrendered after Vicksburg.

The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778\u201379}}\n\n=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E.

One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called \"the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy\") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M.

He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382\u201388}}\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.<ref>Don H.

Fox complained, however, that records were incomplete, especially during the last year of the war, and that battlefield reports likely under-counted deaths (many men counted as wounded in battlefield reports subsequently died of their wounds). Thomas L.

In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later. [[Francis Amasa Walker]], superintendent of the 1870 census, used census and surgeon general data to estimate a minimum of 500,000 Union military deaths and 350,000 Confederate military deaths, for a total death toll of 850,000 soldiers. While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.<ref name=\"recounting\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307\u201348}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1&nbsp;million.<ref>Professor James Downs. \"Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction\".

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]].

By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"...&nbsp;cannot be neutral.

From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves.

They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.\"{{sfn|Winters|1963|p=237}} Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]].

From the Union perspective, the goals of Reconstruction were to consolidate the Union victory on the battlefield by reuniting the Union; to guarantee a \"[[Republicanism in the United States|republican form of government]]\" for the ex-Confederate states; and to permanently end slavery\u2014and prevent semi-slavery status.<ref>Eric Foner's ''A Short History of Reconstruction'' (1990) is a brief survey.</ref>\n\nPresident Johnson took a lenient approach and saw the achievement of the main war goals as realized in 1865, when each ex-rebel state repudiated secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment.

Southern white preachers said:\n{{quote|God had chastised them and given them a special mission\u2014to maintain orthodoxy, strict biblicism, personal piety, and traditional race relations.

They appreciated opportunities to exercise their independence, to worship in their own way, to affirm their worth and dignity, and to proclaim the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A. Beard and Mary R. Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927), 2:54.</ref>}}\n\nThe Beards themselves abandoned their interpretation by the 1940s and it became defunct among historians in the 1950s, when scholars shifted to an emphasis on slavery.

War broke out in April 1861 when [[Confederate States of America|secessionist]] forces attacked [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]] in [[South Carolina]] shortly after [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|inaugurated]] as the [[President of the United States]]. The loyalists of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the North, which also included some geographically western and southern states, proclaimed support for the [[Constitution of the United States|Constitution]]. They faced secessionists of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] in the South, who advocated for [[states' rights]] in order to uphold slavery.\n\nOf the 34 [[U.S. state]]s in February 1861, seven Southern [[Slave states and free states|slave-holding states\"]] were declared by their state governments to have seceded from the country, and the  [[Confederate States of America]] was organized in rebellion against the U.S. constitutional government. The Confederacy grew to control at least a majority of territory in eleven states, and it claimed the additional states of Kentucky and Missouri by assertions from [[Government in exile|native secessionists fleeing Union authority]]. These states were given full representation in the [[Confederate States Congress|Confederate Congress]] throughout the Civil War. The two remaining \"slave states\", Delaware and Maryland, were invited to join the Confederacy, but nothing substantial developed due to [[Ex parte Merryman|intervention]] [[Habeas Corpus Suspension Act (1863)|by federal troops]].\n\nThe Confederate states were never diplomatically recognized as a joint entity by the [[Federal government of the United States|government of the United States]], nor by that of any foreign country.{{Efn|Although the United Kingdom and France granted it [[Belligerent|belligerent status]].}} The states that remained loyal to the U.S. were known as the Union.{{Efn|Including the [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] where slavery was legal.}} The Union and the Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over the course of four years.

The Southern states viewed this as a violation of their constitutional rights, and as the first step in a grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Stephen A. Douglas]]' votes were distributed nationally and [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]]'s votes centered in [[Tennessee]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Virginia]]. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally; thus Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]], seven slave states with [[cotton]]-based economies declared secession and formed the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, with an average of 49 percent.<ref>[https://cwemancipation.wordpress.com/2011/04/17/slavery-and-secession-1860-census-statistics/ \"Date of Secession Related to 1860 Black Population\"], America's Civil War</ref> Of those states whose legislatures resolved for secession, the first seven voted with split majorities for unionist candidates Douglas and Bell ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] with 51% and [[Louisiana]] with 55%), or with sizable minorities for those unionists ([[Alabama]] with 46%, [[Mississippi]] with 40%, [[Florida]] with 38%, [[Texas]] with 25%, and [[South Carolina]], which cast [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]] votes without a popular vote for president).<ref>Burnham, Walter Dean.

Outgoing Democratic President [[James Buchanan]] and the incoming Republicans rejected secession as illegal. [[Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address|Lincoln's March 4, 1861, inaugural address]] declared that his administration would not initiate a [[civil war]]. Speaking directly to the \"Southern States\", he attempted to calm their fears of any threats to slavery, reaffirming, \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the United States where it exists.

While in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Theater]] the Union made significant permanent gains, in the [[Eastern Theater of the American Civil War|Eastern Theater]], the battle was inconclusive during 1861\u20131862. Later, in September 1862, Lincoln issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], which made ending slavery a war goal.<ref name=\"proclamation\" /> To the west, by summer 1862 the Union destroyed the Confederate river navy, then much of its western armies, and seized [[New Orleans]]. The successful 1863 Union [[siege of Vicksburg]] split the Confederacy in two at the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1863, [[Robert E. Lee]]'s Confederate incursion north ended at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Western successes led to [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s command of all Union armies in 1864. Inflicting an ever-tightening [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of Confederate ports, the Union marshaled the resources and manpower to attack the Confederacy from all directions, leading to the [[fall of Atlanta]] to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|his march to the sea]]. The last significant battles raged around the [[Siege of Petersburg]]. Lee's escape attempt ended with his [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|surrender at Appomattox Court House]], on April 9, 1865. While the military war was coming to an end, the political reintegration of the nation was to take another 12 years, known as the [[Reconstruction era]].\n\n[[File:Flag of the Confederate States of America (1861\u20131863).svg|thumb|Confederate flag, the \"Stars and Bars\".]]\n\nThe American Civil War was among the earliest [[industrial warfare|industrial wars]].

The mobilization of civilian factories, mines, shipyards, banks, transportation, and food supplies all foreshadowed the impact of industrialization in [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and subsequent conflicts.

At first, the new states carved out of these territories entering the union were apportioned equally between slave and free states. Pro- and anti-slavery forces collided over the territories west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Krannawitter|2008|p=49\u201350}}\n\nWith the conquest of northern [[Mexico]] west to [[Alta California|California]] in 1848, slaveholding interests looked forward to expanding into these lands and perhaps Cuba and Central America as well.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=14}}{{sfn|Stampp|1990|p=190\u201393}}\nNorthern \"free soil\" interests vigorously sought to curtail any further expansion of slave territory. The [[Compromise of 1850]] over California balanced a free-soil state with stronger fugitive slave laws for a political settlement after four years of strife in the 1840s. But the states admitted following California were all free: Minnesota (1858), Oregon (1859) and Kansas (1861). In the Southern states the question of the territorial expansion of slavery westward again became explosive.{{sfn|McPherson|2007|pp=13\u201314}} Both the South and the North drew the same conclusion: \"The power to decide the question of slavery for the territories was the power to determine the future of slavery itself.\"{{sfn|Bestor|1964|p=19}}{{sfn|McPherson|2007|p=16}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align =\n| direction =\n| width =\n| image1 = Stephen Arnold Douglas.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| caption1 = Sen.

Of all these interpretations, the states'-rights argument is perhaps the weakest. It fails to ask the question, states' rights for what purpose?

Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North, which phased slavery out of existence, industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor, together with [[subsistence agriculture]] for poor whites. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery (in the guise of rejecting slave-owning bishops and missionaries) split the nation's largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern denominations.{{sfn|Ahlstrom|1972|p=648\u2013649}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether economic differences between the mainly industrial North and the mainly agricultural South helped cause the war.

While socially different, the sections economically benefited each other.<ref name=\"progressive\" />{{sfn|Woodworth|1996|p=145, 151, 505, 512, 554, 557, 684}}\n\n===Protectionism===\nSlave owners preferred low-cost manual labor with no mechanization. Northern manufacturing interests supported tariffs and protectionism while southern planters demanded free trade.{{sfn|Thornton|Ekelund|2004|p=21}} The Democrats in Congress, controlled by Southerners, wrote the tariff laws in the 1830s, 1840s, and 1850s, and kept reducing rates so that the 1857 rates were the lowest since 1816.

The Republican national electoral platform of 1860 warned that Republicans regarded disunion as [[treason]] and would not tolerate it: \"We denounce those threats of disunion&nbsp;... as denying the vital principles of a free government, and as an avowal of contemplated treason, which it is the imperative duty of an indignant people sternly to rebuke and forever silence.\"<ref name=\"republican18\" /> The South ignored the warnings: Southerners did not realize how ardently the North would fight to hold the Union together.<ref name=\"nationalism19\" />\n\n===Lincoln's election===\n{{Main|1860 United States presidential election}}\n[[File:Abraham Lincoln seated, Feb 9, 1864.jpg|thumb|190px|Abraham Lincoln in 1864]]\n\nThe election of Abraham Lincoln in November 1860 was the final trigger for secession.{{sfn|Potter|Fehrenbacher|1976|p=485}} Efforts at compromise, including the \"[[Corwin Amendment]]\" and the \"[[Crittenden Compromise]]\", failed.\nSouthern leaders feared that Lincoln would stop the expansion of slavery and put it on a course toward extinction. The slave states, which had already become a minority in the House of Representatives, were now facing a future as a perpetual minority in the Senate and Electoral College against an increasingly powerful North. Before Lincoln took office in March 1861, seven slave states had declared their secession and joined to form the Confederacy.\n\nAccording to Lincoln, the American people had shown that they had been successful in ''establishing'' and ''administering'' a republic, but a third challenge faced the nation, ''maintaining'' a republic based on the people's vote against an attempt to overthrow it.<ref>{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=u1xgWBntGYICA|page=1}}|title=A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War|last=Jaffa|first=Harry V.|date=2004|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780847699537|language=en|p=1}} {{dead link|date=November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Outbreak of the war==\n\n===Secession crisis===\nThe election of Lincoln provoked the legislature of South Carolina to call a state convention to consider secession.

The convention summoned unanimously voted to secede on December 20, 1860, and adopted the \"[[Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union]]\". It argued for states' rights for slave owners in the South, but contained a complaint about states' rights in the North in the form of opposition to the [[Fugitive Slave Law of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]], claiming that Northern states were not fulfilling their federal obligations under the Constitution.

The blockade shut down the ten Confederate seaports with railheads that moved almost all the cotton, especially New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston. By June 1861, warships were stationed off the principal Southern ports, and a year later nearly 300 ships were in service.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|pp=288\u201389, 296\u201398}}\n\n==== Blockade runners ====\n{{Main|Blockade runners of the American Civil War}}\n[[File:First Charleston Harbor.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Gunline of nine Union ironclads.

There were multiple reasons for this: the severe deterioration of food supplies, especially in cities, the failure of Southern railroads, the loss of control of the main rivers, foraging by Northern armies, and the seizure of animals and crops by Confederate armies.\n\nMost historians agree that the blockade was a major factor in ruining the Confederate economy; however, Wise argues that the blockade runners provided just enough of a lifeline to allow Lee to continue fighting for additional months, thanks to fresh supplies of 400,000 rifles, lead, blankets, and boots that the homefront economy could no longer supply.<ref>Stephen R. Wise, ''Lifeline of the Confederacy: Blockade Running during the Civil War'' (1991)</ref>\n\nSurdam argues that the blockade was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, at the cost of few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income.

Insurance rates skyrocketed and the American flag virtually disappeared from international waters. However, the same ships were reflagged with European flags and continued unmolested.{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=300}} After the war, the U.S. demanded that Britain pay for the damage done, and Britain paid the U.S. $15&nbsp;million in 1871.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=225}}\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomacy of the American Civil War}}\n\nAlthough the Confederacy hoped that Britain and France would join them against the Union, this was never likely, and so they instead tried to bring Britain and France in as mediators.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=546\u201357}}{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=237}} The Union, under Lincoln and Secretary of State [[William H.

In 1861, Southerners voluntarily embargoed cotton shipments, hoping to start an economic depression in Europe that would force Britain to enter the war to get cotton, but this did not work. Worse, Europe developed other cotton suppliers, which they found superior, hindering the South's recovery after the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}}\n[[File:USS Wissahickon Crewmembers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Crewmembers of {{USS|Wissahickon|1861|6}} by the ship's {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} [[Dahlgren gun]], circa 1863|alt=A group of twenty-six sailors posing around a rifled naval cannon]]\n[[Cotton diplomacy]] proved a failure as Europe had a surplus of cotton, while the 1860\u201362 crop failures in Europe made the North's grain exports of critical importance.

It was said that \"King Corn was more powerful than King Cotton\", as U.S. grain went from a quarter of the British import trade to almost half.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=386}} When Britain did face a cotton shortage, it was temporary, being replaced by increased cultivation in Egypt and India. Meanwhile, the war created employment for arms makers, ironworkers, and British ships to transport weapons.<ref name=\"nevins73\" />\n\nLincoln's administration failed to appeal to European public opinion. Diplomats explained that the United States was not committed to the ending of slavery, and instead repeated legalistic arguments about the unconstitutionality of secession. Confederate representatives, on the other hand, were much more successful by ignoring slavery and instead focusing on their struggle for liberty, their commitment to free trade, and the essential role of cotton in the European economy. The European aristocracy was \"absolutely gleeful in pronouncing the American debacle as proof that the entire experiment in popular government had failed. European government leaders welcomed the fragmentation of the ascendant American Republic.\"<ref>Don H.

The Confederacy purchased several warships from commercial shipbuilders in Britain ({{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah}}, {{ship|CSS|Tennessee|1863|6}}, {{ship|CSS|Tallahassee}}, {{ship|CSS|Florida}}, and some others). The most famous, the {{ship|CSS|Alabama}}, did considerable damage and led to serious [[Alabama Claims|postwar disputes]]. However, public opinion against slavery created a political liability for politicians in Britain, where the antislavery movement was powerful.<ref>Richard Huzzeym, ''Freedom Burning: Anti-Slavery and Empire in Victorian Britain'' (2013)</ref>\n\nWar loomed in late 1861 between the U.S. and Britain over the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' affair]], involving the U.S. Navy's boarding of the British ship {{RMS|Trent||2}} and seizure of two Confederate diplomats. However, London and Washington were able to smooth over the problem after Lincoln released the two. In 1862, the British considered mediation between North and South, though even such an offer would have risked war with the United States. British Prime Minister [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] reportedly read ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' three times when deciding on this.<ref name=\"approaching\" />\n\nThe Union victory in the [[Battle of Antietam]] caused them to delay this decision. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] over time would reinforce the political liability of supporting the Confederacy. Despite sympathy for the Confederacy, France's [[French intervention in Mexico|seizure of Mexico]] ultimately deterred them from war with the Union. Confederate offers late in the war to end slavery in return for diplomatic recognition were not seriously considered by London or Paris. After 1863, the [[January Uprising|Polish revolt against Russia]] further distracted the European powers, and ensured that they would remain neutral.{{sfn|Herring|2011|p=261}}\n\n==Eastern theater==\n[[File:American Civil War Battles by Theater, Year.png|thumb|[[County (United States)|County]] map of Civil War battles by theater and year]]\n\n{{Details|Eastern Theater of the American Civil War}}The Eastern theater refers to the military operations east of the [[Appalachian Mountains]], including the states of [[Virginia]], [[West Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the coastal fortifications and seaports of [[North Carolina]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Potomac \nMaj. Gen. [[George B. McClellan]] took command of the Union [[Army of the Potomac]] on July 26 (he was briefly general-in-chief of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. [[Henry Halleck|Henry W. Halleck]]), and the war began in earnest in 1862. The 1862 Union strategy called for simultaneous advances along four axes:{{sfn|Anderson|1989|p=91}}\n\n# McClellan would lead the main thrust in Virginia towards Richmond.\n# Ohio forces would advance through Kentucky into Tennessee.\n# The Missouri Department would drive south along the Mississippi River.\n# The westernmost attack would originate from Kansas.\n[[File:Robert Edward Lee.jpg|thumb|left|145px|Robert E. Lee]]\n; Army of Northern Virginia\n\nThe primary Confederate force in the Eastern theater was the [[Army of Northern Virginia]]. The Army originated as the [[Confederate Army of the Potomac|(Confederate) Army of the Potomac]], which was organized on June 20, 1861, from all operational forces in northern Virginia. On July 20 and 21, the [[Army of the Shenandoah (Confederate)|Army of the Shenandoah]] and forces from the District of Harpers Ferry were added. Units from the [[Army of the Northwest (Confederate)|Army of the Northwest]] were merged into the Army of the Potomac between March 14 and May 17, 1862. The Army of the Potomac was renamed ''Army of Northern Virginia'' on March 14. The [[Army of the Peninsula]] was merged into it on April 12, 1862.\n\nWhen Virginia declared its secession in April 1861, [[Robert E. Lee]] chose to follow his home state, despite his desire for the country to remain intact and an offer of a senior Union command.\n\nLee's biographer, [[Douglas S. Freeman]], asserts that the army received its final name from Lee when he issued orders assuming command on June 1, 1862.<ref>Freeman, Vol. II, p. 78 and footnote 6.</ref> However, Freeman does admit that Lee corresponded with Brigadier General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], his predecessor in army command, prior to that date and referred to Johnston's command as the Army of Northern Virginia. Part of the confusion results from the fact that Johnston commanded the Department of Northern Virginia (as of October 22, 1861) and the name Army of Northern Virginia can be seen as an informal consequence of its parent department's name. Jefferson Davis and Johnston did not adopt the name, but it is clear that the organization of units as of March 14 was the same organization that Lee received on June 1, and thus it is generally referred to today as the Army of Northern Virginia, even if that is correct only in retrospect. [[File:Bayonet-charge-1250.jpg|thumb|Union forces performing a bayonet charge, 1862]]On July 4 at Harper's Ferry, Colonel [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas J. Jackson]] assigned [[Jeb Stuart]] to command all the cavalry companies of the Army of the Shenandoah. He eventually commanded the Army of Northern Virginia's cavalry.\n\n=== Battles ===\n\n;First Bull Run\n\nIn one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of [[Major General|Maj. Gen.]] [[Irvin McDowell]] on the Confederate forces led by Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] near Washington was repulsed at the [[First Battle of Bull Run]] (also known as First Manassas). \n[[File:Stonewall Jackson by Routzahn, 1862.png|thumb|left|140px|\"Stonewall\" got his nickname at Bull Run.]]\nThe Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under. Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the [[Shenandoah Valley]] by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. A [[Stonewall Brigade|brigade of Virginians]] under the relatively unknown brigadier general from the [[Virginia Military Institute]], Thomas J. Jackson, stood its ground, which resulted in Jackson receiving his famous nickname, \"Stonewall\".\n\n; McClellan's Peninsula Campaign; Jackson's Valley Campaign\n[[File:George B McClellan - retouched.jpg|thumb|200x200px|George McClellan]]\nUpon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan attacked Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the [[Virginia Peninsula|peninsula]] between the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] and [[James River]], southeast of Richmond. McClellan's army reached the gates of Richmond in the [[Peninsula Campaign]],{{sfn|Foote|1974|p=464\u2013519}}<ref name=\"terrible\" />{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=424\u201327}}\n\nAlso in the spring of 1862, in the Shenandoah Valley, Stonewall Jackson led his [[Jackson's Valley Campaign|Valley Campaign]]. Employing audacity and rapid, unpredictable movements on interior lines, Jackson's 17,000 men marched 646 miles (1,040&nbsp;km) in 48 days and won several minor battles as they successfully engaged three Union armies (52,000 men), including those of [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] and [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont|John C. Fremont]], preventing them from reinforcing the Union offensive against Richmond. The swiftness of Jackson's men earned them the nickname of \"[[foot cavalry]]\".\n\nJohnston halted McClellan's advance at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], but he was wounded in the battle, and Robert E. Lee assumed his position of command. General Lee and top subordinates [[James Longstreet]] and Stonewall Jackson defeated McClellan in the [[Seven Days Battles]] and forced his retreat.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}\n\n;Second Bull Run\nThe [[Northern Virginia Campaign]], which included the [[Second Battle of Bull Run]], ended in yet another victory for the South.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=528\u201333}} McClellan resisted General-in-Chief Halleck's orders to send reinforcements to [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope's]] Union [[Army of Virginia]], which made it easier for Lee's Confederates to defeat twice the number of combined enemy troops.\n\n;Antietam\n[[File:Battle of Antietam by Thulstrup.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Battle of Antietam]], the Civil War's deadliest one-day fight.]]\n\nEmboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North with the [[Maryland Campaign]]. General Lee led 45,000 men of the Army of Northern Virginia across the [[Potomac River]] into Maryland on September 5. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan. McClellan and Lee fought at the [[Battle of Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]], Maryland, on September 17, 1862, the bloodiest single day in United States military history.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=538\u201344}}{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=543\u201345}} Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it.

After the battle, Burnside was replaced by Maj. Gen.

That same day, [[John Sedgwick]] advanced across the [[Rappahannock River]], defeated the small Confederate force at Marye's Heights in the [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg]], and then moved to the west. The Confederates fought a successful delaying action at the [[Battle of Salem Church]].\n\n;Gettysburg\n[[File:Thure de Thulstrup - L.

Meade defeated Lee at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] (July 1 to 3, 1863).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=653\u2013663}} This was the bloodiest battle of the war, and has been called the war's [[Turning point of the American Civil War|turning point]]. [[Pickett's Charge]] on July 3 is often considered the [[high-water mark of the Confederacy]] because it signaled the collapse of serious Confederate threats of victory. Lee's army suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000).{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=664}} However, Lincoln was angry that Meade failed to intercept Lee's retreat.\n\n==Western theater==\n{{Details|Western Theater of the American Civil War}}\nThe Western theater refers to military operations between the Appalachian Mountains and the [[Mississippi River]], including the states of [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]], as well as parts of [[Louisiana]].\n\n=== Background ===\n\n; Army of the Tennessee and Army of the Cumberland \n[[File:Gen. Ulysses S. Grant (4228634580).jpg|thumb|160px|Ulysses S. Grant]]\nThe primary Union forces in the Western theater were the [[Army of the Tennessee]] and the [[Army of the Cumberland]], named for the two rivers, the [[Tennessee River]] and [[Cumberland River]]. After Meade's inconclusive fall campaign, Lincoln turned to the Western Theater for new leadership. At the same time, the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg surrendered, giving the Union control of the Mississippi River, permanently isolating the western Confederacy, and producing the new leader Lincoln needed, [[Ulysses S. Grant]].\n\n; Army of Tennessee \nThe primary Confederate force in the Western theater was the [[Army of Tennessee]]. The army was formed on November 20, 1862, when General [[Braxton Bragg]] renamed the former [[Army of Mississippi]]. While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern Theater, they were defeated many times in the West.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;Fort Henry and Fort Donelson\n\nThe Union's key strategist and tactician in the West was Ulysses S. Grant, who won victories at Forts [[Battle of Fort Henry|Henry]] (February 6, 1862) and [[Battle of Fort Donelson|Donelson]] (February 11 to 16, 1862), earning him the nickname of \"Unconditional Surrender\" Grant, by which the Union seized control of the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] rallied nearly 4,000 Confederate troops and led them to escape across the Cumberland. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and central [[Tennessee]] thus fell to the Union, leading to attrition of local food supplies and livestock and a breakdown in social organization.\n\n[[Leonidas Polk]]'s invasion of [[Columbus, Kentucky|Columbus]] ended Kentucky's policy of neutrality and turned it against the Confederacy. Grant used river transport and [[Andrew H. Foote|Andrew Foote's]] gunboats of the Western Flotilla to threaten the Confederacy's \"Gibraltar of the West\" at Columbus, Kentucky. Although rebuffed at Belmont, Grant cut off Columbus. The Confederates, lacking their own gunboats, were forced to retreat and the Union took control of western Kentucky and opened Tennessee in March 1862.\n\n[[File:ASJohnston.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Albert Sidney Johnston died at Shiloh.]]\n;Shiloh\nAt [[Battle of Shiloh|the Battle of Shiloh]] (Pittsburg Landing), in Tennessee in April 1862, the Confederates made a surprise attack that pushed Union forces against the river as night fell.

Union Naval activities were dictated by the Anaconda Plan.\n\n=== Battles ===\n;South Carolina\nOne of the earliest battles of the war was fought at [[Battle of Port Royal|Port Royal Sound]], south of Charleston. Much of the war along the South Carolina coast concentrated on capturing [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. In attempting to capture Charleston, the Union military tried two approaches, by land over James or Morris Islands or through the harbor. However, the Confederates were able to drive back each Union attack. One of the most famous of the land attacks was the [[Second Battle of Fort Wagner]], in which the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|54th Massachusetts Infantry]] took part. The Federals suffered a serious defeat in this battle, losing 1,500 men while the Confederates lost only 175.\n\n;Georgia\nFort Pulaski on the Georgia coast was an early target for the Union navy. Following the capture of Port Royal, an expedition was organized with engineer troops under the command of Captain [[Quincy Adams Gillmore|Quincy A. Gillmore]], forcing a Confederate surrender. The Union army occupied the fort for the rest of the war after making repair.\n\n;Louisiana\n[[File:New Orleans h76369k.jpg|220px|thumb| New Orleans captured.]]\nIn April 1862, a Union naval task force commanded by Commander [[David Dixon Porter|David D.

While part of the fleet bombarded the forts, other vessels forced a break in the obstructions in the river and enabled the rest of the fleet to steam upriver to the city. A Union army force commanded by Major General [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] landed near the forts and forced their surrender. Butler's controversial command of New Orleans earned him the nickname \"Beast\".\n\nThe following year, the Union [[Army of the Gulf]] commanded by Major General Nathaniel P. Banks laid [[Siege of Port Hudson|siege to Port Hudson]] for nearly eight weeks, the longest siege in US military history.

Ewell|Ewell]]'s May 1864 attack at [[Battle of Spotsylvania|Spotsylvania]]\u2014delayed Grant's advance on Richmond in the [[Overland Campaign]].]]\n\n=== Grant's Overland Campaign ===\nGrant's army set out on the [[Overland Campaign]] with the goal of drawing Lee into a defense of Richmond, where they would attempt to pin down and destroy the Confederate army. The Union army first attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles, notably at the [[Battle of the Wilderness|Wilderness]], [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania]], and [[Battle of Cold Harbor|Cold Harbor]]. These battles resulted in heavy losses on both sides, and forced Lee's Confederates to fall back repeatedly. At the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]], the Confederates lost Jeb Stuart.\n\nAn attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was trapped inside the [[Bermuda Hundred Campaign|Bermuda Hundred]] river bend. Each battle resulted in setbacks for the Union that mirrored what they had suffered under prior generals, though unlike those prior generals, Grant fought on rather than retreat. Grant was tenacious and kept pressing Lee's Army of Northern Virginia back to Richmond. While Lee was preparing for an attack on Richmond, Grant unexpectedly turned south to cross the [[James River]] and began the protracted [[Siege of Petersburg]], where the two armies engaged in [[trench warfare]] for over nine months.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=724\u201342}}\n[[File:Philip Sheridan 1-restored.jpg|thumb|160px|Philip Sheridan]]\n\n=== Sheridan's Valley Campaign ===\nGrant finally found a commander, General Philip Sheridan, aggressive enough to prevail in the [[Valley Campaigns of 1864]]. Sheridan was initially repelled at the [[Battle of New Market]] by former U.S. Vice President and Confederate Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]]. The Battle of New Market was the Confederacy's last major victory of the war, and included a charge by teenage VMI cadets. After redoubling his efforts, Sheridan defeated Maj. Gen. [[Jubal Early|Jubal A. Early]] in a series of battles, including a final decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. Sheridan then proceeded to destroy the agricultural base of the [[Shenandoah Valley]], a strategy similar to the tactics Sherman later employed in Georgia.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=778\u201379}}\n\n=== Sherman's March to the Sea ===\nMeanwhile, Sherman maneuvered from Chattanooga to Atlanta, defeating Confederate Generals [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and [[John Bell Hood]] along the way. The [[Battle of Atlanta|fall of Atlanta]] on September 2, 1864, guaranteed the reelection of Lincoln as president.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=773\u201376}} Hood left the Atlanta area to swing around and menace Sherman's supply lines and invade Tennessee in the [[Franklin\u2013Nashville Campaign]]. Union Maj. Gen. [[John Schofield]] defeated Hood at the [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|Battle of Franklin]], and [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas]] dealt Hood a massive defeat at the [[Battle of Nashville]], effectively destroying Hood's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=812\u201315}}[[File:The Peacemakers 1868.jpg|thumb|''[[The Peacemakers]]'' by [[George Peter Alexander Healy]] portrays [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]], [[Ulysses S.

He reached the Atlantic Ocean at [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]], Georgia, in December 1864. Sherman's army was followed by thousands of freed slaves; there were no major battles along the March. Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Confederate Virginia lines from the south, increasing the pressure on Lee's army.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=825\u201330}}\n\n=== The Waterloo of the Confederacy ===\nLee's army, thinned by desertion and casualties, was now much smaller than Grant's. One last Confederate attempt to break the Union hold on Petersburg failed at the decisive [[Battle of Five Forks]] (sometimes called \"the [[Waterloo in popular culture#Other|Waterloo]] of the Confederacy\") on April 1. This meant that the Union now controlled the entire perimeter surrounding Richmond-Petersburg, completely cutting it off from the Confederacy. Realizing that the capital was now lost, Lee decided to evacuate his army. The Confederate capital fell to the [[XXV Corps (Union Army)|Union XXV Corps]], composed of black troops. The remaining Confederate units fled west after a defeat at [[Battle of Sayler's Creek|Sayler's Creek]].{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=846\u201347}}\n\n==Confederacy surrenders==\n{{Main|Conclusion of the American Civil War}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width =400\n\n| image1    = 18650410 Surrender of General Lee and His Whole Army - The New York Times.png\n| alt1      = \n| width1    = \n| caption1  = This ''New York Times'' front page celebrated Lee's surrender, headlining how Grant let Confederate officers retain their sidearms and \"paroled\" the Confederate officers and men.<ref name=NYTimes_18650410>{{cite news |title=Union / Victory! / Peace! / Surrender of General Lee and His Whole Army. |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/new-york-times-apr-10-1865-p-1/ |work=The New York Times |date=April 10, 1865 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\n| image2    = 18650416 Lee Has Surrendered to Grant - Savannah Daily Herald.png\n| caption2  = News of Lee's April 9 surrender reached this southern newspaper (Savannah, Georgia) on April 15\u2014after the April 14 shooting of President Lincoln.<ref name=SavannahDailyHerald_18650416/> The article quotes Grant's terms of surrender.<ref name=SavannahDailyHerald_18650416>{{cite news |title=Most Glorious News of the War / Lee Has Surrendered to Grant ! / All Lee's Officers and Men Are Paroled |url=https://newspaperarchive.com/savannah-daily-herald-apr-16-1865-p-1/ |work=Savannah Daily Herald |date=April 16, 1865 |location=Savannah, Georgia, U.S. |pages=1, 4}}</ref>\n}}\nInitially, Lee did not intend to surrender, but planned to regroup at the [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|village of Appomattox Court House]], where supplies were to be waiting, and then continue the war. Grant chased Lee and got in front of him, so that when Lee's army reached Appomattox Court House, they were surrounded.

The North and West grew rich while the once-rich South became poor for a century. The national political power of the slaveowners and rich Southerners ended. Historians are less sure about the results of the postwar Reconstruction, especially regarding the second-class citizenship of the Freedmen and their poverty.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=851}}\n\nHistorians have debated whether the Confederacy could have won the war. Most scholars, including [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]], argue that Confederate victory was at least possible.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|p=855}} McPherson argues that the North's advantage in population and resources made Northern victory likely but not guaranteed. He also argues that if the Confederacy had fought using unconventional tactics, they would have more easily been able to hold out long enough to exhaust the Union.<ref name=\"confederacy\" />\n\nConfederates did not need to invade and hold enemy territory to win, but only needed to fight a defensive war to convince the North that the cost of winning was too high. The North needed to conquer and hold vast stretches of enemy territory and defeat Confederate armies to win.<ref name=\"confederacy\" /> Lincoln was not a military dictator, and could continue to fight the war only as long as the American public supported a continuation of the war. The Confederacy sought to win independence by out-lasting Lincoln; however, after Atlanta fell and Lincoln defeated McClellan in the election of 1864, all hope for a political victory for the South ended. At that point, Lincoln had secured the support of the Republicans, War Democrats, the border states, emancipated slaves, and the neutrality of Britain and France. By defeating the Democrats and McClellan, he also defeated the [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] and their peace platform.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=771\u201372}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; text-align:center; margin:2em;\"\n|+ Comparison of Union and Confederacy, 1860\u20131864<ref name=\"census74\" />\n!\n! scope=\"col\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" | Union\n! scope=\"col\" | Confederacy\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|'''Population'''\n|1860\n| 22,100,000 (71%)\n| 9,100,000 (29%)\n|-\n|1864\n| 28,800,000 (90%){{refn|name=UnionPop|group=lower-alpha|\"Union population 1864\" aggregates 1860 population, average annual immigration 1855\u20131864, and population governed formerly by CSA per Kenneth Martis source.

He attributes the major Confederate defeats in 1863 at Vicksburg and Missionary Ridge to this class conflict.<ref>Armstead Robinson, ''Bitter Fruits of Bondage: The Demise of Slavery and the Collapse of the Confederacy, 1861\u20131865'' (University of Virginia Press, 2004)</ref> However, most historians reject the argument.<ref>see Alan Farmer, [http://www.historytoday.com/alan-farmer/why-was-confederacy-defeated ''History Review'' (2005)], No. 52: 15\u201320.</ref> [[James M.

Even as the Confederacy was visibly collapsing in 1864\u201365, he says most Confederate soldiers were fighting hard.{{sfn|McPherson|1997|pp=169\u201372}} Historian [[Gary Gallagher]] cites General Sherman who in early 1864 commented, \"The devils seem to have a determination that cannot but be admired.\" Despite their loss of slaves and wealth, with starvation looming, Sherman continued, \"yet I see no sign of let up\u2014some few deserters\u2014plenty tired of war, but the masses determined to fight it out.\"{{sfn|Gallagher|1999|p=57}}\n\nAlso important were Lincoln's eloquence in rationalizing the national purpose and his skill in keeping the border states committed to the Union cause. The Emancipation Proclamation was an effective use of the President's war powers.<ref name=\"WarLeader\" /> The Confederate government failed in its attempt to get Europe involved in the war militarily, particularly Britain and France. Southern leaders needed to get European powers to help break up the blockade the Union had created around the Southern ports and cities. Lincoln's naval blockade was 95 percent effective at stopping trade goods; as a result, imports and exports to the South declined significantly. The abundance of European cotton and Britain's hostility to the institution of slavery, along with Lincoln's Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico naval blockades, severely decreased any chance that either Britain or France would enter the war.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=382\u201388}}\n\nHistorian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory had a major impact on the course of world history.<ref>Don H.

In addition to many Confederate records being missing, partly as a result of Confederate widows not reporting deaths due to being ineligible for benefits, both armies only counted troops who died during their service, and not the tens of thousands who died of wounds or diseases after being discharged. This often happened only a few days or weeks later.

While Walker's estimates were originally dismissed because of the 1870 census's undercounting, it was later found that the census was only off by 6.5%, and that the data Walker used would be roughly accurate.<ref name=\"recounting\"/>\n\nAnalyzing the number of dead by using census data to calculate the deviation of the death rate of men of fighting age from the norm suggests that at least 627,000 and at most 888,000, but most likely 761,000 soldiers, died in the war.{{sfn|Hacker|2011|p=307\u201348}} This would break down to approximately 350,000 Confederate and 411,000 Union military deaths, going by the proportion of Union to Confederate battle losses.\n\nDeaths among former slaves has proven much harder to estimate, due to the lack of reliable census data at the time, though they were known to be considerable, as former slaves were set free or escaped in massive numbers in an area where the Union army did not have sufficient shelter, doctors, or food for them. University of Connecticut Professor James Downs states that tens to hundreds of thousands of slaves died during the war from disease, starvation, or exposure, and that if these deaths are counted in the war's total, the death toll would exceed 1&nbsp;million.<ref>Professor James Downs. \"Sick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction\".

One reason for the high number of battle deaths during the war was the continued use of tactics similar to those of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] at the turn of the century, such as [[charge (warfare)|charging]]. With the advent of more accurate rifled barrels, [[Mini\u00e9 ball]]s, and (near the end of the war for the [[Union army]]) repeating firearms such as the [[Spencer repeating rifle|Spencer Repeating Rifle]] and the [[Henry rifle|Henry Repeating Rifle]], soldiers were mowed down when standing in lines in the open.

By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As one Congressman put it, the slaves \"...&nbsp;cannot be neutral.

From early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in occupied areas like Nashville, Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862, Tennessee from 1862 on, the line of Sherman's march, etc. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. See Catton, Bruce. ''Never Call Retreat'', p.&nbsp;335. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations. In addition, approximately 180,000 or more African-American men served as soldiers and sailors with Union troops. Most of those were escaped slaves. Probably the most prominent of these African-American soldiers is the [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]].}} About 190,000 volunteered, further enhancing the numerical advantage the Union armies enjoyed over the Confederates, who did not dare emulate the equivalent manpower source for fear of fundamentally undermining the legitimacy of slavery.{{refn|name=SlavesinConfedArmy|group=lower-alpha|In spite of the South's shortage of soldiers, most Southern leaders\u2014until 1865\u2014opposed enlisting slaves. They used them as laborers to support the war effort. As [[Howell Cobb]] said, \"If slaves will make good soldiers our whole theory of slavery is wrong.\" Confederate generals [[Patrick Cleburne]] and [[Robert E. Lee]] argued in favor of arming blacks late in the war, and [[Jefferson Davis]] was eventually persuaded to support plans for arming slaves to avoid military defeat. The Confederacy surrendered at [[Appomattox, Virginia|Appomattox]] before this plan could be implemented.{{sfn|McPherson|1988|pp=831\u201337}} The great majority of the 4 million slaves were freed by the Emancipation Proclamation, as Union armies moved south.

They were 'all frantic with joy, some weeping, some blessing, and some dancing in the exuberance of their emotions.' All of the Negroes were attracted by the pageantry and excitement of the army. Others cheered because they anticipated the freedom to plunder and to do as they pleased now that the Federal troops were there.\"{{sfn|Winters|1963|p=237}} Confederates enslaved captured black Union soldiers, and black soldiers especially were shot when trying to surrender at the [[Battle of Fort Pillow|Fort Pillow Massacre]].

Most of all, they could form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.<ref>Fallin, ''Uplifting the People: Three Centuries of Black Baptists in Alabama'' (2007), pp. 52\u201353.</ref>}}\n\n===Lost Cause===\n{{main|Lost Cause of the Confederacy}}\nMemory of the war in the white South crystallized in the myth of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|\"Lost Cause\"]]: that the Confederate cause was a just and heroic one. The myth shaped regional identity and race relations for generations.<ref name=\"confederacy84\" /> Alan T. Nolan notes that the Lost Cause was expressly \"a rationalization, a cover-up to vindicate the name and fame\" of those in rebellion. Some claims revolve around the insignificance of slavery; some appeals highlight cultural differences between North and South; the military conflict by Confederate actors is idealized; in any case, secession was said to be lawful.<ref>Nolan, Alan T., in Gallagher, Gary W., and Alan T. Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause and Civil War history'' (2000), pp. 12\u201319.</ref> Nolan argues that the adoption of the Lost Cause perspective facilitated the reunification of the North and the South while excusing the [[Nadir of American race relations|\"virulent racism\" of the 19th century]], sacrificing African-American progress to a white man's reunification. He also deems the Lost Cause \"a caricature of the truth. This caricature wholly misrepresents and distorts the facts of the matter\" in every instance.<ref>Nolan, ''The Myth of the Lost Cause'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\n===Beardian historiography===\nThe economic and political-power determinism forcefully presented by [[Charles A. Beard]] and Mary R. Beard in ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) was highly influential among historians and the general public until the [[civil rights movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. The Beards downplayed slavery, abolitionism, and issues of morality. They ignored constitutional issues of states' rights and even ignored American nationalism as the force that finally led to victory in the war. Indeed, the ferocious combat itself was passed over as merely an ephemeral event. Much more important was the calculus of class conflict. The Beards announced that the Civil War was really:\n\n{{quote|[A] social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South.<ref>Charles A.

Col Lawrence Cummings. Training was provided by the 4401st Helicopter Squadron, under the \"PONY EXPRESS\" Project. The pilots selected were the most experienced CH-3B/C pilots in the Air Force at the time since the CH-3B/C had been operational with the USAF for a very short period of time.\nAfter a month of training and checkout, the Squadron was deployed to South Vietnam in November 1965. The Squadron initially was stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] near Saigon. The CH-3C helicopters, which had been disassembled and flown to Viet Nam in [[C-133]] aircraft, were then assembled and readied for duty. The Squadron was split into three flights; one stayed at Tan Son Nhut under the command of Major Richard Burdett. Another flight was sent to [[Danang Air Base]] under the command of Major Herbert Zehnder with six CH-3C aircraft. The third flight was assigned to [[Cam Ranh Bay]].\n\n==Mission==\nThe flight at Da Nang performed several missions in the six months they were located there. One of the missions was to support the Forward Air Controller units at the [[Kham Duc]] and [[Khe Sahn]] Green Beret bases, which involved carrying 500 gallon fuel cells and [[Conex box]]es of supplies on the cargo sling.\nThe flight performed many general support missions such as retrieving downed Marine [[Sikorsky H-34|H-34]] and [[UH-1|Huey]] helicopters from remote sites, slinging fully equipped radio jeeps to hilltop reconnaissance sites; and ferrying wounded soldiers to the hospital at Da Nang or to the Hospital Ship [[USS Repose (AH-16)|USS Repose]] which was stationed off the coast of Da Nang. One major mission was to work with the Marines to support [[Operation Double Eagle]] by emplacing 105&nbsp;mm Howitzers at forward firing positions by carrying them on the cargo sling under the aircraft and placing them in position at the forward firing site. \nOne of the Pony pilots was awarded the [[Silver Star]] when he was diverted on the way back from Dong Ha to evacuate wounded soldiers from the [[A Shau Valley]] which was under attack by heavy mortar and machine gun fire. He escaped ground fire after takeoff by immediately pulling up into the low-lying clouds.\n\nIn late spring of 1966, the flights at Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang were reassigned to [[Udorn RTAFB]] in Thailand under headquarters 14th Command Support Group, [[Nha Trang]], South Vietnam. The designated radio call sign was \"Pony Express\". There they again performed a number of missions including support of anti-terrorist operations of the Thai Army. During the monsoon season the CH-3C helicopters were used to fly critical supplies and medical personnel to outlying villages which were cut off from road supply by the muddy roads. The Ponies also had the mission of engaging in classified Counterinsurgency flights into Laos and North Vietnam. In 1968 the unit was PCS to Udorn.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Cambodian Campaign}}\n{{details|Operation Lam Son 719}}\nThe [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], the logistical system that supplied the manpower and materiel for the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] and the [[People's Army of Vietnam]], ran not only through the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and the [[Republic of Vietnam]], but also through the neighbouring countries of [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Via the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]], the [[US military]] aimed to work outside of Vietnam and [[General Westmoreland]]'s jurisdiction:\n\n<blockquote>to execute an intensified program of harassment, diversion, political pressure, capture of prisoners, physical destruction, acquisition of intelligence, generation\nof propaganda, and diversion of resources, against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.<ref>Annex A to MACV Command History, 1964, p.

The Pony Express' primary highly classified mission was counterinsurgency. They flew their unarmed helicopters from Thailand to various friendly airstrips in Laos where they could refuel and await to launch their missions. They would fly indigenous troops into unprepared sites in Laos and North Vietnam to gather intelligence on troop/truck movements, etc. This information would in turn be forwarded to the appropriate Military agencies to select targets for air strike missions.\n\nThe unit aircraft were basic CH-3C Sikorsky helicopters models. No armor was deemed necessary at this time since the mission was to be clandestine and the power/weight ratio was considered more important. Even then, with the equipped engines, power was sometimes very marginal. In early 1968, the engines were upgraded from the 1300&nbsp;hp model to the 1500&nbsp;hp models which was a vast improvement in the high temperature/humidity environment. With the upgrading of the engines, armor was installed on the engine cowling doors, the transmission doors, and around the tail rotor gearbox. Designation was changed from CH-3C to CH-3E.\n\nDue to the classified nature of their mission, the 20th CH-3's did not display any U.S. markings or insignia. They were equipped with slotted hangers to insert the USAF insignia when flying \"in country\". The pilots had no insignia on their flight suits. The helicopters were painted the standard camouflage pattern, except one. CH-3C #63-09676 was painted flat black to determine the color feasibility for our mission. It soon was given the nickname of \"Black Mariah\". (It was the only black H-3 to serve in SEA and is now on display at the USAF Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.)\n\nThe infil/exfil site would be selected and studied. Previous to the flight an airborne \"recon\" of the site would be made, often using CAS Beech Baron or [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] [[Pilatus Porter]] aircraft. Since the Air America aircraft were constantly flying over the country, they would hardly be noticed.\nThe mission tactics would usually include two helicopters. One would be the \"high bird\" and would orbit at a discreet distance to distract the enemy and to act as a rescue aircraft if needed. The \"low bird\" would fly in at low altitude to the selected site to offload the troops. This was usually accomplished at dusk to give the ground troops a chance to disperse if enemy forces were encountered. If any enemy ground fire was encountered on the \"infil\" approach, the mission would be aborted and the troops not put at undue risk.\n\nAs previously stated, the helicopters were not equipped with armor. The crew would wear the \"flak vest\" and place another flack vest under the pilot seats to provide personal protection. Their only weapons were the crewmember's personal weapons, an [[M16 rifle|M-16]] rifle and a .38 caliber revolver. The infil portion of the mission required secrecy and not a firefight. The \"exfil\" though might be another matter. Sometimes the ground troops would encounter enemy forces and would require extraction while under enemy fire. The \"Ponies\" depended on \"top cover\" usually supplied by [[A-1 Skyraider]] attack aircraft, call sign depended on where they were stationed and could be \"Sandy\", Hobo\" or \"Firefly\", to provide close air support with their guns and bombs, if needed. In the early days at Udorn, the Ponies were sometimes accompanied by World War II twin engine [[B-26 Invader]] aircraft callsign \"Nimrod\".\n\nThe Pony Express other mission was in support of [[TACAN]] navigational sites in Laos. These sites were important in guiding fighter and bomber aircraft on strike missions into North Vietnam. The helicopters would deliver personnel and needed supplies, such as power generators and diesel fuel, to the remotely located sites. One of the most important of these sites was at [[Lima Site 85]] on top of a 5800' karst mountain, 19&nbsp;km south of the Laotian/North Vietnam border and 125 miles southwest of Hanoi. LS85 also was supplied with super secret equipment used to direct strike missions around Hanoi.\n\nIn the spring of 1968, some pilots and CH-3s of the 20th HES were transferred to [[Nakhon Phanom RTAFB]] (NKP) to form the [[21st Special Operations Squadron|21st Helicopter Squadron]].\n\nIn July 1968, four UH-1F's and 10 pilots from the 20th Helicopter Squadron, \"E\" Flight, \"Green Hornets,\" arrived from Nha Trang. The \"new\" Pony Express Hueys flew virtually all the same missions as the H-3's. There were a few of the H-3 missions in Northern Laos that the Hueys were not involved in due to the extreme distance and limited range of the UH-1. On occasion, the Huey would carry a 55-gallon barrel of fuel in the cabin. If the Huey required the extra fuel, the crewchief would hook up his safety strap, step out onto the chopper's skid and hold the refueling hose as the other crewman pumped the fuel into the Huey's fuel tank. This was done at cruising altitude.\n\nIn August 1968 the 20th Helicopter Squadron was redesignated the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS). The Pony Express continued to fly many missions in support of DOSA (Director of Operations for Special Activities) through 1968 and into 1969. The Ponies flew 75% of their flying time as combat time and over 75% of their time flying their primary DOSA missions. The Pony Express always had two large and important missions, TACAN support and DOSA missions fragged by 7/13th AF in support of the secret war in Laos. The Ponies did not have sufficient helicopters and pilots to accomplish every mission adequately. Some of their large missions required the use of up to 20 CH-3E helicopters and they only had nine CH-3's and four UH-1's assigned. On many occasions the Pony Express called upon the 21st SOS at NKP to help with these large missions. Many times they were assisted by helicopters from Air America.\n\nAs early as June 1968, higher Headquarters began talk of merging the 20th and 21st began which would allow them to work more closely together and utilize the 21st flying time more for combat missions. The Pony Express would remain at Udorn as a Forward Operating Location (FOL) with basically the same people, aircraft and mission. Little did anyone know of the problems to follow. Apparently the ego and petty jealousy of the Wing Commander at NKP who insisted that all assets be transferred to NKP created a severe demoralizing effect on all concerned. The Ponies crews still accomplished their mission in an excellent manner despite the difficulties.\n\nOn 5 Sep 1969, the 20th SOS CH-3E aircraft and personnel at Udorn were reassigned to the 21st SOS at NKP.

Col Lawrence Cummings. Training was provided by the 4401st Helicopter Squadron, under the \"PONY EXPRESS\" Project. The pilots selected were the most experienced CH-3B/C pilots in the Air Force at the time since the CH-3B/C had been operational with the USAF for a very short period of time.\nAfter a month of training and checkout, the Squadron was deployed to South Vietnam in November 1965. The Squadron initially was stationed at [[Tan Son Nhut Air Base]] near Saigon. The CH-3C helicopters, which had been disassembled and flown to Viet Nam in [[C-133]] aircraft, were then assembled and readied for duty. The Squadron was split into three flights; one stayed at Tan Son Nhut under the command of Major Richard Burdett. Another flight was sent to [[Danang Air Base]] under the command of Major Herbert Zehnder with six CH-3C aircraft. The third flight was assigned to [[Cam Ranh Bay]].\n\n==Mission==\nThe flight at Da Nang performed several missions in the six months they were located there. One of the missions was to support the Forward Air Controller units at the [[Kham Duc]] and [[Khe Sahn]] Green Beret bases, which involved carrying 500 gallon fuel cells and [[Conex box]]es of supplies on the cargo sling.\nThe flight performed many general support missions such as retrieving downed Marine [[Sikorsky H-34|H-34]] and [[UH-1|Huey]] helicopters from remote sites, slinging fully equipped radio jeeps to hilltop reconnaissance sites; and ferrying wounded soldiers to the hospital at Da Nang or to the Hospital Ship [[USS Repose (AH-16)|USS Repose]] which was stationed off the coast of Da Nang. One major mission was to work with the Marines to support [[Operation Double Eagle]] by emplacing 105&nbsp;mm Howitzers at forward firing positions by carrying them on the cargo sling under the aircraft and placing them in position at the forward firing site. \nOne of the Pony pilots was awarded the [[Silver Star]] when he was diverted on the way back from Dong Ha to evacuate wounded soldiers from the [[A Shau Valley]] which was under attack by heavy mortar and machine gun fire. He escaped ground fire after takeoff by immediately pulling up into the low-lying clouds.\n\nIn late spring of 1966, the flights at Cam Ranh Bay and Da Nang were reassigned to [[Udorn RTAFB]] in Thailand under headquarters 14th Command Support Group, [[Nha Trang]], South Vietnam. The designated radio call sign was \"Pony Express\". There they again performed a number of missions including support of anti-terrorist operations of the Thai Army. During the monsoon season the CH-3C helicopters were used to fly critical supplies and medical personnel to outlying villages which were cut off from road supply by the muddy roads. The Ponies also had the mission of engaging in classified Counterinsurgency flights into Laos and North Vietnam. In 1968 the unit was PCS to Udorn.\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Cambodian Campaign}}\n{{details|Operation Lam Son 719}}\nThe [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], the logistical system that supplied the manpower and materiel for the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam]] and the [[People's Army of Vietnam]], ran not only through the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and the [[Republic of Vietnam]], but also through the neighbouring countries of [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Via the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group]], the [[US military]] aimed to work outside of Vietnam and [[General Westmoreland]]'s jurisdiction:\n\n<blockquote>to execute an intensified program of harassment, diversion, political pressure, capture of prisoners, physical destruction, acquisition of intelligence, generation\nof propaganda, and diversion of resources, against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.<ref>Annex A to MACV Command History, 1964, p. A-1.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn 21 September 1965 the JCS authorized [[MACV-SOG]] to begin cross-border operations within Laos in areas contiguous to the South Vietnam's western border.<ref>MACV Command History 1965, Annex N, N-VIII-4</ref>\n\nTypically the [[20th Special Operations Squadron|20th SOS]] carried unconventional forces across the border for secret missions into North Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, such as the [[United States Special Operations Command|special operations group]] inserted by [[CH-3C/E]] helicopter across the Vietnamese border on June 30, 1968.<ref name=\"dunstan169\"/> Most of these SOG recon teams were made up of personnel indigenous to the population, reducing American combat casualties.<ref name=\"R18\"/>\n\n==Operations==\n{{Expand section|date=June 2007}}\n{{See also|Operation Hardnose|Operation Star (Laos)|label 2=Operation Star}}\n[[File:Ponysign.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Symbol of the Pony Express at the 20th HES, Udorn RTAFB, Thailand]]\n\nThe 20th Helicopter Squadron \"Pony Express\" was one of the most extraordinary and outstanding combat units in Southeast Asia. The Pony Express' primary highly classified mission was counterinsurgency. They flew their unarmed helicopters from Thailand to various friendly airstrips in Laos where they could refuel and await to launch their missions. They would fly indigenous troops into unprepared sites in Laos and North Vietnam to gather intelligence on troop/truck movements, etc. This information would in turn be forwarded to the appropriate Military agencies to select targets for air strike missions.\n\nThe unit aircraft were basic CH-3C Sikorsky helicopters models. No armor was deemed necessary at this time since the mission was to be clandestine and the power/weight ratio was considered more important. Even then, with the equipped engines, power was sometimes very marginal. In early 1968, the engines were upgraded from the 1300&nbsp;hp model to the 1500&nbsp;hp models which was a vast improvement in the high temperature/humidity environment. With the upgrading of the engines, armor was installed on the engine cowling doors, the transmission doors, and around the tail rotor gearbox. Designation was changed from CH-3C to CH-3E.\n\nDue to the classified nature of their mission, the 20th CH-3's did not display any U.S. markings or insignia. They were equipped with slotted hangers to insert the USAF insignia when flying \"in country\". The pilots had no insignia on their flight suits. The helicopters were painted the standard camouflage pattern, except one. CH-3C #63-09676 was painted flat black to determine the color feasibility for our mission. It soon was given the nickname of \"Black Mariah\". (It was the only black H-3 to serve in SEA and is now on display at the USAF Museum at Wright-Patterson AFB, Dayton, Ohio.)\n\nThe infil/exfil site would be selected and studied. Previous to the flight an airborne \"recon\" of the site would be made, often using CAS Beech Baron or [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] [[Pilatus Porter]] aircraft. Since the Air America aircraft were constantly flying over the country, they would hardly be noticed.\nThe mission tactics would usually include two helicopters. One would be the \"high bird\" and would orbit at a discreet distance to distract the enemy and to act as a rescue aircraft if needed. The \"low bird\" would fly in at low altitude to the selected site to offload the troops. This was usually accomplished at dusk to give the ground troops a chance to disperse if enemy forces were encountered. If any enemy ground fire was encountered on the \"infil\" approach, the mission would be aborted and the troops not put at undue risk.\n\nAs previously stated, the helicopters were not equipped with armor. The crew would wear the \"flak vest\" and place another flack vest under the pilot seats to provide personal protection. Their only weapons were the crewmember's personal weapons, an [[M16 rifle|M-16]] rifle and a .38 caliber revolver. The infil portion of the mission required secrecy and not a firefight. The \"exfil\" though might another matter. Sometimes the ground troops would encounter enemy forces and would require extraction while under enemy fire. The \"Ponies\" depended on \"top cover\" usually supplied by [[A-1 Skyraider]] fighter aircraft, call sign depended on where they were stationed and could be \"Sandy\", Hobo\" or \"Firefly\", to provide close air support with their guns and bombs, if needed. In the early days at Udorn, the Ponies were sometimes accompanied by World War II twin engine [[B-26 Invader]] aircraft callsign \"Nimrod\".\n\nThe Pony Express other mission was in support of [[TACAN]] navigational sites in Laos. These sites were important in guiding fighter and bomber aircraft on strike missions into North Vietnam. The helicopters would deliver personnel and needed supplies, such as power generators and diesel fuel, to the remotely located sites. One of the most important of these sites was at [[Lima Site 85]] on top of a 5800' karst mountain, 19&nbsp;km south of the Laotian/North Vietnam border and 125 miles southwest of Hanoi. LS85 also was supplied with super secret equipment used to direct strike missions around Hanoi.\n\nIn the spring of 1968, some pilots and CH-3s of the 20th HES were transferred to [[Nakhon Phanom RTAFB]] (NKP) to form the [[21st Special Operations Squadron|21st Helicopter Squadron]].\n\nIn July 1968, four UH-1F's and 10 pilots from the 20th Helicopter Squadron, \"E\" Flight, \"Green Hornets,\" arrived from Nha Trang. The \"new\" Pony Express Hueys flew virtually all the same missions as the H-3's. There were a few of the H-3 missions in Northern Laos that the Hueys were not involved in due to the extreme distance and limited range of the UH-1. On occasion, the Huey would carry a 55-gallon barrel of fuel in the cabin. If the Huey required the extra fuel, the crewchief would hook up his safety strap, step out onto the chopper's skid and hold the refueling hose as the other crewman pumped the fuel into the Huey's fuel tank. This was done at cruising altitude.\n\nIn August 1968 the 20th Helicopter Squadron was redesignated the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]] (SOS). The Pony Express continued to fly many missions in support of DOSA (Director of Operations for Special Activities) through 1968 and into 1969. The Ponies flew 75% of their flying time as combat time and over 75% of their time flying their primary DOSA missions. The Pony Express always had two large and important missions, TACAN support and DOSA missions fragged by 7/13th AF in support of the secret war in Laos. The Ponies did not have sufficient helicopters and pilots to accomplish every mission adequately. Some of their large missions required the use of up to 20 CH-3E helicopters and they only had nine CH-3's and four UH-1's assigned. On many occasions the Pony Express called upon the 21st SOS at NKP to help with these large missions. Many times they were assisted by helicopters from Air America.\n\nAs early as June 1968, higher Headquarters began talk of merging the 20th and 21st began which would allow them to work more closely together and utilize the 21st flying time more for combat missions. The Pony Express would remain at Udorn as a Forward Operating Location (FOL) with basically the same people, aircraft and mission. Little did anyone know of the problems to follow. Apparently the ego and petty jealousy of the Wing Commander at NKP who insisted that all assets be transferred to NKP created a severe demoralizing effect on all concerned. The Ponies crews still accomplished their mission in an excellent manner despite the difficulties.\n\nOn 5 Sep 1969, the 20th SOS CH-3E aircraft and personnel at Udorn were reassigned to the 21st SOS at NKP. The FOL at Udorn lost three helicopters to NKP and many pilot spaces which amounted to one third of its capability, yet the FOL still flew 63% of the DOSA missions and 60% of the TACAN and an amazing 53.8% of the overall mission of the entire newly formed 21st SOS headquartered at NKP with the FOL stationed at Udorn RTAFB, Thailand.\n\nWhen the 20th SOS CH-3E's were transferred to the 21st SOS, without ceremony or fanfare, the \"Pony Express\" part of the 20th Special Operations Squadron ceased to exist.\n\n[[File:Ponyemblem.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Emblem of the 20th SOS, the ''Pony Express'']]\n[[File:CH3Rice.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A USAF CH-3E downed in a rice paddy after having taken off with too many members of a Thai Artillery team on board, June 1969.<ref>Kirkpatrick, Matthew D.

An example is given below:\n\n::Jane will '''watch a movie'''.\n\n::Jane will '''watch a movie''' and Liz will <sub>watch a movie</sub> too.\n\nThe requirements of VPE have been studied, but the general agreement is that\u00a0specific selectional properties and conditions of certain elements must be satisfied for VPE to work. \n\n==Features of verb phrase ellipsis in English==\nIn the VP ellipsis considered here, which are features of [[English grammar]], the elided VP must be a [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VP; it cannot be a [[finite verb|finite]] VP. Further, the ellipsis must be introduced by an [[auxiliary verb]] (''be'', ''can'', ''do'', ''don't'', ''could'', ''have'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''won't'', ''would'', etc.) or by the infinitive particle ''to''.<ref>See Kroeger (2004:35) concerning the necessity that an auxiliary verb be \"left behind\" in order to license VP ellipsis.</ref> In the examples below, the elided material of VP ellipsis is indicated using subscripts and a smaller font and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded:\n\n::You might '''do it''', but I won't <sub>do it</sub>.\n\n::She won't '''laugh''', but he will <sub>laugh</sub>.\n\n::Susan has '''been cheating''', and Fred has <sub>been cheating</sub> too.\n\n::Larry is not '''telling the truth''', neither is Jim <sub>telling the truth</sub>.\n\n::They will '''do it''' if they want to <sub>do it</sub>.\n\nAttempts at VP ellipsis that lack an auxiliary verb fail, unless the infinitive particle ''to'' is retained:\n\n::a. *Sam wants '''to eat''', and Fred wants <sub>to eat</sub> as well. (* indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical)\n::b. Sam wants to '''eat''', and Fred wants to <sub>eat</sub> as well.\n\n::a. *Josh likes '''to sleep late''', and Hillary likes <sub>to sleep late</sub> as well.\n::b. Josh likes to '''sleep late''', and Hillary likes to <sub>sleep late</sub> as well.\n\nApparent exceptions to this restriction on VP ellipsis may be instances of [[null complement anaphora]], e.g. ''?Bill tried to leave, and Jim tried <sub>to leave</sub> too''.\n\nA particularly frequent construction in which VP ellipsis (obligatorily) occurs is the [[tag question]]:\n\n::Jeremy '''likes beer''', doesn't he <sub>like beer</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n::Susan will '''write the paper''', won't she <sub>write the paper</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n\n==The direction of ellipsis==\nVP ellipsis can be said to operate either ''forwards'' or'' backwards'': it operates forwards when the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to the ellipsis precedes the ellipsis (as in the above examples) and backwards when the antecedent follows the ellipsis. It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable. However, as the fourth example shows, VP ellipsis is impossible when it operates both backwards and upwards.\n\n<br />\n\n== VP ellipsis as a diagnostic for constituency in English ==\n\n=== \"Do so\" ellipsis ===\n\"Do so\" ellipsis is a type of VPE in which the phrase \"do so\" fills in the VP ellipsis site after the VP is elided<ref name=\":0\" />. In the example below, \"do so\" is in parentheses, as this substitution is optional as the meaning of the elided phrase can be established based on its antecedent<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n::Larry will not '''drive to the store''', but Sarah will '''drive to the store'''.\n\n::Larry will not '''drive to the store''', but Sarah will <sub>drive to the store</sub> (do so).\n<br />\n==Antecedent-contained ellipsis==\n{{main article|Antecedent-contained deletion}}\nAn aspect of VP ellipsis that has been the subject of much theoretical analysis occurs when the ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP. An alternative explanation, pursued in [[dependency grammar]]s, is to assume that the basic unit of syntax is not the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], but rather the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]].<ref>Concerning the status of the catena as the basic unit of syntactic analysis and as a basis for the analysis of ellipsis and antecedent containment, see Osborne (2019: 353-355, 373-375).</ref> On this analysis, the antecedent to the ellipsis does not need to be a complete constituent (an entire verb phrase), but can be merely a catena (the verbs ''say'' and ''thinking'' in the above examples), which need not contain the ellipsis.\n\n==Argument contained ellipsis==\nAs noted above, VP ellipsis is generally impossible if it would operate both backwards and upwards. There are also certain other restrictions on the possibility of ellipsis, although a complete theoretical analysis may be lacking. Two examples of environments in which ellipsis fails are now given:<ref>The two examples illustrating argument contained ellipsis were originally from Wasow 1972.</ref>\n\n:: *A proof that God '''exists''' does <sub>exist</sub>. <small>- Failed upward ellipsis</small>\n:: *A proof that God does <sub>exist</sub> '''exists'''. <small>- Failed argument-contained ellipsis</small>\n\nThe inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these cases has been explored in terms of so-called ''argument contained ellipsis''.<ref>Argument contained ellipsis is explored in detail by Kennedy (1994).</ref> The ellipsis appears inside an argument of the predicate represented by the antecedent to the ellipsis. A satisfactory account of the inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these sentences is lacking.\n\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Antecedent-contained deletion]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n*Bos, J. and J.

An example is given below:\n\n::Jane will watch a movie.\n\n::Jane will watch a movie and Liz will <sub>watch a movie</sub> too.\n\nThe requirements of VPE have been studied, but the general agreement is that\u00a0specific selectional properties and conditions of certain elements must be satisfied for VPE to work. \n\n==Features of verb phrase ellipsis in English==\nIn the VP ellipsis considered here, which are features of [[English grammar]], the elided VP must be a [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] VP; it cannot be a [[finite verb|finite]] VP. Further, the ellipsis must be introduced by an [[auxiliary verb]] (''be'', ''can'', ''do'', ''don't'', ''could'', ''have'', ''may'', ''might'', ''shall'', ''should'', ''will'', ''won't'', ''would'', etc.) or by the infinitive particle ''to''.<ref>See Kroeger (2004:35) concerning the necessity that an auxiliary verb be \"left behind\" in order to license VP ellipsis.</ref> In the examples below, the elided material of VP ellipsis is indicated using subscripts and a smaller font and the antecedent to the ellipsis is bolded:\n\n::You might '''do it''', but I won't <sub>do it</sub>.\n\n::She won't '''laugh''', but he will <sub>laugh</sub>.\n\n::Susan has '''been cheating''', and Fred has <sub>been cheating</sub> too.\n\n::Larry is not '''telling the truth''', neither is Jim <sub>telling the truth</sub>.\n\n::They will '''do it''' if they want to <sub>do it</sub>.\n\nAttempts at VP ellipsis that lack an auxiliary verb fail, unless the infinitive particle ''to'' is retained:\n\n::a. *Sam wants '''to eat''', and Fred wants <sub>to eat</sub> as well. (* indicates that the sentence is ungrammatical)\n::b. Sam wants to '''eat''', and Fred wants to <sub>eat</sub> as well.\n\n::a. *Josh likes '''to sleep late''', and Hillary likes <sub>to sleep late</sub> as well.\n::b. Josh likes to '''sleep late''', and Hillary likes to <sub>sleep late</sub> as well.\n\nApparent exceptions to this restriction on VP ellipsis may be instances of [[null complement anaphora]], e.g. ''?Bill tried to leave, and Jim tried <sub>to leave</sub> too''.\n\nA particularly frequent construction in which VP ellipsis (obligatorily) occurs is the [[tag question]]:\n\n::Jeremy '''likes beer''', doesn't he <sub>like beer</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n::Susan will '''write the paper''', won't she <sub>write the paper</sub>? <small>- Tag question involves VP ellipsis</small>\n\n==The direction of ellipsis==\nVP ellipsis can be said to operate either ''forwards'' or'' backwards'': it operates forwards when the [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] to the ellipsis precedes the ellipsis (as in the above examples) and backwards when the antecedent follows the ellipsis. It can also be said to operate either ''upwards'' or ''downwards'' (or neither). It operates upwards when the antecedent appears in a clause that is [[subordinate clause|subordinate]] to the clause containing the ellipsis, and downwards when the ellipsis appears in a clause subordinate to the clause containing the antecedent. In the above examples, the two clauses are [[coordination (grammar)|coordinated]], so neither is subordinate to the other, and hence the operation of the ellipsis is neither upward nor downward.\n\nCombinations of these directions of operation of ellipsis are illustrated with the following examples:\n\n:: The people who say they will '''help''' never do <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and upwards</small>\n:: The people who say they will <sub>help</sub> never do '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and downwards</small>\n\n:: The people never do '''help''', who say they will <sub>help</sub>. <small>- Forwards and downwards</small>\n:: *The people never do <sub>help</sub>, who say they will '''help'''. <small>- Backwards and upwards</small>\n\nThree of the four combinations are acceptable. However, as the fourth example shows, VP ellipsis is impossible when it operates both backwards and upwards.\n\n<br />\n\n== VP ellipsis as a diagnostic for constituency in English ==\n\n=== \"Do so\" ellipsis ===\n\"Do so\" ellipsis is a type of VPE in which the phrase \"do so\" fills in the VP ellipsis site after the VP is elided<ref name=\":0\" />. In the example below, \"do so\" is in parentheses, as this substitution is optional as the meaning of the elided phrase can be established based on its antecedent<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n::Larry will not drive to the store, but Sarah will drive to the store.\n\n::Larry will not drive to the store, but Sarah will <sub>drive to the store</sub> (do so).\n<br />\n==Antecedent-contained ellipsis==\n{{main article|Antecedent-contained deletion}}\nAn aspect of VP ellipsis that has been the subject of much theoretical analysis occurs when the ellipsis appears to be contained inside its antecedent. The phenomenon is called '''antecedent-contained ellipsis''' or '''antecedent-contained deletion'''. Canonical cases of antecedent-contained ellipsis occur when the ellipsis appears inside a quantified object NP, e.g.\n\n::They '''said everything that we did <sub>say</sub>'''.\n::He is '''thinking the same thing I am <sub>thinking</sub>'''.\n\nIf it is assumed that the antecedent to the ellipsis is to be a complete verb phrase, then the only possible antecedent appears to be the VP in bold. This VP, however, contains the ellipsis itself. This analysis would imply an [[infinite regress]], which is an impossibility, since it would mean that the ellipsis could never acquire full semantic content.\n\nOne means of addressing antecedent-contained ellipsis that is pursued in some [[phrase structure grammar]]s is to assume quantifier [[raising (linguistics)|raising]] (QR).<ref>For accounts of antecedent contained deletion in terms of quantifier raising, see for instance Kennedy (1997) and Wilder (2003).</ref> Quantifier raising raises the quantified NP to a position where it is no longer contained inside its antecedent VP. An alternative explanation, pursued in [[dependency grammar]]s, is to assume that the basic unit of syntax is not the [[constituent (linguistics)|constituent]], but rather the [[catena (linguistics)|catena]].<ref>Concerning the status of the catena as the basic unit of syntactic analysis and as a basis for the analysis of ellipsis and antecedent containment, see Osborne (2019: 353-355, 373-375).</ref> On this analysis, the antecedent to the ellipsis does not need to be a complete constituent (an entire verb phrase), but can be merely a catena (the verbs ''say'' and ''thinking'' in the above examples), which need not contain the ellipsis.\n\n==Argument contained ellipsis==\nAs noted above, VP ellipsis is generally impossible if it would operate both backwards and upwards. There are also certain other restrictions on the possibility of ellipsis, although a complete theoretical analysis may be lacking. Two examples of environments in which ellipsis fails are now given:<ref>The two examples illustrating argument contained ellipsis were originally from Wasow 1972.</ref>\n\n:: *A proof that God '''exists''' does <sub>exist</sub>. <small>- Failed upward ellipsis</small>\n:: *A proof that God does <sub>exist</sub> '''exists'''. <small>- Failed argument-contained ellipsis</small>\n\nThe inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these cases has been explored in terms of so-called ''argument contained ellipsis''.<ref>Argument contained ellipsis is explored in detail by Kennedy (1994).</ref> The ellipsis appears inside an argument of the predicate represented by the antecedent to the ellipsis. A satisfactory account of the inability of VP ellipsis to occur in these sentences is lacking.\n\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Catena (linguistics)|Catena]]\n*[[Constituent (linguistics)|Constituent]]\n*[[Antecedent-contained deletion]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col}}\n*Bos, J. and J.

Co., 1986).</ref> Alternative methods are sometimes simpler than completing the square, and may offer interesting insight into other areas of mathematics.\n\n===By using the 'completing the square' technique===\n====Standard method====\nDivide the quadratic equation by <math>a</math>, which is allowed because <math>a</math> is non-zero:\n\n:<math>x^2 + \\frac{b}{a} x + \\frac{c}{a}=0\\ \\ .</math>\n\nSubtract {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} from both sides of the equation, yielding:\n:<math>x^2 + \\frac{b}{a} x= -\\frac{c}{a}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nThe quadratic equation is now in a form to which the method of [[completing the square]] is applicable. In fact, by adding a constant to both sides of the equation such that the left hand side becomes a complete square, the equation becomes:\n\n:<math>x^2+\\frac{b}{a}x+\\left( \\frac{b}{2a} \\right)^2 =-\\frac{c}{a}+\\left( \\frac{b}{2a} \\right)^2\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nwhich produces:\n\n:<math>\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2=-\\frac{c}{a}+\\frac{b^2}{4a^2}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nAccordingly, after rearranging the terms on the right hand side to have a common denominator, we obtain:\n\n:<math>\\left(x+\\frac{b}{2a}\\right)^2=\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nThe square has thus been completed. Taking the [[square root]] of both sides yields the following equation:\n\n:<math>x+\\frac{b}{2a}=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nIn which case, isolating the <math>x</math> would give the quadratic formula:\n\n:<math>x=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nThere are many alternatives of this derivation with minor differences, mostly concerning the manipulation of <math>a</math>.\n\n====Method 2====\nThe majority of algebra texts published over the last several decades teach [[completing the square]] using the sequence presented earlier:\n\n# Divide each side by <math>a</math> to make the polynomial [[Monic polynomial|monic]].\n# Rearrange.\n# Add <math>\\textstyle \\left( \\frac{b}{2a} \\right)^2</math> to both sides to complete the square.\n# Rearrange the terms in the right side to have a common denominator.\n# Take the square root of both sides.\n# Isolate ''<math>x</math>''.\n\nAs pointed out by Larry Hoehn in 1975, completing the square can be accomplished by a shorter and simpler sequence:<ref name=\"Hoehn1975\">{{cite journal |last=Hoehn |first=Larry |title=A More Elegant Method of Deriving the Quadratic Formula |journal=The Mathematics Teacher |year=1975 |volume=68 |issue=5 |page=442&ndash;443}}</ref>\n\n# Multiply each side by ''<math>4a</math>'',\n# Rearrange.\n# Add ''<math>b^2</math>'' to both sides to complete the square.\n# Take the square root of both sides.\n# Isolate ''<math>x</math>''.\n\nIn which case, the quadratic formula can also be derived as follows:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nax^2+bx+c &= 0 \\\\\n4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + 4ac &= 0 \\\\\n4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx &= -4ac \\\\\n4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + b^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\\\\n(2ax + b)^2 &= b^2 - 4ac \\\\\n2ax + b &= \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\\\\n2ax &= -b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\\\ \nx &= \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac }}{2a}\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis actually represents an ancient derivation of the quadratic formula and was known to the Hindus at least as far back as 1025.<ref name=Smith1958>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David E.|title=History of Mathematics, Vol. II|year=1958|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0486204308|page=446}}</ref> Compared with the derivation in standard usage, this alternate derivation is simpler and shorter, as it avoids fractions and squared fractions until the last step and hence it does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side.<ref name=Hoehn1975/>\n\n====Method 3====\n\nSimilar to Method 1, divide each side by ''<math>a</math>'' to make left-hand-side polynomial [[Monic polynomial|monic]] (i.e., the coefficient of ''<math>x^2</math>'' becomes ''1'').\n\n:<math>x^2 + \\frac{b}{a} x + \\frac{c}{a}=0\\ \\ .</math>\n\nWrite the equation in a more compact and easier-to-handle format:\n\n:<math>x^2 + Bx + C = 0</math>\n\nwhere ''<math>\\textstyle B = \\frac{b}{a}</math>'' and ''<math>\\textstyle C = \\frac{c}{a}</math>''.\n\nComplete the square by adding ''<math>\\textstyle \\frac{B^2}{4}</math>'' to the first two terms and subtracting it from the third term:\n\n:<math>\\left(x+\\frac{B}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left( C - \\frac{B^2}{4}\\right) = 0</math>\n\nRearrange the left side into a [[difference of two squares]]:\n\n:<math>\\left(x+\\frac{B}{2}\\right)^2 - \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\right)^2 = 0</math>\n\nand factor it:\n\n:<math>\\left(x+\\frac{B}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\right) \\left(x+\\frac{B}{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}\\right) = 0</math>\n\nwhich implies that either\n\n:<math>x+\\frac{B}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>x+\\frac{B}{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C} = 0</math>\n\nEach of these two equations is linear and can be solved for ''<math>x</math>'', obtaining:<blockquote><math>x = -\\frac{B}{2} - \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}</math>   or  <math>x = -\\frac{B}{2} + \\sqrt{\\frac{B^2}{4} - C}</math></blockquote>By re-expressing ''<math>B</math>'' and ''<math>C</math>'' back into ''<math>\\textstyle\\frac{b}{a}</math>'' and ''<math>\\textstyle\\frac{c}{a}</math>'', respectively, the quadratic formula can then be obtained.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===By substitution===\nAnother technique is solution by [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]].<ref>Joseph J.

That is, ''<math>2am + b = 0</math>'' or ''<math>\\textstyle m = \\frac{-b}{2a}</math>''. Subtracting the constant term from both sides of the equation (to move it to the right hand side) and then dividing by ''<math>a</math>'' gives:\n\n:<math>y^2=\\frac{-\\left(am^2+bm+c\\right)}{a}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nSubstituting for ''<math>m</math>'' gives:\n\n:<math>y^2=\\frac{-\\left(\\frac{b^2}{4a}+\\frac{-b^2}{2a}+c\\right)}{a}=\\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}\\ \\ .</math>\n\nTherefore,\n\n:<math>y=\\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}</math>\n\nBy re-expressing ''<math>y</math>'' in terms of ''<math>x</math>'' using the formula ''<math>\\textstyle x = y + m = y - \\frac{b}{2a}</math>'' , the usual quadratic formula can then be obtained:\n\n:<math>x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\ \\ .</math>\n\n===By using algebraic identities===\nThe following method was used by many historical mathematicians:<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1080/00207390802642237|title = The legacy of Leonhard Euler \u2013 a tricentennial tribute|year = 2009|last1 = Debnath|first1 = Lokenath|journal = International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume = 40|issue = 3|pages = 353\u2013388}}</ref>\n\nLet the roots of the standard quadratic equation be {{math|''r''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''r''<sub>2</sub>}}.

Given a monic quadratic polynomial\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nassume that it factors as\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q=(x-\\alpha)(x-\\beta)\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nExpanding yields\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q=x^2-(\\alpha+\\beta)x+\\alpha \\beta\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u2212(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}} and {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''\u03b1\u03b2''}}.\n\nSince the order of multiplication does not matter, one can switch {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} and the values of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} will not change: one can say that {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are [[symmetric polynomials]] in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}. In fact, they are the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] \u2013 any symmetric polynomial in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} can be expressed in terms of {{math|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|''\u03b1\u03b2''}} The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is: given the coefficients of a polynomial, which are symmetric functions in the roots, can one \"break the symmetry\" and recover the roots? Thus solving a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is related to the ways of rearranging (\"permuting\") {{math|''n''}} terms, which is called the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''n''}} letters, and denoted {{math|''S{{sub|n}}''}}. For the quadratic polynomial, the only way to rearrange two terms is to swap them (\"[[Transposition (mathematics)|transpose]]\" them), and thus solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.\n\nTo find the roots {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}, consider their sum and difference:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nr_1 &= \\alpha + \\beta\\\\\nr_2 &= \\alpha - \\beta\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese are called the ''Lagrange resolvents'' of the polynomial; notice that one of these depends on the order of the roots, which is the key point. One can recover the roots from the resolvents by inverting the above equations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(r_1+r_2\\right)\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(r_1-r_2\\right)\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThus, solving for the resolvents gives the original roots.\n\nNow {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}} is a symmetric function in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}, so it can be expressed in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, and in fact {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} \u2212''p''}} as noted above. But {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''\u03b2''}} is not symmetric, since switching {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} yields {{math|\u2212''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''\u03b2'' \u2212 ''\u03b1''}} (formally, this is termed a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of the symmetric group of the roots). Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} is not symmetric, it cannot be expressed in terms of the coefficients {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, as these are symmetric in the roots and thus so is any polynomial expression involving them. Changing the order of the roots only changes {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} by a factor of \u22121, and thus the square {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''\u03b2''){{sup|2}}}} is symmetric in the roots, and thus expressible in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Using the equation\n\n:<math>(\\alpha - \\beta)^2 = (\\alpha + \\beta)^2 - 4\\alpha\\beta\\ \\ </math>\n\nyields\n\n:<math>r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q\\ \\ </math>\n\nand thus\n\n:<math>r_2 = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\ \\ </math>\n\nIf one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nr_1 &= -p\\\\\nr_2 &= \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\n\\end{align}</math>\nand thus\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p+\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p-\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\nThus the roots are\n:<math>\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)</math>\nwhich is the quadratic formula. Substituting {{math|''p'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}, ''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as {{math|{{sfrac|''r''{{sub|1}}|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|\u2212''p''|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|\u2212''b''|2''a''}}}} being the vertex, and {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} ''p''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''q''}} is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial).\n\nA similar but more complicated method works for [[cubic equation]]s, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the \"resolving polynomial\") relating {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}}, which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a [[quartic equation]] (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved.<ref name=Clark/> The same method for a [[quintic equation]] yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.\n\n==Historical development==\nThe earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric.

The geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula is that it defines the points on the {{math|''x''}}-axis where the parabola will cross the axis. Additionally, if the quadratic formula was looked at as two terms,\n\n:<math>x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}=-\\frac{b}{2a} \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}</math>\n\nthe [[axis of symmetry]] appears as the line {{math|1=''x'' = \u2212{{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}}}}. The other term, {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac''}}|2''a''}}}}, gives the distance the zeros are away from the axis of symmetry, where the plus sign represents the distance to the right, and the minus sign represents the distance to the left.\n\nIf this distance term were to decrease to zero, the value of the axis of symmetry would be the {{math|''x''}} value of the only zero, that is, there is only one possible solution to the quadratic equation. Algebraically, this means that {{math|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac''}} {{=}} 0}}, or simply {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac'' {{=}} 0}} (where the left-hand side is referred to as the ''discriminant''). This is one of three cases, where the discriminant indicates how many zeros the parabola will have. If the discriminant is positive, the distance would be non-zero, and there will be two solutions. However, there is also the case where the discriminant is less than zero, and this indicates the distance will be ''imaginary''{{snd}} or some multiple of the complex unit {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|\u22121}}}}{{snd}} and the parabola's zeros will be [[complex number]]s. The complex roots will be [[complex conjugate]]s, where the real part of the complex roots will be the value of the axis of symmetry. There will be no real values of {{math|''x''}} where the parabola crosses the {{math|''x''}}-axis.\n\n===Dimensional analysis===\nIf the constants {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and/or {{math|''c''}} are not [[unitless]], then the units of {{math|''x''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, due to the requirement that {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|''bx''}} agree on their units. Furthermore, by the same logic, the units of {{math|''c''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''{{sup|2}}|''a''}}}}, which can be verified without solving for {{math|''x''}}. This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of [[physical quantities]] has been set up correctly, prior to solving this.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Discriminant]]\n* [[Fundamental theorem of algebra]]\n* [[Cubic equation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Polynomials}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]\n[[Category:Equations]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|solution of the quadratic equation}}\n[[File:Quadratic roots.svg|alt=Roots of a quadratic function|thumb|231x231px|A quadratic function with roots ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and ''x''&nbsp;=&nbsp;4.]]\nIn [[elementary algebra]], the '''quadratic formula''' is a formula that provides the solution(s) to a [[quadratic equation]].

Given a monic quadratic polynomial\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nassume that it factors as\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q=(x-\\alpha)(x-\\beta)\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nExpanding yields\n\n:<math>x^2+px+q=x^2-(\\alpha+\\beta)x+\\alpha \\beta\\ \\ ,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u2212(''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2'')}} and {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''\u03b1\u03b2''}}.\n\nSince the order of multiplication does not matter, one can switch {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} and the values of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} will not change: one can say that {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are [[symmetric polynomials]] in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}. In fact, they are the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] \u2013 any symmetric polynomial in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} can be expressed in terms of {{math|''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}} and {{math|''\u03b1\u03b2''}} The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is: given the coefficients of a polynomial, which are symmetric functions in the roots, can one \"break the symmetry\" and recover the roots? Thus solving a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is related to the ways of rearranging (\"permuting\") {{math|''n''}} terms, which is called the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''n''}} letters, and denoted {{math|''S{{sub|n}}''}}. For the quadratic polynomial, the only way to rearrange two terms is to swap them (\"[[Transposition (mathematics)|transpose]]\" them), and thus solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.\n\nTo find the roots {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}, consider their sum and difference:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nr_1 &= \\alpha + \\beta\\\\\nr_2 &= \\alpha - \\beta\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThese are called the ''Lagrange resolvents'' of the polynomial; notice that one of these depends on the order of the roots, which is the key point. One can recover the roots from the resolvents by inverting the above equations:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(r_1+r_2\\right)\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(r_1-r_2\\right)\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThus, solving for the resolvents gives the original roots.\n\nNow {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' + ''\u03b2''}} is a symmetric function in {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}}, so it can be expressed in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, and in fact {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} \u2212''p''}} as noted above. But {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''\u03b2''}} is not symmetric, since switching {{math|''\u03b1''}} and {{math|''\u03b2''}} yields {{math|\u2212''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''\u03b2'' \u2212 ''\u03b1''}} (formally, this is termed a [[Group action (mathematics)|group action]] of the symmetric group of the roots). Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} is not symmetric, it cannot be expressed in terms of the coefficients {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, as these are symmetric in the roots and thus so is any polynomial expression involving them. Changing the order of the roots only changes {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} by a factor of \u22121, and thus the square {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''\u03b1'' \u2212 ''\u03b2''){{sup|2}}}} is symmetric in the roots, and thus expressible in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Using the equation\n\n:<math>(\\alpha - \\beta)^2 = (\\alpha + \\beta)^2 - 4\\alpha\\beta\\ \\ </math>\n\nyields\n\n:<math>r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q\\ \\ </math>\n\nand thus\n\n:<math>r_2 = \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\ \\ </math>\n\nIf one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nr_1 &= -p\\\\\nr_2 &= \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\n\\end{align}</math>\nand thus\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p+\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)\\\\\n\\beta  &= \\tfrac12\\left(-p-\\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)\\ \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\nThus the roots are\n:<math>\\textstyle{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(-p \\pm \\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\\right)</math>\nwhich is the quadratic formula. Substituting {{math|''p'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}, ''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as {{math|{{sfrac|''r''{{sub|1}}|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|\u2212''p''|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|\u2212''b''|2''a''}}}} being the vertex, and {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} ''p''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''q''}} is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial).\n\nA similar but more complicated method works for [[cubic equation]]s, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the \"resolving polynomial\") relating {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}}, which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a [[quartic equation]] (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved.<ref name=Clark/> The same method for a [[quintic equation]] yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.\n\n==Historical development==\nThe earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric.

The geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula is that it defines the points on the {{math|''x''}}-axis where the parabola will cross the axis. Additionally, if the quadratic formula was looked at as two terms,\n\n:<math>x = \\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}=-\\frac{b}{2a} \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{b^2-4ac\\ }}{2a}</math>\n\nthe [[axis of symmetry]] appears as the line {{math|1=''x'' = \u2212{{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}}}}. The other term, {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac''}}|2''a''}}}}, gives the distance the zeros are away from the axis of symmetry, where the plus sign represents the distance to the right, and the minus sign represents the distance to the left.\n\nIf this distance term were to decrease to zero, the value of the axis of symmetry would be the {{math|''x''}} value of the only zero, that is, there is only one possible solution to the quadratic equation. Algebraically, this means that {{math|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac''}} {{=}} 0}}, or simply {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} \u2212 4''ac'' {{=}} 0}} (where the left-hand side is referred to as the ''discriminant''). This is one of three cases, where the discriminant indicates how many zeros the parabola will have. If the discriminant is positive, the distance would be non-zero, and there will be two solutions. However, there is also the case where the discriminant is less than zero, and this indicates the distance will be ''imaginary''{{snd}} or some multiple of the complex unit {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|\u22121}}}}{{snd}} and the parabola's zeros will be [[complex number]]s. The complex roots will be [[complex conjugate]]s, where the real part of the complex roots will be the value of the axis of symmetry. There will be no real values of {{math|''x''}} where the parabola crosses the {{math|''x''}}-axis.\n\n===Dimensional analysis===\nIf the constants {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and/or {{math|''c''}} are not [[unitless]], then the units of {{math|''x''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, due to the requirement that {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|''bx''}} agree on their units. Furthermore, by the same logic, the units of {{math|''c''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''{{sup|2}}|''a''}}}}, which can be verified without solving for {{math|''x''}}. This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of [[physical quantities]] has been set up correctly, prior to solving this.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Discriminant]]\n* [[Fundamental theorem of algebra]]\n* [[Cubic equation]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Polynomials}}\n\n[[Category:Elementary algebra]]\n[[Category:Equations]]\n", "name_user": "173.72.3.84", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula"}

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact.

NASA said it will begin negotiations with Axiom on a firm-fixed-price contract to build and deliver the module, which will attach to the forward port on space station's Harmony module, or Node 2. Although NASA has only commissioned one module, Axiom plans to build an entire segment which would consists of five modules. These modules would include a node module, an orbital research and manufacturing facility, a crew habitat, and a \"large-windowed Earth observatory\".

To keep the internal temperature within workable limits, a passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes. If the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid [[ammonia]] loop. From the heat exchangers, ammonia is pumped into external radiators that emit heat as infrared radiation, then back to the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses.

When attitude control computers in the ROS and USOS fail to communicate properly, it can result in a rare 'force fight' where the ROS GNC computer must ignore the USOS counterpart, which has no thrusters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |title=Microsoft Word \u2013 hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight_pg1.doc |accessdate=1 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720193844/http://pims.grc.nasa.gov/pimsdocs/public/ISS%20Handbook/hb_qs_vehicle_RussianUSGNCForceFight.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/spacenews/reports/issreports/2005/iss05-7.html |title=International Space Station Status Report #05-7 |date=11 February 2005 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=23 November 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Dynamics and Control of Attitude, Power, and Momentum for a Spacecraft Using Flywheels and Control Moment Gyroscopes |author=Carlos Roithmayr |year=2003 |publisher=NASA |location=Langley Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030038806_2003038772.pdf |accessdate=12 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nDocked spacecraft can also be used to maintain station attitude, such as for troubleshooting or during the [[STS-117|installation]] of the S3/S4 truss, which provides electrical power and data interfaces for the station's electronics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2007/06/atlantis-ready-to-support-iss-troubleshooting/ |title=Atlantis ready to support ISS troubleshooting |publisher=NASASPaceflight.com |author=Chris Bergin |accessdate=6 March 2009 |date=14 June 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Mission controls==\nThe components of the ISS are operated and monitored by their respective space agencies at [[Mission Control Center|mission control centres]] across the globe, including:\n* Roscosmos's [[Mission Control Center#RKA Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]] at [[Korolyov (city)|Korolyov]], Moscow Oblast, controls the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] which handles Guidance, Navigation and Control for the entire Station,<ref name=\"Navigation\" /><ref name=\"EsaComputer\" /> in addition to individual Soyuz and Progress missions.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* ESA's [[ATV Control Centre]], at the [[Toulouse Space Centre]] (CST) in [[Toulouse]], France, controls flights of the uncrewed European [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]].<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* JAXA's JEM Control Center and HTV Control Center at [[Tsukuba Space Center]] (TKSC) are responsible for operating the ''Kib\u014d'' complex and all flights of the White Stork HTV Cargo spacecraft, respectively.<ref name=\"ISSRG\" />\n* NASA's [[Christopher C.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Most are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets provide electricity for many parts that could be damaged by the cold of space and require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have local area network (LAN) connections for telemetry to connect experiments. A heavy emphasis on stocking the USOS with ORU's occurred around 2011, before the end of the NASA shuttle programme, as its commercial replacements, [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus]] and [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]], carry one tenth to one quarter the payload.\n\nUnexpected problems and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced abandonment of the station for safety reasons. Serious problems include an air leak from the USOS in 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3882962 |title=Crew finds 'culprit' in space station leak |publisher=NBC News |date=11 January 2004 |first=James |last=Oberg |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> the venting of fumes from an ''[[Elektron (ISS)|Elektron]]'' oxygen generator in 2006,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/station/exp13/060918elektron.html |title=Oxygen Generator Problem Triggers Station Alarm |work=CBS News via Spaceflight Now |date=18 September 2006 |first=William |last=Harwood |accessdate=24 November 2008}}</ref> and the failure of the computers in the ROS in 2007 during [[STS-117]] that left the station without thruster, ''Elektron'', ''[[Vozdukh]]'' and other environmental control system operations.

The same valve was then used to vent the ammonia from the damaged panel, eliminating the possibility of an ammonia leak.<ref name=\"Radiator\" /> It is also known that a Service Module thruster cover struck the S1 radiator after being jettisoned during an EVA in 2008, but its effect, if any, has not been determined.\n\nEarly on 1 August 2010, a failure in cooling Loop A (starboard side), one of two external cooling loops, left the station with only half of its normal cooling capacity and zero redundancy in some systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n1007/31station/ |title=Problem forces partial powerdown aboard station |publisher=Spaceflightnow.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=34622 |title=NASA ISS On-Orbit Status 1 August 2010 (early edition) |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=31 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/spacestation/systems/atcs.html |title=ISS Active Control System |publisher=Boeing |date=21 November 2006 |accessdate=16 November 2010}}</ref> The problem appeared to be in the ammonia pump module that circulates the ammonia cooling fluid.

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth, resulting in a higher risk of cancer. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew, as Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early US missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M. Tani|Daniel Tani]] died in a car accident, and when Michael Fincke was forced to miss the birth of his second child.\n\nA study of the longest spaceflight concluded that the first three weeks are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Manzey |first1=D. |last2=Lorenz |first2=B. |last3=Poljakov |first3=V. |doi=10.1080/001401398186991 |title=Mental performance in extreme environments: Results from a performance monitoring study during a 438-day spaceflight |journal=Ergonomics |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=537\u2013559 |year=1998 |pmid=9557591 |pmc=}}</ref> ISS crew flights typically last about five to six months.\n\nThe ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different language.

Specifically, these goals have been the primary focus of the ISS Multilateral Medical Operations Panel (MMOP) Acoustics Subgroup since the first days of ISS assembly and operations.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  [https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039608.pdf] The effort includes contributions from [[Acoustical engineering|acoustical engineers]], [[Audiology|audiologists]], [[Industrial Hygienists|industrial hygienists]], and physicians who comprise the subgroup's membership from NASA, the [[Roscosmos|Russian Space Agency]] (RSA), the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), the [[JAXA|Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), and the [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA).\n\nWhen compared to terrestrial environments, the noise levels incurred by astronauts and cosmonauts on the ISS may seem insignificant and typically occur at levels that would not be of major concern to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|the Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] \u2013 rarely reaching 85 dBA.  But crew members are exposed to these levels 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with current missions averaging 6 months in duration.  These levels of noise also impose risks to crew health and performance in the form of sleep interference and communication, as well as reduced alarm [[Hearing|audibility]].\n\nOver the 19 plus year history of the ISS, significant efforts have been put forth to limit and reduce noise levels on the ISS.  During design and pre-flight activities, members of the Acoustic Subgroup have written acoustic limits and verification requirements, consulted to design and choose quietest available payloads, and then conducted acoustic verification tests prior to launch.[https://web.archive.org/web/20200220193031/http://emits.sso.esa.int/emits-doc/ESTEC/AO6216-SoW-RD9.pdf]  During spaceflights, the Acoustics Subgroup has assessed each ISS module's in flight sound levels, produced by a large number of vehicle and science experiment noise sources, to assure compliance with strict acoustic standards.   The acoustic environment on ISS changed when additional modules were added during its construction, and as additional spacecraft arrive at the ISS.  The Acoustics Subgroup has responded to this dynamic operations schedule by successfully designing and employing acoustic covers, absorptive materials, [[noise barrier]]s, and vibration isolators to reduce noise levels. Moreover, when pumps, fans, and ventilation systems age and show increased noise levels,  this Acoustics Subgroup has guided ISS managers to replace the older, noisier instruments with quiet fan and pump technologies, significantly reducing [[ambient noise level]]s.\n\nNASA has adopted most-conservative damage risk criteria (based on recommendations from the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] and the [[World Health Organization]]), in order to protect all crew members.  The MMOP Acoustics Subgroup has adjusted its approach to managing noise risks in this unique environment by applying, or modifying, terrestrial approaches for hearing loss prevention to set these conservative limits.  One innovative approach has been NASA's Noise Exposure Estimation Tool (NEET), in which noise exposures are calculated in a task-based approach to determine the need for [[hearing protection device]]s (HPDs).  Guidance for use of HPDs, either mandatory use or recommended, is then documented in the Noise Hazard Inventory, and posted for crew reference during their missions. The Acoustics Subgroup also tracks spacecraft noise exceedances, applies [[engineering controls]], and recommends hearing protective devices to reduce crew noise exposures. Finally, hearing thresholds are monitored on-orbit, during missions .\n\nThere have been no persistent mission-related hearing threshold shifts among US Orbital Segment crewmembers (JAXA, CSA, ESA, NASA) during what is approaching 20 years of ISS mission operations, or nearly 175,000 work hours. In 2020, the MMOP Acoustics Subgroup received the [[Safe-In-Sound Award]] for Innovation for their combined efforts to mitigate any health effects of noise.[https://www.safeinsound.us/winners.html]\n\n===Fire and toxic gases===\nAn onboard fire or a toxic gas leak are other potential hazards.

The US segment modules consist of an inner layer made from 1.5&nbsp;cm thick aluminum, a 10&nbsp;cm thick intermediate layers of Kevlar and Nextel, and an outer layer of stainless steel, which causes objects to shatter into a cloud before hitting the hull, thereby spreading the energy of impact.

The matter of her refused visit to the US was raised in an interview by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' with the then President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, who claimed to champion \"Moderate Islam\" that \"respect the rights of women\", and complained that his country is \"unfairly portrayed as a place where rape and other violence against women are rampant and frequently condoned\".<ref name=\"South Asia Tribune\" /> He said that he had relented over allowing her to leave the country, and remarked that being raped had \"become a money-making concern\", a way to get rich abroad. This statement provoked an uproar, and Musharraf later denied having made it.<ref name=\"South Asia Tribune\" />\n\nThe statement was made in the light of the fact that another rape victim, Dr Shazia Khalid, had left Pakistan, was living in Canada, and had spoken out against official attitudes to rape in Pakistan. Musharraf said of her: \"It is the easiest way of doing it. Every second person now wants to come up and get all the [pause] because there is so much of finances. Dr. Shazia, I don't know.

with death by hanging or up to 25 years in prison. However, only once case of marital rape has been reported in Pakistan despite it being a common problem. A woman in Lahore filed a marital rape complaint against her husband in 2007. The husband expressed deep remorse, confessed to his crime, and sought forgiveness from his wife saying that he was pressurized by the wife's mother to try and consummate their marriage as they had been married for three months. The wife initially turned down husband's pleas saying that being a highly educated man he should have known better, and sought maximum penalty under the law. However, the couple later agreed to a settlement in which the husband was given a punishment of 200 lashes with the whip and ordered to pay a fine of Rs 1 million to his wife. Wife attended the flogging and participated in whipping him before forgiving his crime and accepting him back. The case highlights several problems in Pakistani society. Firstly, the role of cultural pressures and expectations from a woman in marriage, with wife's own mother encouraging the husband to try and consummate the marriage against wife's will. Secondly, justice is only available to educated and resourceful Pakistani women who have access to female police willing to swiftly arrest the perpetrator of the crime. Thirdly, justice was served in this case due to husband's confession, without which even resourceful Pakistani women would have to wait years to get any justice. \n\n===Child sexual abuse===\n[[Child sexual abuse]] is widespread in Pakistani [[Madrasa|Islamic schools]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Kathy |last=Gannon |url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/ap-probe-sex-abuse-pervasive-070436794.html |title=Sexual abuse is pervasive in Islamic schools in Pakistan |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=21 November 2017|accessdate=21 November 2017}}</ref> In a study of child sexual abuse in [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Islamabad]], out of a sample of 300 children 17% claimed to have been abused and in 1997 one child a day was reported as raped, gang raped or kidnapped for sexual gratification.<ref name=\"Rasheed\" /> In September 2014, the British [[Channel 4]] broadcast a [[documentary]] called ''Pakistan's Hidden Shame'', directed by [[Mohammed Ali Naqvi|Mohammed Naqvi]] and produced by [[Jamie Doran]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/programmes/pakistans-hidden-shame/4od |title=Pakistan's Hidden Shame|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |date=1 September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Coilin |last=O'Connor |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/pakistan--hidden-shame-sex-abuse-peshawar/26574900.html |title=New Film Lays Bare 'Pakistan's Hidden Shame' |publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]] |date=9 September 2014 }}</ref> which highlighted the problem of sexual abuse of street children in particular, an estimated 90 percent of whom have been sexually abused.\n\nThe NGO Sahil reported 3,832 cases of child abuse in 2018 which is an 11 per cent increase from 2017 (3,445 cases).

The matter of her refused visit to the US was raised in an interview by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' with the then President of Pakistan, General Pervez Musharraf, who claimed to champion \"Moderate Islam\" that \"respect the rights of women\", and complained that his country is \"unfairly portrayed as a place where rape and other violence against women are rampant and frequently condoned\".<ref name=\"South Asia Tribune\" /> He said that he had relented over allowing her to leave the country, and remarked that being raped had \"become a money-making concern\", a way to get rich abroad. This statement provoked an uproar, and Musharraf later denied having made it.<ref name=\"South Asia Tribune\" />\n\nThe statement was made in the light of the fact that another rape victim, Dr Shazia Khalid, had left Pakistan, was living in Canada, and had spoken out against official attitudes to rape in Pakistan. Musharraf said of her: \"It is the easiest way of doing it. Every second person now wants to come up and get all the [pause] because there is so much of finances. Dr. Shazia, I don't know. But maybe she's a case of money (too), that she wants to make money. She is again talking all against Pakistan, against whatever we've done.
