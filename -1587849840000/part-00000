The communist party set as its aim not only the struggle against exploitation, but also the independence of Cyprus from British rule. The party became illegal in 1931 when the British colonial government imposed restrictions on civil rights following a [[nationalism|nationalist]] riot. In 1941, leading members of the underground communist party and others founded AKEL. In the first municipal elections in 1943 (before that mayors were appointed) AKEL candidates became mayors of [[Limassol]] ([[Ploutis Servas]]) and [[Famagusta]] (Adam Adamantos).\n\nList of general secretaries:\n\n* 1936-1945 [[Ploutis Servas]]\n* 1945-1949 [[Fifis Ioannou]]\n* 1949-1988 [[Ezekias Papaioannou]] (a veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* 1988-2009 [[Dimitris Christofias]] (6th President of the [[Republic of Cyprus]])\n* 2009\u2013present [[Andros Kyprianou]]<ref name=\"faros\">{{cite web|url=http://faros.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/%ce%bf-%ce%bd%ce%ad%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%b3%ce%b3-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%b5%ce%bb-3/ |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u0393 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u039a\u0395\u039b (3) \u00ab Faros's Weblog |publisher=Faros.wordpress.com |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>\n\nUnlike its predecessor, AKEL was not against [[Enosis]]. Instead, AKEL supported a gradual process, starting off with a constitution and self-government, while Cyprus would remain a colony, leading to self-determination and Enosis. After the failure of the consultative assembly in 1949 to grant a constitution acceptable to the Cypriot members, AKEL changed line, supporting immediate Enosis with no intermediate stages.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, AKEL was opposed to the violent tactics followed by the anti-British resistance movement of [[EOKA]]. EOKA accused AKEL of being collaborators with the British, even though AKEL had also been illegal since 1955. Several AKEL members were assassinated by EOKA at the time for being \"traitors\", including AKEL supporter Savas Menikou, who was [[stoned to death]]. AKEL denounced EOKA's leadership as being anti-communist, as its leader [[George Grivas]] had fought against the communist side during the [[Greek Civil War]]. Grivas later founded [[EOKA B]], which supported the 1974 coup d'\u00e9tat following his death.\n\n[[File:\u0394\u03b7\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a5\u03a0\u0395\u039e \u03a3. \u039b\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0394. \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03b1 (\u039d. \u03a5\u03cc\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7, 21.09.11).jpg|thumb|Foreign Minister of Greece [[Stavros Lambrinidis]] and President of Cyprus [[Demetris Christofias]] during his tenure in [[New York City]] in October 2011]]\n\nAbout 1958, the Turkish Cypriot nationalist organization [[Turkish Resistance Organization|TMT]] started forcing [[Turkish Cypriots]] members of AKEL to leave.

The party's candidate was defeated in the [[2018 Cypriot presidential election|2018 presidential election]] against the incumbent president.\n\n==History==\nIt was founded in 1926 with the name Communist Party of Cyprus (CPC). The communist party set as its aim not only the struggle against exploitation, but also the independence of Cyprus from British rule. The party became illegal in 1931 when the British colonial government imposed restrictions on civil rights following a [[nationalism|nationalist]] riot. In 1941, leading members of the underground communist party and others founded AKEL. In the first municipal elections in 1943 (before that mayors were appointed) AKEL candidates became mayors of [[Limassol]] ([[Ploutis Servas]]) and [[Famagusta]] (Adam Adamantos).\n\nList of general secretaries:\n\n* 1936-1945 [[Ploutis Servas]]\n* 1945-1949 [[Fifis Ioannou]]\n* 1949-1988 [[Ezekias Papaioannou]] (a veteran of the [[Spanish Civil War]])\n* 1988-2009 [[Dimitris Christofias]] (6th President of the [[Republic of Cyprus]])\n* 2009\u2013present [[Andros Kyprianou]]<ref name=\"faros\">{{cite web|url=http://faros.wordpress.com/2009/01/21/%ce%bf-%ce%bd%ce%ad%ce%bf%cf%82-%ce%b3%ce%b3-%cf%84%ce%bf%cf%85-%ce%b1%ce%ba%ce%b5%ce%bb-3/ |title=\u039f \u03bd\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2 \u0393\u0393 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0391\u039a\u0395\u039b (3) \u00ab Faros's Weblog |publisher=Faros.wordpress.com |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>\n\nUnlike its predecessor, AKEL was not against [[Enosis]]. Instead, AKEL supported a gradual process, starting off with a constitution and self-government, while Cyprus would remain a colony, leading to self-determination and Enosis. After the failure of the consultative assembly in 1949 to grant a constitution acceptable to the Cypriot members, AKEL changed line, supporting immediate Enosis with no intermediate stages.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, AKEL was opposed to the violent tactics followed by the anti-British resistance movement of [[EOKA]]. EOKA accused AKEL of being collaborators with the British, even though AKEL had also been illegal since 1955. Several AKEL members were assassinated by EOKA at the time for being \"traitors\", including AKEL supporter Savas Menikou, who was [[stoned to death]]. AKEL denounced EOKA's leadership as being anti-communist, as its leader [[George Grivas]] had fought against the communist side during the [[Greek Civil War]]. Grivas later founded [[EOKA B]], which supported the 1974 coup d'\u00e9tat following his death.\n\n[[File:\u0394\u03b7\u03bb\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a5\u03a0\u0395\u039e \u03a3. \u039b\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03af\u03b4\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ad\u03b4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0394\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u0394. \u03a7\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c6\u03b9\u03b1 (\u039d. \u03a5\u03cc\u03c1\u03ba\u03b7, 21.09.11).jpg|thumb|Foreign Minister of Greece [[Stavros Lambrinidis]] and President of Cyprus [[Demetris Christofias]] during his tenure in [[New York City]] in October 2011]]\n\nAbout 1958, the Turkish Cypriot nationalist organization [[Turkish Resistance Organization|TMT]] started forcing [[Turkish Cypriots]] members of AKEL to leave.

Most commonly, a time series is a [[sequence]] taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of [[discrete-time]] data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean [[tides]], counts of [[sunspots]], and the daily closing value of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].\n\nTime series are very frequently plotted via [[line chart]]s. Time series are used in [[statistics]], [[signal processing]], [[pattern recognition]], [[econometrics]], [[mathematical finance]], [[weather forecasting]], [[earthquake prediction]], [[electroencephalography]], [[control engineering]], [[astronomy]], [[communications engineering]], and largely in any domain of applied [[Applied science|science]] and [[engineering]] which involves [[Time|temporal]] measurements.\n\n'''Time series ''analysis''''' comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. '''Time series ''forecasting''''' is the use of a [[model (abstract)|model]] to predict future values based on previously observed values. While [[regression analysis]] is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called \"time series analysis\", which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. [[Interrupted time series]] analysis is the analysis of interventions on a single time series.\n\nTime series data have a natural temporal ordering.  This makes time series analysis distinct from [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional studies]], in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order).  Time series analysis is also distinct from [[spatial data analysis]] where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A [[stochastic]] model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see [[time reversibility]].)\n\nTime series analysis can be applied to [[real number|real-valued]], continuous data, [[:wikt:discrete|discrete]] [[Data type#Numeric types|numeric]] data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the [[English language]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Lin |first=Jessica |last2=Keogh |first2=Eamonn |last3=Lonardi |first3=Stefano |last4=Chiu |first4=Bill |chapter=A symbolic representation of time series, with implications for streaming algorithms |title=Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery |pages=2\u201311 |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=ACM Press |doi=10.1145/882082.882086|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.5597 }}</ref>).\n\n==Methods for analysis==\n\nMethods for time series analysis may be divided into two classes: [[frequency-domain]] methods and [[time-domain]] methods. The former include [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]] and [[wavelet analysis]]; the latter include [[auto-correlation]] and [[cross-correlation]] analysis. In the time domain, correlation and analysis can be made in a filter-like manner using [[scaled correlation]], thereby mitigating the need to operate in the frequency domain.\n\nAdditionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into [[Parametric estimation|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] methods. The [[Parametric estimation|parametric approaches]] assume that the underlying [[stationary process|stationary stochastic process]] has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an [[autoregressive]] or [[moving average model]]). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric approaches]] explicitly estimate the [[covariance]] or the [[spectrum]] of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.\n\nMethods of time series analysis may also be divided into [[Linear regression|linear]] and [[Nonlinear regression|non-linear]], and [[Univariate analysis|univariate]] and [[Multivariate analysis|multivariate]].\n\n==Panel data==\n\nA time series is one type of [[panel data]]. Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a one-dimensional panel (as is a [[cross-sectional data]]set).  A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data.  One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records.  If the answer is the time data field, then this is a time series data set candidate.  If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate.  If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.\n\n==Analysis==\n\nThere are several types of motivation and data analysis available for time series which are appropriate for different purposes and etc.\n\n===Motivation===\n\nIn the context of [[statistics]], [[econometrics]], [[quantitative finance]], [[seismology]], [[meteorology]], and [[geophysics]] the primary goal of time series analysis is [[forecasting]]. In the context of [[signal processing]], [[control engineering]] and [[communication engineering]] it is used for signal detection and [[estimation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  In the context of [[data mining]], [[pattern recognition]] and [[machine learning]] time series analysis can be used for [[cluster analysis|clustering]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liao | first1 = T.

The number of cases was standardized to a rate per 100,000 and the percent change per year in this rate was calculated. The nearly steadily dropping line shows that the TB incidence was decreasing in most years, but the percent change in this rate varied by as much as +/- 10%, with 'surges' in 1975 and around the early 1990s. The use of both vertical axes allows the comparison of two time series in one graphic.\n\nOther techniques include:\n\n* [[Autocorrelation]] analysis to examine [[serial dependence]]\n* [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|Spectral analysis]] to examine cyclic behavior which need not be related to [[seasonality]].

Interpolation is estimation of an unknown quantity between two known quantities (historical data), or drawing conclusions about missing information from the available information (\"reading between the lines\").<ref>Hamming, Richard. Numerical methods for scientists and engineers. Courier Corporation, 2012.</ref> Interpolation is useful where the data surrounding the missing data is available and its trend, seasonality, and longer-term cycles are known. This is often done by using a related series known for all relevant dates.<ref>Friedman, Milton. \"[http://www.nber.org/chapters/c2062.pdf The interpolation of time series by related series].\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 57.300 (1962): 729\u2013757.</ref> Alternatively [[polynomial interpolation]] or [[spline interpolation]] is used where piecewise [[polynomial]] functions are fit into time intervals such that they fit smoothly together. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function (also called [[Polynomial regression|regression]]).The main difference between regression and interpolation is that polynomial regression gives a single polynomial that models the entire data set.  Spline interpolation, however, yield a piecewise continuous function composed of many polynomials to model the data set.\n\n[[Extrapolation]] is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to [[interpolation]], which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater [[uncertainty]] and a higher risk of producing meaningless results.\n\n===Function approximation===\n{{main|Function approximation}}\nIn general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a [[function (mathematics)|function]] among a well-defined class that closely matches (\"approximates\") a target function in a task-specific way.\nOne can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions [[approximation theory]]  is the branch of [[numerical analysis]] that investigates how certain known functions (for example, [[special function]]s) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, [[polynomial]]s or [[rational function]]s) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).\n\nSecond, the target function, call it ''g'', may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (''x'', ''g''(''x'')) is provided.  Depending on the structure of the [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of ''g'', several techniques for approximating ''g'' may be applicable.  For example, if ''g'' is an operation on the [[real number]]s, techniques of [[interpolation]], [[extrapolation]], [[regression analysis]], and [[curve fitting]] can be used.  If the [[codomain]] (range or target set) of ''g'' is a finite set, one is dealing with a [[statistical classification|classification]] problem instead. A related problem of ''online'' time series approximation<ref>Gandhi, Sorabh, Luca Foschini, and Subhash Suri. \"[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5447930/ Space-efficient online approximation of time series data: Streams, amnesia, and out-of-order].\" Data Engineering (ICDE), 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on. IEEE, 2010.</ref> is to summarize the data in one-pass and construct an approximate representation that can support a variety of time series queries with bounds on worst-case error.\n\nTo some extent the different problems ([[regression analysis|regression]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[fitness approximation]]) have received a unified treatment in [[statistical learning theory]], where they are viewed as [[supervised learning]] problems.\n\n===Prediction and forecasting===\nIn [[statistics]], [[prediction]] is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].\n* Fully formed statistical models for [[stochastic simulation]] purposes, so as to generate alternative versions of the time series, representing what might happen over non-specific time-periods in the future\n* Simple or fully formed statistical models to describe the likely outcome of the time series in the immediate future, given knowledge of the most recent outcomes (forecasting).\n* Forecasting on time series is usually done using automated statistical software packages and programming languages, such as [[Apache Spark]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]] and many others.\n* Forecasting on large scale data is done using Spark which has spark-ts as a third party package.\n\n===Classification===\n{{main|Statistical classification}}\nAssigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example identify a word based on series of hand movements in [[sign language]].\n\n===Signal estimation===\n{{see also|Signal processing|Estimation theory}}\nThis approach is based on [[harmonic analysis]] and filtering of signals in the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Fourier transform]], and [[spectral density estimation]], the development of which was significantly accelerated during [[World War II]] by mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]], electrical engineers [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[Dennis Gabor]] and others for filtering signals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in time. See [[Kalman filter]], [[Estimation theory]], and [[Digital signal processing]]\n\n===Segmentation===\n{{main|Time-series segmentation}}\nSplitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual segments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the audio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces corresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In time-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary points in the time-series, and to characterize the dynamical properties associated with each segment. One can approach this problem using [[Change detection|change-point detection]], or by modeling the time-series as a more sophisticated system, such as a Markov jump linear system.\n\n==Models==\n\nModels for time series data can have many forms and represent different [[stochastic processes]]. When modeling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the ''[[autoregressive]]'' (AR) models, the ''integrated'' (I) models, and the ''[[moving average model|moving average]]'' (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on previous data points.<ref name=\"linear time series\">{{cite book |authorlink=Neil Gershenfeld |last=Gershenfeld |first=N. |year=1999 |title=The Nature of Mathematical Modeling |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=205\u2013208 |isbn=978-0521570954 }}</ref> Combinations of these ideas produce [[autoregressive moving average]] (ARMA) and [[autoregressive integrated moving average]] (ARIMA) models. The [[autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average]] (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three. Extensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are available under the heading of multivariate time-series models and sometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial \"V\" for \"vector\", as in VAR for [[vector autoregression]]. An additional set of extensions of these models is available for use where the observed time-series is driven by some \"forcing\" time-series (which may not have a causal effect on the observed series): the distinction from the multivariate case is that the forcing series may be deterministic or under the experimenter's control. For these models, the acronyms are extended with a final \"X\" for \"exogenous\".\n\nNon-linear dependence of the level of a series on previous data points is of interest, partly because of the possibility of producing a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] time series. However, more importantly, empirical investigations can indicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear models, over those from linear models, as for example in [[nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model]]s. Further references on nonlinear time series analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kantz|first1=Holger|last2=Thomas|first2=Schreiber|title=Nonlinear Time Series Analysis|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0521529020}}</ref> and (Abarbanel)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abarbanel|first1=Henry|title=Analysis of Observed Chaotic Data|date=Nov 25, 1997|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387983721}}</ref>\n\nAmong other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to represent the changes of variance over time ([[heteroskedasticity]]). These models represent [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and the collection comprises a wide variety of representation ([[GARCH]], TARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are related to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series. This is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying variability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by a separate time-varying process, as in a [[doubly stochastic model]].\n\nIn recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods (for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural networks) have gained favor. Multiscale (often referred to as multiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to illustrate time dependence at multiple scales. See also [[Markov switching multifractal]] (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution.\n\nA [[Hidden Markov model]] (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest [[dynamic Bayesian network]]. HMM models are widely used in [[speech recognition]], for translating a time series of spoken words into text.\n\n===Notation===\nA number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A common notation specifying a time series ''X'' that is indexed by the [[natural number]]s is written\n:''X'' = {''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...}.\n\nAnother common notation is\n:''Y'' = {''Y<sub>t</sub>'': ''t'' \u2208 ''T''},\nwhere ''T'' is the [[index set]].\n\n===Conditions===\nThere are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is built:\n* [[Stationary process]]\n* [[Ergodic process]]\n\nHowever, ideas of stationarity must be expanded to consider two important ideas: [[strict stationarity]] and [[Stationary process#Weaker forms of stationarity|second-order stationarity]]. Both models and applications can be developed under each of these conditions, although the models in the latter case might be considered as only partly specified.\n\nIn addition, time-series analysis can be applied where the series are [[Cyclostationary process|seasonally stationary]] or non-stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in [[time-frequency analysis]] which makes use of a [[time\u2013frequency representation]] of a time-series or signal.<ref>Boashash, B.

Most commonly, a time series is a [[sequence]] taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of [[discrete-time]] data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean [[tides]], counts of [[sunspots]], and the daily closing value of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]].\n\nTime series are very frequently plotted via [[line chart]]s. Time series are used in [[statistics]], [[signal processing]], [[pattern recognition]], [[econometrics]], [[mathematical finance]], [[weather forecasting]], [[earthquake prediction]], [[electroencephalography]], [[control engineering]], [[astronomy]], [[communications engineering]], and largely in any domain of applied [[Applied science|science]] and [[engineering]] which involves [[Time|temporal]] measurements.\n\n'''Time series ''analysis''''' comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. '''Time series ''forecasting''''' is the use of a [[model (abstract)|model]] to predict future values based on previously observed values. While [[regression analysis]] is often employed in such a way as to test theories that the current values of one or more independent time series affect the current value of another time series, this type of analysis of time series is not called \"time series analysis\", which focuses on comparing values of a single time series or multiple dependent time series at different points in time. [[Interrupted time series]] analysis is the analysis of interventions on a single time series.\n\nTime series data have a natural temporal ordering.  This makes time series analysis distinct from [[cross-sectional study|cross-sectional studies]], in which there is no natural ordering of the observations (e.g. explaining people's wages by reference to their respective education levels, where the individuals' data could be entered in any order).  Time series analysis is also distinct from [[spatial data analysis]] where the observations typically relate to geographical locations (e.g. accounting for house prices by the location as well as the intrinsic characteristics of the houses). A [[stochastic]] model for a time series will generally reflect the fact that observations close together in time will be more closely related than observations further apart. In addition, time series models will often make use of the natural one-way ordering of time so that values for a given period will be expressed as deriving in some way from past values, rather than from future values (see [[time reversibility]].)\n\nTime series analysis can be applied to [[real number|real-valued]], continuous data, [[:wikt:discrete|discrete]] [[Data type#Numeric types|numeric]] data, or discrete symbolic data (i.e. sequences of characters, such as letters and words in the [[English language]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Lin |first=Jessica |last2=Keogh |first2=Eamonn |last3=Lonardi |first3=Stefano |last4=Chiu |first4=Bill |chapter=A symbolic representation of time series, with implications for streaming algorithms |title=Proceedings of the 8th ACM SIGMOD workshop on Research issues in data mining and knowledge discovery |pages=2\u201311 |year=2003 |location=New York |publisher=ACM Press |doi=10.1145/882082.882086|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.5597 }}</ref>).\n\n==Methods for analysis==\n\nMethods for time series analysis may be divided into two classes: [[frequency-domain]] methods and [[time-domain]] methods. The former include [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]] and [[wavelet analysis]]; the latter include [[auto-correlation]] and [[cross-correlation]] analysis. In the time domain, correlation and analysis can be made in a filter-like manner using [[scaled correlation]], thereby mitigating the need to operate in the frequency domain.\n\nAdditionally, time series analysis techniques may be divided into [[Parametric estimation|parametric]] and [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] methods. The [[Parametric estimation|parametric approaches]] assume that the underlying [[stationary process|stationary stochastic process]] has a certain structure which can be described using a small number of parameters (for example, using an [[autoregressive]] or [[moving average model]]). In these approaches, the task is to estimate the parameters of the model that describes the stochastic process. By contrast, [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric approaches]] explicitly estimate the [[covariance]] or the [[spectrum]] of the process without assuming that the process has any particular structure.\n\nMethods of time series analysis may also be divided into [[Linear regression|linear]] and [[Nonlinear regression|non-linear]], and [[Univariate analysis|univariate]] and [[Multivariate analysis|multivariate]].\n\n==Panel data==\n\nA time series is one type of [[panel data]]. Panel data is the general class, a multidimensional data set, whereas a time series data set is a one-dimensional panel (as is a [[cross-sectional data]]set).  A data set may exhibit characteristics of both panel data and time series data.  One way to tell is to ask what makes one data record unique from the other records.  If the answer is the time data field, then this is a time series data set candidate.  If determining a unique record requires a time data field and an additional identifier which is unrelated to time (student ID, stock symbol, country code), then it is panel data candidate.  If the differentiation lies on the non-time identifier, then the data set is a cross-sectional data set candidate.\n\n==Analysis==\n\nThere are several types of motivation and data analysis available for time series which are appropriate for different purposes and etc.\n\n===Motivation===\n\nIn the context of [[statistics]], [[econometrics]], [[quantitative finance]], [[seismology]], [[meteorology]], and [[geophysics]] the primary goal of time series analysis is [[forecasting]]. In the context of [[signal processing]], [[control engineering]] and [[communication engineering]] it is used for signal detection and [[estimation]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}  In the context of [[data mining]], [[pattern recognition]] and [[machine learning]] time series analysis can be used for [[cluster analysis|clustering]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Liao | first1 = T.

The number of cases was standardized to a rate per 100,000 and the percent change per year in this rate was calculated. The nearly steadily dropping line shows that the TB incidence was decreasing in most years, but the percent change in this rate varied by as much as +/- 10%, with 'surges' in 1975 and around the early 1990s. The use of both vertical axes allows the comparison of two time series in one graphic.\n\nOther techniques include:\n\n* [[Autocorrelation]] analysis to examine [[serial dependence]]\n* [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|Spectral analysis]] to examine cyclic behavior which need not be related to [[seasonality]].

Numerical methods for scientists and engineers. Courier Corporation, 2012.</ref> Interpolation is useful where the data surrounding the missing data is available and its trend, seasonality, and longer-term cycles are known. This is often done by using a related series known for all relevant dates.<ref>Friedman, Milton. \"[http://www.nber.org/chapters/c2062.pdf The interpolation of time series by related series].\" Journal of the American Statistical Association 57.300 (1962): 729\u2013757.</ref> Alternatively [[polynomial interpolation]] or [[spline interpolation]] is used where piecewise [[polynomial]] functions are fit into time intervals such that they fit smoothly together. A different problem which is closely related to interpolation is the approximation of a complicated function by a simple function (also called [[Polynomial regression|regression]]).The main difference between regression and interpolation is that polynomial regression gives a single polynomial that models the entire data set.  Spline interpolation, however, yield a piecewise continuous function composed of many polynomials to model the data set.\n\n[[Extrapolation]] is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable. It is similar to [[interpolation]], which produces estimates between known observations, but extrapolation is subject to greater [[uncertainty]] and a higher risk of producing meaningless results.\n\n===Function approximation===\n{{main|Function approximation}}\nIn general, a function approximation problem asks us to select a [[function (mathematics)|function]] among a well-defined class that closely matches (\"approximates\") a target function in a task-specific way.\nOne can distinguish two major classes of function approximation problems: First, for known target functions [[approximation theory]]  is the branch of [[numerical analysis]] that investigates how certain known functions (for example, [[special function]]s) can be approximated by a specific class of functions (for example, [[polynomial]]s or [[rational function]]s) that often have desirable properties (inexpensive computation, continuity, integral and limit values, etc.).\n\nSecond, the target function, call it ''g'', may be unknown; instead of an explicit formula, only a set of points (a time series) of the form (''x'', ''g''(''x'')) is provided.  Depending on the structure of the [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] of ''g'', several techniques for approximating ''g'' may be applicable.  For example, if ''g'' is an operation on the [[real number]]s, techniques of [[interpolation]], [[extrapolation]], [[regression analysis]], and [[curve fitting]] can be used.  If the [[codomain]] (range or target set) of ''g'' is a finite set, one is dealing with a [[statistical classification|classification]] problem instead. A related problem of ''online'' time series approximation<ref>Gandhi, Sorabh, Luca Foschini, and Subhash Suri. \"[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5447930/ Space-efficient online approximation of time series data: Streams, amnesia, and out-of-order].\" Data Engineering (ICDE), 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on. IEEE, 2010.</ref> is to summarize the data in one-pass and construct an approximate representation that can support a variety of time series queries with bounds on worst-case error.\n\nTo some extent the different problems ([[regression analysis|regression]], [[Statistical classification|classification]], [[fitness approximation]]) have received a unified treatment in [[statistical learning theory]], where they are viewed as [[supervised learning]] problems.\n\n===Prediction and forecasting===\nIn [[statistics]], [[prediction]] is a part of [[statistical inference]]. One particular approach to such inference is known as [[predictive inference]], but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, which is not necessarily the same as prediction over time. When information is transferred across time, often to specific points in time, the process is known as [[forecasting]].\n* Fully formed statistical models for [[stochastic simulation]] purposes, so as to generate alternative versions of the time series, representing what might happen over non-specific time-periods in the future\n* Simple or fully formed statistical models to describe the likely outcome of the time series in the immediate future, given knowledge of the most recent outcomes (forecasting).\n* Forecasting on time series is usually done using automated statistical software packages and programming languages, such as [[Apache Spark]], [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[SPSS]] and many others.\n* Forecasting on large scale data is done using Spark which has spark-ts as a third party package.\n\n===Classification===\n{{main|Statistical classification}}\nAssigning time series pattern to a specific category, for example identify a word based on series of hand movements in [[sign language]].\n\n===Signal estimation===\n{{see also|Signal processing|Estimation theory}}\nThis approach is based on [[harmonic analysis]] and filtering of signals in the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Fourier transform]], and [[spectral density estimation]], the development of which was significantly accelerated during [[World War II]] by mathematician [[Norbert Wiener]], electrical engineers [[Rudolf E. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[Dennis Gabor]] and others for filtering signals from noise and predicting signal values at a certain point in time. See [[Kalman filter]], [[Estimation theory]], and [[Digital signal processing]]\n\n===Segmentation===\n{{main|Time-series segmentation}}\nSplitting a time-series into a sequence of segments. It is often the case that a time-series can be represented as a sequence of individual segments, each with its own characteristic properties. For example, the audio signal from a conference call can be partitioned into pieces corresponding to the times during which each person was speaking. In time-series segmentation, the goal is to identify the segment boundary points in the time-series, and to characterize the dynamical properties associated with each segment. One can approach this problem using [[Change detection|change-point detection]], or by modeling the time-series as a more sophisticated system, such as a Markov jump linear system.\n\n==Models==\n\nModels for time series data can have many forms and represent different [[stochastic processes]]. When modeling variations in the level of a process, three broad classes of practical importance are the ''[[autoregressive]]'' (AR) models, the ''integrated'' (I) models, and the ''[[moving average model|moving average]]'' (MA) models. These three classes depend linearly on previous data points.<ref name=\"linear time series\">{{cite book |authorlink=Neil Gershenfeld |last=Gershenfeld |first=N. |year=1999 |title=The Nature of Mathematical Modeling |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=205\u2013208 |isbn=978-0521570954 }}</ref> Combinations of these ideas produce [[autoregressive moving average]] (ARMA) and [[autoregressive integrated moving average]] (ARIMA) models. The [[autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average]] (ARFIMA) model generalizes the former three. Extensions of these classes to deal with vector-valued data are available under the heading of multivariate time-series models and sometimes the preceding acronyms are extended by including an initial \"V\" for \"vector\", as in VAR for [[vector autoregression]]. An additional set of extensions of these models is available for use where the observed time-series is driven by some \"forcing\" time-series (which may not have a causal effect on the observed series): the distinction from the multivariate case is that the forcing series may be deterministic or under the experimenter's control. For these models, the acronyms are extended with a final \"X\" for \"exogenous\".\n\nNon-linear dependence of the level of a series on previous data points is of interest, partly because of the possibility of producing a [[chaos theory|chaotic]] time series. However, more importantly, empirical investigations can indicate the advantage of using predictions derived from non-linear models, over those from linear models, as for example in [[nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model]]s. Further references on nonlinear time series analysis: (Kantz and Schreiber),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kantz|first1=Holger|last2=Thomas|first2=Schreiber|title=Nonlinear Time Series Analysis|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|isbn=978-0521529020}}</ref> and (Abarbanel)<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abarbanel|first1=Henry|title=Analysis of Observed Chaotic Data|date=Nov 25, 1997|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0387983721}}</ref>\n\nAmong other types of non-linear time series models, there are models to represent the changes of variance over time ([[heteroskedasticity]]). These models represent [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and the collection comprises a wide variety of representation ([[GARCH]], TARCH, EGARCH, FIGARCH, CGARCH, etc.). Here changes in variability are related to, or predicted by, recent past values of the observed series. This is in contrast to other possible representations of locally varying variability, where the variability might be modelled as being driven by a separate time-varying process, as in a [[doubly stochastic model]].\n\nIn recent work on model-free analyses, wavelet transform based methods (for example locally stationary wavelets and wavelet decomposed neural networks) have gained favor. Multiscale (often referred to as multiresolution) techniques decompose a given time series, attempting to illustrate time dependence at multiple scales. See also [[Markov switching multifractal]] (MSMF) techniques for modeling volatility evolution.\n\nA [[Hidden Markov model]] (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobserved (hidden) states. An HMM can be considered as the simplest [[dynamic Bayesian network]]. HMM models are widely used in [[speech recognition]], for translating a time series of spoken words into text.\n\n===Notation===\nA number of different notations are in use for time-series analysis. A common notation specifying a time series ''X'' that is indexed by the [[natural number]]s is written\n:''X'' = {''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ...}.\n\nAnother common notation is\n:''Y'' = {''Y<sub>t</sub>'': ''t'' \u2208 ''T''},\nwhere ''T'' is the [[index set]].\n\n===Conditions===\nThere are two sets of conditions under which much of the theory is built:\n* [[Stationary process]]\n* [[Ergodic process]]\n\nHowever, ideas of stationarity must be expanded to consider two important ideas: [[strict stationarity]] and [[Stationary process#Weaker forms of stationarity|second-order stationarity]]. Both models and applications can be developed under each of these conditions, although the models in the latter case might be considered as only partly specified.\n\nIn addition, time-series analysis can be applied where the series are [[Cyclostationary process|seasonally stationary]] or non-stationary. Situations where the amplitudes of frequency components change with time can be dealt with in [[time-frequency analysis]] which makes use of a [[time\u2013frequency representation]] of a time-series or signal.<ref>Boashash, B.
