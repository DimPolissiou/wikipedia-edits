The origins of the liver lie in both the ventral portion of the [[foregut]] [[endoderm]] (endoderm being one of the three embryonic [[germ layer]]s) and the constituents of the adjacent [[septum transversum]] [[mesenchyme]]. In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure.

[[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.

In the human [[embryo]], the [[hepatic diverticulum]] is the tube of endoderm that extends out from the foregut into the surrounding mesenchyme. The mesenchyme of septum transversum induces this endoderm to proliferate, to branch, and to form the glandular epithelium of the liver. A portion of the hepatic diverticulum (that region closest to the digestive tube) continues to function as the [[Biliary tract|drainage duct]] of the liver, and a branch from this duct produces the [[gallbladder]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Gilbert SF | title = Developmental Biology | edition = 6th | publisher = Sinauer Associates | year = 2000 | location = Sunderland (MA) | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | access-date = 2017-09-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20171218061140/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10107/#A3752 | archive-date = 2017-12-18 | url-status = live }}</ref> Besides signals from the septum transversum mesenchyme, [[fibroblast growth factor]] from the [[Heart development|developing heart]] also contributes to hepatic competence, along with [[retinoic acid]] emanating from the [[lateral plate mesoderm]].

The liver bud separates into the lobes. The left [[umbilical vein]] becomes the [[ductus venosus]] and the right [[Vitelline veins|vitelline vein]] becomes the [[portal vein]]. The expanding liver bud is colonized by [[Hematopoietic stem cell|hematopoietic cells]]. The bipotential hepatoblasts begin differentiating into [[Cholangiocyte|biliary epithelial cells]] and [[hepatocyte]]s. The biliary epithelial cells differentiate from hepatoblasts around portal veins, first producing a monolayer, and then a bilayer of cuboidal cells. In ductal plate, focal dilations emerge at points in the bilayer, become surrounded by portal mesenchyme, and undergo tubulogenesis into intrahepatic bile ducts. Hepatoblasts not adjacent to portal veins instead differentiate into hepatocytes and arrange into cords lined by sinudoidal epithelial cells and bile canaliculi. Once hepatoblasts are specified into hepatocytes and undergo further expansion, they begin acquiring the functions of a mature hepatocyte, and eventually mature hepatocytes appear as highly polarized epithelial cells with abundant [[glycogen]] accumulation. In the adult liver, hepatocytes are not equivalent, with position along the portocentrovenular axis within a [[Lobules of liver|liver lobule]] dictating expression of metabolic genes involved in drug metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, ammonia detoxification, and bile production and secretion. [[Wnt signaling pathway|WNT/\u03b2-catenin]] has now been identified to be playing a key role in this phenomenon.<ref name=\"pmid21337461\"/>\n\nAt birth, the liver comprises roughly 4% of body weight and weighs on average about {{convert|120|g|oz|0|abbr=on}}. Over the course of further development, it will increase to {{convert|1.4|\u2013|1.6|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}} but will only take up 2.5\u20133.5% of body weight.<ref>{{cite book | title=Anatomy a Regional Atlas of the Human Body | publisher=Lippincott Williams & Wilkins | author=Clemente, Carmin D. | year=2011 | location=Philadelphia | page=243 | isbn=978-1-58255-889-9}}</ref>\n\n===Fetal blood supply===\nIn the growing fetus, a major source of blood to the liver is the [[umbilical vein]], which supplies nutrients to the growing fetus. The umbilical vein enters the abdomen at the umbilicus and passes upward along the free margin of the falciform ligament of the liver to the inferior surface of the liver. There, it joins with the left branch of the portal vein. The [[ductus venosus]] carries blood from the left portal vein to the left hepatic vein and then to the [[inferior vena cava]], allowing placental blood to bypass the liver.\n\nIn the fetus, the liver does not perform the normal digestive processes and filtration of the infant liver because nutrients are received directly from the mother via the [[placenta]]. The fetal liver releases some blood stem cells that migrate to the fetal [[thymus]], creating the [[T-cells]] or T-lymphocytes. After birth, the formation of blood stem cells shifts to the red [[bone marrow]].\n\nAfter 2\u20135 days, the umbilical vein and ductus venosus are completely obliterated; the former becomes the [[round ligament of liver]] and the latter becomes the [[ligamentum venosum]].  In the [[medical disorder|disorders]] of [[cirrhosis]] and [[portal hypertension]], the umbilical vein can open up again.\n\n==Functions==\nThe various functions of the liver are carried out by the liver cells or hepatocytes. The liver is thought to be responsible for up to 500 separate functions, usually in combination with other systems and organs. Currently, no [[artificial organ]] or device is capable of reproducing all the functions of the liver.  Some functions can be carried out by [[liver dialysis]], an experimental treatment for [[liver failure]]. The liver also accounts for about 20% of resting total body oxygen consumption.\n\n===Blood supply===\n[[File:Liver veins.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Liver veins]]\nThe liver receives a dual blood supply from the hepatic portal vein and hepatic arteries. The hepatic portal vein delivers around 75% of the liver's blood supply and carries [[venous blood]] drained from the [[spleen]], [[gastrointestinal tract]], and its associated organs. The hepatic arteries supply arterial blood to the liver, accounting for the remaining quarter of its [[blood flow]]. Oxygen is provided from both sources; about half of the liver's oxygen demand is met by the hepatic portal vein, and half is met by the hepatic arteries.<ref name=\"isbn1-55009-364-9\">{{cite book |author1=Shneider, Benjamin L. |author2=Sherman, Philip M. |title=Pediatric Gastrointestinal Disease |publisher=PMPH-USA|location=Connecticut |year=2008 |page=751 |isbn=978-1-55009-364-3 }}</ref> The hepatic artery also has both alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptors; therefore, flow through the artery is controlled, in part, by the splanchnic nerves of the autonomic nervous system.\n\nBlood flows through the liver sinusoids and empties into the central vein of each lobule.  The [[Central veins of liver|central veins]] coalesce into hepatic veins, which leave the liver and drain into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=Human/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Biliary flow===\n{{Main |Enterohepatic circulation}}\n[[File:Diagram showing the position of the perihilar bile ducts CRUK 357.svg|thumb|240px|Biliary tract]]\nThe [[biliary tract]] is derived from the branches of the bile ducts. The biliary tract, also known as the biliary tree, is the path by which bile is secreted by the liver then transported to the first part of the small intestine, the [[duodenum]]. The [[bile]] produced in the liver is collected in [[bile canaliculi]], small grooves between the faces of adjacent hepatocytes. The canaliculi radiate to the edge of the liver lobule, where they merge to form bile ducts. Within the liver, these ducts are termed intrahepatic bile ducts, and once they exit the liver, they are considered extrahepatic. The intrahepatic ducts eventually drain into the right and left [[hepatic duct]]s, which exit the liver at the [[Porta hepatis|transverse fissure]], and merge to form the [[common hepatic duct]]. The [[cystic duct]] from the gallbladder joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct.<ref name=Human/> The biliary system and connective tissue is supplied by the hepatic artery alone\n\nBile either drains directly into the duodenum via the common bile duct, or is temporarily stored in the gallbladder via the cystic duct. The common bile duct and the pancreatic duct enter the second part of the duodenum together at the hepatopancreatic ampulla, also known as the [[ampulla of Vater]].\n\n===Synthesis===\n{{Further|Proteins produced and secreted by the liver}}\nThe liver plays a major role in carbohydrate, protein, amino acid, and lipid metabolism.\n\nThe liver performs several roles in [[carbohydrate metabolism]]: The liver synthesizes and stores around 100 g of [[glycogen]] via [[glycogenesis]], the formation of glycogen from glucose. When needed, the liver releases glucose into the blood by performing [[glycogenolysis]], the breakdown of [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]].<ref name=\"Phys\">{{cite book|title=Human Anatomy & Physiology + New Masteringa&p With Pearson Etext|date=2012|publisher=Benjamin-Cummings Pub Co|isbn=9780321852120|page=939}}</ref> The liver is also responsible for [[gluconeogenesis]], which is the synthesis of glucose from certain [[amino acid]]s, [[lactic acid|lactate]], or [[glycerol]]. Adipose and liver cells produce glycerol by [[lipolysis|breakdown of fat]], which the liver uses for gluconeogenesis.<ref name=Phys/>\n\nThe liver is responsible for the mainstay of protein [[metabolism]], synthesis as well as degradation. It is also responsible for a large part of [[amino acid synthesis]]. The liver plays a role in the production of clotting factors, as well as red blood cell production. Some of the proteins synthesized by the liver include [[coagulation factors]] [[fibrinogen|I]] (fibrinogen), [[thrombin|II]] (prothrombin), [[factor V|V]], [[factor VII|VII]], [[factor VIII|VIII]], [[factor IX|IX]], [[factor X|X]], [[factor XI|XI]], [[factor XII|XII]], [[factor XIII|XIII]], as well as [[protein C]], [[protein S]] and [[antithrombin]]. In the first trimester [[fetus]], the liver is the main site of [[red blood cell]] production. By the 32nd week of [[gestation]], the [[bone marrow]] has almost completely taken over that task. The liver is a major site of production for [[thrombopoietin]], a [[glycoprotein]] hormone that regulates the production of [[platelet]]s by the [[bone marrow]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jelkmann |first1=Wolfgang |title=The role of the liver in the production of thrombopoietin compared with erythropoietin |journal=European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=791\u2013801 |year=2001 |pmid=11474308 |doi=10.1097/00042737-200107000-00006}}</ref>\n\nThe liver plays several roles in [[lipid]] metabolism: it performs [[cholesterol]] synthesis, [[lipogenesis]], and the production of [[triglyceride]]s, and a bulk of the body's lipoproteins are synthesized in the liver.\n\nThe liver plays a key role in digestion, as it produces and excretes [[bile]] (a yellowish liquid) required for emulsifying fats and help the absorption of vitamin K from the diet. Some of the bile drains directly into the duodenum, and some is stored in the gallbladder.\n\nThe liver also produces [[insulin-like growth factor 1]], a [[polypeptide]] [[protein]] hormone that plays an important role in childhood growth and continues to have [[anabolism|anabolic effects]] in adults.\n\n===Breakdown===\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown of [[insulin]] and other [[hormone]]s. The liver breaks down [[bilirubin]] via [[glucuronidation]], facilitating its excretion into bile.\nThe liver is responsible for the breakdown and excretion of many waste products. It plays a key role in breaking down or modifying [[toxic]] substances (e.g., [[methylation]]) and most medicinal products in a process called [[drug metabolism]]. This sometimes results in [[toxication]], when the metabolite is more toxic than its precursor. Preferably, the toxins are [[Xenobiotic conjugation|conjugated]] to avail excretion in bile or urine. The liver converts [[ammonia]] into [[urea]] as part of the [[urea cycle]], and the urea is excreted in the urine.<ref name=Anatomy/>\n\n=== Blood reservoir===\n{{Unsourced section|date=January 2020}}\nBecause the liver is an expandable organ, large quantities of\nblood can be stored in its blood vessels. Its normal blood\nvolume, including both that in the hepatic veins and that in\nthe hepatic sinuses, is about 450 milliliters, or almost 10 percent of the body's total blood volume. When high pressure\nin the right atrium causes backpressure in the liver, the liver\nexpands, and 0.5 to 1 liter of extra blood is occasionally stored\nin the hepatic veins and sinuses. This occurs especially in cardiac failure with peripheral congestion. Thus, in effect, the liver is a large, expandable,\nvenous organ capable of acting as a valuable blood reservoir\nin times of excess blood volume and capable of supplying\nextra blood in times of diminished blood volume\n\n=== Lymph production===\nBecause the pores in the hepatic sinusoids are very permeable and allow ready passage of both fluid and proteins into the spaces of Disse, the lymph draining from the liver usually has a protein concentration of about 6 g/dl, which is only\nslightly less than the protein concentration of plasma. Also,\nthe high permeability of the liver sinusoid epithelium allows\nlarge quantities of lymph to form. Therefore, about half of\nall the lymph formed in the body under resting conditions\narises in the liver.\n\n===Other===\n* The liver stores a multitude of substances, including glucose (in the form of [[glycogen]]), [[vitamin A]] (1\u20132 years' supply), [[vitamin D]] (1\u20134 months' supply){{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}, [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]] (3\u20135 years' supply),<ref>{{cite web|title=If a person stops consuming the vitamin, the body's stores of this vitamin usually take about 3 to 5 years to exhaust|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|access-date=2016-06-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623000150/http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/disorders-of-nutrition/vitamins/vitamin-b-12|archive-date=2016-06-23|url-status=live}}</ref> [[vitamin K]], [[iron]], and [[copper]].\n* The liver is responsible for immunological effects&nbsp;\u2013 the [[mononuclear phagocyte system]] of the liver contains many immunologically active cells, acting as a 'sieve' for antigens carried to it via the [[Hepatic portal system|portal system]].\n* The liver produces [[albumin]], the most abundant protein in [[Blood plasma|blood serum]]. It is essential in the maintenance of [[oncotic pressure]], and acts as a transport for [[fatty acid]]s and [[steroid hormone]]s.\n* The liver synthesizes [[angiotensinogen]], a hormone that is responsible for raising the [[blood pressure]] when activated by [[renin]], an enzyme that is released when the [[juxtaglomerular apparatus|kidney]] senses [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]].\n* The liver produces the enzyme catalase in order to break down hydrogen peroxide, a very toxic substance due to it being a powerful oxidising agent, into water and oxygen.\n\n===With aging===\nThe oxidative capacity of the liver decreases with aging and therefore any medications that require oxidation (for instance, [[benzodiazepines]]) are more likely to accumulate to toxic levels. However, medications with shorter [[half-life|half-lives]], such as [[lorazepam]] and [[oxazepam]], are preferred in most cases when benzodiazepines are required in regard to geriatric medicine.\n\n==Clinical significance==\n\n===Disease===\n{{Main|Liver disease}}\n[[File:Big Liver Tumor.JPG|right|thumb| Left lobe liver tumor]]\n\nThe liver is a vital organ and supports almost every other organ in the body.

This can lead to scarring ([[fibrosis]]) and [[cirrhosis]]. Cirrhosis increases the resistance to blood flow in the liver, and can result in [[portal hypertension]]. [[Portacaval anastomosis|Congested anastomoses]] between the [[portal venous system]] and the systemic circulation, can be a subsequent condition.\n\nMany diseases of the liver are accompanied by [[jaundice]] caused by increased levels of [[bilirubin]] in the system. The bilirubin results from the breakup of the [[Haemoglobin|hemoglobin]] of dead [[red blood cell]]s; normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and excretes it through bile.\n\nThere are also many pediatric liver diseases, including [[biliary atresia]], [[alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency]], [[alagille syndrome]], [[progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis]], [[Langerhans cell histiocytosis]] and [[cavernous liver haemangioma|hepatic hemangioma]] a [[benign tumour]] the most common type of liver tumour, thought to be congenital. A genetic disorder causing multiple cysts to form in the liver tissue, usually in later life, and usually asymptomatic, is [[polycystic liver disease]]. Diseases that interfere with liver function will lead to derangement of these processes. However, the liver has a great capacity to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] and has a large reserve capacity. In most cases, the liver only produces symptoms after extensive damage.\n\n[[Hepatomegaly]] refers to an enlarged liver and can be due to many causes. It can be [[palpated]] in a [[liver span]] measurement.\n\nLiver diseases may be diagnosed by [[liver function tests]]\u2013blood tests that can identify various markers. For example, [[Acute-phase protein|acute-phase reactants]] are produced by the liver in response to injury or inflammation.\n\n===Symptoms===\nThe classic symptoms of liver damage include the following:\n* Pale stools occur when [[stercobilin]], a brown pigment, is absent from the stool. Stercobilin is derived from bilirubin metabolites produced in the liver.\n* Dark urine occurs when bilirubin mixes with urine\n* Jaundice (yellow skin and/or whites of the eyes) This is where [[bilirubin]] deposits in skin, causing an intense [[itch]]. Itching is the most common complaint by people who have liver failure. Often this itch cannot be relieved by drugs.\n* [[Ascites|Swelling of the abdomen]], and [[Swelling (medical)|swelling]] of the ankles and feet occurs because the [[Hypoalbuminemia|liver fails to make albumin]].\n* Excessive fatigue occurs from a [[Deficiency (medicine)|generalized loss of nutrients]], [[dietary mineral|minerals]] and vitamins.\n* [[bruise|Bruising]] and easy bleeding are other features of liver disease. The liver makes [[Coagulation|clotting factors]], substances which help prevent bleeding. When liver damage occurs, these factors are no longer present and severe bleeding can occur.<ref>[http://www.ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver Extraintestinal Complications: Liver Disease] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121034708/http://ccfa.org/info/about/complications/liver |date=2010-11-21 }} Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America.

Less commonly, liver transplantation is done for [[fulminant hepatic failure]], in which liver failure occurs over days to weeks.\n\nLiver [[allograft]]s for [[organ transplantation|transplant]] usually come from donors who have died from fatal [[Traumatic brain injury|brain injury]]. [[Living donor liver transplantation]] is a technique in which a portion of a living person's liver is removed ([[hepatectomy]]) and used to replace the entire liver of the recipient.  This was first performed in 1989 for pediatric liver transplantation.  Only 20 percent of an adult's liver (Couinaud segments 2 and 3) is needed to serve as a liver allograft for an infant or small child.\n\nMore recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} adult-to-adult liver transplantation has been done using the donor's right hepatic lobe, which amounts to 60 percent of the liver.  Due to the ability of the liver to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]], both the donor and recipient end up with normal liver function if all goes well.

The canopy level is the third level of the temperate rainforest. The trees forming the canopy, [[conifers]], can stand as tall as 100 meters or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the [[rainforest]] takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.\n\nThe canopy\u2019s coverage affects the [[shade tolerance]] levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. \nThe treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.\n\nThe canopy survives through [[photosynthesis]]. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) calculates the annual amount of photosynthesis that occurs in temperate rainforests. A diverse amount of photosynthesis occurs based on the location and [[microclimate]]s of the forest.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Global distribution==\n[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the areas of temperate rain forest]]\nTemperate forests cover a large part of the Earth, but temperate rainforests only occur in a few regions around the world. Most of these occur in oceanic moist climates: the [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|Pacific temperate rain forests]] in Western [[North America]] (Southeastern [[Alaska]] to Central [[California]]), the [[Valdivian temperate rainforests|Valdivian]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic]] temperate rainforests of southwestern [[South America]] (Southern [[Chile]] and adjacent [[Argentina]]), pockets of rain forest in [[Northwestern Europe]] (southern [[Norway]] to northern [[Iberia]]), temperate rainforests of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[New Zealand]] temperate rainforests ([[South Island]]'s west coast).\n\nOthers occur in subtropical moist climates; [[South Africa]]'s [[Knysna-Amatole coastal forests]], the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|Colchan rainforests]] of the [[Black Sea]] region (southeast corner of [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the Caspian temperate rainforests of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the mountain temperate rainforests along eastern [[Taiwan]]'s Pacific coast, the eastern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]] along the length of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] and in the area surrounding [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]] and across the peninsula's southern coastline, southwest [[Japan]]'s Taiheiyo forests, coastal [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand's [[North Island]].\n\nAdditionally pockets of temperate rainforest occur in dreary climates that are not categorized by just annual precipitation but also number of cloudy days as well as number of days of measurable precipitation in the form of rain or snow.  In Western North America outside the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Columbia Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] (BC), northern [[Idaho]] and northwestern [[Montana]], have more of a continental climate and have pockets of temperate coniferous rainforest.\n\nIn Eastern North America, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest along the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and adjacent parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[West Virginia]] to [[New England]]. These areas include sections of West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, as well as [[Western New York]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  A good example of these forests are found in [[Zoar Valley]] in [[Western New York]] (nearest major city is [[Buffalo, New York]]), [[Cook Forest State Park]] within the [[Allegheny National Forest]] (nearest major city is [[Pittsburgh]]), and [[Cathedral State Park]] in West Virginia. \n\nIn Eastern Asia, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest in what is known as the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Ussuri]], [[Outer Manchuria]], [[Sakhalin]]) in [[Asia]] where the climate is also continental in nature, but get enough precipitation and cloud cover to harbor significant pockets of temperate rainforest.  Like Eastern North America, much precipitation is in the form of rain and snow. The mountainous coniferous forests of the [[Changbai Mountains]] bordering [[China]] and [[North Korea]] are also a good example, containing some of the richest high-elevation coniferous evergreen forests in [[East Asia]].\n\n==Temperate rain forest regions by continent==\n\n===North America===\n\n====Pacific temperate rain forests====\n{{Main|Pacific temperate rain forests (WWF ecoregion)}}\n[[File:Mt Hood Wilderness near Ramona Falls.jpg|thumb|Temperate rain forest in the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]], Oregon, USA.

They vary in their species composition, but are all predominantly [[coniferous]], sometimes with an [[understory]] of [[broadleaved]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter, similar to [[Mediterranean climate]]s, but in summer, [[fog]] moisture is extracted by the trees and produces a [[fog drip]] keeping the forest moist.<ref name=Franklin>Franklin, J.F. & Dyrness C.T.

Temperate rain forests occur in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like ''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', and [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), but include many [[conifers]] as well, notably [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), one of the largest tree species of the world.\n\nThe Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in [[South America]]. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]]. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[genera]] with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.\n\nIn the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains' west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400&nbsp;m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35\u00b0S), and descends to 1,000&nbsp;m in the south of the [[Los R\u00edos Region|Valdivian region]].

There are several coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen [[Afromontane]] forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa's [[Tsitsikamma National Park]].\n\n===Europe===\nTemperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern [[Norway]] (see [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]]) and northern [[Spain]]. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]], surrounding North Western [[Bulgaria]] along with the [[Black Sea]].\n\n====Atlantic Oakwood forest (United Kingdom and Ireland)====\nThe woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, [[Caledonian forest]], and colloquially as 'Celtic Rainforests'. They are also listed in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] as [[British NVC community W11]] and [[British NVC community W17]] depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of [[Loch Maree]], [[Loch Sunart]], [[Loch Lomond]] and one of the best preserved sites on the remote [[Taynish National Nature Reserve|Taynish Peninsula]] in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in [[Snowdonia]] and Mid Wales. In England, they occur in the [[Lake District]] ([[Borrowdale]] Woods) and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall including the [[Fowey]] valley in Cornwall and the valley of the [[river Dart]] which flows off [[Dartmoor]] and has rainfall in excess of 2&nbsp;metres per year.<ref name=\"UK Government Met Office\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109134904/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/rainfall.html UK Government Met Office].

''Fraga'' is a [[Galician language|Galician]] word for \"natural woodland\", (old-growth forest) and the park is an example of a temperate rainforest in which oak ([[Quercus robur]] and [[Quercus pyrenaica]]) is the [[climax vegetation]]. The protected area extends along the valley of the river Eume within the [[Ferrolterra]] municipalities of [[Pontedeume]], [[Cabanas, Galicia|Cabanas]], [[A Capela, Galicia|A Capela]], [[Monfero]] and [[As Pontes de Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez]]. Some 500 people reside within the park. The monastery of [[Saint John of Caaveiro]] also lies within the park.\n\nThe area was declared a [[Natural park (Spain)|natural park]] (a level of protection lower than [[national park]]) in 1997. It is one of six natural parks in Galicia. The European Union has recognised the park as a [[Site of Community Importance]]. There are a number of species of ferns. Invertebrate species include the [[Kerry slug]] and it is an important site for amphibians.\n\n==== Vinatova\u010da rainforest (Serbia) ====\n{{main|Vinatova\u010da}}\nThe '''Vinatova\u010da rainforest''', alternatively spelled '''vintova\u010da''', is the only rainforest in Serbia.<ref name=\"rts\">{{cite web|url= http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/57/srbija-danas/968488/vinatovaca---jedina-prasuma-u-srbiji.html |author= |title= Vinatova\u010da - jedina pra\u0161uma u Srbiji|date=7 October 2011 |publisher=[[Radio Television Serbia]]|language=Serbian}}</ref> It has been left undisturbed for centuries due to strict conservation laws starting in the 17th century.\n\nVinatova\u010da is situated in the central [[Ku\u010daj mountains]] in the [[Resava River#Region|Upper Resava]] region, at an altitude between {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|800 |m|abbr=on}}.

The canopy level is the third level of the temperate rainforest. The trees forming the canopy, [[conifers]], can stand as tall as 100 meters or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the [[rainforest]] takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.\n\nThe canopy\u2019s coverage affects the [[shade tolerance]] levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. \nThe treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.\n\nThe canopy survives through [[photosynthesis]]. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) calculates the annual amount of photosynthesis that occurs in temperate rainforests. A diverse amount of photosynthesis occurs based on the location and [[microclimate]]s of the forest.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Global distribution==\n[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the areas of temperate rain forest]]\nTemperate forests cover a large part of the Earth, but temperate rainforests only occur in a few regions around the world. Most of these occur in oceanic moist climates: the [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|Pacific temperate rain forests]] in Western [[North America]] (Southeastern [[Alaska]] to Central [[California]]), the [[Valdivian temperate rainforests|Valdivian]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic]] temperate rainforests of southwestern [[South America]] (Southern [[Chile]] and adjacent [[Argentina]]), pockets of rain forest in [[Northwestern Europe]] (southern [[Norway]] to northern [[Iberia]]), temperate rainforests of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[New Zealand]] temperate rainforests ([[South Island]]'s west coast).\n\nOthers occur in subtropical moist climates; [[South Africa]]'s [[Knysna-Amatole coastal forests]], the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|Colchan rainforests]] of the [[Black Sea]] region (southeast corner of [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the Caspian temperate rainforests of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the mountain temperate rainforests along eastern [[Taiwan]]'s Pacific coast, the eastern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]] along the length of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] and in the area surrounding [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]] and across the peninsula's southern coastline, southwest [[Japan]]'s Taiheiyo forests, coastal [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand's [[North Island]].\n\nAdditionally pockets of temperate rainforest occur in dreary climates that are not categorized by just annual precipitation but also number of cloudy days as well as number of days of measurable precipitation in the form of rain or snow.  In Western North America outside the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Columbia Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] (BC), northern [[Idaho]] and northwestern [[Montana]], have more of a continental climate and have pockets of temperate coniferous rainforest.\n\nIn Eastern North America, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest along the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and adjacent parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[West Virginia]] to [[New England]]. These areas include sections of West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, as well as [[Western New York]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  A good example of these forests are found in [[Zoar Valley]] in [[Western New York]] (nearest major city is [[Buffalo, New York]]), [[Cook Forest State Park]] within the [[Allegheny National Forest]] (nearest major city is [[Pittsburgh]]), and [[Cathedral State Park]] in West Virginia. \n\nIn Eastern Asia, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest in what is known as the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Ussuri]], [[Outer Manchuria]], [[Sakhalin]]) in [[Asia]] where the climate is also continental in nature, but get enough precipitation and cloud cover to harbor significant pockets of temperate rainforest.  Like Eastern North America, much precipitation is in the form of rain and snow. The mountainous coniferous forests of the [[Changbai Mountains]] bordering [[China]] and [[North Korea]] are also a good example, containing some of the richest high-elevation coniferous evergreen forests in [[East Asia]].\n\n==Temperate rain forest regions by continent==\n\n===North America===\n\n====Pacific temperate rain forests====\n{{Main|Pacific temperate rain forests (WWF ecoregion)}}\n[[File:Mt Hood Wilderness near Ramona Falls.jpg|thumb|Temperate rain forest in the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]], Oregon, USA.

Temperate rain forests occur in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like ''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', and [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), but include many [[conifers]] as well, notably [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), one of the largest tree species of the world.\n\nThe Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in [[South America]]. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]]. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[genera]] with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.\n\nIn the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains' west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400&nbsp;m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35\u00b0S), and descends to 1,000&nbsp;m in the south of the [[Los R\u00edos Region|Valdivian region]].

There are several coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen [[Afromontane]] forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa's [[Tsitsikamma National Park]].\n\n===Europe===\nTemperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern [[Norway]] (see [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]]) and northern [[Spain]]. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]], surrounding North Western [[Bulgaria]] along with the [[Black Sea]].\n\n====Atlantic Oakwood forest (United Kingdom and Ireland)====\nThe woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, [[Caledonian forest]], and colloquially as 'Celtic Rainforests'. They are also listed in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] as [[British NVC community W11]] and [[British NVC community W17]] depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of [[Loch Maree]], [[Loch Sunart]], [[Loch Lomond]] and one of the best preserved sites on the remote [[Taynish National Nature Reserve|Taynish Peninsula]] in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in [[Snowdonia]] and Mid Wales. In England, they occur in the [[Lake District]] ([[Borrowdale]] Woods) and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall including the [[Fowey]] valley in Cornwall and the valley of the [[river Dart]] which flows off [[Dartmoor]] and has rainfall in excess of 2&nbsp;metres per year.<ref name=\"UK Government Met Office\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109134904/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/rainfall.html UK Government Met Office].

Among his students at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] was [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]], and among Miles' associates was [[Lionel Tertis]].\n\n==Early Life==\nMiles was born in [[Crayford]], [[Kent]], to parents George Miles (a building contractor) and Fanny Hood, of [[Bexleyheath]], [[Kent]]. Percy's earliest compositions date from when he was 8 years-old and at the age of 13, he performed the [[Beethoven]] Violin Concerto at St. James' Hall, Piccadilly, with the Principal of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Alexander MacKenzie]], conducting. Percy became a student at the Royal Academy of Music from June 1893.

According to a brief biography in one of these articles in 1899, he won the first [[\u00c9mile Sauret|Sauret]] prize in 1897, the Hine Exhibition composition prize in 1893, the Walter MacFarren Scholarship in 1896 (awarded 8 January 1896)<ref name=Macfarren/> and the Charles Lucas Medal in mid summer 1898, as well as the [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] in 1899.<ref name=Times1899/><ref name=\"musicalnews41899\"/>  In 1896 he received a silver medal (presented annually to the most distinguished student at the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, or the Guildhall School of Music, in rotation, the recipient nominated by the principal or director of the school) from the [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]].<ref>{{Google books|VyAKAQAAMAAJ|The Worshipful Company of Musicians}}, published 1905 by Livery Club of the company for private circulation, p.108.</ref> As a student he also performed alongside his violin teacher Hans Wessely as second violin for chamber music concerts across London.<ref>PCS Concert Programmes 1890-1900</ref>\n\n==Professional life and Rebecca Clarke==\nHe was made a sub-professor at the RAM in 1899 and in 1903, upon his return from [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] studies in Vienna, Berlin, Karlsruhe, Paris and Milan, Percy became a full professor of Harmony and Counterpoint<ref>Musical Times Nov 1st 1903 page 747</ref>. Among his Harmony students was [[Rebecca Clarke]] who studied there from 1903 to 1905. He had become a friend of the Clarke family in the years before and had recommended she study Harmony with him and the violin with Wessely. However her father removed her from the RAM when Miles suddenly proposed marriage and kissed her after a lesson in 1905<ref>RC Memoirs Unpub. pages 117-118</ref>. This led to her being enrolled in the [[Royal College of Music]] where she studied composition with [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], who suggested she take up the viola which she later studied with Percy's friend [[Lionel Tertis]]. <ref>Ponder, Michael (2004)\"Clarke, Rebecca Helferich (1886-1979)\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

One of his cousins was the famous Australian water colourist [[J J Hilder]].<ref>Surviving letters by PHM held by family</ref>\n\nA [[cello concerto]] by Miles initially dedicated to and rehearsed with Herbert Withers (1880-1961) was announced for performance on September 3rd 1908 in [[Henry Wood]]'s [[Promenade Concerts]]. However it was not in fact performed as Miles voyaged to Australia in April 1908 and the orchestral parts were not completed in time<ref>The Referee Aug 30th 1908 page 5</ref>. Instead Withers performed the Dvorak Concerto and Percy put a line through the dedication to Withers.<ref>BBC Proms Archive Proms 1908 Prom 17</ref>. The orchestral score is lost<ref>Letter from PHM to his brother Maurice 1919</ref>, but the cello and piano accompaniment parts survive. \n\nFinancially secure from Examining, tho still living with his parents in [[Erith]], he paid off his father's mortgage and debts and in 1909 he purchased a grand piano and a [[Stradivarius violin]] made in 1720, known as the \"[[General Kyd]]\u201d<ref>Letter of Provenance dated 29th May 1911 held by Miles descendants</ref>. He bequeathed this to [[Rebecca Clarke]] in his Last Will and Testament of 1912.\n\nAlthough aged 36 at the outbreak of [[World War 1]], Percy was keen to enlist. Indeed, despite his age he was called-up several times and presented himself at [[Woolwich]]<ref>Letters to Maurice 1917</ref>. However he failed the medical on each occasion, either because of his eyesight or weak lungs.  \n\n\nHe was reluctant to have his works published<ref>Revealed in a letter from Mark Andrews, boyhood friend from Erith, to Musical Times, May 1937</ref> although a handful were; his biggest success came in 1920 when his String Sextet, (alongside works by [[Stanford]] and [[Holst]]) was selected from 64 entries for publication by Stainer & Bell and won the [[Carnegie Trust]] Award, a competition open to all the Empire.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1922 Miles went blind in one eye and also caught pneumonia<ref>obituary</ref> which took his life on April 18th of that year. According to his catalogue, he left over 160 works, (mainly chamber music and songs), half of which his mother sent to his brothers in Canada after his death. Some are now deemed lost but there are around 80 manuscripts still with relatives in Canada and around 40 survive in the RAM Archive. He never married and lies buried with his parents in Brook Street cemetery, [[Erith]].\n\n <ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26350500|newspaper=The West Australian|title=Results of 1911 Examinations|date=9 September 1911|author=The Associated Board|accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nCompositions, mostly in Manuscript, held by the Royal Academy of Music Archive, London include:\n\n*1891 Vocal duet \"Now and Afterward\"\n*1893 Song for Sop., Vln., Cello & Pft. \"A Golden Radiance\" Words by E.

Among his students at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] was [[Rebecca Clarke (composer)|Rebecca Clarke]], and among Miles' associates was [[Lionel Tertis]].\n\n==Early Life==\nMiles was born in [[Crayford]], [[Kent]], to parents George Miles (a building contractor) and Fanny Hood, of [[Bexleyheath]], [[Kent]]. Percy's earliest compositions date from when he was 8 years-old and at the age of 13, he performed the [[Beethoven]] Violin Concerto at St. James' Hall, Piccadilly, with the Principal of the [[Royal Academy of Music]], [[Alexander MacKenzie]], conducting. Percy became a student at the Royal Academy of Music from June 1893. His teachers there included [[Walter Battison Haynes]] (for composition) and violinist Hans Wessely.<ref name=Times1899/><ref name=\"musicalnews41899\">{{Google books|xNsqAAAAYAAJ|Musical News, Volume 16}}, 8 April 1899 Issue, page 371.</ref>\n\n==Studies and Awards==\nIn 1895 Miles suggested to [[Lionel Tertis]] (then also a violin pupil of Wessely at the RAM) the idea of switching to the viola, in order for them to form a string quartet.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RfpLcZf6zaoC&pg=PA5|last=White|first=John|title=Lionel Tertis: the first great virtuoso of the viola|publisher=Boydell Press|year=2006|location=Woodbridge|oclc=70765644|pages=5\u20136, 303}}</ref>  \nHis name appeared several times in ''[[The Musical Times]]'' in the late 1890s connected with performances of his own compositions and for those of other contemporaries. According to a brief biography in one of these articles in 1899, he won the first [[\u00c9mile Sauret|Sauret]] prize in 1897, the Hine Exhibition composition prize in 1893, the Walter MacFarren Scholarship in 1896 (awarded 8 January 1896)<ref name=Macfarren/> and the Charles Lucas Medal in mid summer 1898, as well as the [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] in 1899.<ref name=Times1899/><ref name=\"musicalnews41899\"/>  In 1896 he received a silver medal (presented annually to the most distinguished student at the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, or the Guildhall School of Music, in rotation, the recipient nominated by the principal or director of the school) from the [[Worshipful Company of Musicians]].<ref>{{Google books|VyAKAQAAMAAJ|The Worshipful Company of Musicians}}, published 1905 by Livery Club of the company for private circulation, p.108.</ref> As a student he also performed alongside his violin teacher Hans Wessely as second violin for chamber music concerts across London.<ref>PCS Concert Programmes 1890-1900</ref>\n\n==Professional life and Rebecca Clarke==\nHe was made a sub-professor at the RAM in 1899 and in 1903, upon his return from [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] studies in Vienna, Berlin, Karlsruhe, Paris and Milan, Percy became a full professor of Harmony and Counterpoint<ref>Musical Times Nov 1st 1903 page 747</ref>. Among his Harmony students was [[Rebecca Clarke]] who studied there from 1903 to 1905. He had become a friend of the Clarke family in the years before and had recommended she study Harmony with him and the violin with Wessely. However her father removed her from the RAM when Miles suddenly proposed marriage and kissed her after a lesson in 1905<ref>RC Memoirs Unpub. pages 117-118</ref>. This led to her being enrolled in the [[Royal College of Music]] where she studied composition with [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], who suggested she take up the viola which she later studied with Percy's friend [[Lionel Tertis]]. <ref>Ponder, Michael (2004)\"Clarke, Rebecca Helferich (1886-1979)\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nIn 1906 Miles became an overseas examiner for the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]].

Percy went around the world no fewer than six times <ref>see Obituary </ref>, sometimes visiting his brothers in Canada and relatives in Jamaica and Australia. One of his cousins was the famous Australian water colourist [[J J Hilder]].<ref>Surviving letters by PHM held by family</ref>\n\nA [[cello concerto]] by Miles initially dedicated to and rehearsed with Herbert Withers (1880-1961) was announced for performance on September 3rd 1908 in [[Henry Wood]]'s [[Promenade Concerts]]. However it was not in fact performed as Miles voyaged to Australia in April 1908 and the orchestral parts were not completed in time<ref>The Referee Aug 30th 1908 page 5</ref>. Instead Withers performed the Dvorak Concerto and Percy put a line through the dedication to Withers.<ref>BBC Proms Archive Proms 1908 Prom 17</ref>. The orchestral score is lost<ref>Letter from PHM to his brother Maurice 1919</ref>, but the cello and piano accompaniment parts survive. \n\nFinancially secure from Examining, tho still living with his parents in [[Erith]], he paid off his father's mortgage and debts and in 1909 he purchased a grand piano and a [[Stradivarius violin]] made in 1720, known as the \"[[General Kyd]]\u201d<ref>Letter of Provenance dated 29th May 1911 held by Miles descendants</ref>. He bequeathed this to [[Rebecca Clarke]] in his Last Will and Testament of 1912.\n\nAlthough aged 36 at the outbreak of [[World War 1]], Percy was keen to enlist. Indeed, despite his age he was called-up several times and presented himself at [[Woolwich]]<ref>Letters to Maurice 1917</ref>. However he failed the medical on each occasion, either because of his eyesight or weak lungs.  \n\n\nHe was reluctant to have his works published<ref>Revealed in a letter from Mark Andrews, boyhood friend from Erith, to Musical Times, May 1937</ref> although a handful were; his biggest success came in 1920 when his String Sextet, (alongside works by [[Stanford]] and [[Holst]]) was selected from 64 entries for publication by Stainer & Bell and won the [[Carnegie Trust]] Award, a competition open to all the Empire.\n\n==Death==\nIn 1922 Miles went blind in one eye and also caught pneumonia<ref>obituary</ref> which took his life on April 18th of that year. According to his catalogue, he left over 160 works, (mainly chamber music and songs), half of which his mother sent to his brothers in Canada after his death. Some are now deemed lost but there are around 80 manuscripts still with relatives in Canada and around 40 survive in the RAM Archive. He never married and lies buried with his parents in Brook Street cemetery, [[Erith]].\n\n <ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article26350500|newspaper=The West Australian|title=Results of 1911 Examinations|date=9 September 1911|author=The Associated Board|accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nCompositions, mostly in Manuscript, held by the Royal Academy of Music Archive, London include:\n\n*1891 Vocal duet \"Now and Afterward\"\n*1893 Song for Sop., Vln., Cello & Pft. \"A Golden Radiance\" Words by E.

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of the Nintendo Switch game [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom known as Galar, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and June 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

It is held annually in August and features games from the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon]]'' series such as the [[Pok\u00e9mon (video game series)|''Pok\u00e9mon'' video games]], ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]]'', ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]''. Players earn invitations to the World Championships based on their performance in qualifiers and other tournaments held throughout the season and compete for scholarship money, prizes and the title of World Champion. With the exception of [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]], invitations to the World Championships are administered by the [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] program.\n\n==History==\nThe Pok\u00e9mon World Championships first began with the [[Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game]] (TCG) in 2004. In 2009, Play! Pok\u00e9mon began to organize competitive tournaments for the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' video game series alongside the TCG, which is collectively known as the Video Game Championships (VGC). Like the TCG Championships, players compete with other players in their own age divisions (i.e. Junior, Senior and Masters) in different Premier Tournaments, and the season culminates with the best players earning an invitation to play the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships in August. The tournaments in VGC are played with a different game each year. \n\nIn 2016, Play! Pok\u00e9mon announced that ''[[Pokk\u00e9n Tournament]]'' will have its own championship series and will be played at the Pok\u00e9mon World Championships.<ref>Official Pokk\u00e9n Tournament website, http://www.pokkentournament.com/en-us/championship-series/</ref>\n\nIn 2019, it was announced that the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships would take place in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]],<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> the first time in which the World Championships would be held in a location outside of [[North America]]. This is likely due to the setting of the Nintendo Switch game [[Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield|''Pok\u00e9mon Sword and Shield'']], which takes place in a region inspired by the United Kingdom known as Galar, and it is the set of games that would be played by the video game division of the World Championships.  \n\nOn March 31, 2020, [[Play! Pok\u00e9mon]] cancelled the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon World Championships and suspended its 2020 season due to health concerns over the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2020-pokemon-championship-series-canceled/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series Canceled {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/2020-pokemon-championship-series-suspended-due-to-coronavirus/|title=2020 Pok\u00e9mon Championship Series suspended due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-31|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> This came after earlier announcements in March which saw the cancellation of the 2020 European International Championships<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/update-for-the-2020-pokemon-europe-international-championships/|title=Update for the 2020 Pok\u00e9mon Europe International Championships {{!}} Pokemon.com|website=www.pokemon.com|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28852369/pokemon-cancels-europe-international-championship-coronavirus-cases-swell|title=Pok\u00e9mon championship canceled as coronavirus cases swell|date=2020-03-06|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> and part of its season between March and May 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyesports.gg/play-pokemon-cancels-more-sanctioned-events-due-to-coronavirus/|title=Play Pok\u00e9mon cancels more sanctioned events due to coronavirus|date=2020-03-17|website=Daily Esports|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/esports-arena-leagues-shift-online-events-coronavirus-pandemic-1285112|title=Esports Arena: Leagues Shift to Online Events Amid Coronavirus Pandemic|website=The Hollywood Reporter|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Its purpose is to facilitate communication between representatives of different [[Slavs|Slavic nations]], as well as to allow people who do not know any Slavic language to communicate with Slavs. For the latter, it can fulfill an educational role as well.\n\nInterslavic can be classified as a semi-[[constructed language]]. It is essentially a modern continuation of [[Old Church Slavonic]], but also draws on the various improvised language forms Slavs have been using for centuries to communicate with Slavs of other nationalities, for example in multi-Slavic environments and on the Internet, providing them with a scientific base. Thus, both grammar and vocabulary are based on the commonalities between the [[Slavic languages]], and non-Slavic elements are avoided.

In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in [[Orthodox church|Orthodox]] liturgy, where it played a role similar to [[Latin]] in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, [[Proto-Slavic]]. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], its grammar was complex, and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.\n\n=== Early projects ===\nThe first Interslavic grammar, ''Gramat\u00ed\u010dno izk\u00e2zanje ob r\u00faskom jez\u00edku'' by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107]], was written in 1665.<ref>Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, ''\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0431 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0443''.

Kri\u017eani\u0107 used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise ''Politika'' (1663\u20131666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in ''Politika'' are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=\u0418\u0417 \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0413\u0412\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418 \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0418|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKri\u017eani\u0107 was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], had translated the ''Summa Doctrinae Christanae'' by [[Petrus Canisius]] into \"Slovignsky\",<ref>Petrus Canisius, \"Svmma navka christianskoga / sloxena castnim v\u010ditegliem Petrom Kanisiem; tvmacena iz latinskoga jazika v slovignsky, i vtisstena po zapoviedi presuetoga Otca Pape Gregoria Trinaestoga [...] Koie iz Vlasskoga, illi Latinskoga iazika, v Slouignsky Jazik protuma\u010dio iest pop Ssimvn Bvdineo Zadranin\".

In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the [[South Slavic languages]] there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]], that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of [[Matija Majar]] (1809\u20131892), a Slovenian [[Austroslavism|Austroslavist]] who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published [[Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski]] (\"Mutual Slavic Orthography\").<ref name=\"majar\">Matija Majar-Ziljski, ''Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski, to je: Uzajemna Slovnica ali Mluvnica Slavjanska''. Prague, 1865.</ref> In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was by taking their own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic (\"mutual\") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of [[Cyril and Methodius]]<ref name=\"brata\">Matija Majar Ziljski, ''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga''.

The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like [[Esperanto]], efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.<ref name=\"Meyer\" />{{RP|118}}\n\nIn the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands.

It consists of elements that can be encountered in all or at least most of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://izviestija.info/index.php/nauka/195-zalozenja-za-medzuslovjanski-jezyk|title=Zalo\u017ee\u0148ja za med\u017euslovjanski jezyk|publisher=Izviestija.info|accessdate=11 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210133123/http://izviestija.info/index.php/nauka/195-zalozenja-za-medzuslovjanski-jezyk|archive-date=10 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Nouns ===\nInterslavic is an [[inflecting language]]. [[Noun]]s can have three [[gender (grammar)|genders]], two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative]]). Since several Slavic languages also have a [[vocative]], it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThere is no [[article (grammar)|article]]. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five [[declension]]s:\n* masculine nouns (ending in a \u2013 usually hard \u2013 [[consonant]]): ''dom'' \"house\", ''m\u0173\u017e'' \"man\"\n* feminine nouns ending in '''-a''': ''\u017eena'' \"woman\", ''zemja'' \"earth\"\n* feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant: ''kos\u0165'' \"bone\"\n* neuter nouns ending in '''-o''' or '''-e''': ''slovo'' \"word\", ''morje'' \"sea\"\n* Old Church Slavonic also had a consonantal declension that in most Slavic languages merged into the remaining declensions. Some Interslavic projects and writers preserve this declension, which consists of nouns of all three genders, mostly neuters:\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-m\u0119/-men-''': ''im\u0119/imene'' \"name\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-\u0119/-\u0119t-''' (children and young animals): ''tel\u0119/tel\u0119te'' \"calf\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-o/-es-''': ''nebo/nebese'' \"heaven\"\n** masculine nouns of the group '''-en-''': ''kame\u0144/kamene'' \"stone\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-\u00f2v''': ''c\u0155k\u00f2v/c\u0155kve'' \"church\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-i/-er-''': ''mati/matere'' \"mother\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Declension of nouns'''\n! rowspan=\"3\" |&nbsp;!! colspan=\"4\" | masculine !! colspan=\"2\" | neuter !! colspan=\"3\" | feminine !! colspan=\"3\" | consonantal\n|-\n! hard, animate !! hard, non-animate !! soft, animate !! soft, non-animate !! hard !! soft !! -a, hard !! -a, soft !! -\u00d8 !! m. !! n. !! f.\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | singular\n|-\n!

One can write ''dobrego'' instead of ''dobrogo'', ''sv\u011b\u017eogo'' instead of ''sv\u011b\u017eego''.\n\n==== Comparison ====\nThe [[comparative]] is formed with the ending '''-(\u011bj)\u0161i''': ''slab'''\u0161i''''' \"weaker\", ''p\u00f2ln'''\u011bj\u0161i''''' \"fuller\". The [[superlative]] is formed by adding the [[prefix]] '''naj-''' to the comparative: '''''naj'''slab'''\u0161i''''' \"weakest\". Comparatives can also be formed with the adverbs ''bolje'' or ''vy\u0161e'' \"more\", superlatives with the adverbs ''najbolje'' or ''najvy\u0161e'' \"most\".\n\n==== Adverbs ====\nHard adjectives can be turned into an adverb with the ending '''-o''', soft adjectives with the ending '''-e''': ''dobr'''o''''' \"well\", ''sv\u011b\u017e'''e''''' \"freshly\". Comparatives and superlatives can be adverbialized with the ending '''-\u011bje''': ''slab'''\u011bje''''' \"weaker\".\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThe [[personal pronoun]]s are: '''ja''' \"I\", '''ty''' \"you, thou\", '''on''' \"he\", '''ona''' \"she\", '''ono''' \"it\", '''my''' \"we\", '''vy''' \"you\" (pl.), '''oni''' \"they\".

A [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.\n\nVerbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:<br />\n''d\u011blati ~ sd\u011blati'' \"to do\"<br />\n''\u010distiti ~ iz\u010distiti'' \"to clean\"<br />\n''pisati ~ napisati'' \"to write\"<br />\nBecause prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:\n* '''-ati''' becomes '''-yvati''' (e.g. ''zapisati ~ zapisyvati'' \"to note, to register, to record\", ''dokazati ~ dokazyvati'' \"to prove\")\n* '''-iti''' become '''-jati''' (e.g. ''napraviti ~ napravjati'' \"to lead\", ''pozvoliti ~ pozvaljati'' \"to allow\", ''oprostiti ~ opra\u0161\u0107ati'' \"to simplify\")\n\nSome aspect pairs are irregular, for example ''nazvati ~ nazyvati'' \"to name, to call\", ''prijdti ~ prihoditi'' \"to come\", ''podj\u0119ti ~ podimati'' \"to undertake\".\n\n==== Stems ====\nThe Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. To simplify these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal [[stem (linguistics)|stems]]. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:\n* the first stem is used for the [[infinitive]], the [[past tense]], the [[conditional mood]], the [[past passive participle]] and the [[verbal noun]]. It is formed by removing the ending '''-ti''' from the infinitive: ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011bla-'', ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''prosi-'', ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-''. Verbs ending in '''-sti''' can also have their stem ending on '''t''' or '''d''', f.ex. ''vesti > ved-'' \"to lead\", ''gnesti > gnet-'' \"to crush\".\n* the second stem is used for the [[present tense]], the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[present active participle]]. In most cases both stems are identical, and in most of the remaining cases the second stem can be derived regularly from the first. In particular cases they have to be learned separately. In the present tense, a distinction is made between two conjugations:\n** the first conjugation includes almost all verbs that do not have the ending '''-iti''', as well as monosyllabic verbs on '''-iti''':\n*** verbs on '''-ati''' have the stem '''-aj-''': ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011blaj-''\n*** verbs on '''-ovati''' have the stem '''-uj-''': ''kovati'' \"to forge\" > ''kuj-''\n*** verbs on '''-n\u0173ti''' have the stem '''-n-''': ''t\u0119gn\u0173ti'' \"to pull, to draw\" > ''t\u0119gn-''\n*** monosyllabic verbs have '''-j-''': ''piti'' \"to drink\" > ''pij-'', ''\u010duti'' \"to feel\" > ''\u010duj-''\n*** the second stem is identical to the first stem if the latter ends in a consonant: ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-'', ''vesti'' \"to lead\" > ''ved-''\n** the second conjugation includes all polysyllabic verbs on '''-iti''' and most verbs on '''-\u011bti''': ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''pros-i-'', ''vid\u011bti'' \"to see\" > ''vid-i-''\nThere are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: ''pisati'' \"to write\" > ''pi\u0161-'', ''spati'' \"to sleep\" > ''sp-i-'', ''zvati'' \"to call\" > ''zov-'', ''ht\u011bti'' \"to want\" > ''ho\u0107-''. In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.\n\n==== Conjugation ====\nThe various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:\n* ''Present tense'': '''-\u0173, -e\u0161, -e, -emo, -ete, -\u0173t''' (first conjugation); '''-j\u0173, -i\u0161, -i, -imo, -ite, -\u0119t''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past tense \u2013 simple'' (as in Russian): m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li'''\n* ''Past tense \u2013 complex'' (as in South Slavic):\n** ''Imperfect tense'': '''-h, -\u0161e, -\u0161e, -hmo, -ste, -h\u0173'''\n** ''Perfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the present tense of ''byti'' \"to be\"\n** ''Pluperfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the imperfect tense of ''byti''\n* ''Conditional'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the conditional of ''byti''\n* ''Future tense'': the future tense of ''byti'' + the infinitive\n* ''Imperative'': '''-\u00d8, -mo, -te''' after '''j''', or '''-i, -imo, -ite''' after another consonant.\n\nThe forms with '''-l-''' in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the ''L-participle''. The remaining participles are formed as follows:\n* ''Present active participle'': '''-\u0173\u0107i''' (first conjugation), '''-\u0119\u0107i''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Present passive participle'': '''-omy/-emy''' (first conjugation), '''-imy''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past active participle'': '''-v\u0161i''' after a vowel, or '''-\u0161i''' after a consonant\n* ''Past passive participle'': '''-ny''' after a vowel, '''-eny''' after a consonant. Monosyllabic verbs (except for those on '''-ati''') have '''-ty'''. Verbs on '''-iti''' have the ending '''-jeny'''.\n\nThe ''verbal noun'' is based on the past passive participle, replacing the ending '''-ny/-ty''' with '''-nje/-{{Not a typo|tje}}.\n\n==== Examples ====\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''First conjugation''' (''d\u011blati'' \"to do\")\n! !! present !! imperfect !! perfect !! pluperfect !! conditional !! future !! imperative\n|-\n! ja\n| d\u011blaj'''\u0173''' || d\u011bla'''h''' || jesm d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u011bh d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || byh d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u0173d\u0173 d\u011bla'''ti''' || \n|-\n! ty\n| d\u011blaj'''e\u0161''' || d\u011bla'''\u0161e''' || jesi d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || bys d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u0173de\u0161 d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj\n|-\n! on<br />ona<br />ono\n| d\u011blaj'''e''' || d\u011bla'''\u0161e''' || jest d\u011bla'''l'''<br />jest d\u011bla'''la'''<br />jest d\u011bla'''lo''' || b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''l'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''la'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''lo''' || by d\u011bla'''l'''<br />by d\u011bla'''la'''<br />by d\u011bla'''lo''' || b\u0173de d\u011bla'''ti''' ||\n|-\n! my\n| d\u011blaj'''emo''' || d\u011bla'''hmo''' || jesmo d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bhmo d\u011bla'''li''' || byhmo d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173demo d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj'''mo'''\n|-\n! vy\n| d\u011blaj'''ete''' || d\u011bla'''ste''' || jeste d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bste d\u011bla'''li''' || byste d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173dete d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj'''te'''\n|-\n! oni\n| d\u011blaj'''\u0173t''' || d\u011bla'''h\u0173''' || s\u0173t d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bh\u0173 d\u011bla'''li''' || by d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173d\u0173t d\u011bla'''ti''' ||\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! infinitive\n| d\u011bla'''ti'''\n|-\n! present active participle\n| d\u011bla'''j\u0173\u0107-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! present passive participle\n| d\u011bla'''jem-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! past active participle\n| d\u011bla'''v\u0161-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! past passive participle\n| d\u011bla'''n-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! verbal noun\n| d\u011bla'''nje'''\n|}\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Second conjugation''' (''hvaliti'' \"to praise\")\n! !! present !! imperfect !! perfect !! pluperfect !! conditional !! future !! imperative\n|-\n! ja\n| hval'''j\u0173''' || hvali'''h''' || jesm hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u011bh hvali'''l(a)''' || byh hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u0173d\u0173 hvali'''ti''' || \n|-\n! ty\n| hval'''i\u0161''' || hvali'''\u0161e''' || jesi hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''l(a)''' || bys hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u0173de\u0161 hvali'''ti''' || hval'''i'''\n|-\n! on<br />ona<br />ono\n| hval'''i''' || hvali'''\u0161e''' || jest hvali'''l'''<br />jest hvali'''la'''<br />jest hvali'''lo''' || b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''l'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''la'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''lo''' || by hvali'''l'''<br />by hvali'''la'''<br />by hvali'''lo''' || b\u0173de hvali'''ti''' ||\n|-\n! my\n| hval'''imo''' || hvali'''hmo''' || jesmo hvali'''li''' || b\u011bhmo hvali'''li''' || byhmo hvali'''li''' || b\u0173demo hvali'''ti''' || hval'''imo'''\n|-\n! vy\n| hval'''ite''' || hvali'''ste''' || jeste hvali'''li''' || b\u011bste hvali'''li''' || byste hvali'''li''' || b\u0173dete hvali'''ti''' || hval'''ite'''\n|-\n! oni\n| hval'''\u0119t''' || hvali'''h\u0173''' || s\u0173t hvali'''li''' || b\u011bh\u0173 hvali'''li''' || by hvali'''li''' || b\u0173d\u0173t hvali'''ti''' ||\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! infinitive\n| hvali'''ti'''\n|-\n! present active participle\n| hval'''\u0119\u0107-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! present passive participle\n| hval'''im-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! past active participle\n| hval'''iv\u0161-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! past passive participle\n| hval'''jen-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! verbal noun\n| hval'''jenje'''\n|}\n|}\n\nWhenever the stem of a verbs of the second conjugation ends in '''s, z, t, d, st''' or '''zd''', an ending starting '''-j''' causes the following mutations:\n* ''prositi'' \"to require\": ''pros-j\u0173 > pro'''\u0161'''\u0173, pros-jeny > pro'''\u0161'''eny''\n* ''voziti'' \"to transport\": ''voz-j\u0173 > vo'''\u017e'''\u0173, voz-jeny > vo'''\u017e'''eny''\n* ''tratiti'' \"to lose\": ''trat-j\u0173 > tra'''\u0107'''\u0173, trat-jeny > tra'''\u0107'''eny''\n* ''sl\u011bditi'' \"to follow\": ''sl\u011bd-j\u0173 > sl\u011b'''d\u017e'''\u0173, sl\u011bd-jeny > sl\u011b'''d\u017e'''eny''\n* ''\u010distiti'' \"to clean\": ''\u010dist-j\u0173 > \u010di'''\u0161\u0107'''\u0173, \u010dist-jeny > \u010di'''\u0161\u0107'''eny''\n* ''jezditi'' \"to go (by transport)\": ''jezd-j\u0173 > je'''\u017ed\u017e'''\u0173, jezd-jeny > je'''\u017ed\u017e'''eny''\n\n==== Alternative forms ====\nBecause Interslavic is not a highly formalized language, a lot of variation occurs between various forms. Often used are the following alternative forms:\n* In the first conjugation, '''-aje-''' is often reduced to '''-a-''': ''ty d\u011bla\u0161'', ''on d\u011bla'' etc.\n* Instead of the 1st person singular ending '''-(j)\u0173''', the ending '''-(e)m''' is sometimes used as well: ''ja d\u011blam'', ''ja hvalim'', ''ja nesem''.\n* Instead of '''-mo''' in the 1st person plural, '''-me''' can be used as well: ''my d\u011bla(je)me'', ''my hvalime''.\n* Instead of '''-hmo''' in the imperfect tense, '''-smo''' and the more archaic '''-hom''' can be used as well.\n* Instead of the conjugated forms of ''byti'' in the conditional (''byh, bys'' etc.), ''by'' is often used as a [[particle (grammar)|particle]]: ''ja by pisal(a)'', ''ty by pisal(a)'' etc.\n* Verbal nouns can have the ending '''-ije''' instead of '''-je''': ''d\u011blanije'', ''hvaljenije''.\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\nA few verbs have an irregular conjugation:\n* '''byti''' \"to be\" has ''jesm, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, s\u0173t'' in the present tense, ''b\u011bh, b\u011b\u0161e...'' in the imperfect tense, and ''b\u0173d\u0173, b\u0173de\u0161...'' in the future\n* '''dati''' \"to give\", '''j\u011bsti''' \"to eat\" and '''v\u011bd\u011bti''' \"to know\" have the following present tense: ''dam, da\u0161, da, damo, date, dad\u0173t''; ''jem, je\u0161...''; ''v\u011bm, v\u011b\u0161...''\n* '''idti''' \"to go by foot, to walk\" has an irregular L-participle: ''\u0161el, \u0161la, \u0161lo, \u0161li''.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nWords in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages.

Along with this belief came also the need for a Slavic umbrella language. A strong candidate for that position was [[Russian language|Russian]], the language of the largest (and during most of the 19th century the only) Slavic state and also mother tongue of more than half of the Slavs. This option enjoyed most of its popularity in Russia itself, but was also favoured by Pan-Slavists abroad, for example the Slovak [[\u013dudov\u00edt \u0160t\u00far]].<ref name=\"Ruposova\">\u041b.\u041f. \u0420\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430, ''\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043c\u0435\u0436\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u044f\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u044f\u0437\u044b\u043a\u0430'', in: ''\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442\u0430'' (\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0431\u043b\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0443\u043d\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0442, 2012 no. 1, p. 55. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> Others believed that [[Old Church Slavonic]] was a better and also more neutral solution. In previous centuries, this language had served as an administrative language in a large part of the Slavic world, and it was still used on a large scale in [[Orthodox church|Orthodox]] liturgy, where it played a role similar to [[Latin]] in the West. Old Church Slavonic had the additional advantage of being very similar to the common ancestor of the Slavic languages, [[Proto-Slavic]]. However, Old Church Slavonic had several practical disadvantages as well: it was written in a highly archaic form of [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], its grammar was complex, and its vocabulary was characterized by many obsolete words as well as the absence of words for modern concepts. Hence, early examples of Pan-Slavic language projects were aimed at modernizing Old Church Slavonic and adapting it to the needs of everyday communication.\n\n=== Early projects ===\nThe first Interslavic grammar, ''Gramat\u00ed\u010dno izk\u00e2zanje ob r\u00faskom jez\u00edku'' by the Croatian priest [[Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107]], was written in 1665.<ref>Juraj Kri\u017eani\u0107, ''\u0413\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e \u0438\u0437\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0458\u0435 \u043e\u0431 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c \u0458\u0435\u0437\u0438\u043a\u0443''. Moscow, 1665.</ref> He referred to the language as '''Ruski''', but in reality it was mostly based on a mixture of the Russian edition of [[Church Slavonic]] and his own [[Ikavian \u010cakavian]] dialect of [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. Kri\u017eani\u0107 used it not only for this grammar, but also in other works, including the treatise ''Politika'' (1663\u20131666). According to an analysis of the Dutch Slavist Tom Ekman, 59% of the words used in ''Politika'' are of common Slavic descent, 10% come from Russian and Church Slavonic, 9% from Croatian and 2.5% from Polish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miresperanto.com/esperantologio/interlingv_mysl.htm|title=\u0418\u0417 \u0418\u0421\u0422\u041e\u0420\u0418\u0418 \u0418\u041d\u0422\u0415\u0420\u041b\u0418\u041d\u0413\u0412\u0418\u0421\u0422\u0418\u0427\u0415\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u041c\u042b\u0421\u041b\u0418 \u0412 \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0418|publisher=Miresperanto.com|accessdate=11 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nKri\u017eani\u0107 was not the first who attempted writing in a language understandable to all Slavs. In 1583 another Croatian priest, [[\u0160ime Budini\u0107]], had translated the ''Summa Doctrinae Christanae'' by [[Petrus Canisius]] into \"Slovignsky\",<ref>Petrus Canisius, \"Svmma navka christianskoga / sloxena castnim v\u010ditegliem Petrom Kanisiem; tvmacena iz latinskoga jazika v slovignsky, i vtisstena po zapoviedi presuetoga Otca Pape Gregoria Trinaestoga [...] Koie iz Vlasskoga, illi Latinskoga iazika, v Slouignsky Jazik protuma\u010dio iest pop Ssimvn Bvdineo Zadranin\".

Vienna, 1826. {{in lang|sk}}</ref> Unlike Kri\u017eani\u0107' project, this project was closer to the [[West Slavic languages]].\n\nDuring the second half of the 19th century Pan-Slavic language projects were mostly the domain of Slovenes and Croats. In this era of awakening national consciousness, the Russians were the only Slavs who had their own state; other Slavic peoples inhabited large, mostly non-Slavic states, and clear borders between the various nations were mostly lacking. Among the numerous efforts at creating written standards for the [[South Slavic languages]] there were also efforts at establishing a common South Slavic language, [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]], that might also serve as a literary language for all Slavs in the future. Of special importance is the work of [[Matija Majar]] (1809\u20131892), a Slovenian [[Austroslavism|Austroslavist]] who later converted to Pan-Slavism. In 1865 he published [[Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski]] (\"Mutual Slavic Orthography\").<ref name=\"majar\">Matija Majar-Ziljski, ''Uzajemni Pravopis Slavjanski, to je: Uzajemna Slovnica ali Mluvnica Slavjanska''. Prague, 1865.</ref> In this work, he postulated that the best way for Slavs to communicate with other Slavs was by taking their own language as a starting point and then modifying it in steps. First, he proposed changing the orthography of each individual language into a generic (\"mutual\") Pan-Slavic orthography, subsequently he described a grammar that was based on comparing the five major Slavic languages of his days: Old Church Slavonic, Russian, Polish, Czech and Serbian. Apart from a book about the language itself, Majar also used it for a biography of [[Cyril and Methodius]]<ref name=\"brata\">Matija Majar Ziljski, ''Sveta brata Ciril i Metod, slavjanska apostola i osnovatelja slovstva slavjanskoga''. Prague, 1864.</ref> and for a magazine he published in the years 1873\u20131875, ''Slavjan''.

They deplored the fact that these dialects had diverged beyond mutual comprehensibility, and the Pan-Slavic language they envisioned was intended to reverse this process. Their long-term objective was that this language would replace the individual Slavic languages.<ref name=\"Meyer\">{{cite book |author=Anna-Maria Meyer |date=2014 |title=Wiederbelebung einer Utopie.

Many modern educated nations, for example the French, the Italians, the English and the Germans, have a higher number of more divergent dialects and subdialects than we Slavs, and yet they have one single literary language.

In most cases they provided grammatical comparisons between the Slavic languages, sometimes but not always offering solutions they labelled as \"Pan-Slavic\". What their projects have in common that they neither have a rigidly prescriptive grammar, nor a separate vocabulary.\n\n=== The twentieth century ===\n[[File:Bohumil Holy.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Bohumil Hol\u00fd]]<br />(1885\u20131947)]]\nIn the early 20th century it had become clear that the divergence of the Slavic languages was irreversible and the concept of a Pan-Slavic literary language was no longer realistic. The Pan-Slavic dream had lost most of its power, and Pan-Slavists had to satisfy themselves with the formation of two multinational Slavic states, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Yugoslavia]]. However, the need for a common language of communication for Slavs was still felt, and due to the influence of constructed languages like [[Esperanto]], efforts were made to create a language that was no longer supposed to replace the individual Slavic languages, but to serve as an additional second language for Interslavic communication.<ref name=\"Meyer\" />{{RP|118}}\n\nIn the same period, the nexus of Interslavic activity shifted to the North, especially to the Czech lands. In 1907 the Czech dialectologist [[Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek]] (1852\u20131919) published a grammar of '''Neuslavisch''', a proposal for a common literary language for all Slavs within the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]].<ref>Ign\u00e1c Ho\u0161ek, ''Grammatik der Neuslawischen Sprache''.

[[Noun]]s can have three [[gender (grammar)|genders]], two numbers (singular and plural), as well as six [[grammatical case|cases]] ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative]], [[instrumental case|instrumental]] and [[locative]]). Since several Slavic languages also have a [[vocative]], it is usually displayed in tables as well, even though strictly speaking the vocative is not a case. It occurs only in the singular of masculine and feminine nouns.\n\nThere is no [[article (grammar)|article]]. The complicated system of noun classes in Slavic has been reduced to four or five [[declension]]s:\n* masculine nouns (ending in a \u2013 usually hard \u2013 [[consonant]]): ''dom'' \"house\", ''m\u0173\u017e'' \"man\"\n* feminine nouns ending in '''-a''': ''\u017eena'' \"woman\", ''zemja'' \"earth\"\n* feminine nouns ending in a soft consonant: ''kos\u0165'' \"bone\"\n* neuter nouns ending in '''-o''' or '''-e''': ''slovo'' \"word\", ''morje'' \"sea\"\n* Old Church Slavonic also had a consonantal declension that in most Slavic languages merged into the remaining declensions. Some Interslavic projects and writers preserve this declension, which consists of nouns of all three genders, mostly neuters:\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-m\u0119/-men-''': ''im\u0119/imene'' \"name\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-\u0119/-\u0119t-''' (children and young animals): ''tel\u0119/tel\u0119te'' \"calf\"\n** neuter nouns of the group '''-o/-es-''': ''nebo/nebese'' \"heaven\"\n** masculine nouns of the group '''-en-''': ''kame\u0144/kamene'' \"stone\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-\u00f2v''': ''c\u0155k\u00f2v/c\u0155kve'' \"church\"\n** feminine nouns with the ending '''-i/-er-''': ''mati/matere'' \"mother\"\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Declension of nouns'''\n! rowspan=\"3\" |&nbsp;!! colspan=\"4\" | masculine !! colspan=\"2\" | neuter !! colspan=\"3\" | feminine !! colspan=\"3\" | consonantal\n|-\n! hard, animate !! hard, non-animate !! soft, animate !! soft, non-animate !! hard !! soft !! -a, hard !! -a, soft !! -\u00d8 !! m. !! n. !! f.\n|-\n! colspan=\"12\" | singular\n|-\n!

A [[perfective aspect|perfective]] verb indicates an action that has been or will be completed and therefore emphasizes the result of the action rather than its course. On the other hand, an [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] verb focuses on the course or duration of the action, and is also used for expressing habits and repeating patterns.\n\nVerbs without a prefix are usually imperfective. Most imperfective verbs have a perfective counterpart, which in most cases is formed by adding a prefix:<br />\n''d\u011blati ~ sd\u011blati'' \"to do\"<br />\n''\u010distiti ~ iz\u010distiti'' \"to clean\"<br />\n''pisati ~ napisati'' \"to write\"<br />\nBecause prefixes are also used to change the meaning of a verb, secondary imperfective forms based on perfective verbs with a prefix are needed as well. These verbs are formed regularly:\n* '''-ati''' becomes '''-yvati''' (e.g. ''zapisati ~ zapisyvati'' \"to note, to register, to record\", ''dokazati ~ dokazyvati'' \"to prove\")\n* '''-iti''' become '''-jati''' (e.g. ''napraviti ~ napravjati'' \"to lead\", ''pozvoliti ~ pozvaljati'' \"to allow\", ''oprostiti ~ opra\u0161\u0107ati'' \"to simplify\")\n\nSome aspect pairs are irregular, for example ''nazvati ~ nazyvati'' \"to name, to call\", ''prijdti ~ prihoditi'' \"to come\", ''podj\u0119ti ~ podimati'' \"to undertake\".\n\n==== Stems ====\nThe Slavic languages are notorious for their complicated [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. To simplify these, Interslavic has a system of two conjugations and two verbal [[stem (linguistics)|stems]]. In most cases, knowing the infinitive is enough to establish both stems:\n* the first stem is used for the [[infinitive]], the [[past tense]], the [[conditional mood]], the [[past passive participle]] and the [[verbal noun]]. It is formed by removing the ending '''-ti''' from the infinitive: ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011bla-'', ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''prosi-'', ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-''. Verbs ending in '''-sti''' can also have their stem ending on '''t''' or '''d''', f.ex. ''vesti > ved-'' \"to lead\", ''gnesti > gnet-'' \"to crush\".\n* the second stem is used for the [[present tense]], the [[imperative mood|imperative]] and the [[present active participle]]. In most cases both stems are identical, and in most of the remaining cases the second stem can be derived regularly from the first. In particular cases they have to be learned separately. In the present tense, a distinction is made between two conjugations:\n** the first conjugation includes almost all verbs that do not have the ending '''-iti''', as well as monosyllabic verbs on '''-iti''':\n*** verbs on '''-ati''' have the stem '''-aj-''': ''d\u011blati'' \"to do\" > ''d\u011blaj-''\n*** verbs on '''-ovati''' have the stem '''-uj-''': ''kovati'' \"to forge\" > ''kuj-''\n*** verbs on '''-n\u0173ti''' have the stem '''-n-''': ''t\u0119gn\u0173ti'' \"to pull, to draw\" > ''t\u0119gn-''\n*** monosyllabic verbs have '''-j-''': ''piti'' \"to drink\" > ''pij-'', ''\u010duti'' \"to feel\" > ''\u010duj-''\n*** the second stem is identical to the first stem if the latter ends in a consonant: ''nesti'' \"to carry\" > ''nes-'', ''vesti'' \"to lead\" > ''ved-''\n** the second conjugation includes all polysyllabic verbs on '''-iti''' and most verbs on '''-\u011bti''': ''prositi'' \"to require\" > ''pros-i-'', ''vid\u011bti'' \"to see\" > ''vid-i-''\nThere are also mixed and irregular verbs, i.e. verbs with a second stem that cannot be derived regularly from the first stem, for example: ''pisati'' \"to write\" > ''pi\u0161-'', ''spati'' \"to sleep\" > ''sp-i-'', ''zvati'' \"to call\" > ''zov-'', ''ht\u011bti'' \"to want\" > ''ho\u0107-''. In these cases both stem have to be learned separately.\n\n==== Conjugation ====\nThe various moods and tenses are formed by means of the following endings:\n* ''Present tense'': '''-\u0173, -e\u0161, -e, -emo, -ete, -\u0173t''' (first conjugation); '''-j\u0173, -i\u0161, -i, -imo, -ite, -\u0119t''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past tense \u2013 simple'' (as in Russian): m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li'''\n* ''Past tense \u2013 complex'' (as in South Slavic):\n** ''Imperfect tense'': '''-h, -\u0161e, -\u0161e, -hmo, -ste, -h\u0173'''\n** ''Perfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the present tense of ''byti'' \"to be\"\n** ''Pluperfect tense'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the imperfect tense of ''byti''\n* ''Conditional'': m. '''-l''', f. '''-la''', n. '''-lo''', pl. '''-li''' + the conditional of ''byti''\n* ''Future tense'': the future tense of ''byti'' + the infinitive\n* ''Imperative'': '''-\u00d8, -mo, -te''' after '''j''', or '''-i, -imo, -ite''' after another consonant.\n\nThe forms with '''-l-''' in the past tense and the conditional are actually participles known as the ''L-participle''. The remaining participles are formed as follows:\n* ''Present active participle'': '''-\u0173\u0107i''' (first conjugation), '''-\u0119\u0107i''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Present passive participle'': '''-omy/-emy''' (first conjugation), '''-imy''' (second conjugation)\n* ''Past active participle'': '''-v\u0161i''' after a vowel, or '''-\u0161i''' after a consonant\n* ''Past passive participle'': '''-ny''' after a vowel, '''-eny''' after a consonant. Monosyllabic verbs (except for those on '''-ati''') have '''-ty'''. Verbs on '''-iti''' have the ending '''-jeny'''.\n\nThe ''verbal noun'' is based on the past passive participle, replacing the ending '''-ny/-ty''' with '''-nje/-{{Not a typo|tje}}.\n\n==== Examples ====\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''First conjugation''' (''d\u011blati'' \"to do\")\n! !! present !! imperfect !! perfect !! pluperfect !! conditional !! future !! imperative\n|-\n! ja\n| d\u011blaj'''\u0173''' || d\u011bla'''h''' || jesm d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u011bh d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || byh d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u0173d\u0173 d\u011bla'''ti''' || \n|-\n! ty\n| d\u011blaj'''e\u0161''' || d\u011bla'''\u0161e''' || jesi d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || bys d\u011bla'''l(a)''' || b\u0173de\u0161 d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj\n|-\n! on<br />ona<br />ono\n| d\u011blaj'''e''' || d\u011bla'''\u0161e''' || jest d\u011bla'''l'''<br />jest d\u011bla'''la'''<br />jest d\u011bla'''lo''' || b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''l'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''la'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e d\u011bla'''lo''' || by d\u011bla'''l'''<br />by d\u011bla'''la'''<br />by d\u011bla'''lo''' || b\u0173de d\u011bla'''ti''' ||\n|-\n! my\n| d\u011blaj'''emo''' || d\u011bla'''hmo''' || jesmo d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bhmo d\u011bla'''li''' || byhmo d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173demo d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj'''mo'''\n|-\n! vy\n| d\u011blaj'''ete''' || d\u011bla'''ste''' || jeste d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bste d\u011bla'''li''' || byste d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173dete d\u011bla'''ti''' || d\u011blaj'''te'''\n|-\n! oni\n| d\u011blaj'''\u0173t''' || d\u011bla'''h\u0173''' || s\u0173t d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u011bh\u0173 d\u011bla'''li''' || by d\u011bla'''li''' || b\u0173d\u0173t d\u011bla'''ti''' ||\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! infinitive\n| d\u011bla'''ti'''\n|-\n! present active participle\n| d\u011bla'''j\u0173\u0107-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! present passive participle\n| d\u011bla'''jem-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! past active participle\n| d\u011bla'''v\u0161-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! past passive participle\n| d\u011bla'''n-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! verbal noun\n| d\u011bla'''nje'''\n|}\n|}\n\n{|\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ '''Second conjugation''' (''hvaliti'' \"to praise\")\n! !! present !! imperfect !! perfect !! pluperfect !! conditional !! future !! imperative\n|-\n! ja\n| hval'''j\u0173''' || hvali'''h''' || jesm hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u011bh hvali'''l(a)''' || byh hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u0173d\u0173 hvali'''ti''' || \n|-\n! ty\n| hval'''i\u0161''' || hvali'''\u0161e''' || jesi hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''l(a)''' || bys hvali'''l(a)''' || b\u0173de\u0161 hvali'''ti''' || hval'''i'''\n|-\n! on<br />ona<br />ono\n| hval'''i''' || hvali'''\u0161e''' || jest hvali'''l'''<br />jest hvali'''la'''<br />jest hvali'''lo''' || b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''l'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''la'''<br />b\u011b\u0161e hvali'''lo''' || by hvali'''l'''<br />by hvali'''la'''<br />by hvali'''lo''' || b\u0173de hvali'''ti''' ||\n|-\n! my\n| hval'''imo''' || hvali'''hmo''' || jesmo hvali'''li''' || b\u011bhmo hvali'''li''' || byhmo hvali'''li''' || b\u0173demo hvali'''ti''' || hval'''imo'''\n|-\n! vy\n| hval'''ite''' || hvali'''ste''' || jeste hvali'''li''' || b\u011bste hvali'''li''' || byste hvali'''li''' || b\u0173dete hvali'''ti''' || hval'''ite'''\n|-\n! oni\n| hval'''\u0119t''' || hvali'''h\u0173''' || s\u0173t hvali'''li''' || b\u011bh\u0173 hvali'''li''' || by hvali'''li''' || b\u0173d\u0173t hvali'''ti''' ||\n|}\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! infinitive\n| hvali'''ti'''\n|-\n! present active participle\n| hval'''\u0119\u0107-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! present passive participle\n| hval'''im-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! past active participle\n| hval'''iv\u0161-i''' ('''-a, -e''')\n|-\n! past passive participle\n| hval'''jen-y''' ('''-a, -o''')\n|-\n! verbal noun\n| hval'''jenje'''\n|}\n|}\n\nWhenever the stem of a verbs of the second conjugation ends in '''s, z, t, d, st''' or '''zd''', an ending starting '''-j''' causes the following mutations:\n* ''prositi'' \"to require\": ''pros-j\u0173 > pro'''\u0161'''\u0173, pros-jeny > pro'''\u0161'''eny''\n* ''voziti'' \"to transport\": ''voz-j\u0173 > vo'''\u017e'''\u0173, voz-jeny > vo'''\u017e'''eny''\n* ''tratiti'' \"to lose\": ''trat-j\u0173 > tra'''\u0107'''\u0173, trat-jeny > tra'''\u0107'''eny''\n* ''sl\u011bditi'' \"to follow\": ''sl\u011bd-j\u0173 > sl\u011b'''d\u017e'''\u0173, sl\u011bd-jeny > sl\u011b'''d\u017e'''eny''\n* ''\u010distiti'' \"to clean\": ''\u010dist-j\u0173 > \u010di'''\u0161\u0107'''\u0173, \u010dist-jeny > \u010di'''\u0161\u0107'''eny''\n* ''jezditi'' \"to go (by transport)\": ''jezd-j\u0173 > je'''\u017ed\u017e'''\u0173, jezd-jeny > je'''\u017ed\u017e'''eny''\n\n==== Alternative forms ====\nBecause Interslavic is not a highly formalized language, a lot of variation occurs between various forms. Often used are the following alternative forms:\n* In the first conjugation, '''-aje-''' is often reduced to '''-a-''': ''ty d\u011bla\u0161'', ''on d\u011bla'' etc.\n* Instead of the 1st person singular ending '''-(j)\u0173''', the ending '''-(e)m''' is sometimes used as well: ''ja d\u011blam'', ''ja hvalim'', ''ja nesem''.\n* Instead of '''-mo''' in the 1st person plural, '''-me''' can be used as well: ''my d\u011bla(je)me'', ''my hvalime''.\n* Instead of '''-hmo''' in the imperfect tense, '''-smo''' and the more archaic '''-hom''' can be used as well.\n* Instead of the conjugated forms of ''byti'' in the conditional (''byh, bys'' etc.), ''by'' is often used as a [[particle (grammar)|particle]]: ''ja by pisal(a)'', ''ty by pisal(a)'' etc.\n* Verbal nouns can have the ending '''-ije''' instead of '''-je''': ''d\u011blanije'', ''hvaljenije''.\n\n==== Irregular verbs ====\nA few verbs have an irregular conjugation:\n* '''byti''' \"to be\" has ''jesm, jesi, jest, jesmo, jeste, s\u0173t'' in the present tense, ''b\u011bh, b\u011b\u0161e...'' in the imperfect tense, and ''b\u0173d\u0173, b\u0173de\u0161...'' in the future\n* '''dati''' \"to give\", '''j\u011bsti''' \"to eat\" and '''v\u011bd\u011bti''' \"to know\" have the following present tense: ''dam, da\u0161, da, damo, date, dad\u0173t''; ''jem, je\u0161...''; ''v\u011bm, v\u011b\u0161...''\n* '''idti''' \"to go by foot, to walk\" has an irregular L-participle: ''\u0161el, \u0161la, \u0161lo, \u0161li''.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nWords in Interslavic are based on comparison of the vocabulary of the modern Slavic languages. For this purpose, the latter are subdivided into six groups:\n* [[Russian language|Russian]]\n* [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]\n* [[Polish language|Polish]]\n* [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]\n* [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Croatian language|Croat]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]\n* [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]\n\nThese groups are treated equally. In some situations even smaller languages, like [[Kashubian language|Cashubian]], [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]] and [[Sorbian languages]] are included.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/voting_machine.html|title=Voting Machine|website=steen.free.fr|accessdate=October 21, 2019}}</ref> Interslavic vocabulary has been compiled in such way that words are understandable to a maximum number of Slavic speakers. The form in which a chosen word is adopted depends not only on its frequency in the modern Slavic languages, but also on the inner logic of Interslavic, as well as its form in [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]]: to ensure coherence, a system of regular [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is applied.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://steen.free.fr/interslavic/design_criteria.html#vocabulary|title=Vocabulary|publisher=Steen.free.fr|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" WIDTH=100% BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=\"#000000\" CELLPADDING=4 CELLSPACING=0 VALIGN=TOP STYLE=\"font-size:80%\"\n|+ <big>Sample words in Interslavic, compared to other Slavic languages</big>\n!
