According to the Liaison Office's website, the office's official functions are the following:<ref>{{cite book|page=247|title= Report to Congress of the U.

It followed the Xinhua to promote the [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|united front]] and coordinate pro-Beijing camp, mobilising supporters to vote for \"patriotic\" political parties and clandestinely orchestrating electoral campaigns.\n\nIn late 2001, the Liaison Office coordinated and mobilised support among pro-Beijing elites for [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] to run for another term of office. [[Jiang Enzhu]], director of the Liaison Office and [[Gao Siren]] openly supported Tung. A Hong Kong representative of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) expressed he felt pressured to join the campaign otherwise his non-cooperation would be reported to the Liaison Office.<ref>{{cite book|page=213|title=Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong|first=Christine|last=Loh|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Liaison Office was criticised for meddling in the [[National People's Congress election, 2002 (Hong Kong)|election of the Hong Kong deputies]] to the [[10th National People's Congress]] (NPC). It was accused of issuing a recommendation list to the electors before the election. [[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]] of the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] criticised the Liaison Office for circulating the recommendation lists, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Martin Lee]] viewed it as a \"shadow government\" meddling in elections in all levels, including the Chief Executive elections, coordinating with pro-Beijing parties in Legislative Council and District Council elections, and raising funds for the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB).<ref>{{cite book|page=193|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Liaison Office led by Gao Siren backed the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] government to push forward the controversial legislation of the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security bill]] as stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]]. It was criticised for its failure in reporting to Beijing accurately the massive discontent toward the Tung regime and failure in predicting the unprecedented [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|2003 July 1 massive demonstration]] against the national security bill. It was said that the Liaison Office was too close to the pro-Beijing Hong Kong elites and naturally provided over-positive reports on the HKSAR to Beijing.<ref>{{cite book|page=49|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>  As a result, the central government removed and replaced a number of deputy directors of the Liaison Office.

It adopted a hard-line policy toward the democrats. In the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 Legislative Council election]], the Liaison Office mobilised the members of the pro-Beijing interest groups and housing associations, including the [[Hokkien]] community, to support and vote for the DAB and the [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]] (FTU) candidates.<ref>{{cite book|page=58|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nBeijing also strengthened the Liaison Office to influence day-to-day affairs in Hong Kong and effectively operated as a \"second government\" in Hong Kong, reviewing and approving all potential candidates in the elections. Cao Erbao, director of the Liaison Office's Research Department who coined the \"second government\" concept, wrote that Hong Kong went from being ruled by one entity to being ruled by two: the Hong Kong government and \"a team of Central and Mainland authorities carrying out Hong Kong work.\"<ref>{{cite book|pages=246\u20137|title= Report to Congress of the U.

The Liaison Office was accused of lobbying the 60 members of the Agriculture and Fisheries Subsector to nominate Leung in order to enter the race. It was reported that the Liaison Office pressured the pro-Beijing members of the Legislative Council, including [[Jeffrey Lam]], [[Andrew Leung]], [[Sophie Lau]] and [[Abraham Shek]] who nominated [[Henry Tang]], Leung's main rival, not to support pan-democrats' motion of setting up a commission to investigate Leung Chun-ying's conflict of interest scandal in the [[West Kowloon Cultural District]] project.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u4e2d\u806f\u8fa6\u529b\u963b\u300a\u7279\u6b0a\u6cd5\u300b\u67e5\u632f\u82f1|url=https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E4%B8%AD%E8%81%AF%E8%BE%A6%E5%8A%9B%E9%98%BB-%E7%89%B9%E6%AC%8A%E6%B3%95-%E6%9F%A5%E6%8C%AF%E8%8B%B1-220835007.html|date=25 February 2012|newspaper=Sing Tao Daily}}</ref> Cao Erbao reportedly telephoning and pressing Prof [[Gabriel Leung]], the Director of the [[Office of the Chief Executive]] to slow a conflict of interest investigation in the  project that threatened to case Leung in a bad light. This allegation sparked a controversy in which the pan-democracy camp and business community condemned the Liaison Office of meddling into Hong Kong domestic affairs. The pan-democrat Election Committee members held a slogan of \"No to Sai Wan ruling Hong Kong\" in the polling station on the election day, in which the term was popularised in the following years. Leung Chun-ying was also criticised of undermining the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle when he made a high-profile visit to the Liaison Office a day after his victory.<ref>{{cite book|pages=70\u20131|title=Introduction to the Hong Kong Basic Law|first=Danny|last=Gittings|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 Legislative Council election]], various candidates including [[Priscilla Leung]] and [[Paul Tse]] were alleged of being backed by the Liaison Office.

The term \"Sai Wan Party\" also became popular during the election, when several pro-Beijing candidates, including Priscilla Leung, Paul Tse, [[Regina Ip]], [[Junius Ho]] and [[Eunice Yung]] were perceived backed by the Liaison Office, all of whom were elected with Liaison Office's supports.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20161012-xi-may-want-leung-and-liaison-office-to-pay-for-the-hk-mess/|title=Xi may want Leung and Liaison Office to pay for HK mess|date=12 October 2016|work=ejinsight.com}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the end of August 2016, ''[[Sing Pao Daily News]]'', which is known to be pro-Beijing, has been running anonymous critiques of [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] and the Liaison Office.

It followed the Xinhua to promote the [[pro-Beijing camp|pro-Beijing]] [[United Front (People's Republic of China)|united front]] and coordinate pro-Beijing camp, mobilising supporters to vote for \"patriotic\" political parties and clandestinely orchestrating electoral campaigns.\n\nIn late 2001, the Liaison Office coordinated and mobilised support among pro-Beijing elites for [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] to run for another term of office. [[Jiang Enzhu]], director of the Liaison Office and [[Gao Siren]] openly supported Tung. A Hong Kong representative of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (CPPCC) expressed he felt pressured to join the campaign otherwise his non-cooperation would be reported to the Liaison Office.<ref>{{cite book|page=213|title=Underground Front: The Chinese Communist Party in Hong Kong|first=Christine|last=Loh|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Liaison Office was criticised for meddling in the [[National People's Congress election, 2002 (Hong Kong)|election of the Hong Kong deputies]] to the [[10th National People's Congress]] (NPC).

[[James Tien (politician)|James Tien]] of the [[Liberal Party (Hong Kong)|Liberal Party]] criticised the Liaison Office for circulating the recommendation lists, the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Martin Lee]] viewed it as a \"shadow government\" meddling in elections in all levels, including the Chief Executive elections, coordinating with pro-Beijing parties in Legislative Council and District Council elections, and raising funds for the [[Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong]] (DAB).<ref>{{cite book|page=193|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Liaison Office led by Gao Siren backed the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Tung Chee-hwa]] government to push forward the controversial legislation of the [[National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003|national security bill]] as stipulated in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23]]. It was criticised for its failure in reporting to Beijing accurately the massive discontent toward the Tung regime and failure in predicting the unprecedented [[Hong Kong 1 July marches#2003|2003 July 1 massive demonstration]] against the national security bill. It was said that the Liaison Office was too close to the pro-Beijing Hong Kong elites and naturally provided over-positive reports on the HKSAR to Beijing.<ref>{{cite book|page=49|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>  As a result, the central government removed and replaced a number of deputy directors of the Liaison Office.

It adopted a hard-line policy toward the democrats. In the [[2004 Hong Kong legislative election|2004 Legislative Council election]], the Liaison Office mobilised the members of the pro-Beijing interest groups and housing associations, including the [[Hokkien]] community, to support and vote for the DAB and the [[Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions]] (FTU) candidates.<ref>{{cite book|page=58|title=The Dynamics of Beijing-Hong Kong Relations: A Model for Taiwan?|first=Sonny Shiu-hing|last=Lo|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nBeijing also strengthened the Liaison Office to influence day-to-day affairs in Hong Kong and effectively operated as a \"second government\" in Hong Kong, reviewing and approving all potential candidates in the elections. Cao Erbao, director of the Liaison Office's Research Department who coined the \"second government\" concept, wrote that Hong Kong went from being ruled by one entity to being ruled by two: the Hong Kong government and \"a team of Central and Mainland authorities carrying out Hong Kong work.\"<ref>{{cite book|pages=246\u20137|title= Report to Congress of the U.

The Liaison Office was accused of lobbying the 60 members of the Agriculture and Fisheries Subsector to nominate Leung in order to enter the race. It was reported that the Liaison Office pressured the pro-Beijing members of the Legislative Council, including [[Jeffrey Lam]], [[Andrew Leung]], [[Sophie Lau]] and [[Abraham Shek]] who nominated [[Henry Tang]], Leung's main rival, not to support pan-democrats' motion of setting up a commission to investigate Leung Chun-ying's conflict of interest scandal in the [[West Kowloon Cultural District]] project.<ref>{{cite news|title=\u4e2d\u806f\u8fa6\u529b\u963b\u300a\u7279\u6b0a\u6cd5\u300b\u67e5\u632f\u82f1|url=https://hk.news.yahoo.com/%E4%B8%AD%E8%81%AF%E8%BE%A6%E5%8A%9B%E9%98%BB-%E7%89%B9%E6%AC%8A%E6%B3%95-%E6%9F%A5%E6%8C%AF%E8%8B%B1-220835007.html|date=25 February 2012|newspaper=Sing Tao Daily}}</ref> Cao Erbao reportedly telephoning and pressing Prof [[Gabriel Leung]], the Director of the [[Office of the Chief Executive]] to slow a conflict of interest investigation in the  project that threatened to case Leung in a bad light.

The pan-democrat Election Committee members held a slogan of \"No to Sai Wan ruling Hong Kong\" in the polling station on the election day, in which the term was popularised in the following years. Leung Chun-ying was also criticised of undermining the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle when he made a high-profile visit to the Liaison Office a day after his victory.<ref>{{cite book|pages=70\u20131|title=Introduction to the Hong Kong Basic Law|first=Danny|last=Gittings|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2012 Hong Kong legislative election|2012 Legislative Council election]], various candidates including [[Priscilla Leung]] and [[Paul Tse]] were alleged of being backed by the Liaison Office.

The term \"Sai Wan Party\" also became popular during the election, when several pro-Beijing candidates, including Priscilla Leung, Paul Tse, [[Regina Ip]], [[Junius Ho]] and [[Eunice Yung]] were perceived backed by the Liaison Office, all of whom were elected with Liaison Office's supports.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20161012-xi-may-want-leung-and-liaison-office-to-pay-for-the-hk-mess/|title=Xi may want Leung and Liaison Office to pay for HK mess|date=12 October 2016|work=ejinsight.com}}</ref>\n\nStarting from the end of August 2016, ''[[Sing Pao Daily News]]'', which is known to be pro-Beijing, has been running anonymous critiques of [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]] [[Leung Chun-ying]] and the Liaison Office.
