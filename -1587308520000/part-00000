It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty.

It was released on November 6, 2013, by Streamline and [[Interscope Records]]. Gaga began planning the project in 2011, shortly after the launch of her second effort, ''[[Born This Way (album)|Born This Way]]''. Work continued until 2013 while the singer was traveling for her [[Born This Way Ball]] concert tour and recovering from surgery for an injury she had sustained while touring. Gaga described ''Artpop'' as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse [[Warholian]]\" phenomenon in [[Popular culture|pop culture]]. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of ''Born This Way''. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including [[DJ White Shadow]], [[RedOne]], [[Zedd (musician)|Zedd]] and [[Madeon]]. Lyrically, ''Artpop'' revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]]. It also features guest vocals from [[T.I.]], [[Too Short]], [[Twista]], and [[R. Kelly]]. Kelly's featured song, \"[[Do What U Want]]\", was removed from all streaming and online versions of the album in January 2019, and was removed from new vinyl and CD pressings of the album in November 2019, as a reaction to the documentary ''[[Surviving R. Kelly]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cirisano|first=Tatiana|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8533062/lady-gaga-artpop-without-r-kelly-do-what-u-want|title=Lady Gaga Lists New 'ARTPOP' Version Without R.

While the album received generally mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], it was commercially successful, debuting at number one on the United States' [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country. It also topped national [[record chart]]s in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. According to the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), ''Artpop'' was the ninth global best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"IFPI 1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/downloads/Digital-Music-Report-2014.pdf|title=Global Music Report 2014|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014|page=12}}</ref> The album sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014.

There's a transcendence that takes place and eventually it really leads you to everything. So that aspect's there. But I didn't want Gaga there just kind of isolated, so in the background there's [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|[Gian Lorenzo] Bernini]]'s '[[Apollo and Daphne (Bernini)|Apollo and Daphne]]' \u2014 and that's the work where [[Apollo]] chases [[Daphne]] and she turns into a tree. And so there's just glimpses of Daphne's face and of Apollo. Apollo is the god of music and whenever Apollo would perform music he would transcend, he would change; his being would become more feminine. And that's the transcendence that you can experience through art and life. Your being can change, your possibilities can change, your perimeters can change. And also in [these] triangular shapes that go out is [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]]'s ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', presenting Gaga of course in the role of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] \u2014 of the nature of the continuation of life's energy and the pursuit and the enjoyment of aesthetics and of beauty. And of the desire to continually have transcendence.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Ehrlich|first=Brenna|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|title=Lady Gaga's ARTPOP Cover: Artist Jeff Koons Explains What It All Means - Music, Celebrity, Artist News|publisher=MTV News|date=November 11, 2013|accessdate=November 11, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213155629/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1717125/lady-gaga-artpop-album-art-jeff-koons.jhtml|archivedate=February 13, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>}}\n\nWill Gompertz from ''[[NME]]'' wrote that \"this is a classic cover.

The film was a critical and commercial  failure.\n\n==Plot==\nIn the far future, three humans\u2014Jiro, Harvey, and Mary\u2014discover that an alien race called the Pasateli intends to conquer humankind by the mysterious \"Cleopatra plan\". Through the use of a time machine, the three transport their minds into the bodies of members of the historical Cleopatra's court to discover and stop the plan. Harvey, however, vows to use the opportunity to secure the title of the greatest lover who ever lived by having sex with Cleopatra.\n\nIn the middle of the Roman conquest of Egypt, a group of Egyptians secretly plot a rebellion to overthrow [[Julius Caesar]]. The group plans to send Cleopatra to first seduce and then murder Caesar. The Romans discover the group and attack them. Cleopatra escapes, along with her handmaidens Lybia and Apollodoria. Cleopatra goes to an ancient wizard, who magically grants her an irresistibly seductive body for her mission.\n\nIt is at this point that the Jiro, Harvey, and Mary arrive: Mary is now Lybia, Harvey finds himself in the body of the wizard's pet leopard Rupa, thwarting his plans to seduce Cleopatra and Jiro finds himself in the body of Ionius, a Greek man captured and enslaved by the Romans. Ionius frees himself and the other slaves by using his knowledge of future technology to make modern hand grenades. They accompany Cleopatra to meet Caesar, who is so overcome by her beauty that he makes her queen of Egypt. Caesar recaptures Ionius and, amused by his fighting skills, orders him to fight in the gladiatorial arena. He gives Ionius a gun to ensure his victory. Ionius proves so popular with the Roman public that Caesar's own popularity soars, leading his senators to conspire to murder both him and Ionius and end their influence.\n\nLybia and Apollodoria insist that Cleopatra must murder Caesar; Cleopatra, however, has had a change of heart and keeps putting off the assassination in favor of sex. They accompany Caesar back to Rome, just in time for him to be assassinated by his own senators. Caesar's adopted son, Augustus Caesar\u2014soon to be called Octavian\u2014takes command. Cleopatra tries to continue the plan by seducing Octavian, only to find that he is homosexual and impervious to her charms. Caesar's right-hand man, Marcus Antonius or known as Anthony, fall in love and have sex with Cleopatra. Octavian, however, is attracted to Ionius and spares his life. \n\nFinally, During the Battle of Actium where Octavian's fleet, defeats the Anthony-Egyptian fleet, Anthony loses the battle and kills himself, Octavian goes to Cleopatra trying to persuade her to surrender and taken into custody by the Romans. Disappointed by the rejection after Anthony's death, Cleopatra commits suicide by using the venomous bite of an asp.\n\nThe time travelers return to the future and report that the Cleopatra plan is a scheme by the Pasateli to assume the form of beautiful human women to seduce and destroy Earth's most powerful male leaders. The Pasateli have already taken their human forms and are poised to strike when this information arrives, but Earth is able to root them out and save the world in time.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chinatsu Nakayama]] as [[Cleopatra]]\n*[[Hajime Hana]] as [[Julius Caesar]]\n*[[Osami Nabe]] as [[Marcus Antonius]]\n*[[Jitsuko Yoshimura]] as Mary/Lybia\n*[[Tsubame Yanagiya]] as Harvey/Rupa\n*[[Nobuo Tsukamoto]] as Jiro/Ionius\n*[[Kazuko Imai]] as [[Calpurnia (wife of Caesar)|Calpurnia]]\n*[[Susumu Abe]] as Cabagonis\n*[[Nachi Nozawa]] as [[Octavian]]\n*[[Kotoe Hatsui]] as Apollodoria\n*[[Yoshir\u014d Kat\u014d]] as Chief Tarabahha\n\n==Production and release==\nIn 1972, [[Mushi Productions]], who made the film, accepted a deal with [[Xanadu Productions]], a small company, to release an [[English language|English]]-dubbed version in the United States to try to save themselves from bankruptcy.

Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a [[mineraloid]], unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals.  It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]], and [[basalt]]. \n\nThere are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color ([[iridescence]]), common opal does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opal Description |url=https://www.gia.edu/opal-description |website=Gemological Institute of America |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>  Play-of-color is defined as \"a pseudochromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Play of Color |url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/play_of_color |website=Mindat |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>   The internal structure of precious opal causes it to [[diffraction|diffract]] light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent or opaque and the background color may be white, black or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered to be the rarest, whereas white, gray and green are the most common.\n\n== Precious opal ==\n[[File:Opal molecular structure2.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal consists of spheres of silicon dioxide molecules arranged in regular, closely packed planes.

At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some 150 to 300&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1964|title=Colour of precious opal|journal=Nature|volume=204|issue=496|pages=1151\u20131153|doi=10.1038/2041151a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1968|title=Diffraction of light by opals|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|volume=24|issue=4|pages=427\u2013434|doi=10.1107/S0567739468000860|bibcode=1968AcCrA..24..427S}}</ref> that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|last2=Hurlbut|first2=Cornelius S.|date=1985|title=Manual of Mineralogy|edition=20th|isbn=978-0-471-80580-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofmineralo00klei}}</ref> The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres determines the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by [[Bragg's law]] of diffraction.\n\nVisible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]]. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by [[Vasily Astratov]]'s group.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astratov |first=V.&nbsp;N.| year = 1995 | title = Optical spectroscopy of opal matrices with CdS embedded in its pores: Quantum confinement and photonic band gap effects | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento D | volume = 17 | issue = 11\u201312 | pages = 1349\u20131354 | last2 = Bogomolov | first2 = V.&nbsp;N. | last3 = Kaplyanskii | first3 = A.&nbsp;A. | last4 = Prokofiev | first4 = A.&nbsp;V. | last5 = Samoilovich | first5 = L.&nbsp;A. | last6 = Samoilovich | first6 = S.&nbsp;M. | last7 = Vlasov | first7 = Yu.&nbsp;A. | doi=10.1007/bf02457208|bibcode = 1995NCimD..17.1349A }}</ref> In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e inside the opal during solidification. The term [[opalescence]] is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed [[iridescence|play of color]]. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. [[Opalescence]] is a form of [[adularescence]].\n\nFor [[gemstone]] use, most opal is cut and polished to form a [[cabochon]]. \"Solid\" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a \"solid\" may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal [[Doublet (lapidary)|doublet]] consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian.  The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious gemstones.  Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Dr. Joel Arem |author2=Donald Clark, CSM IMG |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Opal Value, Price, and Jewelry |website=Gemsociety.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060711/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archivedate=23 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nCombined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to solid black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.\n\n==Common opal==\n[[File:SLOVAKIAN OPAL 12.jpg|thumb|White and blue opal from Slovakia]]\nBesides the [[gemstone]] varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); [[resin]] opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; [[wood opal]], which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gribble|first=C.&nbsp;D.|title=Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|year=1988|edition=27th|page=431|chapter=Tektosilicates (framework silicates)|isbn=978-0-04-549011-0}}</ref> [[menilite]], which is brown or grey; [[hyalite]], a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; [[geyserite]], also called [[siliceous sinter]], deposited around [[hot springs]] or [[geyser]]s; and [[diatomaceous earth]], the accumulations of [[diatom]] shells or tests.

Although it does not usually show any play of color, occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Also, a type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal which exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.<ref name=\"LetsTalk\">{{cite web|first1=James|last1=Swisher|first2=Edna B.|last2=Anthony|url=http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|title=Let's Talk Gemstones: Opal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214533/http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGirasol opal is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect, when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal<ref name=\"LetsTalk\" /> is a type of [[hyalite]] opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are [[Oregon]] and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nPeruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display play of color. Blue opal also comes from [[Oregon]] in the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] region, as well as from [[Nevada]] around the [[Virgin Valley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOpal is also formed by [[diatom]]s.  Diatoms are a form of algae which, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans.  Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope.  These cell walls or \"tests\" form the \u201cgrains\u201d for the [[diatomaceous earth]].  This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral-variety/mineral/diatomite.aspx|title=diatomite - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom|website=www.minerals.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>  Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water adsorption.\n\n==History==\nOpal was rare and very valuable in antiquity.

In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: [[Col\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro|Col\u00f3n]], [[Tequisquiapan]] and [[Ezequiel Montes]]. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s the Quer\u00e9taro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more.\n\nThe oldest mine in Quer\u00e9taro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Quer\u00e9taro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of [[Jalisco]] were not discovered until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Quer\u00e9taro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco - La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of a lesser quality) are [[Guerrero]], which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in [[Morelos]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Puebla]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], and [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\n\nAnother source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2015/08/future-of-spencer-opal-mining-uncertain/|title=If you've ever wanted an opal -- it's time to visit Spencer {{!}} East Idaho News|date=2015-08-06|work=East Idaho News|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.\n\nOther significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro II, Piau\u00ed]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |title=Boi Morto Mine, Pedro II, Piau\u00ed, Brazil |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512015022/http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Honduras (more precisely in [[Erandique]]), Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n\nIn late 2008, [[NASA]] announced it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|accessdate=29 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103930/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|archivedate=19 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Synthetic opal ==\nOpals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein /> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a \"lizard skin\" or \"chicken wire\" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.\n\nTwo notable producers of synthetic opal are [[Kyocera]] and [[Inamori]] of Japan. Most so-called synthetics, however, are more correctly termed \"imitation opal\", as they contain substances not found in natural opal (such as plastic stabilizers). The imitation opals seen in vintage jewelry are often foiled glass, glass-based \"[[Slocum stone]]\", or later plastic materials.\n\nOther research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |title=Macroporous Structures, Metal Oxides, Highly Ordered |website=Office for Technology Commercialization, Technology Marketing Site |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152153/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Local atomic structure of opals ==\n[[File:Alphacrist.png|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline \u03b1-[[cristobalite]]. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]\n[[File:Lussatite-France.jpg|thumb|Lussatite (opal-CT)]]\nThe lattice of spheres of opal that cause the interference with light are several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], no [[unit cell]] describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graetsch|first=H.|title=Structural characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals. Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy|volume=29|date=1994|editor1-first=P.&nbsp;J.|editor1-last=Heaney|editor2-first=Connecticut|editor2-last=Prewitt|editor3-first=G.&nbsp;V.|editor3-last=Gibbs}}</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.\n\nThe structure of low-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of anhydrous [[silica]] consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonal]] and [[cubic close packing|cubic close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.\n\n=== Microcrystalline opal ===\nOpal-CT has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10&nbsp;wt%.<ref>[https://www.mindat.org/min-32185.html Opal-CT on Midat]</ref> Opal-C, also called ''lussatine'' or ''lussatite'', is interpreted as consisting of localized order of \u03b1-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5&nbsp;wt%.\n\n=== Noncrystalline opal ===\nTwo broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as \"opal-A\", have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second \"opal-A\" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Schematic representation of the hydrated opal surface.]]\n\nNoncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |title=HRTEM of microcrystalline opal in chert and porcelanite from the Monterey Formation, California |last=Cady |first=S.&nbsp;L. |last2=Wenk |first2=H.-R. |last3=Downing |first3=K.&nbsp;H. |date=1996 |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=81 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1380\u20131395 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053527/http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=1996AmMin..81.1380C |doi=10.2138/am-1996-11-1211 }}</ref>\n===Opal surface chemical groups===\n\nThe surface of opal in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH). This makes the opal surface very [[hydrophile|hydrophilic ]] and capable of forming numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'opal' is adapted from the [[Latin]] term ''opalus'', but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''\u00fapala''.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|title=The World of Opals|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=1997|pages=56\u201357|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426210345/https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780471133971}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested to have been adapted from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was \"Opalia\", similar to ''opalus''.\n\nAnother common claim that the term is adapted from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word, ''opallios''. This word has two meanings, one is related to \"seeing\" and forms the basis of the English words like \"opaque\"; the other is \"other\" as in \"alias\" and \"alter\". It is claimed that ''opalus'' combined these uses, meaning \"to see a change in color\". However, historians have noted the first appearances of ''opallios'' do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180&nbsp;BC, and they had previously used the term ''paederos''.<ref name=eckert />\n\nHowever, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250&nbsp;BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Historical superstitions ==\nIn the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | year = 1907 | location = Bristol | publisher = John Wright & Co | pages = [https://archive.org/details/b24855893/page/248 248]\u2013249 | url = https://archive.org/details/b24855893 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie /><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich |author-link=Gerina Dunwich |year=1996|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation.

Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a [[mineraloid]], unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals.  It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]], and [[basalt]]. \n\nThere are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color ([[iridescence]]), common opal does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opal Description |url=https://www.gia.edu/opal-description |website=Gemological Institute of America |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>  Play-of-color is defined as \"a pseudochromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Play of Color |url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/play_of_color |website=Mindat |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>   The internal structure of precious opal causes it to [[diffraction|diffract]] light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent or opaque and the background color may be white, black or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered to be the rarest, whereas white, gray and green are the most common.\n\n== Precious opal ==\n[[File:Opal molecular structure2.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal consists of spheres of silicon dioxide molecules arranged in regular, closely packed planes.

At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some 150 to 300&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1964|title=Colour of precious opal|journal=Nature|volume=204|issue=496|pages=1151\u20131153|doi=10.1038/2041151a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1968|title=Diffraction of light by opals|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|volume=24|issue=4|pages=427\u2013434|doi=10.1107/S0567739468000860|bibcode=1968AcCrA..24..427S}}</ref> that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|last2=Hurlbut|first2=Cornelius S.|date=1985|title=Manual of Mineralogy|edition=20th|isbn=978-0-471-80580-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofmineralo00klei}}</ref> The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres determines the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by [[Bragg's law]] of diffraction.\n\nVisible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]]. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by [[Vasily Astratov]]'s group.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astratov |first=V.&nbsp;N.| year = 1995 | title = Optical spectroscopy of opal matrices with CdS embedded in its pores: Quantum confinement and photonic band gap effects | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento D | volume = 17 | issue = 11\u201312 | pages = 1349\u20131354 | last2 = Bogomolov | first2 = V.&nbsp;N. | last3 = Kaplyanskii | first3 = A.&nbsp;A. | last4 = Prokofiev | first4 = A.&nbsp;V. | last5 = Samoilovich | first5 = L.&nbsp;A. | last6 = Samoilovich | first6 = S.&nbsp;M. | last7 = Vlasov | first7 = Yu.&nbsp;A. | doi=10.1007/bf02457208|bibcode = 1995NCimD..17.1349A }}</ref> In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e inside the opal during solidification. The term [[opalescence]] is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed [[iridescence|play of color]]. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. [[Opalescence]] is a form of [[adularescence]].\n\nFor [[gemstone]] use, most opal is cut and polished to form a [[cabochon]]. \"Solid\" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a \"solid\" may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal [[Doublet (lapidary)|doublet]] consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian.  The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious gemstones.  Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Dr. Joel Arem |author2=Donald Clark, CSM IMG |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Opal Value, Price, and Jewelry |website=Gemsociety.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060711/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archivedate=23 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nCombined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to solid black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price.

Although it does not usually show any play of color, occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Also, a type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal which exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.<ref name=\"LetsTalk\">{{cite web|first1=James|last1=Swisher|first2=Edna B.|last2=Anthony|url=http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|title=Let's Talk Gemstones: Opal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214533/http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGirasol opal is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect, when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal<ref name=\"LetsTalk\" /> is a type of [[hyalite]] opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are [[Oregon]] and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nPeruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display play of color. Blue opal also comes from [[Oregon]] in the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] region, as well as from [[Nevada]] around the [[Virgin Valley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOpal is also formed by [[diatom]]s.  Diatoms are a form of algae which, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans.  Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope.  These cell walls or \"tests\" form the \u201cgrains\u201d for the [[diatomaceous earth]].

In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: [[Col\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro|Col\u00f3n]], [[Tequisquiapan]] and [[Ezequiel Montes]]. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s the Quer\u00e9taro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more.\n\nThe oldest mine in Quer\u00e9taro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Quer\u00e9taro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of [[Jalisco]] were not discovered until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Quer\u00e9taro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco - La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of a lesser quality) are [[Guerrero]], which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in [[Morelos]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Puebla]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], and [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\n\nAnother source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2015/08/future-of-spencer-opal-mining-uncertain/|title=If you've ever wanted an opal -- it's time to visit Spencer {{!}} East Idaho News|date=2015-08-06|work=East Idaho News|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.\n\nOther significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro II, Piau\u00ed]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |title=Boi Morto Mine, Pedro II, Piau\u00ed, Brazil |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512015022/http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Honduras (more precisely in [[Erandique]]), Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n\nIn late 2008, [[NASA]] announced it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|accessdate=29 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103930/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|archivedate=19 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Synthetic opal ==\nOpals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein /> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a \"lizard skin\" or \"chicken wire\" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.\n\nTwo notable producers of synthetic opal are [[Kyocera]] and [[Inamori]] of Japan. Most so-called synthetics, however, are more correctly termed \"imitation opal\", as they contain substances not found in natural opal (such as plastic stabilizers). The imitation opals seen in vintage jewelry are often foiled glass, glass-based \"[[Slocum stone]]\", or later plastic materials.\n\nOther research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |title=Macroporous Structures, Metal Oxides, Highly Ordered |website=Office for Technology Commercialization, Technology Marketing Site |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152153/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Local atomic structure of opals ==\n[[File:Alphacrist.png|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline \u03b1-[[cristobalite]]. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]\n[[File:Lussatite-France.jpg|thumb|Lussatite (opal-CT)]]\nThe lattice of spheres of opal that cause the interference with light are several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], no [[unit cell]] describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graetsch|first=H.|title=Structural characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals. Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy|volume=29|date=1994|editor1-first=P.&nbsp;J.|editor1-last=Heaney|editor2-first=Connecticut|editor2-last=Prewitt|editor3-first=G.&nbsp;V.|editor3-last=Gibbs}}</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.\n\nThe structure of low-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of anhydrous [[silica]] consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonal]] and [[cubic close packing|cubic close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.\n\n=== Microcrystalline opal ===\nOpal-CT has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10&nbsp;wt%.<ref>[https://www.mindat.org/min-32185.html Opal-CT on Midat]</ref> Opal-C, also called ''lussatine'' or ''lussatite'', is interpreted as consisting of localized order of \u03b1-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5&nbsp;wt%.\n\n=== Noncrystalline opal ===\nTwo broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as \"opal-A\", have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second \"opal-A\" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Schematic representation of the hydrated opal surface.]]\n\nNoncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |title=HRTEM of microcrystalline opal in chert and porcelanite from the Monterey Formation, California |last=Cady |first=S.&nbsp;L. |last2=Wenk |first2=H.-R. |last3=Downing |first3=K.&nbsp;H. |date=1996 |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=81 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1380\u20131395 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053527/http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=1996AmMin..81.1380C |doi=10.2138/am-1996-11-1211 }}</ref>\n===Opal surface chemical groups===\n\nThe surface of opal in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH). This makes the opal surface very [[hydrophile|hydrophilic ]] and capable of forming numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'opal' is adapted from the [[Latin]] term ''opalus'', but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''\u00fapala''.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|title=The World of Opals|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=1997|pages=56\u201357|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426210345/https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780471133971}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested to have been adapted from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was \"Opalia\", similar to ''opalus''.\n\nAnother common claim that the term is adapted from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word, ''opallios''. This word has two meanings, one is related to \"seeing\" and forms the basis of the English words like \"opaque\"; the other is \"other\" as in \"alias\" and \"alter\". It is claimed that ''opalus'' combined these uses, meaning \"to see a change in color\". However, historians have noted the first appearances of ''opallios'' do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180&nbsp;BC, and they had previously used the term ''paederos''.<ref name=eckert />\n\nHowever, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250&nbsp;BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Historical superstitions ==\nIn the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | year = 1907 | location = Bristol | publisher = John Wright & Co | pages = [https://archive.org/details/b24855893/page/248 248]\u2013249 | url = https://archive.org/details/b24855893 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie /><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich |author-link=Gerina Dunwich |year=1996|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal [[amulet|talisman]] with supernatural powers. When a drop of [[holy water]] falls on the talisman, the opal turns into a colorless stone and the Baroness dies soon thereafter. Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.<ref name=Fernie /> Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W.

Highly recommended for old fans, as well as interested newcomers.\"\n\n==Track listing==\n{{Tracklist\n|headline = ''Feeding the Machine'' track listing\n|all_lyrics = Niklas St\u00e5lvind\n| total_length = 46:54\n| title1 = Shoot to Kill \n| writer1 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length1 = 3:41\n| title2 = Guillotine\n| writer2 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length2 = 4:04\n| title3 = Dead Man\u2019s Hand\n| writer3 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length3 = 3:09\n| title4 = Midnight Hour\n| writer4 = St\u00e5lvind, Johansson\n| length4 = 3:22\n| title5 = Mass Confusion\n| writer5 = St\u00e5lvind,Johansson, Modd\n| length5 = 4:12\n| title6 =  The Cold Emptiness\n| writer6 = Johansson\n| length6 = 3:48\n| title7 = Feeding the Machine\n| writer7 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length7 = 3:51\n| title8 = Devil in the Flesh\n| writer8 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length8 = 3:18\n| title9 = Spoon Bender\n| writer9 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length9 = 3:26\n| title10 = The Raven\n| writer10 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length10 = 4:29\n| title11 = Black Widow\n| writer11 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length11 = 4:00\n| title12 = A Thief Inside\n| writer12 = St\u00e5lvind\n| length12 = 5:34\n|}}\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Wolf'''\n* Niklas St\u00e5lvind \u2013 vocals, guitar\n* Simon Johansson \u2013 guitar\n* Pontus Egberg \u2013 bass guitar\n* Johan Koleberg \u2013 drums\n\n'''Additional personnel'''\n* Produced by Simon Johansson\n* Mixed and mastered by Fredrick Nordst\u00f6rm\n* Engineered by Simon Johansson and Mike Wead\n* Artwork by Thomas Holm\n* Photography by Ther\u00e9s Bj\u00f6rk\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of 2020 albums]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Wolf (band)}}\n\n[[Category:Century Media Records albums]]\n[[Category:2020 albums]]\n[[Category:Wolf (band) albums]]\n", "name_user": "MetalS-W", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReception", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_the_Machine_(Wolf_album)"}
