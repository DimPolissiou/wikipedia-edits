Often, the early signs become apparent when looking back in time. The earliest stage of dementia is called [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI). 70% of those diagnosed with MCI later progress to dementia.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> In MCI, changes in the person's brain have been happening for a long time, but symptoms are just beginning to appear. These problems, however, are not severe enough to affect daily function. If/once they do, the diagnosis becomes dementia. A person with MCI scores between 27 and 30 on the [[Mini-Mental State Examination]] (MMSE), which is a normal score. They may have some memory trouble and trouble finding words, but they solve everyday problems and competently handle their life affairs.<ref name=\"hugo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hugo J, Ganguli M | title = Dementia and cognitive impairment: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 421\u201342 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25037289 | pmc = 4104432 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2014.04.001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Early stages ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the early stage of dementia, symptoms become noticeable to others. In addition, the symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities. [[Mini\u2013Mental State Examination|MMSE]] scores are between 20 and 25. The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia. More complicated chores and tasks around the house or at work become more difficult. The person can usually still take care of themselves but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dementia care at a glance|last=Jenkins |first=Catharine|others=Ginesi, Laura; Keenan, Bernie|isbn=978-1-118-85998-8|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=905089525|date = 2016-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThe symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems (anomia) and problems with planning and organizational skills (executive function).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rohrer JD, Knight WD, Warren JE, Fox NC, Rossor MN, Warren JD | title = Word-finding difficulty: a clinical analysis of the progressive aphasias | journal = Brain | volume = 131 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 8\u201338 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17947337 | pmc = 2373641 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm251 }}</ref> One very good way of assessing a person's impairment is by asking if they are still able to handle their finances independently. This is often one of the first things to become problematic.

It is also important to consider education level when assessing function. For example, an accountant who can no longer balance a checkbook would be more concerning than a person who had not finished high school or had never taken care of their own finances.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nIn Alzheimer's dementia the most prominent early symptom is memory difficulty. Others include word-finding problems and getting lost. In other types of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.\n\n=== Middle stages ===\nAs dementia progresses, initial symptoms generally worsen. The rate of decline is different for each person. MMSE between scores of 6\u201317 signal moderate dementia . For example, people with moderate Alzheimer's dementia lose almost all new information. People with dementia may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is usually also impaired. They cannot usually function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone. They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene beyond simple reminders.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\n=== Late stages ===\nPeople with late-stage dementia typically turn increasingly inward and need assistance with most or all of their personal care. Persons with dementia in the late stages usually need 24-hour supervision to ensure personal safety, as well as to ensure meeting basic needs. If left unsupervised, a person with late-stage dementia may wander or fall, may not recognize common dangers such as a hot stove, or may not realize that they need to use the bathroom. They may become [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]].<ref name=hugo/>\n\nChanges in eating frequently occur. People with late-stage dementia often eat [[Pur\u00e9e|pureed diets]], thickened liquids, and require assistance in eating, to prolong their lives, to cause them to retain weight, to reduce choking risk and to make eating easier.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|title=How We Die Now: Intimacy and the Work of Dying|last=Erickson|first=Karla | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013-09-27|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0823-5|pages=109\u201311|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223191201/https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|archive-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> The person's appetite may decline to the point that the person does not want to eat at all.

Trouble with visual-spatial processing (for example, they may begin to get lost often), reasoning, judgment and insight fail. Insight refers to whether or not the person realizes they have memory problems.\n\nCommon early symptoms of Alzheimer's include repetition, getting lost, difficulties tracking bills, problems with cooking especially new or complicated meals, forgetting to take medication and word-finding problems.\n\nThe part of the brain most affected by Alzheimer's is the [[hippocampus]]. Other parts that show atrophy (shrinking) include the [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> Although this pattern suggests Alzheimer's, the brain shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease is variable, and a brain scan is not sufficient for diagnosis.

People with vascular dementia tend to have risk factors for [[vascular disease|disease of the blood vessels]], such as [[Cigarette smoking|tobacco use]], [[high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] or [[diabetes]], or other signs of vascular disease such as a previous [[heart attack]] or [[angina]].\n\n=== Dementia with Lewy bodies ===\n{{update|see <nowiki>PMID 28592453</nowiki>|date=March 2018}}\n[[Dementia with Lewy bodies]] (DLB) has the primary symptoms of visual hallucinations and \"Parkinsonism\". Parkinsonism is the symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]], which include tremor, rigid muscles, and a face without emotion. The visual hallucinations in DLB are generally vivid hallucinations of people or animals and they often occur when someone is about to fall asleep or wake up. Other prominent symptoms include problems with attention, organization, problem solving and planning (executive function) and difficulty with visual-spatial function.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nAgain, imaging studies cannot determine the diagnosis of DLB, but some changes are particularly common. A person with DLB often shows occipital [[hypoperfusion]] on a [[SPECT scan]] or occipital hypometabolism on a [[PET scan]]. Generally, a diagnosis of DLB is straightforward and typically does not require a brain scan.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\n=== Frontotemporal dementia ===\n[[Frontotemporal Dementia|Frontotemporal dementias]] (FTDs) are characterized by drastic personality changes and language difficulties. In all FTDs, the person has a relatively early social withdrawal and early lack of insight. Memory problems are not a main feature.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finger|first=Elizabeth C.|date=April 2016|title=Frontotemporal Dementias|journal=Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)|volume=22|issue=2 Dementia|pages=464\u2013489|doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000300|issn=1538-6899|pmc=5390934|pmid=27042904}}</ref>\n\nThere are six main types of FTD. The first has major symptoms in personality and behavior. This is called behavioral variant FTD (bv-FTD) and is the most common. In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene; becomes rigid in their thinking;, and rarely acknowledges problems; they are socially withdrawn; and often have a drastic increase in appetite. They may become socially inappropriate. For example, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly. One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything. Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many dementias.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nTwo types of FTD feature [[aphasia]] (language problems) as the main symptom. One type is called semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV-PPA). The main feature of this is the loss of the meaning of words. It may begin with difficulty naming things. The person eventually may lose the meaning of objects as well. For example, a drawing of a bird, dog, and an airplane in someone with FTD may all appear almost the same.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> In a classic test for this, a patient is shown a picture of a pyramid and below it a picture of both a palm tree and a pine tree. The person is asked to say which one goes best with the pyramid. In SV-PPA the person cannot answer that question. The other type is called non-fluent agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (NFA-PPA). This is mainly a problem with producing speech. They have trouble finding the right words, but mostly they have a difficulty coordinating the muscles they need to speak. Eventually, someone with NFA-PPA only uses one-syllable words or may become totally mute.\n\n[[Progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP) is a form of FTD that is characterized by problems with eye movements. Generally the problems begin with difficulty moving the eyes up or down (vertical gaze palsy). Since difficulty moving the eyes upward can sometimes happen in normal aging, problems with downward eye movements are the key in PSP. Other key symptoms include falling backward, balance problems, slow movements, rigid muscles, irritability, apathy, social withdrawal and depression. The person may have certain \"frontal lobe\" signs such as perseveration, a grasp reflex and [[utilization behavior]] (the need to use an object once you see it). People with PSP often have progressive difficulty eating and swallowing, and eventually with talking. Because of the rigidity and slow movements, PSP is sometimes misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]]. On scans the [[midbrain]] of people with PSP is generally shrunken (atrophied), but no other common brain abnormalities are visible.\n\n[[Corticobasal degeneration]] (CBD) is a rare form of FTD that is characterized by many different types of neurological problems that progressively worsen. This is because the disorder affects the brain in many different places, but at different rates. One common sign is difficulty with using only one limb. One symptom that is rare in any other condition is the \"alien limb\". The alien limb is a limb that seems to have a mind of its own, it moves without conscious control of the person's brain. Other common symptoms include jerky movements of one or more limbs ([[myoclonus]]), symptoms that are different in different limbs (asymmetric), difficulty with speech from inability to move the mouth muscles in a coordinated way, numbness and tingling of the limbs and neglecting one side of vision or senses. In neglect, a person ignores the opposite side of the body from the one that has the problem. For example, a person may not feel pain on one side, or may only draw half of a picture when asked. In addition, the person's affected limbs may be rigid or have muscle contractions causing [[dystonia]] (strange repetitive movements).<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> The brain area most often affected in corticobasal degeneration is the posterior [[frontal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], although many other parts can be affected.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nFinally, FT dementia associated with MND (FTD-MND) includes the symptoms of FTD (behavior, language and movement problems) co-occurring with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Motor Neurone Disease]] (death of motor neurons).\n\n=== Rapidly progressive ===\n[[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] typically causes a dementia that worsens over weeks to months, and is caused by [[prion]]s.

The first is primarily memory loss (amnestic MCI). The second is anything else (non-amnestic MCI). People with primarily memory problems typically develop Alzheimer's disease. People with the other type of MCI may develop other types of dementia.\n\nDiagnosis of MCI is often difficult, as cognitive testing may be normal. Often, more in-depth [[neuropsychological]] testing is necessary to make the diagnosis. The most commonly used criteria are called the Peterson criteria and include:\n* Memory or other cognitive (thought-processing) complaint by the person or a person who knows the patient well.\n* A memory or other cognitive problem as compared to a person of the same age and level of education.\n* Symptoms not severe enough to affect daily function.\n* Absence of dementia.\n\n=== Fixed cognitive impairment ===\nVarious types of brain injury may cause irreversible cognitive impairment that remains stable over time. [[Traumatic brain injury]] may cause generalized damage to the white matter of the brain ([[diffuse axonal injury]]), or more localized damage (as may also accompany [[neurosurgery]]). A temporary reduction in the brain's blood supply or oxygen may lead to [[cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic-ischemic injury]]. [[Stroke]]s (ischemic stroke, or intracerebral, subarachnoid, subdural or extradural hemorrhage) or infections ([[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]]) affecting the brain, prolonged epileptic [[seizure]]s, and acute [[hydrocephalus]] may also have long-term effects on cognition. Excessive alcohol use may cause [[alcohol dementia]], [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], or [[Korsakoff's psychosis]].\n\n=== Slowly progressive ===\nDementia that begins gradually and worsens over several years is usually caused by [[neurodegenerative disease]]\u2014that is, by conditions that affect only or primarily brain neurons and cause gradual but irreversible loss of function. Less commonly, a non-degenerative condition may have secondary effects on brain cells, which may or may not be reversible if the condition is treated.\n\nCauses of dementia depend on the age when symptoms begin.

Most cases of progressive cognitive disturbance in this age group are caused by psychiatric illness, alcohol or other drugs, or metabolic disturbance. However, certain genetic disorders can cause true neurodegenerative dementia at this age. These include [[Early-onset Alzheimer's disease|familial Alzheimer's disease]], [[Spinocerebellar ataxia|SCA17]] ([[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] inheritance); [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] ([[Sex linkage|X-linked]]); [[Gaucher's disease]] type 3, [[metachromatic leukodystrophy]], [[Niemann-Pick disease type C]], [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]], [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]], and [[Wilson's disease]] (all [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]). Wilson's disease is particularly important since cognition can improve with treatment.\n\nAt all ages, a substantial proportion of patients who complain of memory difficulty or other cognitive symptoms have [[major depressive disorder|depression]] rather than a neurodegenerative disease.

One of the earliest known allusions to dementia is attributed to the 7th-century BC [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]], who divided the human lifespan into six distinct phases: 0\u20136 (infancy), 7\u201321 (adolescence), 22\u201349 (young adulthood), 50\u201362 (middle age), 63\u201379 (old age), and 80\u2013death (advanced age). The last two he described as the \"senium\", a period of mental and physical decay, and that the final phase was when \"the scene of mortal existence closes after a great length of time that very fortunately, few of the human species arrive at, where the mind is reduced to the imbecility of the first epoch of infancy\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berchtold NC, Cotman CW | year = 1998 | title = Evolution in the conceptu-alization of dementia and Alzheimer's disease: Greco-Roman period to the 1960s | url = | journal = Neurobiol Aging | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 173\u201389 | doi = 10.1016/s0197-4580(98)00052-9 }}</ref> In 550&nbsp;BC, the Athenian statesman and poet [[Solon]] argued that the terms of a man's will might be invalidated if he exhibited loss of judgement due to advanced age. [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical]] texts made allusions to the condition as well, and the characters for \"dementia\" translate literally to \"foolish old person\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAthenians [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] spoke of the mental decay of advanced age, apparently viewing it as an inevitable process that affected all old men, and which nothing could prevent. Plato stated that the elderly were unsuited for any position of responsibility because, \"There is not much acumen of the mind that once carried them in their youth, those characteristics one would call judgement, imagination, power of reasoning, and memory. They see them gradually blunted by deterioration and can hardly fulfill their function.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nFor comparison, the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] held a view much more in line with modern-day medical wisdom that loss of mental function was not inevitable in the elderly and \"affected only those old men who were weak-willed\". He spoke of how those who remained mentally active and eager to learn new things could stave off dementia. However, Cicero's views on aging, although progressive, were largely ignored in a world that would be dominated for centuries by Aristotle's medical writings. Physicians during the Roman Empire, such as [[Galen]] and [[Celsus]], simply repeated the beliefs of Aristotle while adding few new contributions to medical knowledge.\n\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] physicians sometimes wrote of dementia. It is recorded that at least seven emperors whose lifespans exceeded 70 years displayed signs of cognitive decline. In [[Constantinople]], special hospitals housed those diagnosed with dementia or insanity, but these did not apply to the emperors, who were above the law and whose health conditions could not be publicly acknowledged.\n\nOtherwise, little is recorded about dementia in Western medical texts for nearly 1700 years. One of the few references was the 13th-century friar [[Roger Bacon]], who viewed old age as divine punishment for [[original sin]]. Although he repeated existing Aristotelian beliefs that dementia was inevitable, he did make the progressive assertion that the brain was the center of memory and thought rather than the heart.\n\nPoets, playwrights, and other writers made frequent allusions to the loss of mental function in old age. [[William Shakespeare]] notably mentions it in plays such as ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.\n\nDuring the 19th century, doctors generally came to believe that elderly dementia was the result of [[cerebral atherosclerosis]], although opinions fluctuated between the idea that it was due to blockage of the major arteries supplying the brain or small strokes within the vessels of the [[cerebral cortex]].\n\nIn 1907 [[Alzheimer's disease]] was described. This was associated with particular microscopic changes in the brain, but was seen as a rare disease of middle age because the first person diagnosed with it was [[Auguste Deter|a 50-year-old woman]]. By 1913\u201320, [[schizophrenia]] had been well-defined in a way similar to later times.\n\nThis viewpoint remained conventional medical wisdom through the first half of the 20th century, but by the 1960s it was increasingly challenged as the link between [[Neurodegenerative Diseases|neurodegenerative diseases]] and age-related cognitive decline was established. By the 1970s, the medical community maintained that vascular dementia was rarer than previously thought and Alzheimer's disease caused the vast majority of old age mental impairments. More recently however, it is believed that dementia is often a mixture of conditions.\n\nIn 1976, neurologist [[Robert Katzmann]] suggested a link between senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html|title=Drug Trials Test Bold Plan to Slow Alzheimer's|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=June 17, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=June 17, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121141/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html|archive-date=April 9, 2012|authorlink=Gina Kolata|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> Katzmann suggested that much of the senile dementia occurring (by definition) after the age of 65, was pathologically identical with Alzheimer's disease occurring in people under age 65 and therefore should not be treated differently.<ref name=\"Katzman1976\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Katzman R|date=April 1976|title=Editorial: The prevalence and malignancy of Alzheimer disease.

This is shown by documented supercentenarians (people living to 110 or more) who experienced no substantial cognitive impairment. Some evidence suggests that dementia is most likely to develop between ages 80 and 84 and individuals who pass that point without being affected have a lower chance of developing it. Women account for a larger percentage of dementia cases than men, although this can be attributed to their longer overall lifespan and greater odds of attaining an age where the condition is likely to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nMuch like other diseases associated with aging, dementia was comparatively rare before the 20th century, because few people lived past 80. Conversely, syphilitic dementia was widespread in the developed world until it was largely  eradicated by the use of [[penicillin]] after [[World War II]]. With significant increases in life expectancy thereafter, the number of people over 65 started rapidly climbing. While elderly persons constituted an average of 3\u20135% of the population prior to 1945, by 2010 many countries reached 10\u201314% and in Germany and Japan, this figure exceeded 20%. Public awareness of Alzheimer's Disease greatly increased in 1994 when former US president [[Ronald Reagan]] announced that he had been diagnosed with the condition.\n\nIn the 21st century, [[Frontotemporal dementia|other types of dementia]] were differentiated from Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementias (the most common types). This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues, by symptomatology, and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as [[SPECT]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PETscans]] of the brain. The various forms have differing prognoses and differing epidemiologic risk factors. The causal etiology of many of them, including Alzheimer's disease, remains unclear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Terminology===\nDementia in the elderly was once called ''senile dementia'' or ''senility'', and viewed as a normal and somewhat inevitable aspect of growing old. This terminology is no longer standard.<ref name=\"senility-aa\">{{cite web |title=What is dementia? |url=https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia |publisher=Alzheimer's Association |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Dementia is often incorrectly referred to as \"senility\" or \"senile dementia,\" which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.}}</ref><ref name=\"senility-mednet\">{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Danette C. |title=Dementia |url=https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Senile dementia (\"senility\") is a term that was once used to describe all dementias; this term is no longer used as a diagnosis.}}</ref>\n\nBy 1913\u201320 the term ''[[dementia praecox]]''  was introduced to suggest the development of senile-type dementia at a younger age. Eventually the two terms fused, so that until 1952 physicians used the terms ''dementia praecox'' (precocious dementia) and ''schizophrenia'' interchangeably. The term ''precocious dementia'' for a mental illness suggested that a type of mental illness like schizophrenia (including [[paranoia]] and decreased cognitive capacity) could be expected to arrive normally in all persons with greater age (see [[paraphrenia]]). After about 1920, the beginning use of ''dementia'' for what is now understood as schizophrenia and senile dementia helped limit the word's meaning to \"permanent, irreversible mental deterioration\". This began the change to the later use of the term.\n\nThe view that dementia must always be the result of a particular disease process led for a time to the proposed  diagnosis of \"senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type\" (SDAT) in persons over the age of 65, with \"Alzheimer's disease\" diagnosed in persons younger than 65 who had the same pathology. Eventually, however, it was agreed that the age limit was artificial, and that ''Alzheimer's disease'' was the appropriate term for persons with that particular brain pathology, regardless of age.\n\nAfter 1952 mental illnesses including schizophrenia were removed from the category of ''[[organic brain syndrome]]s'', and thus (by definition) removed from possible causes of \"dementing illnesses\" (dementias). At the same, however, the traditional cause of senile dementia \u2013 \"hardening of the arteries\" \u2013 now returned as a set of dementias of vascular cause (small strokes). These were now termed ''multi-infarct dementias'' or ''[[vascular dementia]]s''.\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Care at Home with Dementia, Tigray (8015180561).jpg|thumb|Old woman from [[Ethiopia]]]]\nThe societal cost of dementia is high, especially for family caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brodaty H, Donkin M | title = Family caregivers of people with dementia | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u201328 | date = 29 April 2017 | pmid = 19585957 | pmc = 3181916 }}</ref>\n\nMany countries consider the care of people living with dementia a national priority and invest in resources and education to better inform health and social service workers, unpaid caregivers, relatives and members of the wider community.

Often, the early signs become apparent when looking back in time. The earliest stage of dementia is called [[mild cognitive impairment]] (MCI). 70% of those diagnosed with MCI later progress to dementia.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> In MCI, changes in the person's brain have been happening for a long time, but symptoms are just beginning to appear. These problems, however, are not severe enough to affect daily function. If/once they do, the diagnosis becomes dementia. A person with MCI scores between 27 and 30 on the [[Mini-Mental State Examination]] (MMSE), which is a normal score. They may have some memory trouble and trouble finding words, but they solve everyday problems and competently handle their life affairs.<ref name=\"hugo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Hugo J, Ganguli M | title = Dementia and cognitive impairment: epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment | journal = Clinics in Geriatric Medicine | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 421\u201342 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 25037289 | pmc = 4104432 | doi = 10.1016/j.cger.2014.04.001 }}</ref>\n\n=== Early stages ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nIn the early stage of dementia, symptoms become noticeable to others. In addition, the symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities. [[Mini\u2013Mental State Examination|MMSE]] scores are between 20 and 25. The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia. More complicated chores and tasks around the house or at work become more difficult. The person can usually still take care of themselves but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dementia care at a glance|last=Jenkins |first=Catharine|others=Ginesi, Laura; Keenan, Bernie|isbn=978-1-118-85998-8|location=Chichester, West Sussex|oclc=905089525|date = 2016-01-26}}</ref>\n\nThe symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems (anomia) and problems with planning and organizational skills (executive function).<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Rohrer JD, Knight WD, Warren JE, Fox NC, Rossor MN, Warren JD | title = Word-finding difficulty: a clinical analysis of the progressive aphasias | journal = Brain | volume = 131 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 8\u201338 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17947337 | pmc = 2373641 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm251 }}</ref> One very good way of assessing a person's impairment is by asking if they are still able to handle their finances independently. This is often one of the first things to become problematic.

It is also important to consider education level when assessing function. For example, an accountant who can no longer balance a checkbook would be more concerning than a person who had not finished high school or had never taken care of their own finances.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nIn Alzheimer's dementia the most prominent early symptom is memory difficulty. Others include word-finding problems and getting lost. In other types of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.\n\n=== Middle stages ===\nAs dementia progresses, initial symptoms generally worsen. The rate of decline is different for each person. MMSE between scores of 6\u201317 signal moderate dementia . For example, people with moderate Alzheimer's dementia lose almost all new information. People with dementia may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is usually also impaired. They cannot usually function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone. They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene beyond simple reminders.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\n=== Late stages ===\nPeople with late-stage dementia typically turn increasingly inward and need assistance with most or all of their personal care. Persons with dementia in the late stages usually need 24-hour supervision to ensure personal safety, as well as to ensure meeting basic needs. If left unsupervised, a person with late-stage dementia may wander or fall, may not recognize common dangers such as a hot stove, or may not realize that they need to use the bathroom. They may become [[Urinary incontinence|incontinent]].<ref name=hugo/>\n\nChanges in eating frequently occur. People with late-stage dementia often eat [[Pur\u00e9e|pureed diets]], thickened liquids, and require assistance in eating, to prolong their lives, to cause them to retain weight, to reduce choking risk and to make eating easier.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|title=How We Die Now: Intimacy and the Work of Dying|last=Erickson|first=Karla | name-list-format = vanc |date=2013-09-27|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0823-5|pages=109\u201311|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223191201/https://books.google.com/books?id=vc_FmgEACAAJ|archive-date=2016-12-23}}</ref> The person's appetite may decline to the point that the person does not want to eat at all.

Trouble with visual-spatial processing (for example, they may begin to get lost often), reasoning, judgment and insight fail. Insight refers to whether or not the person realizes they have memory problems.\n\nCommon early symptoms of Alzheimer's include repetition, getting lost, difficulties tracking bills, problems with cooking especially new or complicated meals, forgetting to take medication and word-finding problems.\n\nThe part of the brain most affected by Alzheimer's is the [[hippocampus]]. Other parts that show atrophy (shrinking) include the [[Temporal lobe|temporal]] and [[parietal lobe]]s.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> Although this pattern suggests Alzheimer's, the brain shrinkage in Alzheimer's disease is variable, and a brain scan is not sufficient for diagnosis.

People with vascular dementia tend to have risk factors for [[vascular disease|disease of the blood vessels]], such as [[Cigarette smoking|tobacco use]], [[high blood pressure]], [[atrial fibrillation]], [[Hypercholesterolemia|high cholesterol]] or [[diabetes]], or other signs of vascular disease such as a previous [[heart attack]] or [[angina]].\n\n=== Dementia with Lewy bodies ===\n{{update|see <nowiki>PMID 28592453</nowiki>|date=March 2018}}\n[[Dementia with Lewy bodies]] (DLB) has the primary symptoms of visual hallucinations and \"Parkinsonism\". Parkinsonism is the symptoms of [[Parkinson's disease]], which include tremor, rigid muscles, and a face without emotion. The visual hallucinations in DLB are generally vivid hallucinations of people or animals and they often occur when someone is about to fall asleep or wake up. Other prominent symptoms include problems with attention, organization, problem solving and planning (executive function) and difficulty with visual-spatial function.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nAgain, imaging studies cannot determine the diagnosis of DLB, but some changes are particularly common. A person with DLB often shows occipital [[hypoperfusion]] on a [[SPECT scan]] or occipital hypometabolism on a [[PET scan]]. Generally, a diagnosis of DLB is straightforward and typically does not require a brain scan.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\n=== Frontotemporal dementia ===\n[[Frontotemporal Dementia|Frontotemporal dementias]] (FTDs) are characterized by drastic personality changes and language difficulties. In all FTDs, the person has a relatively early social withdrawal and early lack of insight. Memory problems are not a main feature.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Finger|first=Elizabeth C.|date=April 2016|title=Frontotemporal Dementias|journal=Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)|volume=22|issue=2 Dementia|pages=464\u2013489|doi=10.1212/CON.0000000000000300|issn=1538-6899|pmc=5390934|pmid=27042904}}</ref>\n\nThere are six main types of FTD. The first has major symptoms in personality and behavior. This is called behavioral variant FTD (bv-FTD) and is the most common. In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene; becomes rigid in their thinking;, and rarely acknowledges problems; they are socially withdrawn; and often have a drastic increase in appetite. They may become socially inappropriate. For example, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly. One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything. Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many dementias.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nTwo types of FTD feature [[aphasia]] (language problems) as the main symptom. One type is called semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV-PPA). The main feature of this is the loss of the meaning of words. It may begin with difficulty naming things. The person eventually may lose the meaning of objects as well. For example, a drawing of a bird, dog, and an airplane in someone with FTD may all appear almost the same.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> In a classic test for this, a patient is shown a picture of a pyramid and below it a picture of both a palm tree and a pine tree. The person is asked to say which one goes best with the pyramid. In SV-PPA the person cannot answer that question. The other type is called non-fluent agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (NFA-PPA). This is mainly a problem with producing speech. They have trouble finding the right words, but mostly they have a difficulty coordinating the muscles they need to speak. Eventually, someone with NFA-PPA only uses one-syllable words or may become totally mute.\n\n[[Progressive supranuclear palsy]] (PSP) is a form of FTD that is characterized by problems with eye movements. Generally the problems begin with difficulty moving the eyes up or down (vertical gaze palsy). Since difficulty moving the eyes upward can sometimes happen in normal aging, problems with downward eye movements are the key in PSP. Other key symptoms include falling backward, balance problems, slow movements, rigid muscles, irritability, apathy, social withdrawal and depression. The person may have certain \"frontal lobe\" signs such as perseveration, a grasp reflex and [[utilization behavior]] (the need to use an object once you see it). People with PSP often have progressive difficulty eating and swallowing, and eventually with talking. Because of the rigidity and slow movements, PSP is sometimes misdiagnosed as [[Parkinson's disease]]. On scans the [[midbrain]] of people with PSP is generally shrunken (atrophied), but no other common brain abnormalities are visible.\n\n[[Corticobasal degeneration]] (CBD) is a rare form of FTD that is characterized by many different types of neurological problems that progressively worsen. This is because the disorder affects the brain in many different places, but at different rates. One common sign is difficulty with using only one limb. One symptom that is rare in any other condition is the \"alien limb\". The alien limb is a limb that seems to have a mind of its own, it moves without conscious control of the person's brain. Other common symptoms include jerky movements of one or more limbs ([[myoclonus]]), symptoms that are different in different limbs (asymmetric), difficulty with speech from inability to move the mouth muscles in a coordinated way, numbness and tingling of the limbs and neglecting one side of vision or senses. In neglect, a person ignores the opposite side of the body from the one that has the problem. For example, a person may not feel pain on one side, or may only draw half of a picture when asked. In addition, the person's affected limbs may be rigid or have muscle contractions causing [[dystonia]] (strange repetitive movements).<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" /> The brain area most often affected in corticobasal degeneration is the posterior [[frontal lobe]] and [[parietal lobe]], although many other parts can be affected.<ref name=\"Memory Loss\" />\n\nFinally, FT dementia associated with MND (FTD-MND) includes the symptoms of FTD (behavior, language and movement problems) co-occurring with [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|Motor Neurone Disease]] (death of motor neurons).\n\n=== Rapidly progressive ===\n[[Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease]] typically causes a dementia that worsens over weeks to months, and is caused by [[prion]]s.

The first is primarily memory loss (amnestic MCI). The second is anything else (non-amnestic MCI). People with primarily memory problems typically develop Alzheimer's disease. People with the other type of MCI may develop other types of dementia.\n\nDiagnosis of MCI is often difficult, as cognitive testing may be normal. Often, more in-depth [[neuropsychological]] testing is necessary to make the diagnosis. The most commonly used criteria are called the Peterson criteria and include:\n* Memory or other cognitive (thought-processing) complaint by the person or a person who knows the patient well.\n* A memory or other cognitive problem as compared to a person of the same age and level of education.\n* Symptoms not severe enough to affect daily function.\n* Absence of dementia.\n\n=== Fixed cognitive impairment ===\nVarious types of brain injury may cause irreversible cognitive impairment that remains stable over time. [[Traumatic brain injury]] may cause generalized damage to the white matter of the brain ([[diffuse axonal injury]]), or more localized damage (as may also accompany [[neurosurgery]]). A temporary reduction in the brain's blood supply or oxygen may lead to [[cerebral hypoxia|hypoxic-ischemic injury]]. [[Stroke]]s (ischemic stroke, or intracerebral, subarachnoid, subdural or extradural hemorrhage) or infections ([[meningitis]] or [[encephalitis]]) affecting the brain, prolonged epileptic [[seizure]]s, and acute [[hydrocephalus]] may also have long-term effects on cognition. Excessive alcohol use may cause [[alcohol dementia]], [[Wernicke's encephalopathy]], or [[Korsakoff's psychosis]].\n\n=== Slowly progressive ===\nDementia that begins gradually and worsens over several years is usually caused by [[neurodegenerative disease]]\u2014that is, by conditions that affect only or primarily brain neurons and cause gradual but irreversible loss of function. Less commonly, a non-degenerative condition may have secondary effects on brain cells, which may or may not be reversible if the condition is treated.\n\nCauses of dementia depend on the age when symptoms begin.

Most cases of progressive cognitive disturbance in this age group are caused by psychiatric illness, alcohol or other drugs, or metabolic disturbance. However, certain genetic disorders can cause true neurodegenerative dementia at this age. These include [[Early-onset Alzheimer's disease|familial Alzheimer's disease]], [[Spinocerebellar ataxia|SCA17]] ([[dominance (genetics)|dominant]] inheritance); [[adrenoleukodystrophy]] ([[Sex linkage|X-linked]]); [[Gaucher's disease]] type 3, [[metachromatic leukodystrophy]], [[Niemann-Pick disease type C]], [[pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration]], [[Tay\u2013Sachs disease]], and [[Wilson's disease]] (all [[dominance (genetics)|recessive]]). Wilson's disease is particularly important since cognition can improve with treatment.\n\nAt all ages, a substantial proportion of patients who complain of memory difficulty or other cognitive symptoms have [[major depressive disorder|depression]] rather than a neurodegenerative disease.

One of the earliest known allusions to dementia is attributed to the 7th-century BC [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosopher]] [[Pythagoras]], who divided the human lifespan into six distinct phases: 0\u20136 (infancy), 7\u201321 (adolescence), 22\u201349 (young adulthood), 50\u201362 (middle age), 63\u201379 (old age), and 80\u2013death (advanced age). The last two he described as the \"senium\", a period of mental and physical decay, and that the final phase was when \"the scene of mortal existence closes after a great length of time that very fortunately, few of the human species arrive at, where the mind is reduced to the imbecility of the first epoch of infancy\".<ref>{{cite journal | author = Berchtold NC, Cotman CW | year = 1998 | title = Evolution in the conceptu-alization of dementia and Alzheimer's disease: Greco-Roman period to the 1960s | url = | journal = Neurobiol Aging | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 173\u201389 | doi = 10.1016/s0197-4580(98)00052-9 }}</ref> In 550&nbsp;BC, the Athenian statesman and poet [[Solon]] argued that the terms of a man's will might be invalidated if he exhibited loss of judgement due to advanced age. [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese medical]] texts made allusions to the condition as well, and the characters for \"dementia\" translate literally to \"foolish old person\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nAthenians [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]] spoke of the mental decay of advanced age, apparently viewing it as an inevitable process that affected all old men, and which nothing could prevent. Plato stated that the elderly were unsuited for any position of responsibility because, \"There is not much acumen of the mind that once carried them in their youth, those characteristics one would call judgement, imagination, power of reasoning, and memory. They see them gradually blunted by deterioration and can hardly fulfill their function.\"{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nFor comparison, the Roman statesman [[Cicero]] held a view much more in line with modern-day medical wisdom that loss of mental function was not inevitable in the elderly and \"affected only those old men who were weak-willed\". He spoke of how those who remained mentally active and eager to learn new things could stave off dementia. However, Cicero's views on aging, although progressive, were largely ignored in a world that would be dominated for centuries by Aristotle's medical writings. Physicians during the Roman Empire, such as [[Galen]] and [[Celsus]], simply repeated the beliefs of Aristotle while adding few new contributions to medical knowledge.\n\n[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] physicians sometimes wrote of dementia. It is recorded that at least seven emperors whose lifespans exceeded 70 years displayed signs of cognitive decline. In [[Constantinople]], special hospitals housed those diagnosed with dementia or insanity, but these did not apply to the emperors, who were above the law and whose health conditions could not be publicly acknowledged.\n\nOtherwise, little is recorded about dementia in Western medical texts for nearly 1700 years. One of the few references was the 13th-century friar [[Roger Bacon]], who viewed old age as divine punishment for [[original sin]]. Although he repeated existing Aristotelian beliefs that dementia was inevitable, he did make the progressive assertion that the brain was the center of memory and thought rather than the heart.\n\nPoets, playwrights, and other writers made frequent allusions to the loss of mental function in old age. [[William Shakespeare]] notably mentions it in plays such as ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[King Lear]]''.\n\nDuring the 19th century, doctors generally came to believe that elderly dementia was the result of [[cerebral atherosclerosis]], although opinions fluctuated between the idea that it was due to blockage of the major arteries supplying the brain or small strokes within the vessels of the [[cerebral cortex]].\n\nIn 1907 [[Alzheimer's disease]] was described. This was associated with particular microscopic changes in the brain, but was seen as a rare disease of middle age because the first person diagnosed with it was [[Auguste Deter|a 50-year-old woman]]. By 1913\u201320, [[schizophrenia]] had been well-defined in a way similar to later times.\n\nThis viewpoint remained conventional medical wisdom through the first half of the 20th century, but by the 1960s it was increasingly challenged as the link between [[Neurodegenerative Diseases|neurodegenerative diseases]] and age-related cognitive decline was established. By the 1970s, the medical community maintained that vascular dementia was rarer than previously thought and Alzheimer's disease caused the vast majority of old age mental impairments. More recently however, it is believed that dementia is often a mixture of conditions.\n\nIn 1976, neurologist [[Robert Katzmann]] suggested a link between senile dementia and Alzheimer's disease.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html|title=Drug Trials Test Bold Plan to Slow Alzheimer's|last=Kolata|first=Gina|date=June 17, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=June 17, 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409121141/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/17/health/research/17drug.html|archive-date=April 9, 2012|authorlink=Gina Kolata|name-list-format=vanc}}</ref> Katzmann suggested that much of the senile dementia occurring (by definition) after the age of 65, was pathologically identical with Alzheimer's disease occurring in people under age 65 and therefore should not be treated differently.<ref name=\"Katzman1976\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Katzman R|date=April 1976|title=Editorial: The prevalence and malignancy of Alzheimer disease.

This is shown by documented supercentenarians (people living to 110 or more) who experienced no substantial cognitive impairment. Some evidence suggests that dementia is most likely to develop between ages 80 and 84 and individuals who pass that point without being affected have a lower chance of developing it. Women account for a larger percentage of dementia cases than men, although this can be attributed to their longer overall lifespan and greater odds of attaining an age where the condition is likely to occur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nMuch like other diseases associated with aging, dementia was comparatively rare before the 20th century, because few people lived past 80. Conversely, syphilitic dementia was widespread in the developed world until it was largely  eradicated by the use of [[penicillin]] after [[World War II]]. With significant increases in life expectancy thereafter, the number of people over 65 started rapidly climbing. While elderly persons constituted an average of 3\u20135% of the population prior to 1945, by 2010 many countries reached 10\u201314% and in Germany and Japan, this figure exceeded 20%. Public awareness of Alzheimer's Disease greatly increased in 1994 when former US president [[Ronald Reagan]] announced that he had been diagnosed with the condition.\n\nIn the 21st century, [[Frontotemporal dementia|other types of dementia]] were differentiated from Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementias (the most common types). This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues, by symptomatology, and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as [[SPECT]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PETscans]] of the brain. The various forms have differing prognoses and differing epidemiologic risk factors. The causal etiology of many of them, including Alzheimer's disease, remains unclear.{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Terminology===\nDementia in the elderly was once called ''senile dementia'' or ''senility'', and viewed as a normal and somewhat inevitable aspect of growing old. This terminology is no longer standard.<ref name=\"senility-aa\">{{cite web |title=What is dementia? |url=https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia |publisher=Alzheimer's Association |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Dementia is often incorrectly referred to as \"senility\" or \"senile dementia,\" which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.}}</ref><ref name=\"senility-mednet\">{{cite web |last1=Taylor |first1=Danette C. |title=Dementia |url=https://www.medicinenet.com/dementia/article.htm |publisher=MedicineNet |accessdate=6 August 2018 |quote=Senile dementia (\"senility\") is a term that was once used to describe all dementias; this term is no longer used as a diagnosis.}}</ref>\n\nBy 1913\u201320 the term ''[[dementia praecox]]''  was introduced to suggest the development of senile-type dementia at a younger age. Eventually the two terms fused, so that until 1952 physicians used the terms ''dementia praecox'' (precocious dementia) and ''schizophrenia'' interchangeably. The term ''precocious dementia'' for a mental illness suggested that a type of mental illness like schizophrenia (including [[paranoia]] and decreased cognitive capacity) could be expected to arrive normally in all persons with greater age (see [[paraphrenia]]). After about 1920, the beginning use of ''dementia'' for what is now understood as schizophrenia and senile dementia helped limit the word's meaning to \"permanent, irreversible mental deterioration\". This began the change to the later use of the term.\n\nThe view that dementia must always be the result of a particular disease process led for a time to the proposed  diagnosis of \"senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type\" (SDAT) in persons over the age of 65, with \"Alzheimer's disease\" diagnosed in persons younger than 65 who had the same pathology. Eventually, however, it was agreed that the age limit was artificial, and that ''Alzheimer's disease'' was the appropriate term for persons with that particular brain pathology, regardless of age.\n\nAfter 1952 mental illnesses including schizophrenia were removed from the category of ''[[organic brain syndrome]]s'', and thus (by definition) removed from possible causes of \"dementing illnesses\" (dementias). At the same, however, the traditional cause of senile dementia \u2013 \"hardening of the arteries\" \u2013 now returned as a set of dementias of vascular cause (small strokes). These were now termed ''multi-infarct dementias'' or ''[[vascular dementia]]s''.\n\n==Society and culture==\n[[File:Care at Home with Dementia, Tigray (8015180561).jpg|thumb|Old woman from [[Ethiopia]]]]\nThe societal cost of dementia is high, especially for family caregivers.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brodaty H, Donkin M | title = Family caregivers of people with dementia | journal = Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 217\u201328 | date = 29 April 2017 | pmid = 19585957 | pmc = 3181916 }}</ref>\n\nMany countries consider the care of people living with dementia a national priority and invest in resources and education to better inform health and social service workers, unpaid caregivers, relatives and members of the wider community.

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The [[Executive Director]] runs the day-to-day operations of the group.

Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P. Cohen, ''The History of the Sierra Club, 1892\u20131970'' (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Club's first goals included establishing [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]] and [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]] national parks, convincing the California legislature to give [[Yosemite Valley]] to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s.\n\nMuir escorted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000. Brower resigned from the board in 2000.<ref name=ap00/>\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions. They favored a zero-cut forest policy on public lands and, a few years later, decommissioning Glen Canyon Dam. JMS was successful in changing club positions on both counts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Broydo|first1=Leora|title=Mutiny at the Sierra Club|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/mutiny-sierra-club|accessdate=1 May 2015|publisher=Mother Jones|date=November 3, 1998}}</ref>\n\n=== 21st century ===\nIn 2008, several Sierra Club officers quit in protest after the Sierra Club agreed to promote products by [[Clorox]], which had been named one of a \"dangerous dozen\" chemical companies by the [[Public Interest Research Group]] in 2004.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands.

Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.

In the mid 1990s, the club began gradually stepping away from the immigration restrictionist position, culminating with the board adopting a neutral position on immigration policy in 1996.<ref>Davila, Florangela (February&nbsp;18, 2004). \"[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20040218&slug=sierra18m Immigration dispute spawns factions, anger in Sierra Club]\".

It was founded on May 28, 1892, in [[San Francisco, California]], by the Scottish-American preservationist [[John Muir]], who became its first president. The Sierra Club primarily operates in the United States; an affiliated organization, [[Sierra Club Canada]], operates in Canada and deals exclusively with Canadian issues.\n\nTraditionally associated with the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]], the club was one of the first large-scale environmental preservation organizations in the world, and currently engages in lobbying politicians to promote environmentalist policies. Recent focuses of the club include promoting [[sustainable energy]], mitigating [[global warming]], and [[Beyond Coal|opposing the use of coal]]. The club is known for its political endorsements, which are often sought after by candidates in local elections; it generally supports [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and progressive candidates in elections.\n\nThe Sierra Club is organized on both a national and local level. The club is divided into large chapters representing large geographic areas, some of which have tens of thousands of members. These chapters are divided into regional groups, and special interest sections, committees, and task forces. While much activity is coordinated at a local level, the Club is a unified organization; decisions made at the national level take precedence.\n\nIn addition to political advocacy, the Sierra Club organizes outdoor recreation activities, and has historically been a notable organization for [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]] in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sierraclub.org/about-sierra-club|title=About the Sierra Club|date=2018-10-06|website=Sierra Club|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Members of the Sierra Club pioneered the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] of climbing, and were responsible for a substantial amount of the early development of climbing. Much of this activity occurred in the group's namesake [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The Sierra Club does not set standards for or regulate alpinism, but it organizes wilderness courses, hikes, and occasional alpine expeditions for members. In [[California]], the club, through its outdoor recreation groups, is usually considered the state's analogue to other state mountaineering clubs such as [[Mazamas]] or the [[Colorado Mountain Club]].\n\n== Overview==\nThe Sierra Club's stated mission is \"To explore, enjoy, and protect the wild places of the earth; To practice and promote the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources; To educate and enlist humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to use all lawful means to carry out these objectives.\"<ref name=mission>{{cite web|title=Policies|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/policy|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Sierra Club is governed by a 15-member [[Board of Directors]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Directors|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/board|publisher=Sierra Club|accessdate=1 May 2015}}</ref> Each year, five directors are elected to three-year terms, and all club members are eligible to vote. A president is elected annually by the Board from among its members. The [[Executive Director]] runs the day-to-day operations of the group. [[Michael Brune]], formerly of [[Rainforest Action Network]], has served as the organization's executive director since 2010.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Carl Pope to Step Down as Executive Director of Sierra Club |publisher=Sierra Club |date=January 20, 2010 |url=http://action.sierraclub.org/site/MessageViewer?em_id=154481.0|accessdate=2010-01-20}}</ref> Brune succeeded [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]].

National and local special-interest sections, committees, and task forces address particular issues. The national Sierra Club sets the organization's policy agenda and overarching rules.<ref name=mission/>\n\nThe club is known for engaging in two main activities: promoting and guiding outdoor recreational activities, which is done throughout the United States but primarily in California (especially Southern California), and political activism to promote environmental causes. Richard M. Skinner of the [[Brookings Institution]] describes the Sierra Club as one of the United States' \"leading environmental organizations\". The Sierra Club makes endorsements of individual candidates for elected office, which has substantial weight given the club's reputation and large membership.<ref name=\"Skinner2007\">{{cite book|author=Richard M.

This campaign succeeded in 1890. As early as 1889, Johnson had encouraged Muir to form an \"association\" to help protect the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and preliminary meetings were held to plan the group. Others involved in the early planning included artist [[William Keith (artist)|William Keith]], [[Willis Linn Jepson]], [[Willard Drake Johnson]], [[Joseph LeConte]] and [[David Starr Jordan]].\n\nIn May 1892, a group of professors from the [[University of California at Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Stanford University]] helped Muir and attorney [[Warren Olney]] launch the new organization modeled after the eastern [[Appalachian Mountain Club]]. The Sierra Club's charter members elected Muir president, an office he held until his death in 1914.<ref name=history>Michael P. Cohen, ''The History of the Sierra Club, 1892\u20131970'' (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1988)</ref>\n\nThe Club's first goals included establishing [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier]] and [[Mount Rainier National Park|Mount Rainier]] national parks, convincing the California legislature to give [[Yosemite Valley]] to the U.S. federal government, and preserving California's coastal [[Coast Redwood|redwood]]s.\n\nMuir escorted President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] through Yosemite in 1903, and two years later the California legislature ceded Yosemite Valley and [[Mariposa Grove]] to the federal government. The Sierra Club won its first lobbying victory with the creation of the country's second national park, after [[Yellowstone]] in 1872.<ref name=legacy>Stephen Fox, ''John Muir and His Legacy: The American Conservation Movement (Boston: Little, Brown, 1981), pp. 125\u2013319.</ref>\n\n=== Hetch Hetchy controversy ===\n[[File:Theodore-Roosevelt-and-John-Muir 1906.jpg|thumb|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] and [[John Muir]] in [[Yosemite National Park]], c. 1906]]\n\nIn the first decade of the 1900s, the Sierra Club became embroiled in the  [[Hetch Hetchy Reservoir]] controversy that divided preservationists from \"resource management\" conservationists. In the late 19th century, the city of San Francisco was rapidly outgrowing its limited water supply, which depended on intermittent local springs and streams. In 1890, San Francisco mayor [[James D. Phelan]] proposed to build a dam and aqueduct on the Tuolumne River, one of the largest southern Sierra rivers, as a way to increase and stabilize the city's water supply.<ref name=\"controversy\">{{cite web\n |url        = http://www1.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041230222555/http://www.assumption.edu/users/mcclymer/His130/P-H/hetch%20hetchy/default.html\n |url-status   = dead\n |archive-date = 2004-12-30\n |title      = The Hetch Hetchy Dam Controversy: An Introduction\n |publisher  = Assumption College\n |accessdate = 2013-05-25\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Gifford Pinchot]], a progressive supporter of public utilities and head of the [[US Forest Service]], which then had jurisdiction over the national parks, supported the creation of the Hetch Hetchy dam. Muir appealed to his friend U.S. President Roosevelt, who would not commit himself against the dam, given its popularity with the people of San Francisco (a [[referendum]] in 1908 confirmed a seven-to-one majority in favor of the dam and municipal water). Muir and attorney [[William Edward Colby]] began a national campaign against the dam, attracting the support of many eastern conservationists. With the 1912 election of U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], who carried San Francisco, supporters of the dam had a friend in the White House.\n\nThe bill to dam Hetch Hetchy passed Congress in 1913, and so the Sierra Club lost its first major battle. In retaliation, the Club supported creation of the [[National Park Service]] in 1916, to remove the parks from Forest Service oversight. [[Stephen Mather]], a Club member from Chicago and an opponent of the Hetch Hetchy dam, became the first National Park Service director.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== 1920s\u201340s ===\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, the Sierra Club functioned as a social and recreational society, conducting outings, maintaining trails and building huts and lodges in the Sierras. Preservation campaigns included a several-year effort to enlarge [[Sequoia National Park]] (achieved in 1926) and over three decades of work to protect and then preserve [[Kings Canyon National Park]] (established in 1940). Historian Stephen Fox notes, \"In the 1930s most of the three thousand members were middle-aged Republicans.\"<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe [[New Deal]] brought many conservationists to the Democratic Party, and many Democrats entered the ranks of conservationists. Leading the generation of [[Young Turks (U.S. politics)|Young Turks]] who revitalized the Sierra Club after World War II were attorneys [[Richard M. Leonard|Richard Leonard]] and [[Bestor Robinson]], nature photographer [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David Brower]].\n\nAdams sponsored Brower for membership in the Club, and he was appointed to the editorial board of the ''Sierra Club Bulletin.'' After [[World War II]] Brower returned to his job with the University of California Press, and began editing the ''Sierra Club Bulletin'' in 1946.<ref name=legacy />\n\n===National reach===\n\nIn 1950, the Sierra Club had some 7,000 members, mostly on the West Coast. That year the Atlantic chapter became the first formed outside California. An active volunteer board of directors ran the organization, assisted by a small clerical staff. Brower was appointed the first executive director in 1952, and the Club began to catch up with major conservation organizations such as the [[National Audubon Society]], [[National Wildlife Federation]], [[The Wilderness Society (United States)|The Wilderness Society]], and [[Izaak Walton League]], which had long had professional staff.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club secured its national reputation in the battle against the [[Echo Park Dam]] in [[Dinosaur National Monument]] in [[Utah]], which had been announced by the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] in 1950. Brower led the fight, marshaling support from other conservation groups. Brower's background in publishing proved decisive; with the help of publisher Alfred Knopf, ''This Is Dinosaur'' was rushed into press. Invoking the specter of Hetch Hetchy, conservationists effectively lobbied Congress, which deleted the Echo Park dam from the [[Colorado River]] project as approved in 1955. Recognition of the Sierra Club's role in the Echo Park dam victory boosted membership from 10,000 in 1956 to 15,000 in 1960.<ref name=legacy />\n\nThe Sierra Club was now truly a national conservation organization, and preservationists took the offensive with wilderness proposals. The Club's Biennial Wilderness Conferences, launched in 1949 in concert with The Wilderness Society, became an important force in the campaign that secured passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.<ref name=legacy />\n\n=== Book series ===\n\nIn 1960, Brower launched the Exhibit Format book series with ''This Is the American Earth'', and in 1962 ''In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World'', with color photographs by [[Eliot Porter]]. These coffee-table books, published by their [[Sierra Club Books]] division, introduced the Sierra Club to a wider audience. Fifty thousand copies were sold in the first four years, and by 1960 sales exceeded $10 million. Soon Brower was publishing two new titles a year in the Exhibit Format series, but not all did as well as ''In Wildness.'' Although the books were successful in introducing the public to wilderness preservation and the Sierra Club, they lost money for the organization, some $60,000 a year after 1964. Financial management became a matter of contention between Brower and his board of directors.<ref name=legacy/>\n\n=== Grand Canyon campaign ===\n\nThe Sierra Club's most publicized crusade of the 1960s was the effort to stop the Bureau of Reclamation from building two dams that would flood portions of the [[Grand Canyon]]. Opposing the [[Bridge Canyon Dam|Bridge Canyon]] and [[Marble Canyon Dam|Marble Canyon]] dam projects, full-page ads the Club placed in the ''New York Times'' and the ''Washington Post'' in 1966 exclaimed, \"This time it's the Grand Canyon they want to flood,\" and asked, \"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\" The ads generated a storm of protest to the Congress, prompting the [[Internal Revenue Service]] to announce it was suspending the Sierra Club's [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] status pending an investigation. The board had taken the precaution of setting up the [[Sierra Club Foundation]] as a (c)(3) organization in 1960 for endowments and contributions for educational and other non-lobbying activities.<ref name=history/> Even so, contributions to the Club dropped off, aggravating its annual operating deficits. Membership, however, climbed sharply in response to the investigation into the legitimacy of the society's tax status by the IRS from 30,000 in 1965 to 57,000 in 1967 and 75,000 in 1969.\n\nThe victory over the dam projects and challenges from the IRS did not come without costs. To make up for the power that would have been produced by the dams, the Sierra Club actually advocated for coal power plants. The result of the campaign and its trade-off was, in the words of historian Andrew Needham, that \"the Grand Canyon became protected, sacred space,\" while \"the Navajo Reservation\"\u2014which housed some of the main power plants picking up the slack \u2013 \"became increasingly industrial.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = Power Lines: Phoenix and the Making of the Modern Southwest|last = Needham|first = Andrew|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 9781400852406|location = Princeton, NJ|pages = 211}}</ref>\n\n=== End of the Brower era ===\n\nDespite the Club's success in blocking plans for the Grand Canyon dams and weathering the transition from 501(c)(3) to [[501(c)#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4)]] status, tension grew over finances between Brower and the board of directors. The Club's annual deficits rose from $100,000 in 1967 and 1968 to some $200,000 in 1969. Another conflict occurred over the Club's policy toward the nuclear power plant to be constructed by [[Pacific Gas and Electric]] (PG&E) at [[Diablo Canyon Power Plant|Diablo Canyon]] near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]. Although the Club had played the leading role blocking PG&E's nuclear power plant proposed for [[Bodega Bay, California]] in the early 1960s, that case had been built around the local environmental impact and earthquake danger from the nearby [[San Andreas fault]], not from opposition to nuclear power itself. In exchange for moving the new proposed site from the environmentally sensitive Nipomo Dunes to Diablo Canyon, the board of directors voted to support PG&E's plan for the power plant. A membership referendum in 1967 upheld the board's decision. But Brower concluded that nuclear power at any location was a mistake, and he voiced his opposition to the plant, contrary to the Club's official policy. As pro- and anti-Brower factions polarized, the annual election of new directors reflected the conflict. Brower's supporters won a majority in 1968, but in the April 1969 election the anti-Brower candidates won all five open positions. Ansel Adams and president Richard Leonard, two of his closest friends on the board, led the opposition to Brower, charging him with financial recklessness and insubordination and calling for his ouster as executive director. The board voted ten to five to accept Brower's resignation.<ref name=history/> Eventually reconciled with the Club, Brower was elected to the board of directors for a term from 1983 to 1988, and again from 1995 to 2000.\n\n=== McCloskey years ===\n\nMichael McCloskey, hired by Brower in 1961 as the Club's first northwest field representative, became the Club's second executive director in 1969. An administrator attentive to detail, McCloskey had set up the Club's conservation department in 1965 and guided the campaigns to save the Grand Canyon and establish [[Redwoods National Park]] and [[North Cascades National Park]]. During the 1970s, McCloskey led the Club's legislative activity\u2014preserving [[Alaska]]n lands and eastern wilderness areas, and supporting the new environmental agenda: the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976, the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] amendments, and the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act]] of 1977, passed during the administration of President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Sierra Club made its first presidential endorsement in 1984 in support of [[Walter Mondale]]'s unsuccessful campaign to unseat [[Ronald Reagan]]. McCloskey resigned as executive director in 1985 after 16-1/2 years (the same length of time Brower had led the organization), and assumed the title of chairman, becoming the Club's senior strategist, devoting his time to conservation policy rather than budget planning and administration.<ref>Michael McCloskey, ''In the Thick of It: My Life in the Sierra Club'' (Washington, DC: Island Press, 2000), pp. 99\u2013248.</ref> After a two-year interlude with Douglas Wheeler, whose Republican credentials were disconcerting to liberal members, the Club hired Michael Fischer, the former head of the [[California Coastal Commission]], who served as executive director from 1987 to 1992. [[Carl Pope (environmentalist)|Carl Pope]], formerly the Club's legislative director, was named executive director in 1992.\n\n=== Lobbying within the club ===\n\nIn the 1990s, club members Jim Bensman, Roger Clarke, David Dilworth, Chad Hanson and David Orr along with about 2,000 members formed the John Muir Sierrans (JMS), an internal caucus, to promote changes to club positions.

The annual [[High Trips]] were led by [[Mountaineering|mountaineers]]  such as [[Francis P. Farquhar]], [[Joseph Nisbet LeConte]], [[Norman Clyde]], [[Walter A. Starr, Jr.]], [[Jules Eichorn]], [[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]], [[Ansel Adams]], and [[David R. Brower]]. A number of [[first ascent]]s  in the Sierra Nevada were made on Sierra Club outings. Sierra Club members were also early enthusiasts of rock climbing. In 1911, the first chapter was formed, Angeles, and it began conducting local excursions in the mountains surrounding [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and throughout the West.\n\nMany major innovations in mountaineering have come from Sierra Club members. [[Norman Clyde]] and [[Jules Eichorn]], considered among the most famous members of the club, completed many first ascents of peaks in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].\n\n[[Glen Dawson (mountaineer)|Glen Dawson]] and [[Royal Robbins]], often on trips sponsored and organized by the Rock Climbing Section of the Angeles Chapter, opened up much of the [[Tahquitz Peak]] area to climbing, which at the time was said to contain some of the hardest routes in the world. The [[Yosemite Decimal System]], the primary method of rating a route's difficulty used in the United States, was developed into its modern form at Tahquitz.\n\n[[Steve Roper]]'s ''[[Fifty Classic Climbs of North America]]'', sponsored and published by the Sierra Club, is still considered one of the definitive rock climbing guidebooks in the United States.\n\nDue to an increasing focus on political activity and concerns about financial liability, mountaineering activity in the Sierra Club has subsided since the 1980s. Some chapters, mostly in California, continue to maintain large mountaineering programs.\n\nThe club currently occasionally awards the [[Francis P. Farquhar Mountaineering Award]] to outstanding member mountaineers.\n\n===Hiking and Outings===\nIn [[World War II]], a number of Sierra Club leaders joined the [[10th Mountain Division (United States)|10th Mountain Division]].<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\">{{cite web|url=http://sierraclub.org/outings/ |title=Outings |publisher=Sierra Club |accessdate=2012-04-01}}</ref> Among them was [[David R.

These outings form a major part of Sierra Club culture, and in some chapters, constitute the majority of member activity.<ref name=\"http://sierraclub.org/outings\" /> Other chapters, however, may sponsor very few outdoor or recreational activities, being focused solely on political advocacy.

Uniquely for a progressive organization, the Sierra Club has strong grassroots organization in rural areas, with much activity focused on ensuring equitable and environmentally-friendly use of public lands.

Ehrlich|Anne]],<ref name=monitor/> wanted to take the Club into the contentious field of [[immigration to the United States]]. The Club's position was that [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] was a significant factor in the degradation of the environment. Accordingly, the Club supported stabilizing and reducing U.S. and world population. Some members argued that, as a practical matter, U.S. population could not be stabilized, let alone reduced, at the then-current levels of immigration. They urged the Club to support [[immigration reduction]]. The Club had previously addressed the issue of \"mass immigration\",<ref>\"[http://www.susps.org/history/scpolicy.html#ihist Sierra Club Policy: Immigration Policy History].\" SUSPS. Accessed 14 May 2008.</ref> and in 1988, the organization's Population Committee and Conservation Coordinating Committee stated that immigration to the U.S. should be limited, so as to achieve population stabilization.<ref>Kunofsky, Judy. \"[http://www.susps.org/history/popreport1989.html Sierra Club, U.S. Population Growth, and Immigration].\" ''Sierra Club Population Report''.

Historically, each is a successor to one of the previous [[Australian colonies]]. Each state has its own constitution, with its own legislature (parliament), judiciary and executive.  The state parliaments have [[plenary power|plenary]] legislative power, except that some areas of legislative power are exclusive to the Federal Parliament, many others are exercised concurrently with it and, in case of conflict between federal and state legislation, the federal legislation prevails.  A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures.

(The territory was previously known as [[German New Guinea]], between 1884 and 1914; it was formally under Australian military occupation, in 1914\u20131920.)\nIn 1949, the combined [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was created, although both the two territories remained technically distinct, for some administrative and legal purposes, until 1975, when the combined entity became independent.\n\n'''Nauru''', 1920\u20131968<br>\nThe Australian government received a League of Nations [[History of Nauru|mandate for Nauru]], following World War I.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]], Papua, New Guinea and Nauru were controlled by the Australian government as [[United Nations trust territories]]. The ''[[Papua and New Guinea Act 1949]]'' placed the Territory of New Guinea in an \"administrative union\" with the Territory of Papua. The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975. Nauru was granted independence in 1968.\n\n== Background and overview ==\n[[File:Australia history.gif|frameless|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nThe states originated as separate [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonies prior to [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H. McLintock (ed), ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders.

A decision of a state judiciary is subject to appeal to the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]].\n\nThere are also ten '''territories''', whose existence and governmental structure (if any) depend on federal legislation.  The territories are distinguished for federal administrative purposes between ''internal'' territories, i.e. those within the Australian mainland, and ''external'' territories, although the differences among all the territories relate to population rather than location.\n\nTwo of the three ''internal'' territories{{mdash}}the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT), which was established to be a neutral site of the federal capital, and the [[Northern Territory]]{{mdash}}function almost as states.  Each has self-government, through its legislative assembly, but the assembly's legislation can be federally overridden.  Each has its own judiciary, with appeal to a federal court.  The third internal territory, the [[Jervis Bay Territory]], is the product of Australia's complex relationship with its capital city; rather than having the same level of autonomy as the other internal territories, it has services provided by the ACT.\n\nThere are also seven ''external'' territories, not part of the Australian mainland or of any state. Three of them have a small permanent population, two have tiny and transient populations, and two are uninhabited.  All are directly administered by the federal [[Department of Infrastructure, Regional Development and Cities]] (or the [[Department of the Environment and Energy]] in the case of the [[Australian Antarctic Territory]]). [[Norfolk Island]], which is permanently populated, was partially self-governing until 2015.\n\nThe term \"'''interstate'''\" is used within Australia to refer to any cross-border events, transactions, or travel.\n\n== Geographic Australia ==\nThe term ''geographic Australia'' is used by the Australian government to describe the area covered by demographic statistics such as national population figures. This area comprises [[Christmas Island]] and the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]] in addition to the six states and three mainland territories; Norfolk Island is the only territory with a permanent population that is not part of geographic Australia.<ref>{{Cite report | first=Brian | last=Pink | authorlink=Brian_Pink  | year=2010  | title=Australian Standard Geographical Classification (ASGC) | publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics | section=Definition of Australia | sectionurl=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/58B39EB886CFC607CA25779F00172F75?opendocument | page=5}}</ref>\n\n== States and territories ==\n{{Administrative divisions of Australia}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;font-size:90%\"\n|-\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| Reference map for states and territories of Australia\n|-\n|[[File:Australia states and territories labelled.svg|frameless|upright=2.75]]\n|}\n{{anchor|Table}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ style=\"text-align:center;background:#BFD7FF\"| States of Australia<ref group=\"n\">Unless provided, references and details on data provided in the table can be found within the individual state and territory articles.</ref>\n|-\n!class=\"unsortable\"|[[List of Australian flags#States and territories|Flag]]\n!

The [[Territory of Papua and New Guinea]] was eventually given independence as [[Papua New Guinea]] in 1975. Nauru was granted independence in 1968.\n\n== Background and overview ==\n[[File:Australia history.gif|frameless|upright=1.5|right]]\n\nThe states originated as separate [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] colonies prior to [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in 1901. The [[Colony of New South Wales]] was founded in 1788 and originally comprised much of the Australian mainland, as well as [[Lord Howe Island]], [[Colony of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Norfolk Island]], and [[Van Diemen's Land]], in addition to the area currently referred to as the state of New South Wales. During the 19th century, large areas were successively separated to form the [[Colony of Tasmania]] (initially established as a separate colony named [[Van Diemen's Land]] in 1825), the [[History of Western Australia#British Colony|Colony of Western Australia]] (initially established as the smaller [[Swan River Colony]] in 1829), the [[History of South Australia#The Proclamation of South Australia .281836.29|Province of South Australia]] (1836), the [[Colony of New Zealand]] (1840),<ref>A.H. McLintock (ed), ''An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand'', 3 vols, Wellington, NZ:R.E. Owen, Government Printer, 1966, vol 3 p. 526.'</ref> the [[Victoria (Australia)#Creation of separate colony of Victoria|Victoria Colony]] (1851) and the [[Queensland#Colony of Queensland|Colony of Queensland]] (1859). Upon Federation, the six colonies of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania became the founding states of the new Commonwealth of Australia.\n\nLegislative powers of the states are protected by the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], section 107, and under the principle of [[federalism]], [[Federalism in Australia|Commonwealth legislation only applies to the states where permitted by the constitution]]. The territories, by contrast, are from a constitutional perspective directly subject to the [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]]; laws for territories are determined by the Australian Parliament.<ref>Constitution of Australia, section 122</ref>\n\nMost of the territories are directly administered by the Commonwealth Government, while two (the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory) have some degree of self-government although less than that of the states. In the self-governing territories, the Australian Parliament retains the full power to legislate, and can override laws made by the territorial institutions, which it has done on rare occasions. For the purposes of Australian (and joint Australia-New Zealand) intergovernmental bodies, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory are treated as if they were states.\n\nEach state has a [[Governors of the Australian states|governor]], appointed by [[Monarchy of Australia|the monarch]] (currently Queen [[Elizabeth II]]), which by convention she does on the advice of the state premier. The Administrator of the Northern Territory, by contrast, is appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]]. The Australian Capital Territory has neither a Governor nor an Administrator, but the Governor-General exercises some powers that in other jurisdictions are exercised by the Governor of a state or Administrator of a territory, such as the power to dissolve the Legislative Assembly.\n\n[[Jervis Bay Territory]] is the only non-self-governing internal territory. Until 1989, it was administered as if it were a part of the ACT, although it has always been a separate territory.  Under the terms of the ''Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915'',<ref>[https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2004C00038 Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (Cth)].</ref> the laws of the ACT apply to the Jervis Bay Territory insofar as they are applicable and providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance.<ref>{{cite web |title= Jervis Bay Territory Governance and Administration |url= http://www.regional.gov.au/territories/jervis_bay/governanceadministration.aspx |quote= Although the Jervis Bay Territory is not part of the Australian Capital Territory, the laws of the ACT apply, insofar as they are applicable and, providing they are not inconsistent with an Ordinance, in the Territory by virtue of the 'Jervis Bay Acceptance Act 1915' |publisher= The Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport |accessdate= 17 January 2013}}</ref> Although residents of the Jervis Bay Territory are generally subject to laws made by the ACT Legislative Assembly, they are not represented in the Assembly. They are represented in the [[Parliament of Australia]] as part of the Electoral [[Division of Fraser (Australian Capital Territory)|Division of Fraser]] in the ACT and by the ACT's two Senators. In other respects, the territory is administered directly by the Federal Government through the Territories portfolio.\n\nThe external territory of [[Norfolk Island]] possessed a degree of self-government from 1979 until 2015.\n\nEach state has a [[bicameral]] parliament except Queensland, which abolished its upper house in 1922. The lower house is called the Legislative Assembly, except in South Australia and Tasmania, where it is called the House of Assembly. Tasmania is the only state to use [[proportional representation]] for elections to its lower house; all others elect members from single member constituencies, using [[instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]]. The upper house is called the Legislative Council and is generally elected from multi-member constituencies using proportional representation. The three self-governing territories, the ACT, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island, each have [[unicameral]] Legislative Assemblies.\n\nThe head of government of each state is called the premier, appointed by the state's Governor. In normal circumstances, the Governor will appoint as premier whoever leads the party or coalition which exercises control of the lower house (in the case of Queensland, the only house) of the state Parliament. However, in times of [[constitutional crisis]], the Governor can appoint someone else as Premier. The head of government of the self-governing internal territories is called the chief minister. The Northern Territory's chief minister, in normal circumstances whoever controls the Legislative Assembly, is appointed by the administrator.\n\nThe term \"interstate\" is used within Australia to refer to a number of events, transactions, registrations, travel, etc. which occurs across borders or outside of the particular state or territory of the user of the term. Examples of use include motor vehicle registration,<ref>{{cite web|website=sa.gov.au|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=https://www.sa.gov.au/topics/driving-and-transport/registration/vehicle-registration/driving-an-interstate-registered-vehicle|title=Interstate-registered vehicles|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> travel,<ref>{{cite web|website=Public Transport Victoria|url=https://www.ptv.vic.gov.au/more/travelling-on-the-network/interstate-travel/|title=Interstate travel|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref> applications to educational institutions out of one's home state.<ref>{{cite web|website=VTAC|url=https://www.vtac.edu.au/applying/courses/interstate.html|title=Applying interstate|access-date=18 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThere are very few urban areas bifurcated by state/territory borders.

{"title_page": "Wilson's Raid", "text_new": "{{Campaignbox Wilson's Raid in Alabama and Georgia}}\n'''Wilson's Raid''' was a [[cavalry]] operation through [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in March&ndash;April 1865, late in the [[American Civil War]]. [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James H. Wilson]] led his [[Union Army]] Cavalry Corps to destroy [[Southern United States|Southern]] manufacturing facilities and was opposed unsuccessfully by a much smaller force under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].\n\n==Background and opposing forces==\nAfter his victory at the [[Battle of Nashville]], Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George H. Thomas]] and his [[Army of the Cumberland]] found themselves with virtually no organized military opposition in the heart of the South. Thomas ordered Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson (who commanded the Cavalry Corps of the [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], but was attached to Thomas's army) to lead a [[Raid (military)|raid]] to destroy the [[arsenal]] at [[Selma, Alabama]], in conjunction with Maj. Gen. [[Edward Canby]]'s operations against [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. Selma was strategically important as one of the few Confederate military bases remaining in Southern hands. The town contained an arsenal, a [[Confederate Navy|naval]] [[foundry]], gun factories, a [[Gunpowder|powder]] mill, military warehouses, and railroad repair shops.\n\nWilson led approximately 13,500 men in three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. [[Edward M. McCook]], [[Eli Long]], and [[Emory Upton]]. Each cavalryman was armed with the formidable 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle]]. His principal opponent was Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, whose Cavalry Corps of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana consisted of about 2,500 troopers organized into two small divisions, led by Brig. Gens. [[James R. Chalmers]] and [[William Hicks Jackson|William H. Jackson]], two partial brigades under Brig. Gen. [[Philip D. Roddey]] and Colonel [[Edward Crossland]], and a few local [[Militia (United States)|militia]].\n\n==Raid==\nWilson was delayed in crossing the rain-swollen [[Tennessee River]], but he got underway on March 22, 1865, departing from Gravelly Springs in [[Lauderdale County, Alabama]]. He sent his forces in three separate columns to mask his intentions and confuse the enemy; Forrest learned very late in the raid that Selma was the primary target. Minor skirmishes occurred at [[Houston, Alabama|Houston]] (March 25) and [[Black Warrior River]] (March 26), and Wilson's columns rejoined at [[Jasper, Alabama|Jasper]] on March 27.\n\n[[File:University of Alabama 1859.jpg|thumb|400px|View of [[University of Alabama Quad|the Quad]] at the [[University of Alabama]] in 1859.

All of these buildings were destroyed during Wilson's Raid on April 4, 1865.]]\nOn March 28, at [[Elyton]], in present-day [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], another skirmish occurred and the Union troopers destroyed the Oxmoor and Irondale iron furnaces. A detachment of General Emory Upton's division destroyed the C.B. Churchill and Company foundry in [[Columbiana, Alabama|Columbiana]]<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuZYAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=cb+churchill+columbiana+alabama&source=bl&ots=uKrm8SpCQ0&sig=ciGIQd6G_kXFr2k-ONjyFjYc-UQ&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e0GgU86SKYewyASozILwDA&ved=0CEIQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=cb%20churchill%20columbiana%20alabama&f=false |title=The story of coal and iron in Alabama - Ethel Armes - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-17}}</ref> and the [[Shelby Iron Company|Shelby Iron Works]] in [[Shelby, Alabama|Shelby]] on March 31, 1865.<ref>http://www.bhamwiki.com/wiki/index.php?title=Shelby_Furnace</ref>\n\n===Tuscaloosa===\nWilson also detached a 1,500 man brigade under Brig. Gen. [[John T. Croxton]] and sent them south and west to burn the [[Roupes Valley Ironworks]] at [[Tannehill Ironworks|Tannehill]] and [[Brierfield Furnace|Bibb Naval Furnace]] at [[Brierfield, Alabama|Brierfield]] on March 31. They then burned the [[University of Alabama]] in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]], which was a prominent military school, on April 4.<ref>Jones, p. 60</ref> This movement diverted Chalmer's division away from Forrest's main force.\n\n===Selma===\nOn March 31, Forrest was routed by the larger, better-armed Union force at [[Montevallo, Alabama|Montevallo]]. The cavalrymen under Chalmers had not arrived to reinforce Forrest, but he could not wait. During the action, Forrest's headquarters were overrun and documents captured that gave valuable intelligence concerning his plans. Wilson dispatched McCook to link up with Croxton's brigade at [[Vance, Alabama|Trion]] (now Vance) and then led the remainder of his force rapidly toward Selma. Forrest made a stand on April 1 at [[Plantersville, Alabama|Plantersville]], near Ebenezer Church, and was routed once again at the [[Battle of Ebenezer Church]]. The Confederates raced toward Selma and deployed into a three-mile, semicircular defensive line anchored at both ends by the [[Alabama River]].\n\nThe [[Battle of Selma]] took place on April 2. The divisions of Long and Upton assaulted Forrest's hastily constructed works. The dismounted Union troopers broke through by afternoon, after brief periods of [[hand-to-hand combat]]; the inexperienced militiamen abandoning their positions and fleeing was the primary reason for the entire line breaking. General Wilson personally led a mounted charge of the [[4th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|4th U.S. Cavalry]] against an unfinished portion of the line. General Long was severely wounded in the head during the assault. Forrest, who was also wounded, and whose tiny corps was severely damaged, regrouped at [[Marion, Alabama|Marion]], where he finally rejoined Chalmers. Wilson's men worked for over a week at destroying military facilities.  From there, Wilson's forces moved toward [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], which they occupied on April 12.\n\n===West Point===\nDespite [[Robert E. Lee]]'s April 9 surrender of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]] following the [[Battle of Appomattox Court House]], the [[Army of Tennessee]] under the command of Gen [[Joseph E. Johnston]] had not yet surrendered the Confederate forces in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida.  Wilson's plan was to head east into Georgia to destroy the remaining arsenals and munitions, and to cause any remaining local forces to \"disintegrate.\"<ref>Jones, pp. 117-8</ref> Wilson's success in this plan would be accelerated if his forces could secure at least one of several key bridges over the Chattahoochee River.  One such bridge led into the town of West Point. To avoid any delay in the raid, Wilson separated his force sending a 3,700-man detachment under Colonel [[Oscar Hugh La Grange]] to capture both the bridge and the town.<ref>\"Out of the Storm: The End of the Civil War, April\u2013June 1865\" by Noah Andre Trudeau</ref>  Simultaneously, Wilson ordered Upton's division to rush toward another strategically important bridge at Columbus, Georgia. \n\nThe [[Battle of West Point]], Georgia, was fought on Easter Sunday, April 16, when Colonel [[Oscar Hugh La Grange]]'s brigade attacked an earthwork defensive position named Fort Tyler that was defended by a couple hundred young men and teenaged Confederates under CS Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Tyler]]. Determined to fight to the last ditch, the Confederates fought a wave of dismounted Union troops. The Confederates did not stand a chance as they were largely outnumbered and poorly armed, whereas the Federals were armed with repeaters. The Union soldiers crossed over a ditch while the rebels hurled primitive hand-grenades and fired their weapons.<ref>Trudeau, pp. 253-54</ref> Although the Union men had to assault under the fire of one 32-pounder gun and two 12-pounders inside the earthwork, the fort was captured. Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Robert C. Tyler]] was mortally wounded by a sharpshooter, becoming the last general officer to be killed in the Civil War.\n\nThe defense of West Point was doomed to fail, and had done so. With rebel prisoners, the fort, and bridge in his hands, La Grange moved out to rejoin Wilson. The battle had been won for the Union at a cost of 36 casualties both killed and wounded. The Confederates had lost 18 men killed, 28 wounded, and the remainder captured. With most of the dead southerners in the fort, one Yankee artilleryman said the dead Confederates wore \"an awful look.\"<ref>Trudeau, pp. 254</ref>\n\n===Columbus===\nIn a separate battle on Easter Sunday, April 16, Wilson was victorious in the [[Battle of Columbus, Georgia]], in which Upton's division clashed with Confederate forces at [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], capturing the city and its naval works and burning, then scuttling the incomplete [[ironclad]] [[Naval ram|ram]], [[CSS Muscogee|CSS ''Jackson'']]. This engagement is widely regarded as the \"Last Battle of the Civil War.\"<ref>[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bellware/ Civil War Times, April 2003]</ref><ref>[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bellware/paper.html \"The Last Battle of The Civil War,\" by Charles Swift.]</ref> On April 20, Wilson's men captured [[Macon, Georgia]], without resistance, and Wilson's Raid came to an end.  This was only six days before General [[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s surrender of all Confederate troops in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida to [[William Tecumseh Sherman]], in North Carolina.\n\n==Aftermath and capture of Jefferson Davis==\nWilson's Raid had been a spectacular success. His men captured five fortified cities, 288 cannons, and 6,820 prisoners, at a cost of 725 Union casualties. Forrest's casualties, from a much smaller force, numbered 1,200. The raid was done without the disastrous [[collateral damage]] that characterized [[Sherman's March to the Sea]] of the previous year. Residents accused Wilson's men of sacking Selma after the battle, but the damage there came from many sources including street combat that continued into the night, as well as 35,000 bales of cotton and the Central Commercial Warehouse fired by Confederates as the city fell.  Some Union soldiers and newly liberated former slaves did engage in plunder.  After the first night, Wilson re-established discipline.<ref>Jones, pp. 92-96</ref>\n\nUpon conclusion of the raid, and following the surrender of all of the Confederate forces east of the [[Chattahoochee River]] by Johnston to Sherman, the hostilities in the theater ended.  However, the pursuit of fleeing officials of the Confederate government commenced as Wilson's forces fanned out through the region.  Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] was captured on May 10, 1865, near [[Irwinville, Georgia]].<ref>Jones, pp. 170-176</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[David J.

[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig. Gen.]] [[James H. Wilson]] led his [[Union Army]] Cavalry Corps to destroy [[Southern United States|Southern]] manufacturing facilities and was opposed unsuccessfully by a much smaller force under [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]].\n\n==Background and opposing forces==\nAfter his victory at the [[Battle of Nashville]], Union [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[George H. Thomas]] and his [[Army of the Cumberland]] found themselves with virtually no organized military opposition in the heart of the South. Thomas ordered Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson (who commanded the Cavalry Corps of the [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], but was attached to Thomas's army) to lead a [[Raid (military)|raid]] to destroy the [[arsenal]] at [[Selma, Alabama]], in conjunction with Maj. Gen. [[Edward Canby]]'s operations against [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. Selma was strategically important as one of the few Confederate military bases remaining in Southern hands. The town contained an arsenal, a [[Confederate Navy|naval]] [[foundry]], gun factories, a [[Gunpowder|powder]] mill, military warehouses, and railroad repair shops.\n\nWilson led approximately 13,500 men in three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. [[Edward M. McCook]], [[Eli Long]], and [[Emory Upton]]. Each cavalryman was armed with the formidable 7-shot [[Spencer repeating rifle]]. His principal opponent was Lt. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, whose Cavalry Corps of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana consisted of about 2,500 troopers organized into two small divisions, led by Brig. Gens. [[James R. Chalmers]] and [[William Hicks Jackson|William H. Jackson]], two partial brigades under Brig. Gen. [[Philip D. Roddey]] and Colonel [[Edward Crossland]], and a few local [[Militia (United States)|militia]].\n\n==Raid==\nWilson was delayed in crossing the rain-swollen [[Tennessee River]], but he got underway on March 22, 1865, departing from Gravelly Springs in [[Lauderdale County, Alabama]].
