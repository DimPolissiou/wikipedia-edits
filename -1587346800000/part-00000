She was named after her father and Queen [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], her great-great-grandmother and the consort of [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\nOriginally known as ''Madame Quatri\u00e8me'', signifying the fourth daughter of the King (an older sister had died in February 1733, before her birth), she was later known as ''Madame Victoire''. She outlived eight of her nine siblings, and was survived by her older sister [[Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France|Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] by less than a year. The sisters were collectively known as ''[[Mesdames]]''.\n\n==Life==\n'''Marie Louise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Victoire de France''' was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Unlike the older children of Louis XV, Madame Victoire was not raised at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Rather, she was, in June 1738, sent to live at the [[Abbey of Fontevraud]] with her younger sisters, because the cost of raising them in Versailles with all the status they were entitled to was deemed too expensive by [[Cardinal Fleury]], Louis XV's chief minister. She remained there till 1748 when she was 15.\n\nAccording to [[Madame Campan]], the Mesdames had rather a traumatic upbringing in Fontrevault and were not given much education: \"Cardinal Fleury, who in truth had the merit of re-establishing the finances, carried this system of economy so far as to obtain from the King the suppression of the household of the four younger Princesses. They were brought up as mere boarders in a convent eighty leagues distant from the Court. Saint Cyr would have been more suitable for the reception of the King\u2019s daughters; but probably the Cardinal shared some of those prejudices which will always attach to even the most useful institutions, and which, since the death of Louis XIV., had been raised against the noble establishment of Madame de Maintenon. Madame Louise often assured me that at twelve years of age she was not mistress of the whole alphabet, and never learnt to read fluently until after her return to Versailles. Madame Victoire attributed certain paroxysms of terror, which she was never able to conquer, to the violent alarms she experienced at the Abbey of Fontevrault, whenever she was sent, by way of penance, to pray alone in the vault where the sisters were interred. A gardener belonging to the abbey died raving mad. His habitation, without the walls, was near a chapel of the abbey, where Mesdames were taken to repeat the prayers for those in the agonies of death. Their prayers were more than once interrupted by the shrieks of the dying man.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">Madame Campan, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3891/3891-h/3891-h.htm Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France]'', [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\n===Reign of Louis XV===\nOn 24 March 1748, being fifteen and no longer regarded a child, Victoire wrote to her father the king and successfully asked permission to return to court.\nLouis XV appointed three maids-of-honour to attend her, sent the Marie-Ang\u00e9lique-Victoire de Bournonville, duchesse de Duras to collect her and met her with her brother the crown prince at Sceaux.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\">{{cite book |last=Latour |first=Louis Therese |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.66391/ |title=Princesses Ladies and Salonni\u00e8res of the Reign of Louis XV |year=1927 |translator-first=Ivy E. |translator-last=Clegg |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.}}</ref>  In November 1750, she was joined by her sisters Sophie and Louise.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  \n\nUpon their arrival at court, they were not included in to the household of their elders sisters Henriette and Adelaide, the Household of the ''Mesdames a\u00een\u00e9es'' ('Elder Mesdames') but was given their own Household of the ''Mesdames cadettes'' ('Younger Mesdames') headed by Marie-Ang\u00e9lique-Victoire de Bournonville, duchesse de Duras. <ref>Luynes (Charles-Philippe d\u2019Albert, duc de), M\u00e9moires du duc de Luynes sur la cour de Louis XV (1735-1758), publi\u00e9s sous le patronage de M. le duc de Luynes par Louis Dussieux et Eudore Souli\u00e9, Paris, Firmin Didot, 1860-1865, 17 vol.</ref> \n\n[[File:Nivelon or Fr\u00e9dou - Victoire of France.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Victoire by Nivelon]]\nWhile their education had been neglected in the convent, they reportedly compensated for this and studied extensively after their return to court, encouraged by their brother, with whom they immediately formed a close attachment: \"When Mesdames, still very young, returned to Court, they enjoyed the friendship of Monseigneur the Dauphin, and profited by his advice. They devoted themselves ardently to study, and gave up almost the whole of their time to it; they enabled themselves to write French correctly, and acquired a good knowledge of history. Italian, English, the higher branches of mathematics, turning and dialing, filled up in succession their leisure moments.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nVictoire made a success at court and her father with her lively self-assurance and charm; she was also regarded to be a beauty and was described \"Madame Victoire was handsome and very graceful; her address, mien, and smile were in perfect accordance with the goodness of her heart\",<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> and \"her beautiful, tender, soft brown eyes, fresh complexion [...] and a bright smile gave the impression of happiness and health, which, together with her desire to please, radiated from her whole personality\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  In 1753, it was suggested that she might eventually marry her brother-in-law, [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]], as his wife, [[Barbara of Portugal]] was seriously ill at the time and expected to die. However, the Queen of Spain survived her illness and lived another five years. No other marriage partner of suitable religion and status was found, and Victoire remained unmarried: with time, she became quite overweight, and because of this, her father the King came to refer to her as \u2018Coche\u2019 [Piggy], while he called Madame Adelaide \u2018Logue\u2019 [Tatters], Madame Sophie, \u2018Graille\u2019 [Mite], and Madame Louise, \u2018Chiffie\u2019 [Rubbish].<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nVictoire, as her sisters, had a close relationship with her brother, viewed her mother as a role model, and followed her sister Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde in her campaign against the influence of [[Madame de Pompadour]] and, later, [[Madame du Barry]]. She also had a close friendship with her favourite lady-in-waiting the Marquise de Durfort, who \"afforded to Madame Victoire agreeable society. The Princess spent almost all her evenings with that lady, and ended by fancying herself domiciled with her.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> In contrast to her elder sister Adelaide, Victoire was described as \"good, sweet-tempered, and affable\", and well liked both by society and her staff.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nIn 1761, Victoire visited the waters in Lorraine for medical purposes for the first time, in the company of Adelaide, because of an over amount of food consumption, while their sisters Sophie and Louise visited Paris for the first time.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n[[File:Roslin - Madame Victoire, Princess of France - Helsingborg museum.jpg|thumb|Madame Victoire, Princess of France]]\n[[Madame Campan]] described the sisters and their life in the years around 1770: \"Louis XV. saw very little of his family. He came every morning by a private staircase into the apartment of Madame Adelaide. He often brought and drank there coffee that he had made himself. Madame Adelaide pulled a bell which apprised Madame Victoire of the King\u2019s visit; Madame Victoire, on rising to go to her sister\u2019s apartment, rang for Madame Sophie, who in her turn rang for Madame Louise. The apartments of Mesdames were of very large dimensions. Madame Louise occupied the farthest room. This latter lady was deformed and very short; the poor Princess used to run with all her might to join the daily meeting, but, having a number of rooms to cross, she frequently in spite of her haste, had only just time to embrace her father before he set out for the chase. Every evening, at six, Mesdames interrupted my reading to them to accompany the princes to Louis XV.; this visit was called the King\u2019s \u2018debotter\u2019,\u2014[Debotter, meaning the time of unbooting.]\u2014and was marked by a kind of etiquette. Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out a petticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long train round their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their clothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the chin. The chevaliers d\u2019honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the equerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to the King. In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in motion; the King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was so short that the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at the end of a quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments, and untied the strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their tapestry, and I my book.\" <ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nIn 1770, the fourteen-year-old [[Marie-Antoinette]] became Dauphine by marriage to Madame Victoire's nephew the Dauphin, the future [[Louis XVI of France]]. Because of the close relationship between the Dauphin and his aunts, Marie-Antoinette also initially came close to the Mesdames her first years in France as the senior royal women at court. The ''Mesdames'' use to alternate with the [[Princess Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy|Countess of Provence]] in accompanying Marie Antoinette on official assignments.<ref>\n{{cite book| author = Joan Haslip| title = Marie Antoinette| publisher =  | ISBN = | year = 1991| page= | language = Swedish}}</ref> The close relationship between Marie-Antoinette and ''Mesdames'' was, however, discontinued in 1772, after the attempt to entice Marie Antoinette to humiliate [[Madame du Barry]] was thwarted, a plan which had been led by Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde with support of Madame Victoire and Madame Sophie.\n\n===Reign of Louis XVI===\nFrom April 1774, Madame Victoire and her sisters attended to their father Louis XV on his deathbed until his death from smallpox on 10 May. Despite the fact the sisters had never had smallpox, and the male members of the royal family, as well as the crown princess, were kept away because of the high risk of catching the illness, the ''Mesdames'' were allowed to attend to him until his death, being female and therefore of no political importance because of the Salic Law. After the death of Louis XV, he was succeeded by his grandson Louis Auguste as [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], who referred to his aunts as ''Mesdames Tantes''. The sisters were in fact infected by their father and fell ill with smallpox (from which they however recovered), and were kept in quarantine on a little house near the Palace of Choisy, to which the court evacuated after the death of the king until recovery.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Joan Haslip\n | title = Marie Antoinette\n | publisher =  \n | ISBN = | year = 1991\n | pages=72\u201373 \n | language = \n}}</ref>\n\nTheir nephew the king allowed them to keep their apartments in the Palace of Versailles, and they kept attending court at special occasions - such as for example at the visit of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who reportedly charmed Adelaide.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\">Joan Haslip (1991).

Arnold, 1908</ref> \n[[File:Madame Victoire of France.jpg|thumb|Madame Victoire of France]]\nThe ''Mesdames'' did not get along well with queen Marie-Antoinette. When the queen introduced the new custom of informal evening family suppers, as well as other informal habits which undermined the formal court etiquette, it resulted in an exodus of the old court nobility in opposition to the queen's reforms, which gathered in the salon of the ''Mesdames''.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\"/>  They entertained extensively at Bellevue as well as Versailles; their salon was reportedly regularly frequented by minister Maurepas, whom Adelaide had elevated to power, by the prince of Cond\u00e9 and the prince of Conti, both members of the Anti-Austrian party, as well as Beaumarchais, who read aloud his satires of Austria and its power figures.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 79\u201380\"/> The Austrian Ambassador Mercy reported that their salon was a centre of intrigues against Marie Antoinette, were the ''Mesdames'' tolerated poems satirizing the queen.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 79\u201380\"/> The Mesdames gathered the extreme conservative [[D\u00e9vots]] party of the nobility opposed to the philosophers, the encyclopedists and the economists.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n===Revolution and later life===\nMadame Victoire and her sister were present at Versailles during the [[The Women's March on Versailles|Parisian women's march to Versailles]] on 6 October 1789, and were among those gathered in the king's apartment on the night of the attack on Marie Antoinette's bedroom. They participated in the wagon train leaving the Palace of Versailles for Paris; on the way, however, their carriage separated from the rest of the procession before they reached Paris. They never took up residence at the Tuileries with the royal family, but preferred to retire to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue]] at [[Meudon]] instead.\n\nRevolutionary laws against the Catholic Church caused them to apply for passports from their nephew, the King, to travel on pilgrimage to the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome. Louis XVI signed their passports and notified the [[Cardinal de Bernis]], the French Ambassador to Rome, of their impending arrival. On 3 February 1791, when they were about to leave, anonymous notification of their intentions was sent to the Jacobin Club, which caused a deputation of protest to the National Assembly. On 19 February, a crowd of women assembled at Palais Royal and agreed to march out to the Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue in an attempt to stop the Mesdames from departing. The Mesdames were warned and left the ch\u00e2teau in the carriage of a visitor. They did not have the time to bring their baggage wagons; these were protected, however, and sent after them by General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]].<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\">Imbert de Saint-Amand, 1834-1900; Martin, Elizabeth Gilbert, b. 1837, tr, [https://archive.org/stream/marieantoinettea00imbe/marieantoinettea00imbe_djvu.txt Marie Antoinette at the Tuileries, 1789-1791], New York, C. Scribner's sons, 1891</ref> They left for Italy in a procession of wagons on 20 February 1791 with a large entourage.\n\nTheir departure was given attention in the press. The ''Chroniqle de Paris'' wrote: \"Two Princesses, sedentary by condition, age, and taste, are suddenly possessed by a mania for travelling and running about the world. That is singular, but possible. They are going, so people say, to kiss the Pope's slipper. That is droll, but edifying. [...] The Ladies, and especially Madame Adelaide, want to exercise the rights of man. That is natural. [...] \"The fair travellers are followed by a train of eighty persons. That is fine. But they carry away twelve millions. That is very ugly. [...]\", while the ''Sahhats Jacobites'' wrote: \"The Ladies are going to Italy to try the power of their tears and their charms upon the princes of that country. Already the Grand Master of Malta has caused Madame Adelaide to be informed that he will give her his heart and hand as soon as she has quitted France, and that she may count upon the assistance of three galleys and forty-eight cavaliers, young and old. Our Holy Father undertakes to marry Victoire and promises her his army of three hundred men to bring about a counter-revolution.\"<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>\n\nTheir trip was affected by some bad publicity; they were temporarily stopped by a riot against their departure in [[Moret-sur-Loing|Moret]], and on 21 February, they were detained for several days at a tavern in [[Arnay-le-Duc]], where the municipality wished to confirm their permission to leave from the National Assembly before allowing them to continue. In Paris, the affair caused riots; protesters invaded the gardens of the Tuileries and demanded that the king order his aunts to return to France.<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/> The matter was debated in the National Assembly, where M. de Narbonne acted as their spokesperson. [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] convinced the National Assembly that \"The welfare of the people cannot depend on the journey the Ladies undertake to Rome; while they are promenading near the places where the Capitol once stood, nothing prevents the edifice of our liberty from rising to its utmost height. [...] Europe will doubtless be much astonished when it learns that the National Assembly of France spent four entire hours in deliberating on the departure of two ladies who would rather hear Mass in Rome - than in Paris.\"<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>  The public at Arnay-le-Duc, however, was not pleased with the decision of the Assembly and so, because of a riot to prevent their departure, the sisters were not able to leave until 3 March.<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>\n\nOn several occasions between Lyon and the border, they were exposed to public demonstrations. But they finally left France, crossing the border at the [[Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Is\u00e8re|bridge of Beauvoisin]], where they were hooted derisively from the French shore while salvos of artillery from the Italian shore welcomed them to Savoy. They were met by a royal guard of escort and by the chief palace officials of the King of Sardinia, who installed them in the [[Chateau de Chambery]].<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/> They continued to visit their niece [[Clotilde, Queen of Sardinia|Clotilde]] at the royal court of [[Turin]], but stayed only a fortnight: \"not even the touching and gracious welcome offered to them by the royal family, the affection shown to them by the Comte d'Artois and the Prince and Princess of Piedmont, their nephew and niece, could make them forget the anguish and perils they had left behind them, and which encircled their family and country with gloom. Mme Victoire wept continuously, Mme Adelaide did not cry, but she had almost lost the use of speech.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>\n\nThey arrived in [[Rome]] on 16 April 1791, where they stayed for about five years. In Rome, the sisters were given the protection of the Pope and housed in the palace of Cardinal de Bernis.<ref>Jill Berk Jiminez, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8vxXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA348&dq=madame+adelaide+cardinal+de+bernis&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKjdT43anUAhXCXCwKHfuCBM0Q6AEISjAF#v=onepage&q&f=false Dictionary of Artists' Models]'', London, 2001</ref> In the Friday receptions of Cardinal de Bernis, [[Cornelia Knight]] described them: \"Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde still retained traces of that beauty which had distinguished her in her youth, and there was great vivacity in her manner, and in the expression of her countenance. Madame Victoire had also an agreeable face, much good sense, and great sweetness of temper. Their dress, and that of their suite, were old-fashioned, but unostentatious. The jewels they brought with them had been sold, one by one, to afford assistance to the poor emigr\u00e9es who applied to the princesses \nin their distress. They were highly respected by the Romans; not only by the higher orders, but by the common people, who had a horror of the French revolution, and no great partiality for that nation in general.\"<ref>Ellis Cornelia Knight,  ''[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographymi01kniggoog/autobiographymi01kniggoog_djvu.txt Autobiography of Miss Cornelia Knight, Lady Companion to the Princess]'', Harvard College Library, 1861</ref> When news came that Louis XVI and his family had left Paris on the [[Flight to Varennes]] in June, a misunderstanding first caused the impression that the escape had succeeded; at this news, \"the whole of Rome shouted with joy; the crowd massed itself under the windows of the Princesses crying out: Long live the King!\",<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/> and the Mesdames arranged a grand banquet for the nobility of Rome in celebration, which had to be interrupted when it was clarified that the escape had in fact failed.<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>\n\nUpon the invasion of Italy by Revolutionary France in 1796, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Victoire left Rome for [[Naples]], where Marie Antoinette's sister, [[Marie Caroline of Austria|Maria Carolina]], was queen, and settled at the Neapolitan royal court in the [[Palace of Caserta]]. Queen Maria Carolina found their presence in Naples difficult: \"I have the awful torment of harbouring the two old Princesses of France with eighty persons in their retinue and every conceivable impertinence... The same ceremonies are observed in the interior of their apartments here as were formerly at Versailles.\"<ref>Justin C. Vovk: In Destiny's Hands: Five Tragic Rulers, Children of Maria Theresa (2010), p 277</ref>\n\nWhen Naples was invaded by France in 1799, they left for [[Corfu]] and finally settled in [[Trieste]], where Victoire died of [[breast cancer]]. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde died one year later. Their bodies were returned to France by [[Louis XVIII]] at the time of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and buried at the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]].\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Louis XV France by Louis-Michel van Loo 002.jpg|[[Louis XV of France|Her father]]\nFile:Marie_Leszczy\u0144ska,_reine_de_France,_lisant_la_Bible_by_Jean-Marc_Nattier,_002.jpg|[[Maria Leszczy\u0144ska|Her mother]]\nFile:Jean marc nattier - madame louise-th\u00e9r\u00e8se-victoire de france.jpg|Victoire by Jean-Marc Nattier as the 'water'\nImage:Jean marc nattier - madame marie-ad\u00e9laide de France.jpg|[[Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France|Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] also by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]] as ''air''\n</gallery>\n\n==Titles and Styles==\n*'''11 May 1733 &ndash; 7 June 1799''' Madame Victoire, ''fille de France''\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=\u017bychli\u0144ski|first=Teodor|title=Z\u0142ota ksi\u0119ga szlachty polski\u00e9j: Rocznik IVty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zihbCxb9xpQC&pg=PT1|accessdate=1 August 2018|year=1882|publisher=Jaros\u0142aw Leitgeber|language=pl|page=1}}</ref>\n|title=Ancestors of Victoire of France\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

She was named after her father and Queen [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Maria Theresa]], her great-great-grandmother and the consort of [[Louis XIV of France]].\n\nOriginally known as ''Madame Quatri\u00e8me'', signifying the fourth daughter of the King (an older sister had died in February 1733, before her birth), she was later known as ''Madame Victoire''. She outlived eight of her nine siblings, and was survived by her older sister [[Princess Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France|Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] by less than a year. The sisters were collectively known as ''[[Mesdames]]''.\n\n==Life==\n'''Marie Louise Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Victoire de France''' was born at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Unlike the older children of Louis XV, Madame Victoire was not raised at the [[Palace of Versailles]]. Rather, she was, in June 1738, sent to live at the [[Abbey of Fontevraud]] with her younger sisters, because the cost of raising them in Versailles with all the status they were entitled to was deemed too expensive by [[Cardinal Fleury]], Louis XV's chief minister. She remained there till 1748 when she was 15.\n\nAccording to [[Madame Campan]], the Mesdames had rather a traumatic upbringing in Fontrevault and were not given much education: \"Cardinal Fleury, who in truth had the merit of re-establishing the finances, carried this system of economy so far as to obtain from the King the suppression of the household of the four younger Princesses. They were brought up as mere boarders in a convent eighty leagues distant from the Court. Saint Cyr would have been more suitable for the reception of the King\u2019s daughters; but probably the Cardinal shared some of those prejudices which will always attach to even the most useful institutions, and which, since the death of Louis XIV., had been raised against the noble establishment of Madame de Maintenon. Madame Louise often assured me that at twelve years of age she was not mistress of the whole alphabet, and never learnt to read fluently until after her return to Versailles. Madame Victoire attributed certain paroxysms of terror, which she was never able to conquer, to the violent alarms she experienced at the Abbey of Fontevrault, whenever she was sent, by way of penance, to pray alone in the vault where the sisters were interred. A gardener belonging to the abbey died raving mad. His habitation, without the walls, was near a chapel of the abbey, where Mesdames were taken to repeat the prayers for those in the agonies of death. Their prayers were more than once interrupted by the shrieks of the dying man.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\">Madame Campan, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3891/3891-h/3891-h.htm Memoirs of the Court of Marie Antoinette, Queen of France]'', [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref>\n\n===Reign of Louis XV===\nOn 24 March 1748, being fifteen and no longer regarded a child, Victoire wrote to her father the king and successfully asked permission to return to court.\nLouis XV appointed three maids-of-honour to attend her, sent the Marie-Ang\u00e9lique-Victoire de Bournonville, duchesse de Duras to collect her and met her with her brother the crown prince at Sceaux.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\">{{cite book |last=Latour |first=Louis Therese |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.66391/ |title=Princesses Ladies and Salonni\u00e8res of the Reign of Louis XV |year=1927 |translator-first=Ivy E. |translator-last=Clegg |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.}}</ref>  In November 1750, she was joined by her sisters Sophie and Louise.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  \n\nUpon their arrival at court, they were not included in to the household of their elders sisters Henriette and Adelaide, the Household of the ''Mesdames a\u00een\u00e9es'' ('Elder Mesdames') but was given their own Household of the ''Mesdames cadettes'' ('Younger Mesdames') headed by Marie-Ang\u00e9lique-Victoire de Bournonville, duchesse de Duras. <ref>Luynes (Charles-Philippe d\u2019Albert, duc de), M\u00e9moires du duc de Luynes sur la cour de Louis XV (1735-1758), publi\u00e9s sous le patronage de M. le duc de Luynes par Louis Dussieux et Eudore Souli\u00e9, Paris, Firmin Didot, 1860-1865, 17 vol.</ref> \n\n[[File:Nivelon or Fr\u00e9dou - Victoire of France.jpg|thumb|left|Madame Victoire by Nivelon]]\nWhile their education had been neglected in the convent, they reportedly compensated for this and studied extensively after their return to court, encouraged by their brother, with whom they immediately formed a close attachment: \"When Mesdames, still very young, returned to Court, they enjoyed the friendship of Monseigneur the Dauphin, and profited by his advice. They devoted themselves ardently to study, and gave up almost the whole of their time to it; they enabled themselves to write French correctly, and acquired a good knowledge of history. Italian, English, the higher branches of mathematics, turning and dialing, filled up in succession their leisure moments.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nVictoire made a success at court and her father with her lively self-assurance and charm; she was also regarded to be a beauty and was described \"Madame Victoire was handsome and very graceful; her address, mien, and smile were in perfect accordance with the goodness of her heart\",<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> and \"her beautiful, tender, soft brown eyes, fresh complexion [...] and a bright smile gave the impression of happiness and health, which, together with her desire to please, radiated from her whole personality\".<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>  In 1753, it was suggested that she might eventually marry her brother-in-law, [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]], as his wife, [[Barbara of Portugal]] was seriously ill at the time and expected to die. However, the Queen of Spain survived her illness and lived another five years. No other marriage partner of suitable religion and status was found, and Victoire remained unmarried: with time, she became quite overweight, and because of this, her father the King came to refer to her as \u2018Coche\u2019 [Piggy], while he called Madame Adelaide \u2018Logue\u2019 [Tatters], Madame Sophie, \u2018Graille\u2019 [Mite], and Madame Louise, \u2018Chiffie\u2019 [Rubbish].<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nVictoire, as her sisters, had a close relationship with her brother, viewed her mother as a role model, and followed her sister Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde in her campaign against the influence of [[Madame de Pompadour]] and, later, [[Madame du Barry]]. She also had a close friendship with her favourite lady-in-waiting the Marquise de Durfort, who \"afforded to Madame Victoire agreeable society. The Princess spent almost all her evenings with that lady, and ended by fancying herself domiciled with her.\"<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/> In contrast to her elder sister Adelaide, Victoire was described as \"good, sweet-tempered, and affable\", and well liked both by society and her staff.<ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nIn 1761, Victoire visited the waters in Lorraine for medical purposes for the first time, in the company of Adelaide, because of an over amount of food consumption, while their sisters Sophie and Louise visited Paris for the first time.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n[[File:Roslin - Madame Victoire, Princess of France - Helsingborg museum.jpg|thumb|Madame Victoire, Princess of France]]\n[[Madame Campan]] described the sisters and their life in the years around 1770: \"Louis XV. saw very little of his family. He came every morning by a private staircase into the apartment of Madame Adelaide. He often brought and drank there coffee that he had made himself. Madame Adelaide pulled a bell which apprised Madame Victoire of the King\u2019s visit; Madame Victoire, on rising to go to her sister\u2019s apartment, rang for Madame Sophie, who in her turn rang for Madame Louise. The apartments of Mesdames were of very large dimensions. Madame Louise occupied the farthest room. This latter lady was deformed and very short; the poor Princess used to run with all her might to join the daily meeting, but, having a number of rooms to cross, she frequently in spite of her haste, had only just time to embrace her father before he set out for the chase. Every evening, at six, Mesdames interrupted my reading to them to accompany the princes to Louis XV.; this visit was called the King\u2019s \u2018debotter\u2019,\u2014[Debotter, meaning the time of unbooting.]\u2014and was marked by a kind of etiquette. Mesdames put on an enormous hoop, which set out a petticoat ornamented with gold or embroidery; they fastened a long train round their waists, and concealed the undress of the rest of their clothing by a long cloak of black taffety which enveloped them up to the chin. The chevaliers d\u2019honneur, the ladies in waiting, the pages, the equerries, and the ushers bearing large flambeaux, accompanied them to the King. In a moment the whole palace, generally so still, was in motion; the King kissed each Princess on the forehead, and the visit was so short that the reading which it interrupted was frequently resumed at the end of a quarter of an hour; Mesdames returned to their apartments, and untied the strings of their petticoats and trains; they resumed their tapestry, and I my book.\" <ref name=\"gutenberg.org\"/>\n\nIn 1770, the fourteen-year-old [[Marie-Antoinette]] became Dauphine by marriage to Madame Victoire's nephew the Dauphin, the future [[Louis XVI of France]]. Because of the close relationship between the Dauphin and his aunts, Marie-Antoinette also initially came close to the Mesdames her first years in France as the senior royal women at court. The ''Mesdames'' use to alternate with the [[Princess Marie Jos\u00e9phine of Savoy|Countess of Provence]] in accompanying Marie Antoinette on official assignments.<ref>\n{{cite book| author = Joan Haslip| title = Marie Antoinette| publisher =  | ISBN = | year = 1991| page= | language = Swedish}}</ref> The close relationship between Marie-Antoinette and ''Mesdames'' was, however, discontinued in 1772, after the attempt to entice Marie Antoinette to humiliate [[Madame du Barry]] was thwarted, a plan which had been led by Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde with support of Madame Victoire and Madame Sophie.\n\n===Reign of Louis XVI===\nFrom April 1774, Madame Victoire and her sisters attended to their father Louis XV on his deathbed until his death from smallpox on 10 May. Despite the fact the sisters had never had smallpox, and the male members of the royal family, as well as the crown princess, were kept away because of the high risk of catching the illness, the ''Mesdames'' were allowed to attend to him until his death, being female and therefore of no political importance because of the Salic Law. After the death of Louis XV, he was succeeded by his grandson Louis Auguste as [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], who referred to his aunts as ''Mesdames Tantes''. The sisters were in fact infected by their father and fell ill with smallpox (from which they however recovered), and were kept in quarantine on a little house near the Palace of Choisy, to which the court evacuated after the death of the king until recovery.<ref>{{cite book\n | author = Joan Haslip\n | title = Marie Antoinette\n | publisher =  \n | ISBN = | year = 1991\n | pages=72\u201373 \n | language = \n}}</ref>\n\nTheir nephew the king allowed them to keep their apartments in the Palace of Versailles, and they kept attending court at special occasions - such as for example at the visit of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]], who reportedly charmed Adelaide.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\">Joan Haslip (1991).

Arnold, 1908</ref> \n[[File:Madame Victoire of France.jpg|thumb|Madame Victoire of France]]\nThe ''Mesdames'' did not get along well with queen Marie-Antoinette. When the queen introduced the new custom of informal evening family suppers, as well as other informal habits which undermined the formal court etiquette, it resulted in an exodus of the old court nobility in opposition to the queen's reforms, which gathered in the salon of the ''Mesdames''.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991\"/>  They entertained extensively at Bellevue as well as Versailles; their salon was reportedly regularly frequented by minister Maurepas, whom Adelaide had elevated to power, by the prince of Cond\u00e9 and the prince of Conti, both members of the Anti-Austrian party, as well as Beaumarchais, who read aloud his satires of Austria and its power figures.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 79\u201380\"/> The Austrian Ambassador Mercy reported that their salon was a centre of intrigues against Marie Antoinette, were the ''Mesdames'' tolerated poems satirizing the queen.<ref name=\"Joan Haslip 1991 79\u201380\"/> The Mesdames gathered the extreme conservative [[D\u00e9vots]] party of the nobility opposed to the philosophers, the encyclopedists and the economists.<ref name=\"Latour, Louis Therese\"/>\n\n===Revolution and later life===\nMadame Victoire and her sister were present at Versailles during the [[The Women's March on Versailles|Parisian women's march to Versailles]] on 6 October 1789, and were among those gathered in the king's apartment on the night of the attack on Marie Antoinette's bedroom. They participated in the wagon train leaving the Palace of Versailles for Paris; on the way, however, their carriage separated from the rest of the procession before they reached Paris. They never took up residence at the Tuileries with the royal family, but preferred to retire to the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue]] at [[Meudon]] instead.\n\nRevolutionary laws against the Catholic Church caused them to apply for passports from their nephew, the King, to travel on pilgrimage to the Basilica of Saint Peter in Rome. Louis XVI signed their passports and notified the [[Cardinal de Bernis]], the French Ambassador to Rome, of their impending arrival. On 3 February 1791, when they were about to leave, anonymous notification of their intentions was sent to the Jacobin Club, which caused a deputation of protest to the National Assembly. On 19 February, a crowd of women assembled at Palais Royal and agreed to march out to the Ch\u00e2teau de Bellevue in an attempt to stop the Mesdames from departing. The Mesdames were warned and left the ch\u00e2teau in the carriage of a visitor. They did not have the time to bring their baggage wagons; these were protected, however, and sent after them by General [[Louis-Alexandre Berthier]].<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\">Imbert de Saint-Amand, 1834-1900; Martin, Elizabeth Gilbert, b. 1837, tr, [https://archive.org/stream/marieantoinettea00imbe/marieantoinettea00imbe_djvu.txt Marie Antoinette at the Tuileries, 1789-1791], New York, C. Scribner's sons, 1891</ref> They left for Italy in a procession of wagons on 20 February 1791 with a large entourage.\n\nTheir departure was given attention in the press. The ''Chroniqle de Paris'' wrote: \"Two Princesses, sedentary by condition, age, and taste, are suddenly possessed by a mania for travelling and running about the world. That is singular, but possible. They are going, so people say, to kiss the Pope's slipper. That is droll, but edifying. [...] The Ladies, and especially Madame Adelaide, want to exercise the rights of man. That is natural. [...] \"The fair travellers are followed by a train of eighty persons. That is fine. But they carry away twelve millions. That is very ugly. [...]\", while the ''Sahhats Jacobites'' wrote: \"The Ladies are going to Italy to try the power of their tears and their charms upon the princes of that country. Already the Grand Master of Malta has caused Madame Adelaide to be informed that he will give her his heart and hand as soon as she has quitted France, and that she may count upon the assistance of three galleys and forty-eight cavaliers, young and old. Our Holy Father undertakes to marry Victoire and promises her his army of three hundred men to bring about a counter-revolution.\"<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>\n\nTheir trip was affected by some bad publicity; they were temporarily stopped by a riot against their departure in [[Moret-sur-Loing|Moret]], and on 21 February, they were detained for several days at a tavern in [[Arnay-le-Duc]], where the municipality wished to confirm their permission to leave from the National Assembly before allowing them to continue. In Paris, the affair caused riots; protesters invaded the gardens of the Tuileries and demanded that the king order his aunts to return to France.<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/> The matter was debated in the National Assembly, where M. de Narbonne acted as their spokesperson. [[Honor\u00e9 Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] convinced the National Assembly that \"The welfare of the people cannot depend on the journey the Ladies undertake to Rome; while they are promenading near the places where the Capitol once stood, nothing prevents the edifice of our liberty from rising to its utmost height. [...] Europe will doubtless be much astonished when it learns that the National Assembly of France spent four entire hours in deliberating on the departure of two ladies who would rather hear Mass in Rome - than in Paris.\"<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>  The public at Arnay-le-Duc, however, was not pleased with the decision of the Assembly and so, because of a riot to prevent their departure, the sisters were not able to leave until 3 March.<ref name=\"Imbert de Saint-Amand\"/>\n\nOn several occasions between Lyon and the border, they were exposed to public demonstrations. But they finally left France, crossing the border at the [[Le Pont-de-Beauvoisin, Is\u00e8re|bridge of Beauvoisin]], where they were hooted derisively from the French shore while salvos of artillery from the Italian shore welcomed them to Savoy. They were met by a royal guard of escort and by the chief palace officials of the King of Sardinia, who installed them in the [[Chateau de Chambery]].<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/> They continued to visit their niece [[Clotilde, Queen of Sardinia|Clotilde]] at the royal court of [[Turin]], but stayed only a fortnight: \"not even the touching and gracious welcome offered to them by the royal family, the affection shown to them by the Comte d'Artois and the Prince and Princess of Piedmont, their nephew and niece, could make them forget the anguish and perils they had left behind them, and which encircled their family and country with gloom. Mme Victoire wept continuously, Mme Adelaide did not cry, but she had almost lost the use of speech.\"<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>\n\nThey arrived in [[Rome]] on 16 April 1791, where they stayed for about five years. In Rome, the sisters were given the protection of the Pope and housed in the palace of Cardinal de Bernis.<ref>Jill Berk Jiminez, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8vxXAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA348&dq=madame+adelaide+cardinal+de+bernis&hl=sv&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjKjdT43anUAhXCXCwKHfuCBM0Q6AEISjAF#v=onepage&q&f=false Dictionary of Artists' Models]'', London, 2001</ref> In the Friday receptions of Cardinal de Bernis, [[Cornelia Knight]] described them: \"Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde still retained traces of that beauty which had distinguished her in her youth, and there was great vivacity in her manner, and in the expression of her countenance. Madame Victoire had also an agreeable face, much good sense, and great sweetness of temper. Their dress, and that of their suite, were old-fashioned, but unostentatious. The jewels they brought with them had been sold, one by one, to afford assistance to the poor emigr\u00e9es who applied to the princesses \nin their distress. They were highly respected by the Romans; not only by the higher orders, but by the common people, who had a horror of the French revolution, and no great partiality for that nation in general.\"<ref>Ellis Cornelia Knight,  ''[https://archive.org/stream/autobiographymi01kniggoog/autobiographymi01kniggoog_djvu.txt Autobiography of Miss Cornelia Knight, Lady Companion to the Princess]'', Harvard College Library, 1861</ref> When news came that Louis XVI and his family had left Paris on the [[Flight to Varennes]] in June, a misunderstanding first caused the impression that the escape had succeeded; at this news, \"the whole of Rome shouted with joy; the crowd massed itself under the windows of the Princesses crying out: Long live the King!\",<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/> and the Mesdames arranged a grand banquet for the nobility of Rome in celebration, which had to be interrupted when it was clarified that the escape had in fact failed.<ref name=\"Maxwell-Scott, Mary Monica\"/>\n\nUpon the invasion of Italy by Revolutionary France in 1796, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde and Victoire left Rome for [[Naples]], where Marie Antoinette's sister, [[Marie Caroline of Austria|Maria Carolina]], was queen, and settled at the Neapolitan royal court in the [[Palace of Caserta]]. Queen Maria Carolina found their presence in Naples difficult: \"I have the awful torment of harbouring the two old Princesses of France with eighty persons in their retinue and every conceivable impertinence... The same ceremonies are observed in the interior of their apartments here as were formerly at Versailles.\"<ref>Justin C. Vovk: In Destiny's Hands: Five Tragic Rulers, Children of Maria Theresa (2010), p 277</ref>\n\nWhen Naples was invaded by France in 1799, they left for [[Corfu]] and finally settled in [[Trieste]], where Victoire died of [[breast cancer]]. Ad\u00e9la\u00efde died one year later. Their bodies were returned to France by [[Louis XVIII]] at the time of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and buried at the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]].\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Louis XV France by Louis-Michel van Loo 002.jpg|[[Louis XV of France|Her father]]\nFile:Marie_Leszczy\u0144ska,_reine_de_France,_lisant_la_Bible_by_Jean-Marc_Nattier,_002.jpg|[[Maria Leszczy\u0144ska|Her mother]]\nFile:Jean marc nattier - madame louise-th\u00e9r\u00e8se-victoire de france.jpg|Victoire by Jean-Marc Nattier as the 'water'\nImage:Jean marc nattier - madame marie-ad\u00e9laide de France.jpg|[[Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde of France|Madame Ad\u00e9la\u00efde]] also by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]] as ''air''\n</gallery>\n\n==Titles and Styles==\n*'''11 May 1733 &ndash; 7 June 1799''' Madame Victoire, ''fille de France''\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center |ref=<ref>{{cite book|title=Genealogie ascendante jusqu'au quatrieme degre inclusivement de tous les Rois et Princes de maisons souveraines de l'Europe actuellement vivans| trans-title=Genealogy up to the fourth degree inclusive of all the Kings and Princes of sovereign houses of Europe currently living |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AINPAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA12|year=1768|publisher=Frederic Guillaume Birnstiel|location=Bourdeaux|language=fr|page=12}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=\u017bychli\u0144ski|first=Teodor|title=Z\u0142ota ksi\u0119ga szlachty polski\u00e9j: Rocznik IVty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zihbCxb9xpQC&pg=PT1|accessdate=1 August 2018|year=1882|publisher=Jaros\u0142aw Leitgeber|language=pl|page=1}}</ref>\n|title=Ancestors of Victoire of France\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

This financial crisis was discussed at the meeting of the leadership of IMRO in [[Kyustendil]], [[Bulgaria]] that summer. At this meeting, Delchev argued that small robberies only tarnished the reputation of the organization and were not helpful to solving the financial problem. [[Gotse Delchev]] then authorized [[Mihail Gerdzhikov]] to carry out the kidnapping of a wealthy person or persons in Macedonia to obtain funds, but he failed. Delchev made two other unsuccessful attempts with wealthy Turks and Greeks. He later developed a plan to kidnap the son of [[Ivan Evstratiev Geshov]], which also failed. Sandanski then offered to kidnap [[Ferdinand of Bulgaria]] during his visit to the [[Rila Monastery]], but this radical plan was opposed by Delchev, who believed that the abduction must be done on Ottoman territory. Chernopeev and Sandanski discussed the kidnapping of a wealthy Turk near [[Simitli]], but this plan was not realised. Yane Sandanski, Hristo Chernopeev and [[Sava Mihaylov]] prepared a plan for the kidnapping of S\u00fcleyman Bey, but due to his illness this action also failed. \n\nSandanski was then drawn to the idea of kidnapping a Protestant missionary of [[Bansko]]. A detachment led by the [[voivoda]] [[Yane Sandanski]] and the sub-voivodas [[Hristo Chernopeev]] and [[Kr\u01cestyo Asenov]] carried this out on August 21st, 1901. Two women - [[Ellen Maria Stone]] and her fellow missionary Katerina Stefanova\u2013Tsilka - were kidnapped somewhere between [[Bansko]] and [[Blagoevgrad|Gorna Dzhumaya]], then towns in the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\nThe goal of the kidnapping was to receive a heavy ransom and aid the financially struggling IMRO. The detachment was pursued by the Ottoman and Bulgarian authorities and by a [[Cheta (armed group)|cheta]] of the contending organization [[Supreme Macedonian Committee]]. Sometimes regarded as a case of the [[Stockholm syndrome]] (with the kidnappers even assisting Tsilka in giving birth to her daughter), the affair ended after intensive negotiations in early 1902, half a year after the kidnapping. IMRO was paid a ransom of 14,000 [[Turkish lira|Turkish gold liras]] on January 18th, 1902 in Bansko, and the hostages were released on February 2nd near [[Strumica]].\n\nWidely covered by the media at the time, the event has been often dubbed \"America's first modern [[hostage crisis]]\".\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last=\u041f\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0435\u0432|first=\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d|others=\u041c\u0430\u044f \u0412\u0430\u043f\u0446\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430|title=\u0410\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u041c\u0438\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0443\u043d\". \u0421\u043f\u043e\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u0438|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u041e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0444\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0442|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|date=1983|oclc=10725712|language=Bulgarian}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Teresa|title=The Miss Stone Affair: America's First Modern Hostage Crisis!|url=https://archive.org/details/missstoneaffaira00carp|url-access=registration|publisher=Simon & Schuster|date=2003|isbn=978-0-7432-0055-4}}\n* [http://www.promacedonia.org/bugarash/stone/gallery.html Some archive photos] concerning the case.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Miss Stone Affair}}\n[[Category:Macedonian Struggle]]\n[[Category:Hostage taking]]\n[[Category:1901 in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:1902 in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]]\n[[Category:Protestant missionaries in Bulgaria]]\n", "text_old": "{{Campaignbox Macedonian Struggle}}\n[[File:Miss stoun case.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A postcard with the kidnapped Ellen Stone and Tsilka]]\n[[Image:Sandanski&chernopeev.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The participants in the Miss Stone Affair - [[Sava Mihaylov]], [[Yane Sandanski]], [[Krastyo Asenov]] and [[Hristo Chernopeev]].]]\n[[File:Ellen Maria Stone.png|thumb|Ellen Maria Stone]]\n\nThe '''Miss Stone Affair''' ({{lang-bg|\u0410\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u201e\u041c\u0438\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0443\u043d\u201c}}, {{lang-mk|\u201e\u0410\u0444\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0441 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u043d\u201c}}) was the kidnapping of [[United States|American]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[missionary]] Ellen Maria Stone and her pregnant fellow missionary friend Katerina Stefanova\u2013Tsilka by the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]].<ref>Marcel Cornis-Pope, John Neubauer eds., History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries, Volume 2, John Benjamins Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|9027293406}}, p. 361.</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn 1901, one of the main problems facing the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization was the lack of resources for armaments.

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants chose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top 20 advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round aired on March 29 and April 5, featuring the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]]. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down to twenty-one in the Final Judgment. The following is a list of the contestants who performed, the song they performed at the Showcase, and if they advanced or not. The placement of Grace Leer and Lauren Mascitti will be determined by a vote.\n\n'''Color key:'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:cyan; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Male contestant\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:pink; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Female contestant\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B0E0E6; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was chosen by the judges to move on to the Top 20\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF91A4; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was eliminated\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:17px; width:100%; white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

In the judges\u2019 defense, both women are 28-year-old country powerhouses from Nashville, so comparisons are bound to be drawn. That said, I\u2019m not really sure why they weren\u2019t both sent through to the Top 20 over some of the previous contestants that the judges weren\u2019t 100-percent certain about. And there were several of those.\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s now up to viewers to go online and vote for the performance they preferred \u2014 Grace\u2019s killer rendition of \u2018(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,\u2019 or Lauren\u2019s crowd-pleasing \u2018Two More Bottles of Wine.\u2019 Again, I feel like both Grace and Lauren deserve to be in the Top 20 over some other contestants that were sent through before them.\u201d<ref>Swift, Andy.

Retrieved April 18, 2020.</ref>\n\nMaggie Fremont of EW.com stated, \u201cWell, this is sort of a bummer. Our two classic country Nashville gals (who have become close throughout the competition) are sent into their Top 20 Final Judgment together, with 19 spots already filled up. Both put on a great show in their Hawaii Showcase performances: Grace has never sounded better than in this moment, her voice is smooth and rich from the get-go and she shows some real power behind it. Lauren\u2019s sounded better, but she definitely proves that she offers something different to the show than anyone else. The judges love them both: Katy says that Grace made everyone else look like they were in a \u2018talent show\u2019 and they all agree she was one of the top of the entire showcase; They applaud Lauren for being both \u2018classic\u2019 and \u2018classy\u2019 and love that she showed a more rock-n-roll side to her. Because it\u2019s so tight (maybe because of all the teens?!), the judges just could not make a decision, so they\u2019re leaving it up to America. After this episode, they\u2019ll be opening up the vote for people to decide which country queen should continue on to the Top 20.\u201d<ref>Fremont, Maggie.

This is insane!\u2019 the women gasped, as they stumbled off to tell their families the semi-good news.\nHere\u2019s some background for Idol newbies about how Final Judgment...usually works: It often ends with the last two hopefuls \u2014 similar contestants, fan favorites, and/or best buddies \u2014 taking that stressful walk together. Then one of those two singers is cut, right then and there. It makes for good TV, but it\u2019s super-cringey and awkward to watch one survivor\u2019s-guilt-racked contestant try to celebrate, while the hapless reject just sits there in tears...However, two women are still being pitted against each other \u2014 and ultimately, one of them will still go home too soon.\u00a0\n\nI wish both women could have made it \u2014 there were some top 20 contestants, revealed both last week and this week, that I feel were less deserving.\u201d<ref>Parker, Lyndsey.

Instead of the usual concepts of Hollywood Week with Lines of Ten, Group Rounds, and Solo Round, this season the 167 contestants faced the Genre Challenge. The contestants chose from genres given, Pop, Rock, R&B, Soul, Country, and Singer-Songwriter, and picked a song and were assessed amongst their group. After all  performed, the judges brought the contestants to stage, similar to Lines of Ten, and made their decision. The Group Round was replaced with a Duet Round, in which the remaining contestants picked a duet partner and their song from a list provided. They were given twelve hours to rehearse including a session with a vocal coach, and later, a stage rehearsal. The judges decided if one, both, or neither moved to the Solo Round for which the remaining contestants performed with a backing band. The Top 40 were flown to Hawaii for a Showcase round to determine the Top 20 advancing to the live shows.\n\n== Showcase Round ==\nThe Showcase Round aired on March 29 and April 5, featuring the top forty performing for the judges and a live audience at [[Aulani]] resort in [[Kapolei, Hawaii]]. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down to twenty-one in the Final Judgment. The following is a list of the contestants who performed, the song they performed at the Showcase, and if they advanced or not. The placement of Grace Leer and Lauren Mascitti will be determined by a vote.\n\n'''Color key:'''\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"font-size: 90%; white-space: nowrap;\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:cyan; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Male contestant\n| &nbsp;\n|-\n| style=\"background:pink; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Female contestant\n|-\n| style=\"background:#B0E0E6; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was chosen by the judges to move on to the Top 20\n|-\n| style=\"background:#FF91A4; border:1px solid black;\"| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Contestant was eliminated\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:17px; width:100%; white-space:nowrap\"\n|-\n!

The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. The Commune elections were held on 26 March. They elected a Commune council of 92 members, one member for each 20,000 residents.<ref>Rougerie, Jacques, ''La Commune de Paris''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France. {{ISBN|978-2-13-062078-5}}.</ref> Despite internal differences, the council began to organise public services. It reached a consensus on certain policies that tended towards a progressive, secular and highly democratic [[social democracy]].\n\nBecause the Commune was able to meet on fewer than 60 days in total, only a few decrees were actually implemented. These included the [[separation of church and state]]; the remission of rents owed for the period of the siege (during which payment had been suspended); the abolition of [[Shift work|night work]] in the hundreds of Paris [[bakeries]]; the granting of pensions to the unmarried companions and children of National Guards killed on active service; and the free return of all workmen's tools and household items valued up to 20 francs that had been pledged during the siege.<ref name=\"Milza, Pierre, La Commune\">Milza, Pierre, ''La Commune''.</ref> The Commune was concerned that skilled workers had been forced to pawn their tools during the war; the postponement of commercial [[debt]] obligations and the abolition of interest on the debts; and the [[workers' self-management|right of employees to take over and run an enterprise]] if it were deserted by its owner.

In 1865 and 1866, it held a preliminary conference and had its first congress in [[Geneva]], respectively. Due to their wide variety of philosophies, conflict immediately erupted. The first objections to Marx came from the mutualists who opposed [[state socialism]]. Shortly after [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his followers joined in 1868, the First International became polarised into camps headed by Marx and Bakunin.<ref>\"It is unnecessary to repeat the accounts of the Geneva and Hague Congresses of the International in which the issues between Marx and Bakunin were fought out and the organisation itself split apart into the dying Marxist rump centered around the New York General Council and the anti-authoritarian majority centred around the Bakuninist Jura Federation.

Like Proudhonists, they asserted the right of each individual to the product of his labour and to be remunerated for his particular contribution to production. By contrast, [[anarcho-communists]] sought collective ownership of both the means and the products of labour. [[Errico Malatesta]] put it: \"[I]nstead of running the risk of making a confusion in trying to distinguish what you and I each do, let us all work and put everything in common.

Revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: [[Rosa Luxemburg]] condemned Bernstein's ''[[Evolutionary Socialism]]'' in her 1900 essay ''[[Social Reform or Revolution]]?'' [[Revolutionary socialism]] encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define \"revolution\" differently. The [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]] (SPD) in Germany became the largest and most powerful socialist party in Europe, despite working illegally until the anti-socialist laws were dropped in 1890. In the 1893 elections, it gained 1,787,000 votes, a quarter of the total votes cast, according to Engels.

He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets.

In 1989 at Stockholm, the 18th Congress of the Socialist International adopted a new Declaration of Principles, saying: <blockquote>Democratic socialism is an international movement for freedom, social justice, and solidarity.

[[Fela Kuti]] was inspired by socialism and called for a democratic African republic. In South Africa the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) abandoned its partial socialist allegiances after taking power and followed a standard neoliberal route. From 2005 through to 2007, the country was wracked by many thousands of protests from poor communities.

For Marx and Engels, conditions determine consciousness and ending the role of the capitalist class leads eventually to a [[classless society]] in which the [[withering away of the state|state would wither away]]. The Marxist conception of socialism is that of a specific historical phase that would displace capitalism and precede [[communism]].

In contrast to Karl Marx's perspective of the state, Lassalle rejected the concept of the state as a class-based power structure whose main function was to preserve existing class structures. Lassalle also rejected the Marxist view that the state was destined to \"wither away\". Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}\n\nPreceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists including [[reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. Following the victory of Leninism in Russia, the idea of \"state socialism\" spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the [[Soviet economic model]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism. But with the victory of Leninism in Russia, all dissent was silenced, and socialism became identified with 'democratic centralism', 'central planning', and State ownership of the means of production. |ref=p. 295}}</ref>\n\n[[Joseph Schumpeter]] rejected the association of socialism and social ownership with state ownership over the means of production because the state as it exists in its current form is a product of capitalist society and cannot be transplanted to a different institutional framework. Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct and unique institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism) and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-156161-0 |page=169 |quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework.

Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of \"revolution\". Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[trade union]]s and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> \"Revolution\" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,<ref>Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no. 2 (April\u2013June 1973)</ref> but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.\n\nReformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] democratic socialism.

In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=Richard E.|title=Command Economy|url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|website=|accessdate=9 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|archivedate=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. Instead of conscious planning, the Soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. Planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the Soviet economy and that a better description would be an \"administered\" or \"managed\" economy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nove|first=Alec|title=The Economics of Feasible Socialism, Revisited|publisher=Routledge|year=1991|isbn=978-0-04-335049-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/economicsoffeasi00nove/page/78 78]|quote=Several authors of the most diverse political views have stated that there is in fact no planning in the Soviet Union: Eugene Zaleski, J.

Leon Trotsky rejected central planning in favour of decentralised planning. He argued that central planners, regardless of their intellectual capacity, would be unable to coordinate effectively all economic activity within an economy because they operated without the input and tacit knowledge embodied by the participation of the millions of people in the economy. As a result, central planners would be unable to respond to local economic conditions.<ref>''Writings 1932\u201333, p. 96'', Leon Trotsky.</ref> [[State socialism]] is unfeasible in this view because information cannot be aggregated by a central body and effectively used to formulate a plan for an entire economy, because doing so would result in [[Economic calculation problem|distorted or absent price signals]].<ref name=\"hayek\">F.

Authority, takes many shapes, but, broadly speaking, her enemies divide themselves into three classes: first, those who abhor her both as a means and as an end of progress, opposing her openly, avowedly, sincerely, consistently, universally; second, those who profess to believe in her as a means of progress, but who accept her only so far as they think she will subserve their own selfish interests, denying her and her blessings to the rest of the world; third, those who distrust her as a means of progress, believing in her only as an end to be obtained by first trampling upon, violating, and outraging her. These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"La Insumisi\u00f3n voluntaria.

Workers, soldiers and peasants established [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils), the monarchy fell and a [[Provisional Government of Russia, 1917|provisional government]] convened pending the election of a [[constituent assembly]]. In April of that year, [[Vladimir Lenin]], leader of the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|socialists in Russia]] and known for his [[Leninism|profound and controversial expansions]] of [[Marxism]], was allowed to cross Germany to return from exile in Switzerland.\n\nLenin had published [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|essays]] on his analysis of [[Leninism#Imperialism|imperialism]], the monopoly and [[globalisation]] phase of capitalism, as well as analyses on social conditions. He observed that as capitalism had further developed in Europe and America, the workers remained unable to gain [[class consciousness]] so long as they were too busy working to pay their expenses. He therefore proposed that the social revolution would require the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of class-conscious revolutionaries from the educated and politically active part of the population.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/commandingheights/shared/minitextlo/ess_leninscritique.html |title=Commanding Heights: Lenin's Critique of Global Capitalism |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=30 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nUpon arriving in [[Petrograd]], Lenin declared that the revolution in Russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers' [[soviet (council)|soviet]]s to take full authority. He issued a [[April Thesis|thesis]] outlining the Bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. The Bolsheviks became the most influential force. On 7 November, the [[Winter Palace|capitol of the provisional government]] was stormed by [[Red Guards (Russia)|Bolshevik Red Guards]] in what afterwards became known as the [[Great October Socialist Revolution]]. The provisional government ended and the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]]\u2014the world's first constitutionally socialist state\u2014was established.

Lassalle considered the state to be an entity independent of class allegiances and an instrument of justice that would therefore be essential for achieving socialism.{{sfn|Berlau|1949|p=21}}\n\nPreceding the Bolshevik-led revolution in Russia, many socialists including [[reformists]], [[orthodox Marxist]] currents such as [[council communism]], anarchists and [[libertarian socialists]] criticised the idea of using the state to conduct central planning and own the means of production as a way to establish socialism. Following the victory of Leninism in Russia, the idea of \"state socialism\" spread rapidly throughout the socialist movement and eventually state socialism came to be identified with the [[Soviet economic model]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Screpanti and Zamagni|title=An Outline on the History of Economic Thought |edition=2nd |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford|quote=It should not be forgotten, however, that in the period of the Second International, some of the reformist currents of Marxism, as well as some of the extreme left-wing ones, not to speak of the anarchist groups, had already criticised the view that State ownership and central planning is the best road to socialism.

Schumpeter argued that there would be different institutions within socialism than those that exist within modern capitalism, just as [[feudalism]] had its own distinct and unique institutional forms. The state, along with concepts like [[Private property|property]] and [[taxation]], were concepts exclusive to commercial society (capitalism) and attempting to place them within the context of a future socialist society would amount to a distortion of these concepts by using them out of context.<ref>{{cite book |last=Schumpeter |first=Joseph |title=Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy |publisher=Harper Perennial |date=2008 |isbn=978-0-06-156161-0 |page=169 |quote=But there are still others (concepts and institutions) which by virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor of a particular institutional framework.

They have been categorised as [[Religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some. Similarly, modern [[intentional communities]] based on socialist ideas could also be categorised as \"utopian socialist\".\n\nFor Marxists, the development of capitalism in Western Europe provided a material basis for the possibility of bringing about socialism because according to ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' \"[w]hat the bourgeoisie produces above all is its own grave diggers\",<ref>Marx and Engels, ''The Communist Manifesto''.</ref> namely the working class, which must become conscious of the historical objectives set it by society.\n\n=== Reform versus revolution ===\n{{main|Reformism|Revolutionary socialism}}\nRevolutionary socialists believe that a social revolution is necessary to effect structural changes to the socioeconomic structure of society. Among revolutionary socialists there are differences in strategy, theory and the definition of \"revolution\". Orthodox Marxists and left communists take an [[impossibilist]] stance, believing that revolution should be spontaneous as a result of contradictions in society due to technological changes in the productive forces. Lenin theorised that under capitalism the workers cannot achieve class consciousness beyond organising into [[trade union]]s and making demands of the capitalists. Therefore, [[Leninists]] advocate that it is historically necessary for a [[Vanguardism|vanguard]] of class conscious revolutionaries to take a central role in coordinating the social revolution to overthrow the capitalist state and eventually the institution of the state altogether.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Leninist Concept of the Revolutionary Vanguard Party |url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/socialistvoice/partyPR46.html |website=WRG |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref> \"Revolution\" is not necessarily defined by revolutionary socialists as violent insurrection,<ref>Schaff, Adam, 'Marxist Theory on Revolution and Violence', p. 263. in Journal of the history of ideas, Vol 34, no. 2 (April\u2013June 1973)</ref> but as a complete dismantling and rapid transformation of all areas of class society led by the majority of the masses: the working class.\n\nReformism is generally associated with [[social democracy]] and [[gradualist]] democratic socialism. Reformism is the belief that socialists should stand in parliamentary elections within capitalist society and if elected use the [[machinery of government]] to pass political and social reforms for the purposes of ameliorating the instabilities and inequities of capitalism.\n\n== Economics ==\n{{main|Socialist economics}}\n{{see also|Production for use}}\nSocialist [[economics]] starts from the premise that \"individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another.

Society as whole, therefore, should own or at least control property for the benefit of all its members\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe original conception of socialism was an economic system whereby production was organised in a way to directly produce goods and services for their utility (or use-value in [[Classical economics|classical]] and [[Marxian economics]]), with the direct allocation of resources in terms of physical units as opposed to financial calculation and the economic laws of capitalism (see [[law of value]]), often entailing the end of capitalistic economic categories such as [[Renting|rent]], [[interest]], [[Profit (economics)|profit]] and money.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bockman |first=Johanna |title=Markets in the name of Socialism: The Left-Wing origins of Neoliberalism |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8047-7566-3 |page=20 |quote=According to nineteenth-century socialist views, socialism would function without capitalist economic categories\u2014such as money, prices, interest, profits and rent\u2014and thus would function according to laws other than those described by current economic science.

A socialist form of organisation would eliminate controlling hierarchies so that only a hierarchy based on technical knowledge in the workplace remains.

In his model, assuming perfect computation techniques, simultaneous equations relating inputs and outputs to ratios of equivalence would provide appropriate valuations in order to balance supply and demand.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gregory and Stuart|first=Paul and Robert|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First Century, Seventh Edition|publisher=George Hoffman|year=2004|isbn=978-0-618-26181-9|pages=120\u201321}}</ref>\n\nThe most prominent example of a planned economy was the [[Economy of the Soviet Union|economic system of the Soviet Union]] and as such the centralised-planned economic model is usually associated with the [[communist state]]s of the 20th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. In a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency (see also the [[analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]). The economic systems of the Soviet Union and the [[Eastern Bloc]] are further classified as \"command economies\", which are defined as systems where economic coordination is undertaken by commands, directives and production targets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ericson|first=Richard E.|title=Command Economy|url=http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|website=|accessdate=9 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125010605/http://econ.la.psu.edu/~bickes/rickcommand.pdf|archivedate=25 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the Soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy.

The leasing of land and natural resources would also provide enough state revenue to make income taxes unnecessary, allowing a worker to invest his savings and become 'an owner or capitalist at the same time that he remains a worker.}}</ref> Yugoslavia implemented a market socialist economy based on cooperatives and worker self-management.\n\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], main theorist of [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] and influential French socialist thinker]]\n[[Mutualism (economy)|Mutualism]] is an [[Economics|economic theory]] and [[anarchist school of thought]] that advocates a society where each person might possess a [[means of production]], either individually or collectively, with trade representing equivalent amounts of labour in the [[free market]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mutualist.org/ |title=Introduction |publisher=Mutualist.org |accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> Integral to the scheme was the establishment of a mutual-credit bank that would lend to producers at a minimal interest rate, just high enough to cover administration.<ref>Miller, David. 1987. \"Mutualism.\" The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Political Thought.

These three phases of opposition to Liberty are met in almost every sphere of thought and human activity. Good representatives of the first are seen in the Catholic Church and the Russian autocracy; of the second, in the Protestant Church and the Manchester school of politics and political economy; of the third, in the atheism of Gambetta and the socialism of Karl Marx.\" [[Benjamin Tucker]].

Some democratic socialists support [[social democracy]] as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. Modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane, while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is either completely forgotten or redefined in a pro-capitalist way. The two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences.\n\nThe major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics: contemporary social democrats support a [[welfare state]] and unemployment insurance as a means to \"humanise\" capitalism, whereas democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to \"humanise\" capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.<ref>{{cite web |last=Schweickart |first=David |title=Democratic Socialism |website=Encyclopedia of Activism and Social Justice |year=2006 |url=http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617235335/http://orion.it.luc.edu/~dschwei/demsoc.htm |archivedate=17 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }} \"Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state\u2014pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labour movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanised, and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere. (E.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labour discipline breaks down; etc.)\"</ref>\n\nDemocratic socialism generally refers to any political movement that seeks to establish an economy based on [[economic democracy]] by and for the working class. Democratic socialism is difficult to define and groups of scholars have radically different definitions for the term. Some definitions simply refer to all forms of socialism that follow an electoral, [[Reformism|reformist]] or evolutionary path to socialism rather than a revolutionary one.<ref>This definition is captured in this statement by [[Anthony Crosland]], who \"argued that the socialisms of the pre-war world (not just that of the [[Marxist]]s, but of the democratic socialists too) were now increasingly irrelevant\". {{cite journal |first=Chris |last=Pierson |title=Lost property: What the Third Way lacks |journal=Journal of Political Ideologies |date=June 2005 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=145\u201363 |doi=10.1080/13569310500097265}} Other texts which use the terms \"democratic socialism\" in this way include Malcolm Hamilton ''Democratic Socialism in Britain and Sweden'' (St Martin's Press 1989).</ref>\n\n{{quotation|You can't talk about ending the slums without first saying profit must be taken out of slums.

The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup.

An important early influence was the thought of the American [[anarchism|anarchist]] [[Henry David Thoreau]] and his book ''[[Walden]]''<ref name=\"Thoreau\">\"Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por [[John Zerzan]]. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/xdiez.html \"La Insumisi\u00f3n voluntaria.
