The program is classified in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and the team competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall National Championships (3 NCAA Tournament championships, 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. The Jayhawks have been ranked in the AP poll for 220 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on March 18, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 1 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966-1980. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 Regular Season Conference titles.\n\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, [[James Naismith]]. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Nick Collison]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], [[Mario Chalmers]], [[Andrew Wiggins]] and [[Joel Embiid]]. Politician [[Bob Dole]] also played basketball at Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dole Institute to display letters between Phog Allen, Bob Dole|url=https://news.ku.edu/2016/02/08/dole-institute-display-letters-between-phog-allen-bob-dole|website=KU.edu}}</ref> Former players that have gone on to be coaches include [[Phog Allen]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include [[John Calipari]], [[Gregg Popovich]], and [[Bill Self]].

Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two streaks that have reached over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks will frequently play games at the nearby [[Sprint Center]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when they are not a part of a tournament.\n\n==History==\n<!-- Stats in this section need to be kept in sync with \"Rank in notable areas.\" -->\nKansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,302 wins (as of the last [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|complete season]]), against 862 losses (.728 all time winning %, 3rd all-time). This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic [[Allen Fieldhouse]]<!-- Needs to sync with prior sentence season's data. -->. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has been around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]], more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]]'s existence. The program also owns the best [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]] records in both those areas with a 412\u2013102<!-- Source?

Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native [[John McLendon]]. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach.  Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\n\nOn December 10, 2010, the [[David G. Booth|David Booth]] family purchased [[Rules of basketball|Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game]] at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. They brought the founding document of basketball back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://debrucecenter.ku.edu/rules |title=The Rules &#124; The DeBruce Center |publisher=Debrucecenter.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Phog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)===\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, [[Phog Allen|Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen]] as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|title=McGill grad James Naismith, inventor of basketball|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207055905/http://athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|archivedate=December 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]] and [[Ralph Miller]] (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas).\nAllen coached the team from 1907\u201309, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909\u20131919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded [[Helms Foundation]] national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including [[Dean Smith]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and [[Ralph Miller]] (all future Hall of Fame coaches), [[Paul Endacott]], [[Skinny Johnson|Bill Johnson]], and [[Clyde Lovellette]] (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist [[Bill Hougland]], and even former United States [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bob Dole]].\n\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over [[St. John's University (Jamaica, New York)|St. John's]], coached by [[Frank McGuire]]. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/stories/2008/aug/14/good_gold/|title=Good as gold  / LJWorld.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he was getting too \"old\". Allen had recruited legendary [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\n\n===Dick Harp era (1956\u20131964)===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilt Chamberlain]] was one of the top centers to ever play for the Jayhawks.]]\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, [[Dick Harp]]. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\n[[Wilt Chamberlain]] played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n===Ted Owens era (1964\u20131983)===\n[[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]] took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\n\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as [[Jo Jo White]], [[Walt Wesley]], [[Bud Stallworth]], [[Darnell Valentine]], and [[Dave Robisch]].\n\nAfter 19 years of coaching at [[University of Kansas]], Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\n\n===Larry Brown era (1983\u20131988)===\n[[File:1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament - National Semifinals (ticket).jpg|thumb|150px|Brown helped lead Kansas to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament championship in 1988.]]\nIn 1983, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8.  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose 2 more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of [[Danny Manning]], KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed.  Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance.  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season.  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since.  The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas' chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer [[Vincent Askew]] to see his sick grandmother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|title=Vincent Askew|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203032014/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|archivedate=December 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\n\n===Roy Williams era (1988\u20132003)===\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] as head coach.\n\nFrom 1988\u20132003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref> From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 ([[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Billy Thomas (basketball)|Billy Thomas]], and [[C.B. McGrath]]) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers.\n\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play.

Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\n\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as [[Paul Pierce]], [[Jacque Vaughn]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], and [[Scot Pollard]]. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|title=Roy, ACC Have Mixed NCAA History As No. 1|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210022429/http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|archivedate=February 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 & 2003. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his [[alma mater]], North Carolina.\n\n===Bill Self era (2003\u2013present)===\n[[Bill Self]] was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] his first year.\n\nThe next two seasons did not end on such a high note. Big things were expected of an experienced KU in 2004\u201305, led by seniors [[Wayne Simien]], [[Keith Langford]], [[Michael Lee (basketball, born 1983)|Michael Lee]], and [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to [[Bucknell Bison men's basketball|Bucknell]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]].\n\n[[File:Kansas-Basketball-Staff-Nov-15-07-Washburn.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Coach [[Bill Self]] (third from left) with his national champion 2007\u201308 squad]]\nIn [[2005\u201306 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005\u201306]], little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over [[2005\u201306 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]] with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]]. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament [[American Airlines Arena|in Dallas]], and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the [[Bradley University|Bradley Braves]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006\u201307 season]], Self led [[2006\u201307 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the [[Kevin Durant]]-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007\u201308 season]], Self's [[2007\u201308 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival [[2007\u201308 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]], their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 conference tourney]]. They received a number-one seeding in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson College]]. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed [[2007\u201308 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams.  The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366.  On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team to claim the national title.  With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368.  The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\n[[File:Championshipcrowd.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Championshipcrowd| Kansas fans celebrate in Downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas]] after the Jayhawks win the 2008 National Championship]]\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008\u201309 season]], despite losing 7 of their top 9 scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated [[Dayton Flyers men's basketball|Dayton]], advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when [[Michigan State]] came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the [[Associated Press]], [[CBS Sports]]' [[Chevrolet]] Award, [[USBWA]] ([[Henry Iba Award]]), and [[Sporting News]].\n\nOn April 13, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] announced their intent to return for the [[2009\u201310 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season. On April 23, top high school recruit [[Xavier Henry]] made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting [[ESPN]] to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\"  By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications.  The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse.  Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories).  They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133.\n\nRecruiting began immediately for the [[2010\u201311 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2010\u201311]] season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit [[Josh Selby]] in April.  By September 2010, both The [[Sporting News]] and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again do.  Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. [[Josh Selby]], became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]] was named Big 12 Player of the Year.  The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\n\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2011\u201312]] season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would come back from a 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then would face the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas would fall to the Wildcats, 67\u201359.\n\nKansas entered the [[2012\u201313 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2012\u201313]] season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow.  They continued to have the greatest home court advantage in all of sports, ending the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home.  After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title.  They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16.\n\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the [[2013\u201314 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310.\n\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen [[Kelly Oubre Jr.]] and [[Cliff Alexander]], the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a disappointing loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost their arguably strongest post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a two seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe 2015-16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\n\nIn 2016-17, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2017-18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998-99 season. The season bottomed out in early February with an ugly home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall.\n\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2015/7/13/8948825/kansas-basketball-world-university-games|title=KU-led team wins gold at World University Games|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\n\nShortly before the [[2019\u201320 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2019-20 season]] began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kansas basketball hit with major NCAA violation charges stemming from FBI probe |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/kansas-basketball-hit-with-major-ncaa-violation-charges-stemming-from-fbi-probe/ |website=CBSSports.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams and their 3 losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, however, the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] without a national champion being named.\n\n==Rank in notable areas==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by [[All-American]] [[Jo Jo White]] at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated.  This has always been highly contested and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120215/http://www.fanbase.com/photo/355160 photograph] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor.  Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo.  Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot.  This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot.  The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four.  The game is immortalized in the 2006 film ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' which is based on that season's Texas Western team.\n* On February 26, 1972, near the end of a disappointing 11\u201315 season for the Jayhawks, senior forward [[Bud Stallworth]] scored 50 points against archrival Missouri, who were in the running for the Big 8 Conference championship.  Behind Stallworth's mammoth effort, the second-highest number of points in a game in KU history (Wilt Chamberlain scored 52 in his first game as a Jayhawk), KU defeated Missouri 93\u201380 on Senior Day at Allen Fieldhouse.  Stallworth averaged 25.3 points per game for the 1971\u201372 season.\n* On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year [[Danny Manning]], Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court.  Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense.  The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down.  The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.

The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\n\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor [[Gene Budig]].

Plans for the document's enshrinement there are in the early stages.\n\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007 and January 17, 2011 until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas' previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994 through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] merged with the remaining members of the [[Southwest Conference]] to become charter members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984 through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\n\n==Home game traditions==\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, before the singing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", it is a tradition to sing the [[alma mater]], \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the [[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk|Rock Chalk Chant]].\n\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the state of Kansas anthem \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\n\nAfter singing [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The ''[[University Daily Kansan]]'', and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\n\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting [[Wheaties|Wheaties breakfast cereal.]] The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\n\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby [[Sprint Center]] on the Missouri side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\n\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\n\n==Year-by-year Results==\n{{:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball seasons}}\n\n==Record vs. Big 12 opponents==\n{{See also|Sunflower Showdown|}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| Opponent !!| Overall Record !!| Home !!| Road !!| Neutral !!| Last 5 Meetings !!| Last 10 Meetings !!| Current Streak !!| Since Beginning<br>of Big 12\n|-\n| [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]]|| '''KU''', 32\u20135||'''KU''', 17\u20130||'''KU''', 13\u20133|| Tied, 2\u20132||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 2||'''KU''', 28-5\n|-\n| [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]]|| '''KU''', 182\u201366||'''KU''', 94\u201316||'''KU''', 70\u201340||'''KU''', 18\u201310||'''KU''', 3-2|| Tied, 5\u20135||L 1||'''KU''', 37\u201315\n|-\n| [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]|| '''KU''', 197\u201394||'''KU''', 90\u201335||'''KU''', 78\u201348||'''KU''', 29\u201311||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 1|| '''KU''', 56\u201313\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]|| '''KU''', 148\u201368||'''KU''', 76\u201316||'''KU''', 52\u201344||'''KU''', 20\u20138||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 7\u20133|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 27\u20138\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]|| '''KU''', 116\u201359||'''KU''', 63\u201312||'''KU''', 37\u201335||'''KU''', 16\u201312||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 6\u20134|| '''W''' 3 || '''KU''', 27\u201312\n|-\n| [[TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball|TCU]]|| '''KU''', 18\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20130|| '''KU''', 7\u20131|| '''KU''', 3\u20131|| '''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 4|| '''KU''', 14-2\n|-\n| [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]]|| '''KU''', 33\u20139|| '''KU''', 17\u20131|| '''KU''', 10\u20137||'''KU''', 6\u20131||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20138\n|-\n| [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]|| '''KU''', 35\u20136||'''KU''', 18\u20131||'''KU''', 14\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''',8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20136\n|-\n| [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]]|| '''KU''', 12\u20135||'''KU''', 7-0||WVU, 2\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 4\u20131||'''KU''', 8\u20132||'''W''' 2||'''KU''', 12\u20135\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | <small>*As of March 16, 2017.</small><ref>http://www.big12sports.com//pdf4/133449.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&ATCLID=1522666 |title=2004\u201305 Men's Basketball Media Guide \u2013 Big 12 Conference \u2013 Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/kuathletics/docs/kumbb-2017-guide|title=2016\u201317 Kansas Basketball Media Guide|newspaper=issuu|access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Post-season results==\n\n===Regular season conference championships===\nThe Jayhawks have won 61 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 14 consecutive from 2005 through 2018.

The program is classified in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] and the team competes in the [[Big 12 Conference]]. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall National Championships (3 NCAA Tournament championships, 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. The Jayhawks have been ranked in the AP poll for 220 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on March 18, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 1 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966-1980. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 Regular Season Conference titles.\n\nThe Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, [[James Naismith]]. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including [[Clyde Lovellette]], [[Wilt Chamberlain]], [[Jo Jo White]], [[Danny Manning]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Paul Pierce]], [[Nick Collison]], [[Kirk Hinrich]], [[Mario Chalmers]], [[Andrew Wiggins]] and [[Joel Embiid]]. Politician [[Bob Dole]] also played basketball at Kansas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dole Institute to display letters between Phog Allen, Bob Dole|url=https://news.ku.edu/2016/02/08/dole-institute-display-letters-between-phog-allen-bob-dole|website=KU.edu}}</ref> Former players that have gone on to be coaches include [[Phog Allen]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include [[John Calipari]], [[Gregg Popovich]], and [[Bill Self]].

Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two streaks that have reached over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks will frequently play games at the nearby [[Sprint Center]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when they are not a part of a tournament.\n\n==History==\n<!-- Stats in this section need to be kept in sync with \"Rank in notable areas.\" -->\nKansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,302 wins (as of the last [[List of teams with the most victories in NCAA Division I men's college basketball|complete season]]), against 862 losses (.728 all time winning %, 3rd all-time). This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic [[Allen Fieldhouse]]<!-- Needs to sync with prior sentence season's data. -->. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has been around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]], more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]]'s existence. The program also owns the best [[Big 12 Conference#Men's basketball|Big 12]] records in both those areas with a 412\u2013102<!-- Source?

Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in [[Lawrence, Kansas]]. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native [[John McLendon]]. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach.  Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.)\n\nOn December 10, 2010, the [[David G. Booth|David Booth]] family purchased [[Rules of basketball|Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game]] at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. They brought the founding document of basketball back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://debrucecenter.ku.edu/rules |title=The Rules &#124; The DeBruce Center |publisher=Debrucecenter.ku.edu |date= |accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Phog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)===\nIn 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, [[Phog Allen|Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen]] as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|title=McGill grad James Naismith, inventor of basketball|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207055905/http://athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=110|archivedate=December 7, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dean Smith]], [[Dutch Lonborg]] and [[Ralph Miller]] (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas).\nAllen coached the team from 1907\u201309, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909\u20131919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction.\n\nAllen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded [[Helms Foundation]] national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including [[Dean Smith]], [[Adolph Rupp]], [[Dutch Lonborg]], and [[Ralph Miller]] (all future Hall of Fame coaches), [[Paul Endacott]], [[Skinny Johnson|Bill Johnson]], and [[Clyde Lovellette]] (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist [[Bill Hougland]], and even former United States [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bob Dole]].\n\nIn 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over [[St. John's University (Jamaica, New York)|St. John's]], coached by [[Frank McGuire]]. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ljworld.com/stories/2008/aug/14/good_gold/|title=Good as gold  / LJWorld.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936.\nAllen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he was getting too \"old\". Allen had recruited legendary [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956.\n\n===Dick Harp era (1956\u20131964)===\n[[File:Wilt Chamberlain2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wilt Chamberlain]] was one of the top centers to ever play for the Jayhawks.]]\nFollowing Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, [[Dick Harp]]. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths.\n\n[[Wilt Chamberlain]] played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]]. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]], coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]].\n\n===Ted Owens era (1964\u20131983)===\n[[Ted Owens (basketball)|Ted Owens]] took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles.\n\nThe team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette.\n\nDuring this era the program produced All-Americans such as [[Jo Jo White]], [[Walt Wesley]], [[Bud Stallworth]], [[Darnell Valentine]], and [[Dave Robisch]].\n\nAfter 19 years of coaching at [[University of Kansas]], Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons.\n\n===Larry Brown era (1983\u20131988)===\n[[File:1988 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament - National Semifinals (ticket).jpg|thumb|150px|Brown helped lead Kansas to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament championship in 1988.]]\nIn 1983, [[Larry Brown (basketball)|Larry Brown]] headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8.  The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose 2 more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of [[Danny Manning]], KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed.  Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance.  The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season.  They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since.  The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas' chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise.\n\nDuring Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer [[Vincent Askew]] to see his sick grandmother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|title=Vincent Askew|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121203032014/http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1067987/index.htm|archivedate=December 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas.\n\n===Roy Williams era (1988\u20132003)===\nShortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant [[Roy Williams (coach)|Roy Williams]] as head coach.\n\nFrom 1988\u20132003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/m_basketball_RB/2009/D1.pdf|title=Division I Records|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2017}}</ref> From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 ([[Raef LaFrentz]], [[Billy Thomas (basketball)|Billy Thomas]], and [[C.B. McGrath]]) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers.\n\nKansas won nine regular-season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play.

Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002).<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\nThe Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas.\n\nUnder Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as [[Paul Pierce]], [[Jacque Vaughn]], [[Raef LaFrentz]], and [[Scot Pollard]]. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|title=Roy, ACC Have Mixed NCAA History As No. 1|accessdate=August 3, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130210022429/http://www.wral.com/sports/blogpost/2644876/|archivedate=February 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 & 2003. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his [[alma mater]], North Carolina.\n\n===Bill Self era (2003\u2013present)===\n[[Bill Self]] was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] his first year.\n\nThe next two seasons did not end on such a high note. Big things were expected of an experienced KU in 2004\u201305, led by seniors [[Wayne Simien]], [[Keith Langford]], [[Michael Lee (basketball, born 1983)|Michael Lee]], and [[Aaron Miles (basketball)|Aaron Miles]]. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to [[Bucknell Bison men's basketball|Bucknell]] in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co-championship with [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]].\n\n[[File:Kansas-Basketball-Staff-Nov-15-07-Washburn.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Coach [[Bill Self]] (third from left) with his national champion 2007\u201308 squad]]\nIn [[2005\u201306 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005\u201306]], little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over [[2005\u201306 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|Kentucky]], they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]] with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]]. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament [[American Airlines Arena|in Dallas]], and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the [[Bradley University|Bradley Braves]].\n\nIn the [[2006\u201307 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006\u201307 season]], Self led [[2006\u201307 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the [[Kevin Durant]]-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed [[UCLA Bruins men's basketball|UCLA]].\n\nIn the [[2007\u201308 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007\u201308 season]], Self's [[2007\u201308 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival [[2007\u201308 Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball team|Kansas State]], their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the [[2008 Big 12 Men's Basketball Tournament|Big 12 conference tourney]]. They received a number-one seeding in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson College]]. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed [[2007\u201308 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams.  The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366.  On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis]] team to claim the national title.  With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368.  The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history.\n[[File:Championshipcrowd.jpg|thumb|left|350px|Championshipcrowd| Kansas fans celebrate in Downtown [[Lawrence, Kansas]] after the Jayhawks win the 2008 National Championship]]\nIn the [[2008\u201309 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008\u201309 season]], despite losing 7 of their top 9 scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated [[Dayton Flyers men's basketball|Dayton]], advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when [[Michigan State]] came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the [[Associated Press]], [[CBS Sports]]' [[Chevrolet]] Award, [[USBWA]] ([[Henry Iba Award]]), and [[Sporting News]].\n\nOn April 13, [[Sherron Collins]] and [[Cole Aldrich]] announced their intent to return for the [[2009\u201310 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season. On April 23, top high school recruit [[Xavier Henry]] made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting [[ESPN]] to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\"  By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications.  The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse.  Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories).  They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133.\n\nRecruiting began immediately for the [[2010\u201311 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2010\u201311]] season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit [[Josh Selby]] in April.  By September 2010, both The [[Sporting News]] and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again do.  Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. [[Josh Selby]], became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and [[Marcus Morris (basketball)|Marcus Morris]] was named Big 12 Player of the Year.  The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history.\n\nAfter being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2011\u201312]] season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would come back from a 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then would face the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas would fall to the Wildcats, 67\u201359.\n\nKansas entered the [[2012\u201313 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2012\u201313]] season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow.  They continued to have the greatest home court advantage in all of sports, ending the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home.  After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title.  They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16.\n\nWith star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the [[2013\u201314 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2013\u201314]] season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back-to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310.\n\nAfter the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen [[Kelly Oubre Jr.]] and [[Cliff Alexander]], the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a disappointing loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost their arguably strongest post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a two seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament.\n\nThe 2015-16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions.\n\nIn 2016-17, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight.\n\nThe 2017-18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998-99 season. The season bottomed out in early February with an ugly home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall.\n\nKansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/college-basketball/2015/7/13/8948825/kansas-basketball-world-university-games|title=KU-led team wins gold at World University Games|accessdate=March 17, 2017}}</ref> In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams.\n\nShortly before the [[2019\u201320 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|2019-20 season]] began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the [[2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal]] putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kansas basketball hit with major NCAA violation charges stemming from FBI probe |url=https://www.cbssports.com/college-basketball/news/kansas-basketball-hit-with-major-ncaa-violation-charges-stemming-from-fbi-probe/ |website=CBSSports.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams and their 3 losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, however, the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States|coronavirus pandemic]] without a national champion being named.\n\n==Rank in notable areas==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by [[All-American]] [[Jo Jo White]] at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated.  This has always been highly contested and a [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402120215/http://www.fanbase.com/photo/355160 photograph] of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor.  Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo.  Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot.  This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot.  The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four.  The game is immortalized in the 2006 film ''[[Glory Road (film)|Glory Road]]'' which is based on that season's Texas Western team.\n* On February 26, 1972, near the end of a disappointing 11\u201315 season for the Jayhawks, senior forward [[Bud Stallworth]] scored 50 points against archrival Missouri, who were in the running for the Big 8 Conference championship.  Behind Stallworth's mammoth effort, the second-highest number of points in a game in KU history (Wilt Chamberlain scored 52 in his first game as a Jayhawk), KU defeated Missouri 93\u201380 on Senior Day at Allen Fieldhouse.  Stallworth averaged 25.3 points per game for the 1971\u201372 season.\n* On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year [[Danny Manning]], Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court.  Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense.  The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down.  The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark.

The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws.\n\nOn June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor [[Gene Budig]].

Plans for the document's enshrinement there are in the early stages.\n\nKansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007 and January 17, 2011 until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas' previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994 through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the [[Big Eight Conference]] merged with the remaining members of the [[Southwest Conference]] to become charter members of the [[Big 12 Conference]]). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984 through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record.\n\n==Home game traditions==\nBefore the start of every Jayhawks home game, before the singing of \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", it is a tradition to sing the [[alma mater]], \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the [[Rock Chalk, Jayhawk|Rock Chalk Chant]].\n\nPost-game, the band will play a rendition of the state of Kansas anthem \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem.\n\nAfter singing [[The Star-Spangled Banner]], while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The ''[[University Daily Kansan]]'', and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks.\n\nIf an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting [[Wheaties|Wheaties breakfast cereal.]] The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory.\n\nIf the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby [[Sprint Center]] on the Missouri side of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena.\n\nFans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season. The practice is viewable to the public and includes skits with past players as the hosts.\n\n==Year-by-year Results==\n{{:Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball seasons}}\n\n==Record vs. Big 12 opponents==\n{{See also|Sunflower Showdown|}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!| Opponent !!| Overall Record !!| Home !!| Road !!| Neutral !!| Last 5 Meetings !!| Last 10 Meetings !!| Current Streak !!| Since Beginning<br>of Big 12\n|-\n| [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]]|| '''KU''', 32\u20135||'''KU''', 17\u20130||'''KU''', 13\u20133|| Tied, 2\u20132||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 2||'''KU''', 28-5\n|-\n| [[Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball|Iowa State]]|| '''KU''', 182\u201366||'''KU''', 94\u201316||'''KU''', 70\u201340||'''KU''', 18\u201310||'''KU''', 3-2|| Tied, 5\u20135||L 1||'''KU''', 37\u201315\n|-\n| [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|Kansas State]]|| '''KU''', 197\u201394||'''KU''', 90\u201335||'''KU''', 78\u201348||'''KU''', 29\u201311||'''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 1|| '''KU''', 56\u201313\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]]|| '''KU''', 148\u201368||'''KU''', 76\u201316||'''KU''', 52\u201344||'''KU''', 20\u20138||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 7\u20133|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 27\u20138\n|-\n| [[Oklahoma State Cowboys men's basketball|Oklahoma State]]|| '''KU''', 116\u201359||'''KU''', 63\u201312||'''KU''', 37\u201335||'''KU''', 16\u201312||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 6\u20134|| '''W''' 3 || '''KU''', 27\u201312\n|-\n| [[TCU Horned Frogs men's basketball|TCU]]|| '''KU''', 18\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20130|| '''KU''', 7\u20131|| '''KU''', 3\u20131|| '''KU''', 4\u20131|| '''KU''', 9\u20131|| '''W''' 4|| '''KU''', 14-2\n|-\n| [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]]|| '''KU''', 33\u20139|| '''KU''', 17\u20131|| '''KU''', 10\u20137||'''KU''', 6\u20131||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''', 8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20138\n|-\n| [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]|| '''KU''', 35\u20136||'''KU''', 18\u20131||'''KU''', 14\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 3\u20132|| '''KU''',8\u20132|| L 1 ||'''KU''', 29\u20136\n|-\n| [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]]|| '''KU''', 12\u20135||'''KU''', 7-0||WVU, 2\u20135||'''KU''', 3\u20130||'''KU''', 4\u20131||'''KU''', 8\u20132||'''W''' 2||'''KU''', 12\u20135\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\" | <small>*As of March 16, 2017.</small><ref>http://www.big12sports.com//pdf4/133449.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10410&ATCLID=1522666 |title=2004\u201305 Men's Basketball Media Guide \u2013 Big 12 Conference \u2013 Official Athletic Site |publisher=Big12sports.com |date= |accessdate=October 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/kuathletics/docs/kumbb-2017-guide|title=2016\u201317 Kansas Basketball Media Guide|newspaper=issuu|access-date=October 25, 2016}}</ref>\n|}\n\n==Post-season results==\n\n===Regular season conference championships===\nThe Jayhawks have won 61 conference championships since their inception, including an NCAA record 14 consecutive from 2005 through 2018.

On the center platform, there are two old indicator signs which mark the next train, formerly used for non-rush hour [[short turn]] trains. An old style sign to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] also exists. The trackway to the [[Long Island Rail Road]] [[Atlantic Branch]] is still visible at the north end of the northbound local track, although much of it is behind corrugated wall; more information about this and other unused trackways is at [[Bergen Street (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Bergen Street]]. The LIRR [[Atlantic Terminal (LIRR station)|Atlantic Terminal]] platforms, slightly lower, are clearly visible through floor-to-ceiling railings.\n\nThis station has been completely renovated. The northbound local trackway and track have been completely redone with concrete base and [[welded rail]].\n\nThe IRT Eastern Parkway Line platform has a passageway to the BMT Fourth Avenue and Brighton Lines under the platforms, with the Fourth Avenue Line to the southwest and the Brighton Line to the northeast. Another passageway between the Eastern Parkway and Brighton Line is present at the south end of the station, which also leads to an exit immediately adjacent to Barclays Center. The Barclays Center exit features a part-time booth that is staffed during events at the arena and two escalators.<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Downtown Brooklyn and Borough Hall|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/bkn/B1_downtown_brooklyn_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the station is wheelchair accessible, the Eastern Parkway Line express platform was formerly too narrow in some areas to accommodate wheelchairs. Passengers were notified of this fact by announcements on trains before reaching the station. The stairs have since been trimmed in width to allow full wheelchair access.\n\nNorth of this station, there is an unused trackway, splitting from the southbound local track for a proposed subway under Fourth Avenue (later built as the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]]). It merges with the [[Manhattan]]-bound express track and ends on a [[bumper block]] between the two express tracks at Nevins Street. When this station originally opened in 1908 it was the terminal for the line, and had two side platforms, an island platform, and two tracks. All the platforms were connected together at their southern ends.\n\nThis station is one of three express stations to have side platforms for local services and a center island platform for express services, the other two being the 34th Street\u2013Penn Station stops on the [[34th Street\u2013Penn Station (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|IND Eighth Avenue Line]] and the [[34th Street\u2013Penn Station (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] respectively. The reason for this is that the Atlantic Avenue station was originally planned as a two-track station with only the island (express) platform; the side (local) platforms were added to the plans when construction was already underway. However, this layout helps to reduce overcrowding because the station is connected to [[Atlantic Terminal]], and the next station west from Atlantic Avenue, [[Nevins Street (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Nevins Street]], is also an express station with the more common two-island-platform configuration. This limits overcrowding by preventing cross-platform interchanges between local and express services.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Fourth Avenue Line platforms ==\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center\n| former = Atlantic Avenue\u2013Pacific Street<br>Pacific Street\n| font_color = black\n| bg_color = #FFC800\n| bg_color_2 = #FF6E1A\n| image = Atlantic Ave-Barclays Center BMT Northbound Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = Manhattan-bound platform\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]]\n| service = Fourth center\n| service_header = Fourth center header\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]\n| tracks = 4\n| structure = Underground\n| accessible = yes\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1915|June|22|mf=yes}}<ref name=\"bde 061915\"/>\n| code = 027\n| wifi = yes\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type=local | station=DeKalb Avenue | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via Broadway | station=Canal Street | line=BMT Manhattan Bridge Line | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via 6th Avenue | station=Grand Street | line=IND Sixth Avenue Line | service=Manhattan Bridge north bypass}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=Union Street | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=36th Street | service=Fourth center express}}\n| next_north_acc = {{NYCS next | type=local | station=DeKalb Avenue | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via Broadway | station=14th Street\u2013Union Square | line=BMT Broadway Line | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via 6th Avenue | station=Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street | line=IND Sixth Avenue Line | service=Manhattan Bridge north bypass}}\n| next_south_acc = {{NYCS next | type=via Sea Beach Line | line=BMT Sea Beach Line | station=New Utrecht Avenue | service=Sea Beach local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via West End Line | station=62nd Street | line=BMT West End Line | service=West End}}<br>{{NYCS next|terminal=none|service=Fourth far south|time=show}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushpeak}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|default}};{{linear-gradient|left|#{{NYCS color|orange}}, #{{NYCS color|yellow}}}}\n|style=margin-top:10px;\n|legend = track\n|map=numN330\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Canal Street (BMT Broadway Line via Bridge)|Canal St]] or [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand St]]\nudSTR!~dMFADEg\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~to [[DeKalb Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|DeKalb Av]]\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nuv\u00dcSTl\\uv\u00dcSTr\nudSTR\\uv\u00dcSTr\\udSTR\nuv-SHI2r\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2l-\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuvSHI2l-\\uvSTR\\uv-SHI2r\nudSTR!~dMFADEf\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Union Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Union St]]\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[36th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|36 St]]\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center''' (originally '''Pacific Street''' then '''Atlantic Avenue\u2013Pacific Street''') is an express station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s.

The area on the southbound wall where the platform extends out is made of replicas as well.

On the center platform, there are two old indicator signs which mark the next train, formerly used for non-rush hour [[short turn]] trains. An old style sign to the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] also exists. The trackway to the [[Long Island Rail Road]] [[Atlantic Branch]] is still visible at the north end of the northbound local track, although much of it is behind corrugated wall; more information about this and other unused trackways is at [[Bergen Street (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Bergen Street]]. The LIRR [[Atlantic Terminal (LIRR station)|Atlantic Terminal]] platforms, slightly lower, are clearly visible through floor-to-ceiling railings.\n\nThis station has been completely renovated. The northbound local trackway and track have been completely redone with concrete base and [[welded rail]].\n\nThe IRT Eastern Parkway Line platform has a passageway to the BMT Fourth Avenue and Brighton Lines under the platforms, with the Fourth Avenue Line to the southwest and the Brighton Line to the northeast. Another passageway between the Eastern Parkway and Brighton Line is present at the south end of the station, which also leads to an exit immediately adjacent to Barclays Center. The Barclays Center exit features a part-time booth that is staffed during events at the arena and two escalators.<ref name=maps>{{cite web|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Downtown Brooklyn and Borough Hall|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/bkn/B1_downtown_brooklyn_2015.pdf|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=August 2, 2015|date=2015}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the station is wheelchair accessible, the Eastern Parkway Line express platform was formerly too narrow in some areas to accommodate wheelchairs. Passengers were notified of this fact by announcements on trains before reaching the station. The stairs have since been trimmed in width to allow full wheelchair access.\n\nNorth of this station, there is an unused trackway, splitting from the southbound local track for a proposed subway under Fourth Avenue (later built as the [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]]). It merges with the [[Manhattan]]-bound express track and ends on a [[bumper block]] between the two express tracks at Nevins Street. When this station originally opened in 1908 it was the terminal for the line, and had two side platforms, an island platform, and two tracks. All the platforms were connected together at their southern ends.\n\nThis station is one of three express stations to have side platforms for local services and a center island platform for express services, the other two being the 34th Street\u2013Penn Station stops on the [[34th Street\u2013Penn Station (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|IND Eighth Avenue Line]] and the [[34th Street\u2013Penn Station (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line]] respectively. The reason for this is that the Atlantic Avenue station was originally planned as a two-track station with only the island (express) platform; the side (local) platforms were added to the plans when construction was already underway. However, this layout helps to reduce overcrowding because the station is connected to [[Atlantic Terminal]], and the next station west from Atlantic Avenue, [[Nevins Street (IRT Eastern Parkway Line)|Nevins Street]], is also an express station with the more common two-island-platform configuration. This limits overcrowding by preventing cross-platform interchanges between local and express services.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== BMT Fourth Avenue Line platforms ==\n{{Infobox NYCS\n| name = Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center\n| former = Atlantic Avenue\u2013Pacific Street<br>Pacific Street\n| font_color = black\n| bg_color = #FFC800\n| bg_color_2 = #FF6E1A\n| image = Atlantic Ave-Barclays Center BMT Northbound Platform.jpg\n| image_caption = Manhattan-bound platform\n| division = BMT\n| line = [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]]\n| service = Fourth center\n| service_header = Fourth center header\n| platforms = 2 [[island platform]]s<br>[[cross-platform interchange]]\n| tracks = 4\n| structure = Underground\n| accessible = yes\n| open_date = {{start date and age|1915|June|22|mf=yes}}<ref name=\"bde 061915\"/>\n| code = 027\n| wifi = yes\n| next_north = {{NYCS next | type=local | station=DeKalb Avenue | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via Broadway | station=Canal Street | line=BMT Manhattan Bridge Line | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via 6th Avenue | station=Grand Street | line=IND Sixth Avenue Line | service=Manhattan Bridge north bypass}}\n| next_south = {{NYCS next | type=local | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=Union Street | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | station=36th Street | service=Fourth center express}}\n| next_north_acc = {{NYCS next | type=local | station=DeKalb Avenue | line=BMT Fourth Avenue Line | service=Fourth center local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via Broadway | station=14th Street\u2013Union Square | line=BMT Broadway Line | service=Manhattan Bridge south bypass}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=express via 6th Avenue | station=Broadway\u2013Lafayette Street | line=IND Sixth Avenue Line | service=Manhattan Bridge north bypass}}\n| next_south_acc = {{NYCS next | type=via Sea Beach Line | line=BMT Sea Beach Line | station=New Utrecht Avenue | service=Sea Beach local}}<br>{{NYCS next | type=via West End Line | station=62nd Street | line=BMT West End Line | service=West End}}<br>{{NYCS next|terminal=none|service=Fourth far south|time=show}}\n| legend = {{NYCS infobox legend|allexceptnights}}{{NYCS infobox legend|alltimes}}{{NYCS infobox legend|nightsonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushonly}}{{NYCS infobox legend|rushpeak}}\n}}\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|default}};{{linear-gradient|left|#{{NYCS color|orange}}, #{{NYCS color|yellow}}}}\n|style=margin-top:10px;\n|legend = track\n|map=numN330\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Canal Street (BMT Broadway Line via Bridge)|Canal St]] or [[Grand Street (IND Sixth Avenue Line)|Grand St]]\nudSTR!~dMFADEg\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~to [[DeKalb Avenue (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|DeKalb Av]]\nuvSTRf\\uvSTRg\nuv\u00dcSTl\\uv\u00dcSTr\nudSTR\\uv\u00dcSTr\\udSTR\nuv-SHI2r\\uvSTR\\uvSHI2l-\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nudSTR\\dBS\\uvSTR\\dBS\\udSTR\nuvSHI2l-\\uvSTR\\uv-SHI2r\nudSTR!~dMFADEf\\uvSTR\\udSTR!~dMFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Union Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Union St]]\nuvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[36th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|36 St]]\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Atlantic Avenue\u2013Barclays Center''' (originally '''Pacific Street''' then '''Atlantic Avenue\u2013Pacific Street''') is an express station on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line that has four tracks and two [[island platform]]s.

He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 [[war crimes trial]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'' for their actions in what became known as the [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck#Peleus affair|''Peleus'' affair]]. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of [[British Kenya]] during [[Jomo Kenyatta]]'s unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]]. Later that year he represented the litigants in the [[Crichel Down affair]], which led to changes in the law on [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]]. In 1955 he defended [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|executed for murder]] in the United Kingdom. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. Two years later, Stevenson took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of [[John Bodkin Adams]] for the murder of [[Death of Edith Alice Morrell|Edith Alice Morrell]].\n\nStevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the [[Kray twins]] to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30&nbsp;years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the [[Angry Brigade]] 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.\n\nOne of his fellow judges, Sir [[Robin Dunn]], described him as \"the worst judge since the war\".<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence,<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> among them fellow judge and biographer [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Lord Roskill]], who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] described Stevenson as the \"last of the grand eccentrics\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|p=38|ps=none}} Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]] in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.\n\n==Early life==\nStevenson was born in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of [[Henry Wickham Steed]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> journalist and editor of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1919 until 1922.<ref name=\"Steed\"/> The Rev. J. G. Stevenson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into relative poverty. An uncle who was a [[solicitor]] funded Stevenson's ongoing education at [[Dulwich College]] in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available to allow him to attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an [[articled clerk]] in his uncle's legal practice.<ref name= \"ODNB\"/> Stevenson was determined to become a [[barrister]], and joined the [[Inner Temple]], of which he became the treasurer in 1972.\n\n==Career at the bar==\nShortly after being [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1925 he joined the [[chambers (law)|chambers]] of [[Wintringham Stable]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> at 2 Crown Office Row,<ref name=\"ViscountBledisloe\"/> now [[Fountain Court Chambers]].<ref name=\"TheLawyer\"/> He remained there for the rest of his legal career except for the war years,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> eventually becoming head of chambers.<ref name=\"SirPeterWebster\"/>\n\nMost of Stevenson's early legal work was in the field of [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvencies]], \"almost always with small fees\", and he made steady progress until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Deputy Judge Advocate]] with the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]];<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> he was appointed a [[King's Counsel]] in 1943.<ref name=\"London Gazette36069\"/> In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in [[Hamburg]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'', the so-called ''Peleus'' affair.<ref name=\"UBoatNet\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-1.pdf |title=Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals |last=United Nations War Crimes Commission |year=1947 |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |pages=1\u201320 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The U-boat captain, [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck]], was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the [[SS Peleus|SS ''Peleus'']], which they had just torpedoed and sunk.

When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=330|ps=none}}\n\nAccording to fellow judge [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Eustace Roskill]], Stevenson's \"fluent delivery, distinctive voice, remarkable sense of timing, and pungency of phrase soon marked him out as an advocate of note.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> One commentator described him as a \"shameless performer\" in court. He was probably the most successful barrister of his day.<ref name=\"John Platts-Mills\"/>\n\nIn 1955, aided by junior counsel [[Sebag Shaw]] and [[Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell|Peter Rawlinson]], Stevenson defended [[Ruth Ellis]] against the charge of murdering her lover. Stevenson's decision to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum,{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=136|ps=none}} and his \"near silent performance in court\",{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=210|ps=none}} have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: \"Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no question here but this woman shot this man&nbsp;... You will not hear one word from me&nbsp;\u2013 or from the lady herself&nbsp;\u2013 questioning that.\"{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=207|ps=none}} The jury took 23&nbsp;minutes to find Ellis guilty;{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|loc=back cover|ps=none}} she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment in the UK]] in 1969.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|The 1965 [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965|Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act]] abolished the death penalty for murder.

The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised,{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=241|ps=none}} and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' was scathingly described by the trial judge, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]], as \"an abuse of process\", saying: \"The use of ''nolle prosequi'' to conceal the deficiencies of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|pp=180\u2013182|ps=none}} Stevenson was of the opinion that had he been allowed to, he \"could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts\".{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=242}} Journalist [[Rodney Hallworth]] reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court \"I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law.

He then began to attract press attention.<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> Known for his outspokenness,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Stevenson described one case as a \"pretty anaemic kind of rape\", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend<ref name=MarcelBerlins/> and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence.<ref name=\"Millbank\"/> To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked \"I see you come from [[Slough]]. It is a terrible place. You can go back there.\"{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in [[Manchester]] was \"a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}}\n\nFollowing a 1964 parallel of his comments in the wake of the Bodkin Adams case, Stevenson attracted criticism for his summing up to the jury in the case of ''Ryan'':<ref>''Ryan'' (1964) 50 Cr App R 144, at 148</ref> {{quote|It is, we think, clear&nbsp;... that it is wrong to say to a jury \"Because the accused exercised what is undoubtedly his right, the privilege of remaining silent, you may draw an inference of guilt\"; it is quite a different matter to say \"this accused, as he is entitled to do, has not advanced at an earlier stage the explanation that has been offered to you today; you the jury may take that into account when you are assessing the weight that you think it right to attribute to the explanation.\"<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/>}}\nThe academic lawyer [[Rupert Cross]] described Stevenson's pronouncement as \"gibberish\", and to the Court of Appeal in 1977 it seemed that Stevenson had made a distinction \"without a difference\".<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/> Although Stevenson's direction was not in accordance with the law in 1964, Parliament introduced a form of caution under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that reflects what he proposed. His earlier suggestion that defendants in criminal trials should be forced to answer prosecution questions has not been adopted.\n\nStevenson believed that it was the judge's duty to help prevent crime by imposing robust punishments on those found guilty,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and he became noted for the severity of his sentencing, which led to occasional calls from the \"[[liberal elite|liberal establishment]]\" for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}} In 1969 he sentenced the [[Kray twins]], Reggie and Ronnie, to a minimum of 30&nbsp;years in jail each, saying, \"In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/> He remarked later that the Krays had only told the truth twice during the trial: when Reggie referred to a barrister as \"a fat slob\" and when Ronnie accused the judge of being biased.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1970 he controversially gave what were seen as excessively long sentences to eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], a demonstration against the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military government]] that turned violent.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|name=Garden House|All eight of the students found guilty of at least one offence received custodial sentences ranging from nine to eighteen months; those under 21 were sent to [[borstal]] rather than prison.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} He noted that the sentences would have been even longer but for the students' exposure to \"the evil influence of some members of the university\". There were few, if any, examples of serious violence at student demonstrations in the years which followed the trial.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}}{{efn|name=Appeals|All but one of the sentences were upheld on appeal.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} The following year he gave a 15-year sentence to Jake Prescott, a member of [[the Angry Brigade]], for conspiracy to cause explosions. Prescott had been found not guilty of direct involvement in the bombings, but had admitted to addressing three envelopes. His sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal.<ref name=\"GlasgowHerald\"/><ref name=\"MailOnline\"/>\n\nStevenson turned down a chance to join the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], a decision he later regretted, and was subsequently critical of some of its decisions.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]] in the 1973 [[New Year Honours]].<ref name=\"London Gazette45860\"/> His reference to the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] as a \"buggers' charter\" earned him a reprimand from the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Elwyn Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones|Elwyn Jones]], and a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] calling for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}{{efn|Stevenson made his comment while sentencing a 61-year-old man to five years in prison for homosexual acts involving teenagers: \"Cases such as these are all the more grave in these days because some years ago Parliament committed itself to pass a buggers' charter ...\".<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>}} In 1976 the Court of Appeal overturned three of Stevenson's decisions in a single day, and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Marcus Lipton]] tabled another parliamentary motion calling for his removal from the bench.{{sfn|Coote|1993|p=140|ps=none}}\n\nBut Eustace Roskill cautions that \"It would be wrong to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases&nbsp;.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: \"You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's something to be said for him, you do your best not to put him inside.\"{{sfn|Baker|2005|p=152}} Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWhen asked towards the end of his career whether he had been stung by the criticism he had received, Stevenson replied \"A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>\n\nIn an article published on the day of Stevenson's retirement [[Corinna Adam]] of ''The Guardian'' observed that:\n{{quote|He [Stevenson] holds the record among Old Bailey judges for having his sentences queried and taken to appeal. He also holds the record for getting away with it.

He opened his campaign by declaring that in the interests of a clean fight, he would make no allusions to the \"alleged homosexuality\" of his opponent, [[Tom Driberg]],{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} who heavily defeated him in the vote; Stevenson returned to his legal practice the following year.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nDespite his severe manner, Stevenson was extremely sociable and he was often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the [[Garrick Club]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> of which he was a member.<ref name=\"WhosWho\"/> His home at [[Winchelsea]] on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival.{{sfn|Cooper|1850|p=112|ps=none}} Following his retirement, Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders,{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Among the programmes he took part in was [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]]'s six-part series ''[[State

Later that year he represented the litigants in the [[Crichel Down affair]], which led to changes in the law on [[eminent domain|compulsory purchase]]. In 1955 he defended [[Ruth Ellis]], the last woman to be [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|executed for murder]] in the United Kingdom. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by [[Home Secretary]] [[Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby|Gwilym Lloyd George]]. Two years later, Stevenson took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of [[John Bodkin Adams]] for the murder of [[Death of Edith Alice Morrell|Edith Alice Morrell]].\n\nStevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the [[Kray twins]] to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30&nbsp;years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the [[Angry Brigade]] 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.\n\nOne of his fellow judges, Sir [[Robin Dunn]], described him as \"the worst judge since the war\".<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence,<ref name=\"WorstJudge\"/> among them fellow judge and biographer [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Lord Roskill]], who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Lord Devlin]] described Stevenson as the \"last of the grand eccentrics\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|p=38|ps=none}} Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at [[St Leonards-on-Sea|St Leonards]] in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.\n\n==Early life==\nStevenson was born in [[Newquay]], Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of [[Henry Wickham Steed]],<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> journalist and editor of ''[[The Times]]'' from 1919 until 1922.<ref name=\"Steed\"/> The Rev. J. G. Stevenson, a [[Congregational church|Congregational]] minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into relative poverty. An uncle who was a [[solicitor]] funded Stevenson's ongoing education at [[Dulwich College]] in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available to allow him to attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an [[articled clerk]] in his uncle's legal practice.<ref name= \"ODNB\"/> Stevenson was determined to become a [[barrister]], and joined the [[Inner Temple]], of which he became the treasurer in 1972.\n\n==Career at the bar==\nShortly after being [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in 1925 he joined the [[chambers (law)|chambers]] of [[Wintringham Stable]]<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> at 2 Crown Office Row,<ref name=\"ViscountBledisloe\"/> now [[Fountain Court Chambers]].<ref name=\"TheLawyer\"/> He remained there for the rest of his legal career except for the war years,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> eventually becoming head of chambers.<ref name=\"SirPeterWebster\"/>\n\nMost of Stevenson's early legal work was in the field of [[United Kingdom insolvency law|insolvencies]], \"almost always with small fees\", and he made steady progress until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a [[Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces|Deputy Judge Advocate]] with the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]];<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> he was appointed a [[King's Counsel]] in 1943.<ref name=\"London Gazette36069\"/> In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in [[Hamburg]] of former personnel of the German submarine ''[[German submarine U-852|U-852]]'', the so-called ''Peleus'' affair.<ref name=\"UBoatNet\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/Law-Reports_Vol-1.pdf |title=Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals |last=United Nations War Crimes Commission |year=1947 |publisher=His Majesty's Stationery Office |pages=1\u201320 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> The U-boat captain, [[Heinz-Wilhelm Eck]], was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the [[SS Peleus|SS ''Peleus'']], which they had just torpedoed and sunk.

When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.{{sfn|Cooke|2003|p=330|ps=none}}\n\nAccording to fellow judge [[Eustace Roskill, Baron Roskill|Eustace Roskill]], Stevenson's \"fluent delivery, distinctive voice, remarkable sense of timing, and pungency of phrase soon marked him out as an advocate of note.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> One commentator described him as a \"shameless performer\" in court. He was probably the most successful barrister of his day.<ref name=\"John Platts-Mills\"/>\n\nIn 1955, aided by junior counsel [[Sebag Shaw]] and [[Peter Rawlinson, Baron Rawlinson of Ewell|Peter Rawlinson]], Stevenson defended [[Ruth Ellis]] against the charge of murdering her lover. Stevenson's decision to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum,{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=136|ps=none}} and his \"near silent performance in court\",{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=210|ps=none}} have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: \"Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no question here but this woman shot this man&nbsp;... You will not hear one word from me&nbsp;\u2013 or from the lady herself&nbsp;\u2013 questioning that.\"{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|p=207|ps=none}} The jury took 23&nbsp;minutes to find Ellis guilty;{{sfn|Jakubait|Weller|2005|loc=back cover|ps=none}} she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of [[capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment in the UK]] in 1969.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|The 1965 [[Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965|Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act]] abolished the death penalty for murder.

The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised,{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=241|ps=none}} and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a ''[[nolle prosequi]]'' was scathingly described by the trial judge, [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]], as \"an abuse of process\", saying: \"The use of ''nolle prosequi'' to conceal the deficiencies of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all\".{{sfn|Devlin|1986|pp=180\u2013182|ps=none}} Stevenson was of the opinion that had he been allowed to, he \"could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts\".{{sfn|Hallworth|Williams|1983|p=242}} Journalist [[Rodney Hallworth]] reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court \"I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law.

He then began to attract press attention.<ref name=\"TimesObit\"/> Known for his outspokenness,<ref name=\"BBC\" /> Stevenson described one case as a \"pretty anaemic kind of rape\", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend<ref name=MarcelBerlins/> and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence.<ref name=\"Millbank\"/> To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked \"I see you come from [[Slough]]. It is a terrible place. You can go back there.\"{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}} In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in [[Manchester]] was \"a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}}\n\nFollowing a 1964 parallel of his comments in the wake of the Bodkin Adams case, Stevenson attracted criticism for his summing up to the jury in the case of Ryan (1964) 50 Cr App R 144, at 148:{{quote|It is, we think, clear&nbsp;... that it is wrong to say to a jury \"Because the accused exercised what is undoubtedly his right, the privilege of remaining silent, you may draw an inference of guilt\"; it is quite a different matter to say \"this accused, as he is entitled to do, has not advanced at an earlier stage the explanation that has been offered to you today; you the jury may take that into account when you are assessing the weight that you think it right to attribute to the explanation.\"<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/>}}\nThe academic lawyer [[Rupert Cross]] described Stevenson's pronouncement as \"gibberish\", and to the Court of Appeal in 1977 it seemed that Stevenson had made a distinction \"without a difference\".<ref name=\"SpikingTheJudge\"/> Although Stevenson's direction was not in accordance with the law in 1964, Parliament introduced a form of caution under the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] that reflects what he proposed. His earlier suggestion that defendants in criminal trials should be forced to answer prosecution questions has not been adopted.\n\nStevenson believed that it was the judge's duty to help prevent crime by imposing robust punishments on those found guilty,<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> and he became noted for the severity of his sentencing, which led to occasional calls from the \"[[liberal elite|liberal establishment]]\" for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=31|ps=none}} In 1969 he sentenced the [[Kray twins]], Reggie and Ronnie, to a minimum of 30&nbsp;years in jail each, saying, \"In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.\"<ref name=\"BBC\"/> He remarked later that the Krays had only told the truth twice during the trial: when Reggie referred to a barrister as \"a fat slob\" and when Ronnie accused the judge of being biased.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}\n\nIn 1970 he controversially gave what were seen as excessively long sentences to eight Cambridge University students who took part in the [[Garden House riot]], a demonstration against the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|Greek military government]] that turned violent.<ref name=\"NYTObit\"/>{{efn|name=Garden House|All eight of the students found guilty of at least one offence received custodial sentences ranging from nine to eighteen months; those under 21 were sent to [[borstal]] rather than prison.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} He noted that the sentences would have been even longer but for the students' exposure to \"the evil influence of some members of the university\". There were few, if any, examples of serious violence at student demonstrations in the years which followed the trial.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}}{{efn|name=Appeals|All but one of the sentences were upheld on appeal.<ref name=\"GardenHouse\"/>}} The following year he gave a 15-year sentence to Jake Prescott, a member of [[the Angry Brigade]], for conspiracy to cause explosions.

His sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal.<ref name=\"GlasgowHerald\"/><ref name=\"MailOnline\"/>\n\nStevenson turned down a chance to join the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]], a decision he later regretted, and was subsequently critical of some of its decisions.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> He was appointed a [[Privy Counsellor]] in the 1973 [[New Year Honours]].<ref name=\"London Gazette45860\"/> His reference to the [[Sexual Offences Act 1967]] as a \"buggers' charter\" earned him a reprimand from the [[Lord Chancellor]] [[Elwyn Jones, Baron Elwyn-Jones|Elwyn Jones]], and a [[motion (parliamentary procedure)|parliamentary motion]] in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|UK House of Commons]] calling for his resignation.{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=32|ps=none}}{{efn|Stevenson made his comment while sentencing a 61-year-old man to five years in prison for homosexual acts involving teenagers: \"Cases such as these are all the more grave in these days because some years ago Parliament committed itself to pass a buggers' charter ...\".<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>}} In 1976 the Court of Appeal overturned three of Stevenson's decisions in a single day, and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Marcus Lipton]] tabled another parliamentary motion calling for his removal from the bench.{{sfn|Coote|1993|p=140|ps=none}}\n\nBut Eustace Roskill cautions that \"It would be wrong to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases&nbsp;.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors.\"<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: \"You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's something to be said for him, you do your best not to put him inside.\"{{sfn|Baker|2005|p=152}} Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/>\n\nWhen asked towards the end of his career whether he had been stung by the criticism he had received, Stevenson replied \"A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists\".{{sfn|Massingberd|2001|p=33|ps=none}} There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.<ref name=\"GuardianGoodbye\"/>\n\nIn an article published on the day of Stevenson's retirement [[Corinna Adam]] of ''The Guardian'' observed that:\n{{quote|He [Stevenson] holds the record among Old Bailey judges for having his sentences queried and taken to appeal.
