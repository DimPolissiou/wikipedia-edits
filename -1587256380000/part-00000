She has frequently reinvented her music and image while remaining completely in charge of every aspect of her career. Her diverse works, which incorporated social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both critical acclaim and controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, Madonna signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (Madonna album)|eponymous debut album]] the next year. She followed it with a series of [[Madonna albums discography|successful albums]], including [[List of best-selling albums|global bestsellers]] ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' (1986) as well as [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Madonna has attained many [[Madonna singles discography|number-one singles]] throughout her career, including \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\", \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\", \"[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]\", \"[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]\", \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\", \"[[Hung Up]]\", and \"[[4 Minutes]]\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was further enhanced by [[Madonna filmography|her roles in films]] such as ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' (1985), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996). While ''Evita'' earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992. Her other ventures include [[Madonna fashion brands|fashion design]], [[Madonna bibliography|children's books]], health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and [[Raising Malawi]] in 2006.\n\nHaving sold more than 300 million records worldwide<!--Do ''not'' change without consensus on talk page-->, Madonna is certified as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female recording artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart history.

The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades...

She has frequently reinvented her music and image while remaining completely in charge of every aspect of her career. Her diverse works, which incorporated social, political, sexual, and religious themes, have generated both critical acclaim and controversy. Madonna is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]].\n\nBorn and raised in [[Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, Madonna signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (Madonna album)|eponymous debut album]] the next year. She followed it with a series of [[Madonna albums discography|successful albums]], including [[List of best-selling albums|global bestsellers]] ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' (1986) as well as [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Madonna has attained many [[Madonna singles discography|number-one singles]] throughout her career, including \"[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]\", \"[[La Isla Bonita]]\", \"[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]\", \"[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]\", \"[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]\", \"[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]\", \"[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]\", \"[[Hung Up]]\", and \"[[4 Minutes]]\".\n\nMadonna's popularity was further enhanced by [[Madonna filmography|her roles in films]] such as ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' (1985), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996). While ''Evita'' earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], many of her other films received poor reviews. As a businesswoman, Madonna founded an entertainment company called [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]] (including the label Maverick Records) in 1992. Her other ventures include [[Madonna fashion brands|fashion design]], [[Madonna bibliography|children's books]], health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributes to various charities, having founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and [[Raising Malawi]] in 2006.\n\nHaving sold more than 300 million records worldwide<!--Do ''not'' change without consensus on talk page-->, Madonna is certified as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female recording artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart history. She holds the [[List of Madonna records and achievements|record for the most number-one singles]] by a female artist in [[List of artists who reached number one on the Australian singles chart|Australia]], [[List of number-one singles in Canada|Canada]], [[List of artists who reached number one on the Italian Singles Chart|Italy]], [[List of artists who reached number one on the Spanish Singles Chart|Spain]], and the [[List of artists by number of UK Singles Chart number ones|United Kingdom]]. She remains the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time]], accumulating U.S. $1.4&nbsp;billion from her concert tickets. Madonna was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2008, her first year of eligibility.

Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.<ref>{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}</ref>\n\nMadonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a \"lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades...

Before the start of the [[2006-07 ECHL season|2006-07 season]], Salmon Kings' Vice President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, [[Dan Belisle]] signed an affiliation agreement with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and it's [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] on July 18, 2006.  Through the affiliation agreement, the Canucks assigned goaltender [[Julien Ellis]]; forwards [[Marc Andre-Bernier]], [[F.P. Guenette]] and defenseman [[Patrick Coulombe]], while the Moose assigned defensemen [[Matt Kelly (ice hockey)|Matt Kelly]] and forward [[Shaun Heshka]]. Along with this move, Dan Belisle also signed [[Wes Goldie]], [[Milan Gajic]], [[Kiel McLeod]] and [[Mike Stutzel]] to ECHL contracts to play for the Salmon Kings.  Through these moves the Salmon Kings hoped to become a powerhouse in its third season.  However, under their new head coach [[Tony MacAuley]], the team struggled through the first half of the season, which caused Belisle to fire MacAuley, after three months behind the bench.  Dan Belisle would then hire assistant coach [[Mark Morrison (ice hockey b. 1963)|Mark Morrison]] to become the fourth head coach in Salmon Kings' history.  Belisle's other mid-season move included a big trade with the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]], and traded [[Adam Taylor]], and David Wrigley, for [[Jordan Krestanovich]] and his brother, [[Derek Krestanovich]].  Through these mid-season moves, the Salmon Kings started to respond going on a late season run and finished their remaining regular season games on a nine-game winning streak.  With the nine-game winning streak, the Salmon Kings completed their season with a 36-32-1-3 record and finished 7th overall in the National Conference to play against the [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] in their first playoff appearance. The Salmon Kings would eventually win Game 1 by a score of 3-2, but the Aces managed to win their next 4 out of 5 games to win the series 4-2. One of the season highlights for the Salmon Kings, was forward Wes Goldie who led the team and the National Conference with 41 goals.\n\n==Standings==\n\n===Division standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"30%\" | West Division\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GP\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | W\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | L\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | Pts\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GF\n! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" width=\"5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\"\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n===Conference standings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"40%\" | National Conference\n! width=\"5%\" | GP\n! width=\"5%\" | W\n! width=\"5%\" | L\n! width=\"5%\" | OTL\n! width=\"5%\" | SOL\n! width=\"7.5%\" | PTS\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GF\n! width=\"7.5%\" | GA\n|-\n|align=left| [[Las Vegas Wranglers]] ([[Calgary Flames|CGY]]) ||72||46||12|| 6|| 8|| '''106'''||231||187\n|-\n|align=left| [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] ([[St. Louis Blues|STL]]) ||72||49||16|| 3|| 4||'''105'''||270||176\n|-\n|align=left| [[Bakersfield Condors (1998\u20132015)|Bakersfield Condors]] (Independent) ||72||41||19|| 3|| 9||'''94'''||270||236\n|-\n|align=left| [[Idaho Steelheads]] ([[Dallas Stars|DAL]]) ||72||42||24|| 2|| 4||'''90'''||240||208\n|-\n|align=left| [[Stockton Thunder]] ([[Edmonton Oilers|EDM]]) ||72||38||24|| 5|| 5||'''86'''||225||197\n|-\n|align=left| [[Fresno Falcons]] ([[San Jose Sharks|SJ]]) ||72||34||29|| 5|| 4||'''77'''||195||197\n|-bgcolor=#bbffbb\n|align=left| [[Victoria Salmon Kings]] ([[Vancouver Canucks|VAN]]) ||72||36||32|| 1|| 3|| '''76'''||239||249\n|-\n|align=left| [[Phoenix RoadRunners]] ([[Phoenix Coyotes|PHX]]) ||72||27||40|| 2|| 3||'''59'''||201||255\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n| || || || || || || || ||\n|-\n|align=left| [[Long Beach Ice Dogs]] ([[Boston Bruins|BOS]]) ||72||27||42|| 0|| 3||'''57'''||209||267\n|-\n|align=left| [[Utah Grizzlies]] (Independent) ||72||22||42|| 4|| 4||'''52'''||184||294\n|}\n\n==Schedule and results==\n\n===Regular season===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" width=90% style=\"clear:both; margin:1.5em auto; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#00004D; color:#B5A642;\" | 2006\u201307 Game log\n|-\n| colspan=11 |\n{| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" width=100%\n|-\n! colspan=11 style=\"background:#B5A642; color:#00004D;\" | October: 1\u20133\u20130\u20131 (Home: 1\u20131\u20130\u20131 ; Road: 0\u20132\u20130\u20130)\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dddddd\"\n! # !!

Before the start of the [[2006-07 ECHL season|2006-07 season]], Salmon Kings' Vice President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, [[Dan Belisle]] signed an affiliation agreement with the [[Vancouver Canucks]] and it's [[American Hockey League|AHL]] affiliate, the [[Manitoba Moose]] on July 18, 2006.  Through the affiliation agreement, the Canucks assigned goaltender [[Julien Ellis]]; forwards [[Marc Andre-Bernier]], [[F.P. Guenette]] and defenseman [[Patrick Coulombe]], while the Moose assigned defensemen [[Matt Kelly (ice hockey)|Matt Kelly]] and forward [[Shaun Heshka]]. Along with this move, Dan Belisle also signed [[Wes Goldie]], [[Milan Gajic]], [[Kiel McLeod]] and [[Mike Stutzel]] to ECHL contracts to play for the Salmon Kings.  Through these moves the Salmon Kings hoped to become a powerhouse in its third season.  However, under their new head coach [[Tony MacAuley]], the team struggled through the first half of the season, which caused Belisle to fire MacAuley, after three months behind the bench.  Dan Belisle would then hire assistant coach [[Mark Morrison (ice hockey b. 1963)|Mark Morrison]] to become the fourth head coach in Salmon Kings' history.  Belisle's other mid-season move included a big trade with the [[Pensacola Ice Pilots]], and traded [[Adam Taylor]], and David Wrigley, for [[Jordan Krestanovich]] and his brother, [[Derek Krestanovich]].  Through these mid-season moves, the Salmon Kings started to respond going on a late season run and finished their remaining regular season games on a nine-game winning streak.  With the nine-game winning streak, the Salmon Kings completed their season with a 36-32-1-3 record and finished 7th overall in the National Conference to play against the [[Alaska Aces (ECHL)|Alaska Aces]] in their first playoff appearance. The Salmon Kings would eventually win Game 1 by a score of 3-2, but the Aces managed to win their next 4 out of 5 games to win the series 4-2.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.
