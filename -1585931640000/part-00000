The film was adapted by [[Hume Cronyn]] with a screenplay by [[Arthur Laurents]].<ref name =\"Unleashed\">''Rope Unleashed&nbsp;\u2013 Making Of'' (2000)&nbsp;\u2013 documentary on the [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] [[DVD]] of the film.</ref>\n\nThe film was produced by Hitchcock and [[Sidney Bernstein, Baron Bernstein|Sidney Bernstein]] as the first of their [[Transatlantic Pictures]] productions. Starring [[James Stewart]], [[John Dall]] and [[Farley Granger]], this is the first of Hitchcock's [[Technicolor]] films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/rope/258105/before-birdman-there-was-alfred-hitchcock-s-rope|title=Before Birdman There Was Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|publisher=}}</ref> and is notable for taking place in [[real time (media)|real time]] and being edited so as to appear as a single shot through the use of [[long take]]s.<ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&Movie=25703 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:''Rope'']</ref>\nIt is the second of Hitchcock's \"limited setting\" films, the first being ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/movie/1944/Lifeboat|title=Lifeboat|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\nThe original play was said to be inspired by the real-life murder of 14-year-old [[Leopold and Loeb#Murder of Bobby Franks|Bobby Franks]] in 1924 by [[University of Chicago]] students [[Leopold and Loeb|Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo brilliant young [[Aestheticism|aesthetes]], Brandon Shaw (Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Granger), strangle to death their former classmate from [[Harvard University]], David Kentley ([[Dick Hogan]]), in their [[Manhattan]] penthouse apartment. They commit the crime as an intellectual exercise: they want to prove their superiority by committing the \"[[Perfect crime|perfect murder]]\".\n\nAfter hiding the body in a large antique wooden chest, Brandon and Phillip host a dinner party at the apartment, which has a panoramic view of [[Manhattan]]'s skyline. The guests, who are unaware of what has happened, include the victim's father, Mr. Kentley ([[Cedric Hardwicke]]), and aunt, Mrs. Atwater ([[Constance Collier]]); his mother is unable to attend because of a cold. Also present are his fianc\u00e9e, Janet Walker ([[Joan Chandler]]), and her former lover, Kenneth Lawrence ([[Douglas Dick]]), who was once David's close friend.\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Rope trailer 1.png|left|thumb|[[James Stewart]] in the film's trailer]]\nBrandon uses the chest containing the body as a buffet table for the food, just before their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson ([[Edith Evanson]]), arrives to help with the party.\n\nBrandon and Phillip's idea for the murder was inspired years earlier by conversations with their prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell ([[James Stewart|Stewart]]). While they were at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[\u00dcbermensch]], and [[Thomas De Quincey|De Quincey's]] [[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts|art of murder]], as a means of showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party, since Brandon in particular thinks that he would approve of their \"work of art\".\n\nBrandon's subtle hints about David's absence indirectly lead to a discussion on the \"art of murder\". Brandon appears calm and in control, although when he first speaks to Rupert he is nervously excited and stammering. Phillip, on the other hand, is visibly upset and morose. He does not conceal it well and starts to drink too much. When David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him great fame, she is referring to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think this refers to the notoriety of being a strangler.\n\nMuch of the conversation, however, focuses on David and his strange absence, which worries the guests. A suspicious Rupert quizzes a fidgety Phillip about this and about some of the inconsistencies that have been raised in conversation. For example, Phillip vehemently denies ever strangling a chicken at the Shaws' farm, though Rupert has seen Phillip strangle several. Phillip later complains to Brandon about having had a \"rotten evening\", not because of David's murder, but because of Rupert's questioning.\n\nAs the evening goes on, David's father and fianc\u00e9e begin to worry because he has neither arrived nor phoned. Brandon increases the tension by playing matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth. Mrs. Kentley calls, overwrought because she has not heard from David, and Mr. Kentley decides to leave. He takes with him some books Brandon has given him, tied together with the rope Brandon and Phillip used to strangle his son.\n\nWhen Rupert goes to leave, Mrs. Wilson accidentally hands him David's monogrammed hat, further arousing his suspicion. Rupert returns to the apartment a short while after everyone else has departed, pretending that he has left his cigarette case behind. He asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about David's disappearance. He is encouraged by Brandon, who hopes Rupert will understand and even applaud them. A drunk Phillip, unable to bear it anymore, throws a glass and accuses Rupert of playing cat-and-mouse games with him and Brandon.\n\nRupert seizes Brandon's gun from Phillip and over Brandon's objections insists on examining the chest. He lifts the lid of the chest and finds the body inside. He is horrified and deeply ashamed, realizing that Brandon and Phillip used his own rhetoric to rationalize murder. Rupert disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority, and fires several shots out the window to attract attention. As the police arrive, Rupert sits on a chair next to the chest, Phillip begins to play the piano and Brandon continues to drink.\n\n== Cast ==\n<gallery>\nFile:James_Stewart_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[James Stewart]] as Rupert Cadell\nFile:John_Dall_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[John Dall]] as Brandon Shaw\nFile:Farley_Granger_in Rope_trailer.jpg|[[Farley Granger]] as Phillip Morgan\nFile:Joan_Chandler_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[Joan Chandler]] as Janet Walker\nFile:Cedric_Hardwicke_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Mr. Henry Kentley\n</gallery>\n<gallery>\nFile:Constance Collier in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Constance Collier]] as Mrs. Anita Atwater\nFile:Douglas Dick in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Douglas Dick]] as Kenneth Lawrence\nFile:Edith Evanson in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Edith Evanson]] as Mrs. Wilson\nFile:DickHogan.ShedNoTears.1948.jpg|[[Dick Hogan]] as David Kentley\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is one of Hitchcock's most experimental and \"one of the most interesting experiments ever attempted by a major director working with big box-office names\",<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840615/REVIEWS/811069998/1023|title=Rope|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|accessdate=November 8, 2008 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> abandoning many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes. Each shot ran continuously for up to ten minutes without interruption. It was shot on a single set, aside from the opening [[establishing shot]] street scene under the credits. Camera moves were carefully planned and there was almost no editing.\n\nThe walls of the set were on rollers and could silently be moved out of the way to make way for the camera and then replaced when they were to come back into shot. Prop men constantly had to move the furniture and other props out of the way of the large [[Technicolor]] camera, and then ensure they were replaced in the correct location. A team of soundmen and camera operators kept the camera and microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.<ref name=truffaut>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Fran\u00e7ois |authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |title=Hitchcock/Truffaut |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1967}}</ref>\n\nThis filming technique, which conveys the impression of continuous action, also serves to lengthen the duration of the action in the mind of the viewer. In a 2002 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Antonio Damasio]] argues that the time frame covered by the movie, which lasts 80 minutes and is supposed to be in \"real time\", is actually longer\u2014a little more than 100 minutes. This, he states, is accomplished by speeding up the action: the formal dinner lasts only 20 minutes, the sun sets too quickly, and so on.<ref>Damasio, Antonio.

On these changeovers, Hitchcock cuts to a new camera setup, deliberately not disguising the cut.

Starring [[James Stewart]], [[John Dall]] and [[Farley Granger]], this is the first of Hitchcock's [[Technicolor]] films,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/rope/258105/before-birdman-there-was-alfred-hitchcock-s-rope|title=Before Birdman There Was Alfred Hitchcock's Rope|publisher=}}</ref> and is notable for taking place in [[real time (media)|real time]] and being edited so as to appear as a single shot through the use of [[long take]]s.<ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&Movie=25703 The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:''Rope'']</ref>\nIt is the second of Hitchcock's \"limited setting\" films, the first being ''[[Lifeboat (1944 film)|Lifeboat]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/movie/1944/Lifeboat|title=Lifeboat|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\nThe original play was said to be inspired by the real-life murder of 14-year-old [[Leopold and Loeb#Murder of Bobby Franks|Bobby Franks]] in 1924 by [[University of Chicago]] students [[Leopold and Loeb|Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb]].\n\n== Plot ==\nTwo brilliant young [[Aestheticism|aesthetes]], Brandon Shaw (Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Granger), strangle to death their former classmate from [[Harvard University]], David Kentley ([[Dick Hogan]]), in their [[Manhattan]] penthouse apartment. They commit the crime as an intellectual exercise: they want to prove their superiority by committing the \"[[Perfect crime|perfect murder]]\".\n\nAfter hiding the body in a large antique wooden chest, Brandon and Phillip host a dinner party at the apartment, which has a panoramic view of [[Manhattan]]'s skyline. The guests, who are unaware of what has happened, include the victim's father, Mr. Kentley ([[Cedric Hardwicke]]), and aunt, Mrs. Atwater ([[Constance Collier]]); his mother is unable to attend because of a cold. Also present are his fianc\u00e9e, Janet Walker ([[Joan Chandler]]), and her former lover, Kenneth Lawrence ([[Douglas Dick]]), who was once David's close friend.\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Rope trailer 1.png|left|thumb|[[James Stewart]] in the film's trailer]]\nBrandon uses the chest containing the body as a buffet table for the food, just before their housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson ([[Edith Evanson]]), arrives to help with the party.\n\nBrandon and Phillip's idea for the murder was inspired years earlier by conversations with their prep-school housemaster, publisher Rupert Cadell ([[James Stewart|Stewart]]). While they were at school, Rupert had discussed with them, in an apparently approving way, the intellectual concepts of [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]'s [[\u00dcbermensch]], and [[Thomas De Quincey|De Quincey's]] [[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts|art of murder]], as a means of showing one's superiority over others. He too is among the guests at the party, since Brandon in particular thinks that he would approve of their \"work of art\".\n\nBrandon's subtle hints about David's absence indirectly lead to a discussion on the \"art of murder\". Brandon appears calm and in control, although when he first speaks to Rupert he is nervously excited and stammering. Phillip, on the other hand, is visibly upset and morose. He does not conceal it well and starts to drink too much. When David's aunt, Mrs. Atwater, who fancies herself a fortune-teller, tells him that his hands will bring him great fame, she is referring to his skill at the piano, but he appears to think this refers to the notoriety of being a strangler.\n\nMuch of the conversation, however, focuses on David and his strange absence, which worries the guests. A suspicious Rupert quizzes a fidgety Phillip about this and about some of the inconsistencies that have been raised in conversation. For example, Phillip vehemently denies ever strangling a chicken at the Shaws' farm, though Rupert has seen Phillip strangle several. Phillip later complains to Brandon about having had a \"rotten evening\", not because of David's murder, but because of Rupert's questioning.\n\nAs the evening goes on, David's father and fianc\u00e9e begin to worry because he has neither arrived nor phoned. Brandon increases the tension by playing matchmaker between Janet and Kenneth. Mrs. Kentley calls, overwrought because she has not heard from David, and Mr. Kentley decides to leave. He takes with him some books Brandon has given him, tied together with the rope Brandon and Phillip used to strangle his son.\n\nWhen Rupert goes to leave, Mrs. Wilson accidentally hands him David's monogrammed hat, further arousing his suspicion. Rupert returns to the apartment a short while after everyone else has departed, pretending that he has left his cigarette case behind. He asks for a drink and then stays to theorize about David's disappearance. He is encouraged by Brandon, who hopes Rupert will understand and even applaud them. A drunk Phillip, unable to bear it anymore, throws a glass and accuses Rupert of playing cat-and-mouse games with him and Brandon.\n\nRupert seizes Brandon's gun from Phillip and over Brandon's objections insists on examining the chest. He lifts the lid of the chest and finds the body inside. He is horrified and deeply ashamed, realizing that Brandon and Phillip used his own rhetoric to rationalize murder. Rupert disavows all his previous talk of superiority and inferiority, and fires several shots out the window to attract attention. As the police arrive, Rupert sits on a chair next to the chest, Phillip begins to play the piano and Brandon continues to drink.\n\n== Cast ==\n<gallery>\nFile:James_Stewart_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[James Stewart]] as Rupert Cadell\nFile:John_Dall_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[John Dall]] as Brandon Shaw\nFile:Farley_Granger_in Rope_trailer.jpg|[[Farley Granger]] as Phillip Morgan\nFile:Joan_Chandler_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|[[Joan Chandler]] as Janet Walker\nFile:Cedric_Hardwicke_in_Rope_trailer.jpg|Sir [[Cedric Hardwicke]] as Mr. Henry Kentley\n</gallery>\n<gallery>\nFile:Constance Collier in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Constance Collier]] as Mrs. Anita Atwater\nFile:Douglas Dick in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Douglas Dick]] as Kenneth Lawrence\nFile:Edith Evanson in Rope trailer.jpg|[[Edith Evanson]] as Mrs. Wilson\nFile:DickHogan.ShedNoTears.1948.jpg|[[Dick Hogan]] as David Kentley\n</gallery>\n\n== Production ==\nThe film is one of Hitchcock's most experimental and \"one of the most interesting experiments ever attempted by a major director working with big box-office names\",<ref name=\"ebert\">{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19840615/REVIEWS/811069998/1023|title=Rope|first=Roger|last=Ebert|authorlink=Roger Ebert|accessdate=November 8, 2008 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> abandoning many standard film techniques to allow for the long unbroken scenes. Each shot ran continuously for up to ten minutes without interruption. It was shot on a single set, aside from the opening [[establishing shot]] street scene under the credits. Camera moves were carefully planned and there was almost no editing.\n\nThe walls of the set were on rollers and could silently be moved out of the way to make way for the camera and then replaced when they were to come back into shot. Prop men constantly had to move the furniture and other props out of the way of the large [[Technicolor]] camera, and then ensure they were replaced in the correct location. A team of soundmen and camera operators kept the camera and microphones in constant motion, as the actors kept to a carefully choreographed set of cues.<ref name=truffaut>{{cite book |last=Truffaut |first=Fran\u00e7ois |authorlink=Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut |title=Hitchcock/Truffaut |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1967}}</ref>\n\nThis filming technique, which conveys the impression of continuous action, also serves to lengthen the duration of the action in the mind of the viewer. In a 2002 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Antonio Damasio]] argues that the time frame covered by the movie, which lasts 80 minutes and is supposed to be in \"real time\", is actually longer\u2014a little more than 100 minutes. This, he states, is accomplished by speeding up the action: the formal dinner lasts only 20 minutes, the sun sets too quickly, and so on.<ref>Damasio, Antonio.

Starring [[Country music|country]] singer [[Julianne Hough]] and [[Diego Boneta]] leading an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Russell Brand]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Tom Cruise]], the film features the music of many 1980s Rock and Glam Rock artists including [[Def Leppard]], [[Journey (band)|Journey]], [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Pat Benatar]], [[Joan Jett]], [[Bon Jovi]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Whitesnake]], [[REO Speedwagon]], and others. The film's score was composed and conducted by [[Cliff Eidelman]].\n\nOriginally scheduled to enter production in summer 2009 for a 2011 release, it eventually commenced production in May 2011 and was released on June 15, 2012. The film received mixed critical reviews and grossed only $59 million worldwide. However, Cruise was particularly lauded for his performance of \"[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]\" and \"[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]\". The [[#Soundtrack|related film soundtrack]] also did critically well, certified Gold in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987 [[Los Angeles]], Sherrie Christian ([[Julianne Hough]]) arrives from [[Oklahoma]] with dreams of becoming a singer. [[Barback]] Drew Boley ([[Diego Boneta]]) prepares for another night at The Bourbon Room (\"Sister Christian/Just Like Paradise/Nothin' But a Good Time\"). Sherrie's suitcase is stolen, and Drew gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Room.\n\nThe club's owner, Dennis Dupree ([[Alec Baldwin]]), and his right-hand man, Lonny Barnett ([[Russell Brand]]), are desperate to save the club from a tax debt. They book Stacee Jaxx ([[Tom Cruise]]), a detached and self-indulgent rock star preparing for his final gig with his band, Arsenal. Drew tells Sherrie his own dreams of becoming a rock star, but that he has stagefright (\"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock 'n' Roll\"). Learning of Stacee's upcoming concert, Patricia Whitmore ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), [[Conservatism|conservative]] wife of the mayor ([[Bryan Cranston]]), organizes a protest in front of the club (\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\")\n\nDrew and Sherrie have their first date at the Hollywood Sign, where Drew reveals he is writing a song for Sherrie (\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\"). On the night of Arsenal's final show, Dennis learns the opening act has cancelled; Sherrie convinces him to use Drew's band, Wolfgang Von Colt (\"More Than Words/Heaven\"). Stacee's manager, Paul Gill ([[Paul Giamatti]]), schedules an interview with Constance Sack ([[Malin \u00c5kerman]]), a reporter for ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.\n\nConstance mentions rumors of Stacee's difficult behavior and implies he was kicked out of Arsenal, which Stacee denies (\"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). Stacee sends Sherrie for a bottle of scotch from his limo. Constance lashes out at the once-great Stacee; they recognize their mutual attraction and are about to have sex when Stacee sings (\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"). Ashamed, Constance leaves as Sherrie enters and collides with Stacee. Drew mistakenly believes that Sherrie and Stacee had sex, and is angrily inspired to sing (\"[[I Wanna Rock]]\") for the opening act. Drew and Sherrie break up and she quits the Bourbon Room. Drew tries to run after her but Paul, impressed with his performance, offers him a record deal as Arsenal sings their last song of the night (\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\").\n\nSherrie takes refuge at strip club the Venus Club (\"Harden My Heart\"), where owner Justice Charlier ([[Mary J. Blige]]) offers her a job as a dancer (\"Shadows of the Night/Harden My Heart\"), but Sherrie chooses to wait tables. She realizes she needs more money, as Drew signs to Gill's record label (\"Here I Go Again\"). Dennis worries the Bourbon Room will close and that he has \"let everyone down.\" Lonny confesses his love for him, and Dennis reciprocates (\"Can't Fight This Feeling\"). Drew realizes his record deal makes him part of hip-hop boy band \"The Zee Guys\" as Joshua Zee, while Sherrie decides to becomes a dancer at the Venus Club (\"Any Way You Want It\").\n\nSherrie visits the Hollywood sign, where she finds Drew, whose life has also not gone as planned. She tells him she did not have sex with Stacee and will be returning to Oklahoma. They part ways, lamenting their situation (\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\").\n\nStacee realizes his feelings for Constance and calls Rolling Stone to learn \u201cshe is covering Stacee Jaxx's show at The Bourbon Room\". Stacee rushes to the venue, where Lonny leads the patrons against Patricia's protest group (\"We're Not Gonna Take It/We Built This City\"). Stacee recognizes Patricia, whom Lonny exposes as a former Arsenal groupie. Drew buys back Sherrie's stolen records and drops them off at the strip club.\n\nThe Zee Guys are rejected by the rocker crowd; Drew spots Sherrie in the audience and leaves the stage. They reconcile and Drew dismisses Paul, telling him rock 'n' roll will never die. Sherrie reunites Wolfgang Von Colt onstage, where she and Drew perform the song he wrote for her (\"Don't Stop Believin'\"). Stacee, having sex with Constance in the bathroom, is moved by the song.\n\nEight months later, Stacee has rejoined Arsenal and performs the song with Drew and Sherrie, now part of Wolfgang Von Colt, at [[Dodger Stadium]] in front of a crowd including Dennis, Lonny, Justice, a pregnant Constance, and Patricia, returned to her rock 'n' roll persona.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Sherrie Christian\n* [[Diego Boneta]] as Drew Boley\n* [[Russell Brand]] as Lonny Barnett\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Paul Gill\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Patricia Whitmore\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Constance Sack\n* [[Mary J.

The \"I Wanna Rock (Reprise)\" section originally mashed-up with \"Any Way You Want It\" was removed, with \"Any Way You Want It\" instead being the original full-length song.\n\nAlso, many songs from the musical were reordered in the film, mostly to accommodate character and storyline changes. \"We Built This City\", in its original mash-up form, and \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" were originally much earlier in the musical, giving depth to Regina. They were replaced with \"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\", another song sung by Regina in the musical, which now served to give more background to new character Patricia (as Regina was cut from the film), with both songs (in an abridged form) instead added to the climax of the film, as part of an anthem between Lonny and the rockers and Patricia and her conservative church group. \"I Wanna Rock\", originally the fourth song of the musical, was moved to after \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" (which in itself was changed from a duet between Sherrie and Jaxx to Jaxx and new character Constance), with the song now representing Drew's anger toward what he wrongly perceives to be Sherrie's infidelity. \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" and \"More Than Words/Heaven\" switched order in the film version, in order to accommodate the changes in the relationship storyline between Drew and Sherrie. \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" was also placed before \"Any Way You Want It\" due to the restructure of storylines.\n\nNew songs added to the film include a mash-up of \"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", which replaced the original purpose of \"I Wanna Rock\" in the musical, \"Undercover Love\", which was used for Drew's short-lived boy band, and \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Paradise City\", and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" replacing \"I Hate Myself for Loving You/Heat of the Moment\" and serving as Arsenal's discography.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Early development===\nAfter the success of the original [[Off-Broadway]] production, the film rights were sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and [[New Line Cinema]].<ref>McBride, Walter.

Starring [[Country music|country]] singer [[Julianne Hough]] and [[Diego Boneta]] leading an [[ensemble cast]] that includes [[Russell Brand]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], [[Malin \u00c5kerman]], [[Mary J.

The film's score was composed and conducted by [[Cliff Eidelman]].\n\nOriginally scheduled to enter production in summer 2009 for a 2011 release, it eventually commenced production in May 2011 and was released on June 15, 2012. The film received mixed critical reviews and grossed only $59 million worldwide. However, Cruise was particularly lauded for his performance of \"[[Pour Some Sugar on Me]]\" and \"[[Wanted Dead or Alive (Bon Jovi song)|Wanted Dead or Alive]]\". The [[#Soundtrack|related film soundtrack]] also did critically well, certified Gold in Canada.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1987 [[Los Angeles]], Sherrie Christian ([[Julianne Hough]]) arrives from [[Oklahoma]] with dreams of becoming a singer. [[Barback]] Drew Boley ([[Diego Boneta]]) prepares for another night at The Bourbon Room (\"Sister Christian/Just Like Paradise/Nothin' But a Good Time\"). Sherrie\u2019s suitcase is stolen, and Drew gets her a job as a waitress at the Bourbon Room.\n\nThe club's owner, Dennis Dupree ([[Alec Baldwin]]), and his right-hand man, Lonny Barnett ([[Russell Brand]]), are desperate to save the club from a tax debt. They book Stacee Jaxx ([[Tom Cruise]]), a detached and self-indulgent rock star preparing for his final gig with his band, Arsenal. Drew tells Sherrie his own dreams of becoming a rock star, but that he has stagefright (\"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock 'n' Roll\"). Learning of Stacee's upcoming concert, Patricia Whitmore ([[Catherine Zeta-Jones]]), [[Conservatism|conservative]] wife of the mayor ([[Bryan Cranston]]), organizes a protest in front of the club (\"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\")\n\nDrew and Sherrie have their first date at the Hollywood Sign, where Drew reveals he is writing a song for Sherrie (\"Waiting for a Girl Like You\"). On the night of Arsenal's final show, Dennis learns the opening act has cancelled; Sherrie convinces him to use Drew\u2019s band, Wolfgang Von Colt (\"More Than Words/Heaven\"). Stacee's manager, Paul Gill ([[Paul Giamatti]]), schedules an interview with Constance Sack ([[Malin \u00c5kerman]]), a reporter for ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.\n\nConstance mentions rumors of Stacee\u2019s difficult behavior and implies he was kicked out of Arsenal, which Stacee denies (\"Wanted Dead or Alive\"). Stacee sends Sherrie for a bottle of scotch from his limo. Constance lashes out at the once-great Stacee; they recognize their mutual attraction and are about to have sex when Stacee sings (\"I Want to Know What Love Is\"). Ashamed, Constance leaves as Sherrie enters and collides with Stacee. Drew mistakenly believes that Sherrie and Stacee had sex, and is angrily inspired to sing (\"[[I Wanna Rock]]\") for the opening act. Drew and Sherrie break up and she quits the Bourbon Room. Drew tries to run after her but Paul, impressed with his performance, offers him a record deal as Arsenal sings their last song of the night (\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\").\n\nSherrie takes refuge at strip club the Venus Club (\"Harden My Heart\"), where owner Justice Charlier ([[Mary J. Blige]]) offers her a job as a dancer (\"Shadows of the Night/Harden My Heart\"), but Sherrie chooses to wait tables. She realizes she needs more money, as Drew signs to Gill's record label (\"Here I Go Again\"). Dennis worries the Bourbon Room will close and that he has \"let everyone down.\" Lonny confesses his love for him, and Dennis reciprocates (\"Can't Fight This Feeling\"). Drew realizes his record deal makes him part of hip-hop boy band \"The Zee Guys\" as Joshua Zee, while Sherrie decides to becomes a dancer at the Venus Club (\"Any Way You Want It\").\n\nSherrie visits the Hollywood sign, where she finds Drew, whose life has also not gone as planned. She tells him she did not have sex with Stacee and will be returning to Oklahoma. They part ways, lamenting their situation (\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\").\n\nStacee realizes his feelings for Constance and calls Rolling Stone to learn \u201cshe is covering Stacee Jaxx's show at The Bourbon Room\". Stacee rushes to the venue, where Lonny leads the patrons against Patricia\u2019s protest group (\"We're Not Gonna Take It/We Built This City\"). Stacee recognizes Patricia, whom Lonny exposes as a former Arsenal groupie. Drew buys back Sherrie\u2019s stolen records and drops them off at the strip club.\n\nThe Zee Guys are rejected by the rocker crowd; Drew spots Sherrie in the audience and leaves the stage. They reconcile and Drew dismisses Paul, telling him rock 'n' roll will never die. Sherrie reunites Wolfgang Von Colt onstage, where she and Drew perform the song he wrote for her (\"Don't Stop Believin'\"). Stacee, having sex with Constance in the bathroom, is moved by the song.\n\nEight months later, Stacee has rejoined Arsenal and performs the song with Drew and Sherrie, now part of Wolfgang Von Colt, at [[Dodger Stadium]] in front of a crowd including Dennis, Lonny, Justice, a pregnant Constance, and Patricia, returned to her rock 'n' roll persona.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julianne Hough]] as Sherrie Christian\n* [[Diego Boneta]] as Drew Boley\n* [[Russell Brand]] as Lonny Barnett\n* [[Paul Giamatti]] as Paul Gill\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Patricia Whitmore\n* [[Malin \u00c5kerman]] as Constance Sack\n* [[Mary J.

The \"I Wanna Rock (Reprise)\" section originally mashed-up with \"Any Way You Want It\" was removed, with \"Any Way You Want It\" instead being the original full-length song.\n\nAlso, many songs from the musical were reordered in the film, mostly to accommodate character and storyline changes. \"We Built This City\", in its original mash-up form, and \"We're Not Gonna Take It\" were originally much earlier in the musical, giving depth to Regina. They were replaced with \"Hit Me with Your Best Shot\", another song sung by Regina in the musical, which now served to give more background to new character Patricia (as Regina was cut from the film), with both songs (in an abridged form) instead added to the climax of the film, as part of an anthem between Lonny and the rockers and Patricia and her conservative church group. \"I Wanna Rock\", originally the fourth song of the musical, was moved to after \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" (which in itself was changed from a duet between Sherrie and Jaxx to Jaxx and new character Constance), with the song now representing Drew's anger toward what he wrongly perceives to be Sherrie's infidelity. \"Waiting for a Girl Like You\" and \"More Than Words/Heaven\" switched order in the film version, in order to accommodate the changes in the relationship storyline between Drew and Sherrie. \"Can't Fight This Feeling\" was also placed before \"Any Way You Want It\" due to the restructure of storylines.\n\nNew songs added to the film include a mash-up of \"Juke Box Hero/I Love Rock 'n' Roll\", which replaced the original purpose of \"I Wanna Rock\" in the musical, \"Undercover Love\", which was used for Drew's short-lived boy band, and \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\", \"Paradise City\", and \"Rock You Like a Hurricane\" replacing \"I Hate Myself for Loving You/Heat of the Moment\" and serving as Arsenal's discography.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Early development===\nAfter the success of the original [[Off-Broadway]] production, the film rights were sold to [[Warner Bros.]] and [[New Line Cinema]].<ref>McBride, Walter.

Frank, the elder of the pair, shoots and kills the campers.\n\nD.J. Farraday ([[Robert Glen Keith]]) discovers that his father, Del (Stockwell), has been having an affair. D.J. asks Del to meet him at the family's cabin by the lake, where D.J. intends to confront him about his adultery. When the two arrive at the summer house, they find Del's younger son, Campbell \"Cam\" Farraday (Behr), already there. Eventually it is revealed that Del had found Cam and his boyfriend, Billy, embracing there at the cabin. Del brutally beat Billy, and father and son have not spoken since. While D.J. is trying to convince Cam to stay and attempt a reconciliation, Cam reveals to him that Billy is dead, and the clear implication is that Cam blames his father for the loss.\n\nA short while later, the two escaped convicts show up at the cabin and ask to use the phone, claiming that their car has broken down. Red, who is introduced as Frank's adult son, makes a point of taking up the hospitality offered, using that excuse to remain in the house (over Frank's objection).  As the evening progresses Frank seems to be forcing Del into a challenge. Tensions are high, as Frank makes his play for [[alpha male|Alpha]] of the house. At one point, D.J. goes so far as to suggest that \"we all just whip 'em out and get this over with.\"\n\nThe police show up looking for the two escaped convicts, and things get tense very quickly. It soon becomes clear that Cam knew the convicts and has had some sort of entanglement with them. The family must reconcile and put aside their issues with each other to deal with the menacing force of Frank. Tragedy ensues in the film's final few moments, good vanquishes evil, and father and sons are reconciled.\n\n==Production and releases==\n''Rites of Passage'' was the first film from Salva since the controversy surrounding his film, ''[[Powder (film)|Powder]]'' (1995), which was the target of boycotts due to [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney's]] hiring of Salva to direct the film after his conviction for [[child molestation|molesting]] a 12-year-old [[child actor]] during the production of his previous film, ''[[Clownhouse]]'', in 1988.\n\nSalva based much of the dialogue between Del, D.J. and Cam on tense conversations he and his own father had while Salva was growing up.\n\nTwo versions of the film have been released. A [[director's cut]] of the film with commentary by Salva and Behr was released by Bell Canyon Entertainment on May 2, 2000. This version of the film features several deleted scenes which further explain the relationships between the major characters. A theatrical release version was released by Wolfe Video on August 30, 2000. This edition contains no commentaries.\n\n==References==\n*Harvey, Dennis. \"'Rites of Passage' (review).\" ''Variety.''

The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army.

Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops.

The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}.

Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{efn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld.

There is Gresford (or West Gresford) on the Singleton side and East Gresford on the [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] side. It appears that Gresford is the original township, as it is older and the location of the school and local Anglican church. But East Gresford is much larger and has the main shopping area. It is also home to the Gresford Scorpions Soccer Club.  \n\nThe Gresford & District Community Group produces the Gresford News, a monthly four colour production which reports on activities in the district.  It has a circulation of 800.  The Community Group is also responsible for the creation of an arboretum featuring endangered and local native trees.  Now in its third year of development there is increasing interest by groups to visit and learn about these important shrubs and trees.  \n\nEast Gresford is close to the [[Barrington Tops National Park]], which includes the highest peak in the Hunter Valley and is a [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia|World Heritage site]].

There is Gresford (or West Gresford) on the Singleton side and East Gresford on the [[Maitland, New South Wales|Maitland]] side. It appears that Gresford is the original township, as it is older and the location of the school and local Anglican church. But East Gresford is much larger and has the main shopping area. It is also home to the Gresford Scorpions Soccer Club.  \n\nThe Gresford & District Community Group produces the Gresford News, a monthly four colour production which reports on activities in the district.  It has a circulation of 800.  The Community Group is also responsible for the creation of an arboretum featuring endangered and local native trees.  Now in its third year of development there is increasing interest by groups to visit and learn about these important shrubs and trees.  \n\nEast Gresford is close to the [[Barrington Tops National Park]], which includes the highest peak in the Hunter Valley and is a [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia|World Heritage site]]. It also snows in the area each winter. {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 2020 the annual Gresford Show was held in March.
