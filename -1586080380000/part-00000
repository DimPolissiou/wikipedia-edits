In general, the conflict was focused on air-to-ground attacks and ground-based [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]]; only one [[dogfight]] is known to have occurred.\n\nThe [[Ugandan Air Force|Uganda Army Air Force]] dominated the air space during the initial Ugandan invasion of northwestern Tanzania, but achieved little due to bad co-ordination with ground forces and a general lack of planning. At the same time, it suffered increasingly heavy losses as pilots deserted, and the Tanzanian anti-aircraft defenses became more effective. The initiative thus switched to the [[Tanzania Air Force Command|Tanzania Air Defence Command]] which supported the country's counter-offensive into Uganda. In the conflict's later stages, the [[Libyan Air Force|Libyan Arab Republic Air Force]] intervened on the side of Uganda, but failed to make a tangible impact. The Uganda Army Air Force was eventually destroyed on 7 April 1979 when Tanzanian ground forces overran its main air base at [[Entebbe]]. The remaining Ugandan loyalist air pilots subsequently joined the [[Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan military]].\n\n== Background to the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War ==\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the President of Uganda, [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. With the approval of Nyerere, these Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972. Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Subsequent mediation resulted in the signing of the Mogadishu Agreement, which established a demilitarised zone at the border and required that both countries refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each others' governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|720|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 18 miles to the south, should be placed under its jurisdiction, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border.<ref name= darnton1>{{cite news| last = Darnton| first = John| title = Mediation is Begun in Tanzanian War| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 5| date = 7 November 1978| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/07/archives/mediation-is-begun-in-tanzanian-war-african-nations-trying-to.html| access-date = 12 February 2019}}</ref> The circumstances immediately surrounding the outbreak of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War in 1978 remain unclear.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}}\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n=== Uganda ===\n[[File:7006 over Sajek Bangladesh Air Force Mig-21 MF Fishbed.

Its first aircraft was consequently of Israeli origin, and its initial pilots trained in Israel. As Uganda's government forged closer links with the [[Eastern Bloc]], the UAAF began to acquire more aircraft as well as support in training from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]. Israeli aid initially continued as well. The UAAF was gradually expanded, and several air bases were built.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=8\u201310}} Following Amin's coup in 1971, the Ugandan military began to deteriorate. International support for Amin's regime eroded over the next years. Israel turned from an ally into an enemy, and the relations with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia worsened as well though they were not completely severed. The foreign supply of aircraft and spare parts for the UAAF was gradually cut off. As result, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the UAAF's fighters.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=10\u201318}}{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}} At the same time, [[tribalism]], corruption, and repeated purges negatively affected the military's combat capabilities.{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}}{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=10\u201312}} Furthermore, the Israeli-initiated [[Operation Entebbe]] resulted in the destruction of a quarter of the UAAF in 1976;<ref>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm| title = 1976: Israelis rescue Entebbe hostages| website = BBC News| publisher = British Broadcasting Company| access-date = 12 August 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Amin's regime subsequently received a substantial number of replacement MiG-21s from the Soviet Union and Libya.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}}{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}}\n\nBy late 1978, the UAAF was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Christopher Israel Umba Gore|Christopher Gore]]{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=50}} and consisted of several dozen [[List of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 variants#Modernisation \u2013 generation three (1968\u20131972)|MiG-21MFs]], [[List of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 variants#Trainer variants (1960\u20131968+)|MiG-21UMs]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17s]],{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=18}} [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15UTIs]],{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=19}} and [[Aero L-29 Delf\u00edn|L-29s]].

The fighter aircraft unit of 601 KJ, known as \"Squadron 601\", was based at [[Mwanza Airport|Mwanza Air Base]] (MiG-21s) and [[Ngerengere Air Force Base]] (F-5s, F-6s).{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=20}} In 1978 the Air Defence Command employed approximately 1,000 personnel.{{sfn|Paxton|2016b|p=1169}}{{sfn|Lagarde|1979|p=8}}\n\n=== Libya ===\nThe [[Libyan Air Force|Libyan Arab Republic Air Force]] (LARAF) intervened in the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War's later stages.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=32}} The LARAF was a large and well-equipped force, though it suffered from limitations in regard to its personnel. Its squadrons were often understrength, and many pilots lacked proper training.{{sfn|Cooper|Grandolini|2015|pp=24\u201325}} Though it is disputed how many and which types of Libyan aircraft were sent to Uganda, the presence of at least two [[Tupolev Tu-22]] bombers was confirmed.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=32}} LARAF's Tu-22s were operated by the No. 1022 Squadron (also known as \"Second Bomber Squadron\").{{efn|Some reports indicate the existence of two other LARAF units which were supposed to be equipped with Tu-22s, namely the No. 1110 and No. 1120 Squadrons. According to Tom Cooper and Albert Grandolini, however, these two squadrons were probably never operational.{{sfn|Cooper|Grandolini|2015|p=26}}}} The Libyan Tu-22s were second-hand aircraft imported from the Soviet Union, and suffered from serviceability issues; the bombers were both difficult to maintain and to fly. In addition, Libyan Tu-22 crews were regarded by their Soviet instructors as being subpar, incapable of flying sophisticated bombing missions and more interested in their own safety than carrying out their tasks.{{sfn|Cooper|Grandolini|2015|pp=25\u201326}}\n\n== Air campaign ==\n=== Invasion of Kagera ===\n{{further information|Invasion of Kagera}}\nIn early September 1978 the Tanzanians noticed a high volume of Ugandan air reconnaissance flights. By the middle of the month the Ugandan aircraft began crossing into Tanzanian airspace.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=53}} Ugandan troops made their first incursion into Tanzania on 9 October 1978 when a motorised detachment entered a Tanzanian village only to be repulsed by artillery. The next day UAAF [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiG]] fighters bombed forests in the Kagera Salient without effect.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}}{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=23}} On 18 October, Ugandan MiGs bombed [[Bukoba]], the capital of the [[Kagera Region|West Lake Region]].

However, the explosions' reverberations shattered windows and incited the population to panic.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=54}} On 25 October the [[Uganda Army (1971\u20131980)|Uganda Army]] attempted to invade northern Tanzania. The ground attack was repulsed by artillery, but UAAF MiGs continued to cross into Tanzanian airspace, where they were again harassed by ineffectual anti-aircraft fire.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=58\u201359}} Ugandan MiGs bombed Bukoba and the [[Kyaka Bridge]]\u2014a key crossing over the [[Kagera River]]\u2014on 21 and 27 October; most of their bombs hit forests, but one barely missed Bukoba's hospital.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}} The second attack prompted Bukoba's residents to flee the town.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|pp=59\u201360}}\n\n[[File:SA-7.jpg|thumb|left|Tanzanian [[9K32 Strela-2|SA-7]] [[Man-portable air-defense system|MANPAD]] (example pictured) teams shot down several Ugandan [[List of Mikoyan and MiG aircraft|MiGs]] during the war]]\n\nOn 27 October, the first Tanzanian reinforcements arrived in the war zone.

Tanzanian forces were overwhelmed and quickly withdrew south of the Kagera River.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=61}} Fearing that the TPDF could stage a counter-attack across the Kyaka Bridge, Ugandan commanders ordered it to be destroyed.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=65}} The UAAF attacked the crossing from 1 to 3 November; these air strikes either missed or proved ineffective. In contrast, the Tanzanian SA-7 team advanced up to the bridge and reportedly shot down several Ugandan MiGs during these days.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=25}} After the repeated failures by their air force, the Ugandans finally employed a mining specialist who successfully destroyed the Kyaka Bridge.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=23}}\n\n{{\nLocation map+|Tanzania|float=right|caption=Map of [[Tanzania]] showing locations repeatedly attacked by the Uganda Army Air Force\n|places=\n{{Location map~|Tanzania|lat=-1.25|long=31.416667|position=left |label_size=100 |label=[[Kyaka]]}}\n{{Location map~|Tanzania|lat=-1.333333|long=31.816667|position=right |label_size=100 |label=[[Bukoba]]}}\n{{Location map~|Tanzania|lat=-2.444444|long=32.933333|position=bottom |label_size=100 |label=[[Mwanza]]}}\n}}\n\nMeanwhile, the TPDF's high command decided to redeploy a squadron of F-6s to Mwanza. As the fighters approached the air base on 3 November, however, they entered the air space protected by a Tanzanian SA-3 team as well as anti-aircraft artillery. The latter had not been informed about the redeployment, and mistook the F-6s for enemy fighters, opening fire. One aircraft was hit, and its pilot Ayekuwa Akiirusha was killed. Another fighter diverted from its course and crashed after running out of fuel, though its pilot safely ejected. The other F-6s braved the anti-aircraft fire and successfully landed at Mwanza.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=26}} A monument was later built in honour of Akiirusha.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=29}} Several other Tanzanian aircraft, mostly MiGs, were lost due to other accidents during the war.{{sfn|Cooper|2004|p=137}}\n\nOn 2 November Nyerere [[declared war]] on Uganda.{{sfn|Kamazima|2004|p=167}} After some probes, the TPDF launched a counter-offensive to retake the Kagera Salient on 23 November, encountering little resistance.

The UAAF had lost several fighters up to this point, and opted to fly no more attacks into Tanzania. As result, it missed the opportunity to disrupt the assembly of Tanzanian troops as they amassed along the border. A large-scale Tanzanian artillery bombardment began on 25 December. The UAAF was ordered to respond, but its attacks failed to destroy the Tanzanian artillery. Instead, another Ugandan MiG was shot down by SA-7s in January 1979. The TPDF began its advance into Uganda on 21 January, [[Battle of Mutukula|capturing and destroying]] the border town of Mutukula.

The most fierce air combat of the war occurred during the [[Battle of Simba Hills]] from 11 February 1979. The UAAF repeatedly attacked the TPDF troops at Simba Hills, encountering heavy resistance from SA-7 teams; the TPDF later claimed to have shot down 19 Ugandan aircraft. The Tanzanian Air Wing also bombed Ugandan positions during the battle. After two days of fighting, the Simba Hills fell to the Tanzanian-led forces. The TPDF also captured the Lukoma air strip,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=30}} which had been used by the UAAF MiGs to stage raids in Tanzanian territory.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=79}}{{efn|According to the ''New Vision'', following the capture of Simba Hills, the Ugandans attempted to halt the Tanzanian advance at Kabuwooko with paratroopers, but this failed when the Tanzanians shot their planes down.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1508815/amin-annexed-kagera-salient-uganda| title = When Amin annexed Kagera Salient onto Uganda| date = 17 October 2019| website = New Vision| access-date =16 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nTwo Ugandan MiG-21s attacked the Lukoma air strip on 14 February in an attempt to destroy Tanzanian transport aircraft.

In general, the conflict was focused on air-to-ground attacks and ground-based [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft fire]]; only one [[dogfight]] is known to have occurred.\n\nThe [[Ugandan Air Force|Uganda Army Air Force]] dominated the air space during the initial Ugandan invasion of northwestern Tanzania, but achieved little due to bad co-ordination with ground forces and a general lack of planning. At the same time, it suffered increasingly heavy losses as pilots deserted, and the Tanzanian anti-aircraft defenses became more effective. The initiative thus switched to the [[Tanzania Air Force Command|Tanzania Air Defence Command]] which supported the country's counter-offensive into Uganda. In the conflict's later stages, the [[Libyan Air Force|Libyan Arab Republic Air Force]] intervened on the side of Uganda, but failed to make a tangible impact. The Uganda Army Air Force was eventually destroyed on 7 April 1979 when Tanzanian ground forces overran its main air base at [[Entebbe]]. The remaining Ugandan loyalist air pilots subsequently joined the [[Armed Forces of the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libyan military]].\n\n== Background to the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War ==\nIn 1971 Colonel [[Idi Amin]] launched [[1971 Ugandan coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup]] that overthrew the President of Uganda, [[Milton Obote]], precipitating a deterioration of relations with neighbouring Tanzania.<ref name= honey2/> Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] had close ties with Obote and had supported his socialist orientation.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Amin installed himself as President of Uganda and ruled the country under a repressive dictatorship.<ref name= honey2>{{cite news| last = Honey| first = Martha| title = Ugandan Capital Captured| newspaper = The Washington Post| date = 12 April 1979| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1979/04/12/ugandan-capital-captured/1eb604a7-5ff0-4c51-9fa0-527169e5bffa/?noredirect=on|access-date=7 November 2018}}</ref> Nyerere withheld diplomatic recognition of the new government and offered asylum to Obote and his supporters. With the approval of Nyerere, these Ugandan exiles organised a small army of [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]], and attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade Uganda and remove Amin in 1972. Amin blamed Nyerere for backing and arming his enemies,{{sfnp|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=6\u20137}} and retaliated by bombing Tanzanian border towns. Subsequent mediation resulted in the signing of the Mogadishu Agreement, which established a demilitarised zone at the border and required that both countries refrain from supporting opposition forces that targeted each others' governments. Nevertheless, relations between the two presidents remained tense; Nyerere frequently denounced Amin's regime, and Amin made repeated threats to invade Tanzania.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=155}} Uganda also disputed its border with Tanzania, claiming that the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] Salient\u2014a {{convert|720|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} stretch of land between the official border and the [[Kagera River]] 18 miles to the south, should be placed under its jurisdiction, maintaining that the river made for a more logical border.<ref name= darnton1>{{cite news| last = Darnton| first = John| title = Mediation is Begun in Tanzanian War| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 5| date = 7 November 1978| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1978/11/07/archives/mediation-is-begun-in-tanzanian-war-african-nations-trying-to.html| access-date = 12 February 2019}}</ref> The circumstances immediately surrounding the outbreak of the Uganda\u2013Tanzania War in 1978 remain unclear.{{sfn|Roberts|2017|p=156}}\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n=== Uganda ===\n[[File:7006 over Sajek Bangladesh Air Force Mig-21 MF Fishbed.

Its first aircraft was consequently of Israeli origin, and its initial pilots trained in Israel. As Uganda's government forged closer links with the [[Eastern Bloc]], the UAAF began to acquire more aircraft as well as support in training from the [[Soviet Union]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]]. Israeli aid initially continued as well. The UAAF was gradually expanded, and several air bases were built.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=8\u201310}} Following Amin's coup in 1971, the Ugandan military began to deteriorate. International support for Amin's regime eroded over the next years. Israel turned from an ally into an enemy, and the relations with the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia worsened as well though they were not completely severed. The foreign supply of aircraft and spare parts for the UAAF was gradually cut off. As result, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the UAAF's fighters.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=10\u201318}}{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}} At the same time, [[tribalism]], corruption, and repeated purges negatively affected the military's combat capabilities.{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}}{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|pp=10\u201312}} Furthermore, the Israeli-initiated [[Operation Entebbe]] resulted in the destruction of a quarter of the UAAF in 1976;<ref>{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/4/newsid_2786000/2786967.stm| title = 1976: Israelis rescue Entebbe hostages| website = BBC News| publisher = British Broadcasting Company| access-date = 12 August 2019}}</ref>{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}} Amin's regime subsequently received a substantial number of replacement MiG-21s from the Soviet Union and Libya.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=22}}{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=203}}\n\nBy late 1978, the UAAF was commanded by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Christopher Israel Umba Gore|Christopher Gore]]{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=50}} and consisted of several dozen [[List of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 variants#Modernisation \u2013 generation three (1968\u20131972)|MiG-21MFs]], [[List of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 variants#Trainer variants (1960\u20131968+)|MiG-21UMs]], [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17|MiG-17s]],{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=18}} [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15UTIs]],{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=19}} and [[Aero L-29 Delf\u00edn|L-29s]].

The UAAF had lost several fighters up to this point, and opted to fly no more attacks into Tanzania. As result, it missed the opportunity to disrupt the assembly of Tanzanian troops as they amassed along the border. A large-scale Tanzanian artillery bombardment began on 25 December. The UAAF was ordered to respond, but its attacks failed to destroy the Tanzanian artillery. Instead, another Ugandan MiG was shot down by SA-7s in January 1979. The TPDF began its advance into Uganda on 21 January, [[Battle of Mutukula|capturing and destroying]] the border town of Mutukula. The Tanzanians then constructed an air strip in the locale so transport aircraft could resupply the troops at the front lines.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=29}}\n\nAfter an initial rest and further preparations, the Tanzanian forces along with [[Uganda National Liberation Front|allied Ugandan rebels]] resumed their offensive.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=29}} The UAAF continued to attack the Tanzanian-led ground forces and supply bases during this time, while the TPDF's Air Wing began to make its first incursions into Ugandan air space. The most fierce air combat of the war occurred during the [[Battle of Simba Hills]] from 11 February 1979. The UAAF repeatedly attacked the TPDF troops at Simba Hills, encountering heavy resistance from SA-7 teams; the TPDF later claimed to have shot down 19 Ugandan aircraft. The Tanzanian Air Wing also bombed Ugandan positions during the battle. After two days of fighting, the Simba Hills fell to the Tanzanian-led forces. The TPDF also captured the Lukoma air strip,{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=30}} which had been used by the UAAF MiGs to stage raids in Tanzanian territory.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=79}}{{efn|According to the ''New Vision'', following the capture of Simba Hills, the Ugandans attempted to halt the Tanzanian advance at Kabuwooko with paratroopers, but this failed when the Tanzanians shot their planes down.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1508815/amin-annexed-kagera-salient-uganda| title = When Amin annexed Kagera Salient onto Uganda| date = 17 October 2019| website = New Vision| access-date =16 November 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nTwo Ugandan MiG-21s attacked the Lukoma air strip on 14 February in an attempt to destroy Tanzanian transport aircraft. The raid was easily repelled by the TPDF, as Tanzanian MiGs and ground forces responded and forced the Ugandans to flee.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=30}} On 27 February, four UAAF MiG-21s attempted to bomb the Mutukula air strip, but three were reportedly shot down by SA-7s, with one Ugandan pilot taken prisoner.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=31}} Following its devastating losses during February 1979, the UAAF was effectively eliminated as a fighting force,{{sfn|Brzoska|Pearson|1994|p=207}} although it continued to fly missions. In March, the only known dogfight of the war took place, as a Tanzanian fighter shot down a UAAF MiG-21 near Byesika along the [[Masaka]]\u2013[[Mubende]] road. The Ugandan pilot was killed, while the successful Tanzanian pilot remains unidentified.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=31}} On 4 March UAAF MiGs were fielded against Ugandan rebels who were conducting [[Battle of Tororo|a raid]] on the border town of [[Tororo]], forcing them to retreat into Kenya.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=62}} \n\nBy this point, the UAAF increasingly suffered from the loss of manpower through deaths, defections and desertions. Its commander Christopher Gore either fled to [[Sudan]]{{sfn|Rwehururu|2002|p=73}} or was killed in an ambush,{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=231}} leaving Andrew Mukooza as acting commander of the force.{{sfn|Cooper|Fontanellaz|2015|p=36}} An Ugandan soldier interviewed by the ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine stated that two pilots deserted with their MiG-21s,{{sfn|Seftel|2010|p=227}} while others suffered from mental breakdowns.{{sfn|Seftel|2010|pp=224, 227}} One pilot went absent without leave after flying several missions and was arrested and sentenced to death; he was later freed from prison by Tanzanian troops.{{sfn|Avirgan|Honey|1983|p=151}} Kiiza was one of those who deserted during the war's last stages.{{efn|According to Kiiza, he remained in active service until the Tanzanians encircled Entebbe, whereupon he hid with a friend at [[Kanyanya]] in Kampala.

The group was originally named My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (lead vocalist), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass guitar) and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under a variety of different names and with several lineup changes before finally deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1969. The band released their [[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)|first album]] in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns would later be replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]], and King by [[Steve Gaines]]. At the height of their fame during the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\".\n\nThe band abruptly ceased when Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]] were killed in an [[1977 Mississippi CV-240 crash|airplane crash on October 20, 1977]], but reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as its lead vocalist. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record with co-founder Rossington (being the band's sole continuous member), Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996.

The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' then-current hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. They soon approached guitarist [[Allen Collins]] to join the band, though Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway. Collins was soon convinced that Van Zant meant him no harm and he agreed to join the fledgling band.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\">If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, Passion Pictures, Directed by Stephen Kijak, 2018</ref> Bassist [[Larry Junstrom]] soon rounded out the lineup and the band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to The Noble Five<ref name=Name_Changes>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title= History Lessons |publisher= Lynyrd Skynyrd History site (Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com) |date= |accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref> before becoming The One Percent by 1968.<ref name=Name_Changes/>\n\nStill known as The One Percent in 1969, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had \"1% talent\".

Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in [[Macon, Georgia]]-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=Oxford Music Online|website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather [[Shorty Medlocke]] was an influence in the writing of \"[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]\".

When Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist, [[Leon Wilkeson]]. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until 1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'', which used the track \"One More Time\" from the early Muscle Shoals sessions with guitar overdubs done in 1975 by [[Ed King]]. Also in 1972, roadie [[Billy Powell]] became the band's keyboardist after Ronnie Van Zant heard him playing his rendition of \"Free Bird\".{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Peak (1973\u20131977)===\nIn 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta.  Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label that was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions for the album, only playing on two tracks.  He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part which Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album.  After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 }}</ref> The album featured the hit song \"[[Free Bird]]\", which received national airplay,<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Their 1974 follow-up, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough.  Its single, \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", reached #8 on the charts that August.

In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}} }}</ref> Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement before its release, with Kooper left with the tapes to complete the mix.<ref>Al Kooper: Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock 'N' Roll Survivor (1998)</ref> Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. Van Zant and King's guitar roadie were arrested the night prior and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings which broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to [[Los Angeles]], believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> The band continued for the next several months with two guitarists rather than their usual \"three guitar army\". In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, [[Cassie Gaines]] and [[JoJo Billingsley]] (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added, although they were not considered official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album ''[[Gimme Back My Bullets]]'' was released, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as [[Leslie West]], its search continued until Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, [[Steve Gaines|Steve]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\n\nThen Steve Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in [[Kansas City]] on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly reconstituted band recorded the double-live album ''[[One More from the Road]]'' at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)]] in Atlanta, and performed at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] festival in Great Britain, headlined by [[the Rolling Stones]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1977]]\n1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'' turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them.

So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" \u2013 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]\" and \"[[That Smell]]\".

The original cover sleeve for ''Street Survivors'' had featured a photograph of the band amid flames, with Steve Gaines nearly obscured by fire.

Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n42 years after the crash multiple parts of the crashed aircraft were recovered at the site by metal detectors including coins, an unopened beer can, dashboard parts, and flight instruments.{{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=}}\n\n===Hiatus (1977\u20131987)===\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed [[the Rossington-Collins Band]], which released two MCA albums, \"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\" in 1980 and \"This Is The Way\" in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, [[Dale Krantz]], as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s, \"Returned to the Scene of the Crime\" in 1986 and \"Love Your Man\" in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\u20131988.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash.

Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in. In return for avoiding prison following his guilty plea to DUI manslaughter Collins would be wheeled out onstage each night to explain to the audience why he could no longer perform (usually before the performance of \"That Smell\", the lyrics of which had been partially directed at him).<ref name=\"Ult\">[https://ultimateclassicrock.com/allen-collins-car-accident/ \"The Day Lynyrd Skynyrd Guitarist Allen Collins Was Paralyzed in a Car Accident\"]; Jan 29, 2016 article; Ultimate Classic Rock, online website; accessed Oct 4, 2019</ref>  Collins was stricken with [[pneumonia]] in 1989 and died on January 23, 1990, leaving Rossington as the only remaining founding member.<ref name=\"Ult\"/>\n\nThe reunited band was intended to be a one-time tribute to the original lineup, captured on the double-live album ''[[Southern by the Grace of God]]: Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour 1987''. That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness|newspaper=[[Florida Trend]]}}</ref> However, continued lineup changes and natural attrition has led to a relaxation in recent years.\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993.  Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. The band's third post-reunion album, ''[[Endangered Species (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|Endangered Species]]'', featured mostly acoustic instrumentation and remakes of many of the band's classic 1970s songs.

The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour.  Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.\n\nThe band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/> Wilkeson's death resulted in the band with two remaining members from the classic pre-crash lineups.\n\nThe first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003.  This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song \"Red, White and Blue\".  The band also released a double collection album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the band did a show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]], ''Crossroads'', a concert featuring country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]] and other genres of music.

The group was originally named My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (lead vocalist), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass guitar) and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums).  The band spent five years touring small venues under a variety of different names and with several lineup changes before finally deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1969. The band released their [[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)|first album]] in 1973, having settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]] and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns would later be replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]], and King by [[Steve Gaines]]. At the height of their fame during the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\".\n\nThe band abruptly ceased when Ronnie Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]] were killed in an [[1977 Mississippi CV-240 crash|airplane crash on October 20, 1977]], but reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as its lead vocalist. Lynyrd Skynyrd continues to tour and record with co-founder Rossington (being the band's sole continuous member), Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996.

The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' then-current hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. They soon approached guitarist [[Allen Collins]] to join the band, though Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway. Collins was soon convinced that Van Zant meant him no harm and he agreed to join the fledgling band.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\">If I Leave Here Tomorrow: A Film About Lynyrd Skynyrd, Passion Pictures, Directed by Stephen Kijak, 2018</ref> Bassist [[Larry Junstrom]] soon rounded out the lineup and the band settled on the name My Backyard, later changed to The Noble Five<ref name=Name_Changes>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com/less2.html |title= History Lessons |publisher= Lynyrd Skynyrd History site (Lynyrdskynyrdhistory.com) |date= |accessdate=2015-04-04}}</ref> before becoming The One Percent by 1968.<ref name=Name_Changes/>\n\nStill known as The One Percent in 1969, Van Zant sought a new name after growing tired of taunts from audiences that the band had \"1% talent\".

Pat Armstrong, a Jacksonville native and partner in [[Macon, Georgia]]-based Hustlers Inc. with [[Phil Walden]]'s younger brother, [[Alan Walden]], became the band's managers. Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was turned over to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit|title=Oxford Music Online|website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time. Junstrom left and was briefly replaced by [[Greg T. Walker]] on bass. At that time, [[Rickey Medlocke]] joined as a second drummer and occasional second vocalist to help fortify Burns' sound on the drums. Medlocke grew up with the founding members of Lynyrd Skynyrd and his grandfather [[Shorty Medlocke]] was an influence in the writing of \"[[The Ballad of Curtis Loew]]\".

When Lynyrd Skynyrd made a second round of Muscle Shoals recordings in 1972, Burns was once again featured on drums along with new bassist, [[Leon Wilkeson]]. Medlocke and Walker did not appear on any album until 1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'', which used the track \"One More Time\" from the early Muscle Shoals sessions with guitar overdubs done in 1975 by [[Ed King]]. Also in 1972, roadie [[Billy Powell]] became the band's keyboardist after Ronnie Van Zant heard him playing his rendition of \"Free Bird\".{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Peak (1973\u20131977)===\nIn 1972, the band (then comprising Van Zant, Collins, Rossington, Burns, Wilkeson, and Powell) was discovered by musician, songwriter, and producer [[Al Kooper]] of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]], who had attended one of their shows at Funocchio's in Atlanta.  Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label that was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions for the album, only playing on two tracks.  He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part which Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album.  After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archivedate=February 27, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 }}</ref> The album featured the hit song \"[[Free Bird]]\", which received national airplay,<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Their 1974 follow-up, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough.  Its single, \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", reached #8 on the charts that August. (Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" for the band, but they never recorded it.)<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was the only single to crack the top ten.<ref name=\"Butler, J.

In January, drummer Burns left the band after suffering a mental breakdown during a European tour<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> and was replaced by Kentucky native and former [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] [[Artimus Pyle]]. The band's third album, ''[[Nuthin' Fancy]]'', was recorded in 17 days.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hunt |first1=Dennis |title=Ups and Downs of Lynyrd Skynyrd: More Pop News |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=September 15, 1975|id={{ProQuest|157771298}} }}</ref> Unhappy with the band's lack of preparation for the album's recording,<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> Kooper and the band parted ways by mutual agreement before its release, with Kooper left with the tapes to complete the mix.<ref>Al Kooper: Backstage Passes & Backstabbing Bastards: Memoirs of a Rock 'N' Roll Survivor (1998)</ref> Though the album fared well, it ultimately had lower sales than its predecessors. Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. Van Zant and King's guitar roadie were arrested the night prior and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings which broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to [[Los Angeles]], believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" /> The band continued for the next several months with two guitarists rather than their usual \"three guitar army\". In January 1976, backup singers Leslie Hawkins, [[Cassie Gaines]] and [[JoJo Billingsley]] (collectively known as The Honkettes) were added, although they were not considered official members. Lynyrd Skynyrd's fourth album ''[[Gimme Back My Bullets]]'' was released, but did not achieve the same success as the previous two albums. Van Zant and Collins both felt that the band was seriously missing the three-guitar attack that had been one of its early hallmarks. Although Skynyrd auditioned several guitarists, including such high-profile names as [[Leslie West]], its search continued until Cassie Gaines began touting the guitar and songwriting prowess of her younger brother, [[Steve Gaines|Steve]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\n\nThen Steve Gaines, who led his own band, Crawdad (which occasionally would perform Skynyrd's \"Saturday Night Special\" in their set), was invited to audition onstage with Skynyrd at a concert in [[Kansas City]] on May 11, 1976. Liking what they heard, the group also jammed informally with the Oklahoma native several times, then invited him into the group in June. With Gaines on board, the newly reconstituted band recorded the double-live album ''[[One More from the Road]]'' at the [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)]] in Atlanta, and performed at the [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]] festival in Great Britain, headlined by [[the Rolling Stones]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\nBoth Collins and Rossington had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd, 1977]]\n1977's ''[[Street Survivors]]'' turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them.

So confident was Skynyrd's leader of Gaines' abilities that the album (and some concerts) featured Gaines delivering his self-penned bluesy \"Ain't No Good Life\" \u2013 the only song in the pre-crash Skynyrd catalog to feature a lead vocalist other than Ronnie Van Zant. The album also included the hit singles \"[[What's Your Name (Lynyrd Skynyrd Album)|What's Your Name]]\" and \"[[That Smell]]\".

Collins, Rossington, Powell, and Pyle were joined by Daniels and members of his band. Leon Wilkeson, who was still undergoing physical therapy for his badly broken left arm, was in attendance, along with Judy Van Zant, Teresa Gaines, JoJo Billingsley, and Leslie Hawkins.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Hiatus (1977\u20131987)===\nRossington, Collins, Wilkeson and Powell formed [[the Rossington-Collins Band]], which released two MCA albums, \"Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere\" in 1980 and \"This Is The Way\" in 1981. Deliberately avoiding comparisons with Ronnie Van Zant as well as suggestions that this band was Lynyrd Skynyrd reborn, Rossington and Collins chose a woman, [[Dale Krantz]], as the lead vocalist. However, as an acknowledgement of their past, the band's concert encore would always be an instrumental version of \"Free Bird\". Rossington and Collins eventually had a falling out over the affections of Dale Krantz, whom Rossington married and with whom he formed the Rossington Band, which released two albums in the late 1980s, \"Returned to the Scene of the Crime\" in 1986 and \"Love Your Man\" in 1988 and also opened for the Lynyrd Skynyrd Tribute Tour in 1987\u20131988.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe other former members of Lynyrd Skynyrd continued to make music during the hiatus era. Billy Powell played keyboards in a Christian rock band named Vision, touring with established Christian rocker [[Mylon LeFevre]]. During Vision concerts, Powell's trademark keyboard talent was often spotlighted and he spoke about his conversion to Christianity after the near-fatal plane crash.

Ronnie Van Zant's younger brother, [[Johnny Van Zant|Johnny]], took over as the new lead singer and primary songwriter. Due to founding member Allen Collins' paralysis from his 1986 car accident, he was only able to participate as the musical director, choosing Randall Hall, his former bandmate in the Allen Collins Band, as his stand-in.

That the band chose to continue after the 1987 tribute tour caused legal problems for the survivors, as Judy Van Zant Jenness and Teresa Gaines Rapp (widows of Ronnie and Steve, respectively) sued the others for violating an agreement made shortly after the plane crash, stating that they would not \"exploit\" the Skynyrd name for profit. As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness|title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness|newspaper=[[Florida Trend]]}}</ref> However, continued lineup changes and natural attrition has led to a relaxation in recent years.\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''. By that time, the band had added a second drummer, Kurt Custer. Artimus Pyle left the band during the same year, with Custer becoming the band's sole drummer. That lineup released a second post-reunion album, entitled ''[[The Last Rebel]]'' in 1993.  Later that year, Randall Hall was replaced by Mike Estes. The band's third post-reunion album, ''[[Endangered Species (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|Endangered Species]]'', featured mostly acoustic instrumentation and remakes of many of the band's classic 1970s songs.  On the album, Kurt Custer was replaced by [[Owen Hale]] on drums.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Member changes and deaths (1996\u20132019)===\nEd King had to take a break from touring in 1996 due to heart complications that required a transplant.

The result was a major retooling of the band's 'guitar army'.  Medlocke and Thomasson would also become major contributors to the band's songwriting along with Rossington and Van Zant.\n\nThe first album with this new lineup, released in 1997, was entitled [[Twenty (Lynyrd Skynyrd album)|''Twenty'']].  The band released another album, ''[[Edge of Forever]]'' in 1999. By that time, Hale had left the band, and the drums on the album were played by session drummer [[Kenny Aronoff]]. [[Michael Cartellone]] became the band's permanent drummer on the subsequent tour.  Despite the growing number of post-reunion albums that band had released up to this time, setlists showed that the band was playing mostly 1970s-era material in concert.\n\nThe band released a Christmas album, entitled ''[[Christmas Time Again]]'' in 2000. [[Leon Wilkeson]], Skynyrd's bassist since 1972, was found dead in his hotel room on July 27, 2001. His death was found to be due to [[emphysema]] and chronic liver disease. He was replaced in 2001 by [[Ean Evans]].<ref name=Evans_death/> Wilkeson's death resulted in the band with two remaining members from the classic pre-crash lineups.\n\nThe first album to feature Evans was [[Vicious Cycle (album)|''Vicious Cycle'']], released in 2003.  This album had improved sales over the other post-reunion albums, and had a minor hit single in the song \"Red, White and Blue\".  The band also released a double collection album called ''[[Thyrty: The 30th Anniversary Collection|Thyrty]]'', which had songs from the original lineup to the present, and also a live DVD of their Vicious Cycle Tour and on June 22, 2004, the album ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve: The Vicious Cycle Tour]]''.\n\nOn December 10, 2004, the band did a show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]], ''Crossroads'', a concert featuring country duo [[Montgomery Gentry]] and other genres of music. In the beginning of 2005 [[Hughie Thomasson]] left the band to reform his Southern Rock band [[Outlaws (band)|Outlaws]]. Thomasson died in his sleep on September 9, 2007 of an apparent heart attack in his home in Brooksville, Florida; he was 55 years old.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nOn February 5, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd did a Super Bowl party in Jacksonville with special guests [[3 Doors Down]], [[Jo Dee Messina]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and Ronnie and Johnny Van Zant's brother [[Donnie Van Zant]] of [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]]. On February 13 of that year Lynyrd Skynyrd did a tribute to Southern Rock on the Grammy Awards with [[Gretchen Wilson]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Keith Urban]] and [[Dickey Betts]]. In the summer of 2005, lead singer [[Johnny Van Zant]] had to have surgery on his vocal cord to have a polyp removed. He was told not to sing for three months. On September 10, 2005, Lynyrd Skynyrd performed without Johnny Van Zant at the Music Relief Concert for the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], with [[Kid Rock]] standing in for Johnny. In December 2005, Johnny Van Zant returned to sing for Lynyrd Skynyrd. The band performed live at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, as a part of their 2007 tour.
