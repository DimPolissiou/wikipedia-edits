number of nominations, including Game of the Year, received by ''[[Death Stranding]]'', [[Kojima Productions]]' first project after becoming an independent studio from [[Konami]]. Keighley had been open about having a friendly relationship with game director [[Hideo Kojima]] in the past, and Kojima included Keighley as a cameo character in the game. When these relationships were brought up, Keighley reiterated on social media that he had no part in any of the jury nominations or award selections, stating that since he has to work closely with developers and publishers to prepare the show, he keeps himself at a distance from any selection process. Additionally, while Kojima sits on the advisory board for The Game Awards, Keighley asserted the board had no direct influence on the selections.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/death-strandings-nominations-at-the-game-awards-cant-he-1840005746 | title = Death Stranding's Nominations at the Game Awards Can't Help But Raise Questions | first = Heather | last = Alexandra | date = November 22, 2019 | accessdate = November 22, 2019 | work = [[Kotaku]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191122214416/https://kotaku.com/death-strandings-nominations-at-the-game-awards-cant-he-1840005746 | archive-date = November 22, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.videogamer.com/news/geoff-keighley-appreciates-the-concern-regarding-death-stranding-award-nominations | title = Geoff Keighley 'appreciates the concern' regarding Death Stranding award nominations | first = Imogen | last = Donovan | date = November 26, 2019 | accessdate = November 28, 2019 | work = VideoGamer.com | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191128204107/https://www.videogamer.com/news/geoff-keighley-appreciates-the-concern-regarding-death-stranding-award-nominations | archive-date = November 28, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nGames and subjects in '''bold''' won their respective category.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/2019/12/13/21020351/game-awards-2019-winners-nominees-tga | title = All the winners from The Game Awards 2019 | first = Austen | last = Goslin | date = December 13, 2019 | accessdate = December 13, 2019 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20191213183848/https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/2019/12/13/21020351/game-awards-2019-winners-nominees-tga | archive-date = December 13, 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n! style=\"background:#708090; width:50em;\" | {{color|white|[[Game Award for Game of the Year|Game of the Year]]}}\n! style=\"background:#708090; width:50em;\" | {{color|white|Best Game Direction}}\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" |\n*'''''[[Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice]]''''' \u2013 [[FromSoftware]]/[[Activision]]\n**''[[Control (video game)|Control]]'' \u2013 [[Remedy Entertainment]]/[[505 Games]]\n**''[[Death Stranding]]'' \u2013 [[Kojima Productions]]/[[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]\n**''[[Resident Evil 2 (2019 video game)|Resident Evil 2]]'' \u2013 [[Capcom]]\n**''[[Super Smash Bros.

Keighley had been open about having a friendly relationship with game director [[Hideo Kojima]] in the past, and Kojima included Keighley as a cameo character in the game. When these relationships were brought up, Keighley reiterated on social media that he had no part in any of the jury nominations or award selections, stating that since he has to work closely with developers and publishers to prepare the show, he keeps himself at a distance from any selection process.
