She first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' vol. 1 #3 (February 1961), and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]]. In all her ''World's Finest Comics'' appearances she is referred to as Hyanthis.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHyathis is the ''Panala'' (Queen) of Alstair in the [[Antares]] solar system, Alstair shares the solar system with four other planets: '''Dhor''', '''Llarr''', and '''Mosteel''' which is farthest from Antares. Hyathis appears to be a ''Plant Elemental'' with empathic control over all plant life on Alstair. Alstairans are all plant/humanoid hybrids because they diverged from the common [[protozoa]]n evolutionary branch linking [[Flora]] and [[Fauna]] much later on than life did on [[Earth]]. All [[plant]] based Alstairans receive part of their nourishment from sunlight and have broad [[leaf|leaves]] instead of hair. The [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] based Alstairans appear to pass on the mold infection with a [[vampire|vampiric]] bite, they also prefer darkness and seem to have stringy hair.\n\nHyathis is continuously at war with the three other planetary monarchs in the [[Antares]] solar system: '''[[Kanjar Ro]]''', insect-like dictator of the planet ''Dhor''; '''Kromm''', the metal skinned ruler of the planet ''Mosteel''; and '''Sayyar''', the [[lizard]]-like [[emperor]] of ''Llarr''. A few years ago this four-way conflict was temporarily ended when Kanjar Ro abducted members of the [[Justice League of America]], and used his '''Gamma Gong''' to force them to defeat the rulers of Alstair, Mosteel and Llarr, placing Earth in a paralyzed state. \n\n[[Image:Hyathisdcu1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Left to right: Sayyar, Hyathis and Kromm from ''Mystery in Space'' #75, artist [[Carmine Infantino]]]] \nHyathis was defeated and captured by the combined power of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]]. Eventually, the entire Justice League was able to trick and defeat Kanjar Ro, and all four rulers were marooned on a small planet with a barrier created by Green Lantern's ring around it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 1 #3</ref> After the four of them were able to use willpower to make a crack in the barrier, Kanjar Ro escaped, leaving the others behind. Later Hyathis' loyal Alstairan followers rescued her from the prison world, and took her to the planet [[Thanagar]]. Hyathis adapted Alstairan medicine to provide a workable cure for a deadly plague sweeping the planet. She required that the Thanagarians appoint her ''Empress of Thanagar'' before she would give them the cure. Hyathis transformed the Thanagarian people into a warlike race. This led the Thanagarian Empire to attempt conquest of the planet [[Rann]]. [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] was able put an end to the conflict. With the help of [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], Hawkman was also successful in deposing Hyathis.<ref>''World's Finest Comics'' #272, 273</ref> Aggressive Thanagarian factions later freed Hyathis, and then launched a shadow war against [[Earth]].

She first appeared in ''[[Justice League of America]]'' vol. 1 #3 (February 1961), and was created by [[Gardner Fox]] and [[Mike Sekowsky]]. In all her ''World's Finest Comics'' appearances she is referred to as Hyanthis.\n\n==Fictional character biography==\nHyathis is the ''Panala'' (Queen) of Alstair in the [[Antares]] solar system, Alstair shares the solar system with four other planets: '''Dhor''', '''Llarr''', and '''Mosteel''' which is farthest from Antares. Hyathis appears to be a ''Plant Elemental'' with empathic control over all plant life on Alstair. Alstairans are all plant/humanoid hybrids because they diverged from the common [[protozoa]]n evolutionary branch linking [[Flora]] and [[Fauna]] much later on than life did on [[Earth]]. All [[plant]] based Alstairans receive part of their nourishment from sunlight and have broad [[leaf|leaves]] instead of hair. The [[mold]] based Alstairans appear to pass on the mold infection with a [[vampire|vampiric]] bite, they also prefer darkness and seem to have stringy hair.\n\nHyathis is continuously at war with the three other planetary monarchs in the [[Antares]] solar system: '''[[Kanjar Ro]]''', insect-like dictator of the planet ''Dhor''; '''Kromm''', the metal skinned ruler of the planet ''Mosteel''; and '''Sayyar''', the [[lizard]]-like [[emperor]] of ''Llarr''. A few years ago this four-way conflict was temporarily ended when Kanjar Ro abducted members of the [[Justice League of America]], and used his '''Gamma Gong''' to force them to defeat the rulers of Alstair, Mosteel and Llarr, placing Earth in a paralyzed state. \n\n[[Image:Hyathisdcu1.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Left to right: Sayyar, Hyathis and Kromm from ''Mystery in Space'' #75, artist [[Carmine Infantino]]]] \nHyathis was defeated and captured by the combined power of [[Wonder Woman]] and [[Aquaman]]. Eventually, the entire Justice League was able to trick and defeat Kanjar Ro, and all four rulers were marooned on a small planet with a barrier created by Green Lantern's ring around it.<ref>''Justice League of America'' vol. 1 #3</ref> After the four of them were able to use willpower to make a crack in the barrier, Kanjar Ro escaped, leaving the others behind. Later Hyathis' loyal Alstairan followers rescued her from the prison world, and took her to the planet [[Thanagar]]. Hyathis adapted Alstairan medicine to provide a workable cure for a deadly plague sweeping the planet. She required that the Thanagarians appoint her ''Empress of Thanagar'' before she would give them the cure. Hyathis transformed the Thanagarian people into a warlike race. This led the Thanagarian Empire to attempt conquest of the planet [[Rann]]. [[Hawkman (Katar Hol)|Hawkman]] was able put an end to the conflict.
