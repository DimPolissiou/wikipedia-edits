In Catholic countries of Europe, it has been celebrated on March 19 ([[Saint Joseph's Day]]) since the [[Middle Ages]]. This celebration was brought by the Spanish and Portuguese to [[Latin America]], where March 19 is often still used for it, though many countries in Europe and the Americas have adopted the U.S. date, which is the third Sunday of June. It is celebrated on various days in many parts of the world, most commonly in the months of March, April and June according to the home nation's customs.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the number eight is ''b\u0101'', and the pronunciation is very similar to the character \"\u7238\" \"b\u00e0\", which means \"Pa\" or \"dad\". The eighth day of the eighth month (b\u0101-b\u0101) is a pun for dad (\u7238\u7238 or \"b\u00e0ba\").  The Taiwanese, therefore, sometimes refer to August 8 as \"B\u0101b\u0101 Holiday\" as a pun for \"Dad's Holiday\" (\u7238\u7238\u7bc0) or the more formal \"Father's Day\" (\u7236\u89aa\u7bc0).\n\n====Thailand====\nIn [[Thailand]], the birthday of the king, is set as Father's Day.<ref name=smiles /> December 5 is the birthday of the late king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX).

Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the [[color of the day]] for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the [[Sanam Luang]], a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.\n\nIt first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] to promote Thailand's royal family.<ref name=smiles /> [[Mother's Day]] is celebrated on the birthday of Queen [[Sirikit]],<ref name=smiles>{{Cite book|title= The King Never Smiles: a biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |author=Paul M.

In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed.

In [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], the pronunciation of the number eight is ''b\u0101'', and the pronunciation is very similar to the character \"\u7238\" \"b\u00e0\", which means \"Pa\" or \"dad\". The eighth day of the eighth month (b\u0101-b\u0101) is a pun for dad (\u7238\u7238 or \"b\u00e0ba\").  The Taiwanese, therefore, sometimes refer to August 8 as \"B\u0101b\u0101 Holiday\" as a pun for \"Dad's Holiday\" (\u7238\u7238\u7bc0) or the more formal \"Father's Day\" (\u7236\u89aa\u7bc0).\n\n====Thailand====\nIn [[Thailand]], the birthday of the king, is set as Father's Day.<ref name=smiles /> December 5 is the birthday of the late king [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX).

Thai people will wear yellow on this day to show respect for the late king, because yellow is the [[color of the day]] for Monday, the day King Bhumibol Adulyadej was born. Thais flood the [[Sanam Luang]], a massive park in front of the palace, to watch the king give his annual speech, and often stay until the evening, when there is a national ceremony. Thais will light candles and show respect to the king by declaring their faith. This ceremony happens in almost every village in Thailand, and even overseas at Thai organizations.\n\nIt first gained nationwide popularity in the 1980s as part of a campaign by Prime Minister [[Prem Tinsulanonda]] to promote Thailand's royal family.<ref name=smiles /> [[Mother's Day]] is celebrated on the birthday of Queen [[Sirikit]],<ref name=smiles>{{Cite book|title= The King Never Smiles: a biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej |author=Paul M.

In 1952, the holiday was officially decreed. A national father's day committee was set up to give a prize for fathers that deserved it most (originally, candidates were nominated by the social services of each town hall's/mayor's office); This complements \"la F\u00eate des M\u00e8res\" (Mother's day) which was made official in France in 1928 and added to the calendar in Vichy in 1941.\n\n====Germany====\n[[Image:Hiking tour on father's day.JPG|thumb|Hiking tour on father's day with smaller wagons.]]\n\nIn Germany, Father's Day (''Vatertag'') is celebrated differently from other parts of the world.<ref name=\"urge\">{{Cite news| title = German Minister Urges Fathers Not to Get Drunk on Father's Day! | author=Agence France-Presse | url = http://www.medindia.net/news/German-Minister-Urges-Fathers-Not-to-Get-Drunk-on-Fathers-Day-36153-1.htm}}</ref> It is always celebrated on [[Ascension Day]] (the Thursday forty days after Easter), which is a federal holiday.

The revived site now uses a remote server.\n\nOn May 7, 2013, d2, an unofficial website based on Demonoid's databases went live at d2.vu, with hosting provided by the U.S.-based service [[RamNode]]. Around November 2013, a website showing the Demonoid logo and saying \"We will rebuild!\" came online at the .com domain, and the .me and .ph domains began redirecting web traffic to it, indicating they are all under control of the same owner.\n\nIn January 2014, a tracker came online at the .com domain and provided service for the old torrents. On March 29, 2014, Demonoid came back online at the demonoid[[.ph]] domain. On December 3, 2014 domain name was changed to demonoid[[.pw]].\n\nThere are no proxies or other alternatives available.

On November 4, 2009, the tracker, which communicates with a BitTorrent client, began responding to some torrents, and returned to full operation on November 17. The main site, however, did not become operational until December 13, 2009.\n\nOn April 26, 2010, Demonoid.com, started experiencing downtime or extreme slowness. A message was posted on the site that it was due to a [[denial-of-service attack]], which has subsided as of July 2010.<ref name=\"slyckdemonoid28apr2010\">{{cite web\n| url = http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=1947\n| title = Demonoid Suffering Massive Denial of Service Attack\n| author = Thomas Mennecke\n| publisher = [[Slyck.com]]\n| date = 2010-04-29\n| accessdate = 2010-04-30\n}}</ref> The site temporarily banned Taiwanese and Chinese IP ranges.<ref>[http://torrentfreak.com/demonoid-blocks-taiwan-and-china-after-dos-attack-100715/ \"Demonoid Blocks Taiwan and China After DoS Attack\"] ''TorrentFreak''. 15 Jul 2010.

Former users were still able to use their login details, and most of the old torrents were still listed on the site.\n\nIn July 2018, Demonoid stopped working on all used domains. The issues are related to server-side problems.

All previously registered Demonoid users were able to log in using their already existing Demonoid accounts, while new invite codes were being generated. Unlike Demonoid, d2 had no user forums, and to minimize legal risk, the site had no torrent tracker; all torrents instead used public trackers. RamNode eventually terminated d2's hosting and, in August 2013, d2.vu was hosted on a server in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torrentfreak.com/new-demonoid-d2-vu-quickly-shutdown-for-hosting-malware-130508/ |title='New' Demonoid D2.VU Quickly Shutdown for Hosting Malware| work=TorrentFreak |date=May 8, 2013 |author=Andy \"Enigmax\" Maxwell}}</ref> d2 closed on March 30, 2014 when Demonoid went back up.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{BitTorrent}}\n\n[[Category:Internet properties established in 2003]]\n[[Category:BitTorrent websites]]\n[[Category:Internet properties disestablished in 2012]]\n[[Category:File sharing communities]]\n[[Category:Notorious markets]]\n", "name_user": "Kazerniel", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:replaced dead links with moved domain and archived copy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonoid"}

Right in the kisser.\" As such, \"Red Riding Hoodwinked\" marked one of the earliest parodies of ''The Honeymooners''. In addition, Granny's appearance is updated: Although she appears as a sourpuss here, her physical attributes (such as a less-pronounced chin) would be used in future appearances. Also, Granny's old-fashioned ways would be de-emphasized.\n\nThe wolf character would re-appear in \"[[Hare-Less Wolf]]\", albeit designed differently and given the name Charles M.

The present she plans to bring her grandmother is Tweety (in his cage). Sylvester sees Red's cargo and immediately begins going after her, his primary interest being Tweety. Red boards the bus, but Sylvester continues after her as it drives into the woods, the inattentive cat striking a road sign along the way.\n\nIn the woods, the Big Bad Wolf \u2014 rougher looking in appearance than in later shorts \u2014 waits for Red to come by. A sign announces who Big Bad is, much to his disgust. Sylvester overhears the requisite exchange of Big Bad asking Red where she is headed and soon joins Big Bad in trying to reach Granny's house first. In fact both villains nearly beat each other up trying to be \"Grandma\" to catch their prey (\"Tryin to muscle in on my racket?\")\n\nBig Bad ousts Granny from the house, to which she immediately swears revenge (mimicking Ralph Kramden's signature \"POW! Right in the kisser!\" line). Big Bad and Sylvester hurriedly dress in Granny's clothing in anticipation of Red's arrival. Big Bad takes his place in the bed after shooing Sylvester underneath. Once Red arrives and presents \"Grandma\" with Tweety, she sets it down as asked; Sylvester immediately approaches the cage, prompting Tweety to ask: \"Hewwo, Wittle Wed Widing Hood's Gwandma! Whatcha doin' under da bed?\" After the signature exchange ending with \"The better to see, smell, and eat you with,\" and each character's realization of their sworn enemy (Red: \"Oh! The Big Bad Wolf!\" Tweety: \"Eek! The Big Bad Puddy Tat!\"), the chase begins.\n\nAfter several back-and-forth chases, with Big Bad and Sylvester getting the worse end of things, Red and Tweety flee Granny's home and head for the nearest bus stop. Their pursuers chase after the bus and immediately board at the next stop, only to be forcibly ejected and punched by the bus driver. That driver is none other than Granny, who then shouts, \"I told them, one of these days...!\" Red and Tweety supply the rest of the line: \"Pow!
