Since 1985, Sperry\u2019s iconography has ranged from astronauts walking on the surface of the moon to portraits of performers as varied as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Chrissie Hynde]]. Beginning in 2010, many of Sperry\u2019s prints have featured images of female muses from Greek mythology.\n\n==Early life==\n===Family===\nChuck Sperry was born on February 5, 1962, in [[Dayton, Ohio]],<ref name=sperryabout>Chuck Sperry \"About\" page, https://chucksperry.net/about/</ref> to Sally and John Sperry, who apprenticed to sculptor Robert Koepnik, who had apprenticed to Carl Milles, who had apprenticed to [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sperry says that watching his father make art was a source of great inspiration to him, and gave him license to consider an art career for himself. Sperry\u2019s mother was a regional advertising executive. Sally Sperry\u2019s rise from layout artist to advertising executive also made an impression on Chuck, who says he was inspired by her professional advancement during the 1960s and \u201970s in a male-dominated profession.<ref name=insiderock2010>\"The Chuck Sperry Interview and Poster Giveaway,\" November 16, 2010, https://insidetherockposterframe.blogspot.com/2010/11/chuck-sperry-interview-and-poster.html</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:2017 Sperry Workshop.jpg|thumb|Chuck Sperry hosting a Schoolab Workshop with UC Berkeley & \u00c9cole Polytechnique Students. Oakland, CA. June, 2017]]\nDuring this period, Sperry attended art classes at the Living Arts Center in Dayton and the [[Dayton Art Institute]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> In 1980, Sperry enrolled at the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], where he was a dual major in art and journalism.<ref name=\"sperryabout\" /> During his four years at MU, Sperry was an editorial cartoonist for the student newspaper, The Man Eater.<ref name=fwinterview2018>''Artist Interview: Chuck Sperry,\" by Elizabeth Goings, September 26, 2018, https://fwmoa.blog/2018/09/26/artist-interview-chuck-sperry/</ref> Briefly, he also contributed illustrations to the [[Columbia Daily Tribune]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nAt MU, Sperry was inspired by the dean of art school, [[Frank Stack]], whose work prefigured the [[underground comix]] of the late 1960s. In the late 1950s, Stack and cartoonist [[Gilbert Shelton]] had edited [[The Texas Ranger (magazine)|The Texas Ranger]] humor magazine at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Later, while in the Army Reserve, Stack created satirical comics in his spare time, subsequently putting the best of these strips together as The Adventures of Jesus, considered by many to be America\u2019s first underground comic.<ref name=juxtapoz2018>''The Interweaving Worlds of Chuck Sperry,\" by Dasha Matsuura, March 29, 2018, https://www.juxtapoz.com/news/collectibles/the-interweaving-worlds-of-chuck-sperry/</ref>\n\nSperry was also influenced by Pulitzer Prize winning editorial cartoonist [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], who worked for the [[Dayton Daily News]] and was a friend of Sperry\u2019s parents. Thanks to that familial connection, Sperry sometimes visited Peters at his office in downtown Dayton, to show the editorial cartoonist portfolios of art, which Peters would critique.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating from MU in 1984, Sperry stayed in Columbia for a year, during which he created his first [[punk-rock]] flyers and edited an underground newspaper called Java with musician Ann Wood.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nIn 1985, Sperry moved to the East Village in New York City, where he co-edited [[World War 3 Illustrated]] with [[Seth Tobocman]] and [[Peter Kuper]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> World War 3 Illustrated included work by [[Eric Drooker]], [[James Romberger]], Anton Van Dalen, [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Art Spiegelman]], and Michael Roman.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\nIn 1989, Sperry moved to [[San Francisco]], where he eventually art directed and co-edited [https://library.civicmediacenter.org/collection/zine/weekly-weird-news-filth Weekly Weird News & Filth] with publisher Robert Collison; the newspaper had a circulation of 10,000 issues around the San Francisco Bay Area, and ran from 1991-1996. Sperry commissioned magazine covers and art from [[Robert Crumb]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Paul Mavrides]], Hal Robbins, Rigo23, Mats Stromberg, [[Gary Grimshaw]], and many others.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\nIn 1994, Sperry received his first commission from art director [https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/fillmore-art-director-retires-reframing-san-francisco-venues-famed-posters Arlene Owseichik] to create a [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] poster for Bill Graham Presents in San Francisco.

Sperry, Donovan, and Landau were among the first modern rock-poster artists to use metallic gold and silver inks in the rock-poster genre.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nThe next year, 1995, Gary Grimshaw commissioned Psychic Sparkplug to print his poster for an exhibition in [[Cleveland]] called Visual Jams, which was organized by rock-poster artist [[Derek Hess]] and coincided with the opening of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (Sperry\u2019s work is in Hall of Fame\u2019s collection).<ref name=spokesperry>\"Chuck Sperry\" page, https://spoke-art.com/collections/chuck-sperry</ref> Grimshaw invited Sperry, Donovan, and Landau to attend the event.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> Other rock-poster attendees included [[Mark Arminski]], [[Coop (artist)|Coop]], Gary Grimshaw, Derek Hess, [[Frank Kozik]], Lindsey Kuhn, T.A.Z., [[Wes Wilson]], [[Stanley Mouse]], [[Lee Conklin]], [http://www.davidsinger.com/ David Singer], and [http://www.rtuten.com/ Randy Tuten].<ref>{{cite web |title=Visual Jams Poster |url=https://www.wolfgangs.com/posters/visual-jams/poster/POW950901.html |website=Wolfgang's Vault}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Sperry, Grimshaw, and his wife, Laura, produced the first of two annual \u201cTemporary Insanity\u201d art shows at Off the Wall, a gallery on [[Haight Street]] in San Francisco, the first gallery exhibition in San Francisco of rock-poster art since the Joint Show at the Moore Gallery in 1967.

Initially located in an actual San Francisco Firehouse (complete with fire pole)<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> before relocating in Oakland, Firehouse designed and printed a series of posters for [[Virgin Megastore]] to promote record-release events and store openings. Many of these posters were die-cut to shape and promoted bands such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], Pearl Jam, [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Beastie Boys]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[U2]], and [[Limp Bizkit]], as well as performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Over the course of 12 years, the Firehouse was also commissioned to design and print a series of posters for [[Eric Clapton]] and the musician\u2019s [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]].\n\nBeginning in 2008 and continuing until 2014, Sperry art directed nearly 200 posters for [[Goldenvoice]] Presents for its [[Warfield Theatre]] and Regency venues in San Francisco. During that period, Sperry designed and printed many of these posters himself, most notably an iconic poster for Bob Dylan and His Band, which performed at the Warfield on August 25, 2010.\n\nBy 2012, Sperry had severed his partnership with Ron Donovan and renamed the Firehouse, now in Oakland, Hangar 18. From that studio, Sperry has created designs for and printed hundreds of limited-edition posters for countless bands, including The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, [[The Who]], Eric Clapton, [[Dave Matthews]], U2, Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller, Smashing Pumpkins, The Beastie Boys, Pearl Jam, [[Soundgarden]], [[The Black Keys]], [[Nick Cave]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Neko Case]], [[Mickey Hart]], [[Bob Weir]], [[Mumford and Sons]], [[Avett Brothers]], Widespread Panic, [[Greensky Bluegrass]], [[Twiddle (band)|Twiddle]], and [[Umphrey's McGee|Umphrey\u2019s McGee]].\n\nHangar 18 is also where Sperry prints his fine-art pieces on various types of paper and wood panel, usually oak, for exhibitions at [https://spoke-art.com/ Spoke Art] and [https://www.hashimotocontemporary.com/ Hashimoto Comtemporary] in San Francisco and [[New York City|New York]], [[Art Basel Miami]]/Context Art Miami, [https://www.loeilouvert.com/ L\u2019Oeil Ouvert Galerie] in [[Paris, France|Paris]], and [https://www.facebook.com/NextDoorGalleryGeneva/ Next Door Gallery] in [[Geneva]].\n\nIn 2018, the [[Fort Wayne Museum of Art]] presented \u201cAll Access: Exploring Humanism in the Art of Chuck Sperry,\u201d a solo exhibition that included screen-printed figurative artworks, drawings, brush-and-ink originals, ephemeral progressive studies, and three large format hand-woven tapestries.

Since 1985, Sperry\u2019s iconography has ranged from astronauts walking on the surface of the moon to portraits of performers as varied as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Chrissie Hynde]]. Beginning in 2010, many of Sperry\u2019s prints have featured images of female muses from Greek mythology.\n\n==Early Life==\n===Family===\nChuck Sperry was born on February 5, 1962, in [[Dayton, Ohio]],<ref name=sperryabout>Chuck Sperry \"About\" page, https://chucksperry.net/about/</ref> to Sally and John Sperry, who apprenticed to sculptor Robert Koepnik, who had apprenticed to Carl Milles, who had apprenticed to [[Auguste Rodin]]. Sperry says that watching his father make art was a source of great inspiration to him, and gave him license to consider an art career for himself. Sperry\u2019s mother was a regional advertising executive. Sally Sperry\u2019s rise from layout artist to advertising executive also made an impression on Chuck, who says he was inspired by her professional advancement during the 1960s and \u201970s in a male-dominated profession.<ref name=insiderock2010>\"The Chuck Sperry Interview and Poster Giveaway,\" November 16, 2010, https://insidetherockposterframe.blogspot.com/2010/11/chuck-sperry-interview-and-poster.html</ref>\n\n===Education===\n[[File:2017 Sperry Workshop.jpg|thumb|Chuck Sperry hosting a Schoolab Workshop with UC Berkeley & \u00c9cole Polytechnique Students. Oakland, CA. June, 2017]]\nDuring this period, Sperry attended art classes at the Living Arts Center in Dayton and the [[Dayton Art Institute]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> In 1980, Sperry enrolled at the [[University of Missouri]] in [[Columbia, Missouri|Columbia]], where he was a dual major in art and journalism.<ref name=\"sperryabout\" /> During his four years at MU, Sperry was an editorial cartoonist for the student newspaper, The Man Eater.<ref name=fwinterview2018>''Artist Interview: Chuck Sperry,\" by Elizabeth Goings, September 26, 2018, https://fwmoa.blog/2018/09/26/artist-interview-chuck-sperry/</ref> Briefly, he also contributed illustrations to the [[Columbia Daily Tribune]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nAt MU, Sperry was inspired by the dean of art school, [[Frank Stack]], whose work prefigured the [[underground comix]] of the late 1960s. In the late 1950s, Stack and cartoonist [[Gilbert Shelton]] had edited [[The Texas Ranger (magazine)|The Texas Ranger]] humor magazine at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. Later, while in the Army Reserve, Stack created satirical comics in his spare time, subsequently putting the best of these strips together as The Adventures of Jesus, considered by many to be America\u2019s first underground comic.<ref name=juxtapoz2018>''The Interweaving Worlds of Chuck Sperry,\" by Dasha Matsuura, March 29, 2018, https://www.juxtapoz.com/news/collectibles/the-interweaving-worlds-of-chuck-sperry/</ref>\n\nSperry was also influenced by Pulitzer Prize winning editorial cartoonist [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], who worked for the [[Dayton Daily News]] and was a friend of Sperry\u2019s parents. Thanks to that familial connection, Sperry sometimes visited Peters at his office in downtown Dayton, to show the editorial cartoonist portfolios of art, which Peters would critique.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\n==Career==\nAfter graduating from MU in 1984, Sperry stayed in Columbia for a year, during which he created his first [[punk-rock]] flyers and edited an underground newspaper called Java with musician Ann Wood.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nIn 1985, Sperry moved to the East Village in New York City, where he co-edited [[World War 3 Illustrated]] with [[Seth Tobocman]] and [[Peter Kuper]].<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> World War 3 Illustrated included work by [[Eric Drooker]], [[James Romberger]], Anton Van Dalen, [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[Sue Coe]], [[Art Spiegelman]], and Michael Roman.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\nIn 1989, Sperry moved to [[San Francisco]], where he eventually art directed and co-edited [https://library.civicmediacenter.org/collection/zine/weekly-weird-news-filth Weekly Weird News & Filth] with publisher Robert Collison; the newspaper had a circulation of 10,000 issues around the San Francisco Bay Area, and ran from 1991-1996. Sperry commissioned magazine covers and art from [[Robert Crumb]], [[Spain Rodriguez]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Paul Mavrides]], Hal Robbins, Rigo23, Mats Stromberg, [[Gary Grimshaw]], and many others.<ref name=\"juxtapoz2018\" />\n\nIn 1994, Sperry received his first commission from art director [https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/fillmore-art-director-retires-reframing-san-francisco-venues-famed-posters Arlene Owseichik] to create a [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] poster for Bill Graham Presents in San Francisco. (Since then, Sperry has designed scores of posters for the Fillmore, including F1000, the one-thousandth poster in the Fillmore series, a metallic poster for [[The Pretenders]].)<ref>{{cite web |title=Pretenders SF 09 Sperry - 1st |url=https://expressobeans.com/public/detail.php/99924 |website=Expresso Beans}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1994, Sperry joined [https://www.theeparkside.com/event/303637 Ron Donovan] and [https://orionlandau.tumblr.com/ Orion Landau] to found a rock-poster printing company called Psychic Sparkplug. Sperry, Donovan, and Landau were among the first modern rock-poster artists to use metallic gold and silver inks in the rock-poster genre.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" />\n\nThe next year, 1995, Gary Grimshaw commissioned Psychic Sparkplug to print his poster for an exhibition in [[Cleveland]] called Visual Jams, which was organized by rock-poster artist [[Derek Hess]] and coincided with the opening of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (Sperry\u2019s work is in Hall of Fame\u2019s collection).<ref name=spokesperry>\"Chuck Sperry\" page, https://spoke-art.com/collections/chuck-sperry</ref> Grimshaw invited Sperry, Donovan, and Landau to attend the event.<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> Other rock-poster attendees included [[Mark Arminski]], [[Coop (artist)|Coop]], Gary Grimshaw, Derek Hess, [[Frank Kozik]], Lindsey Kuhn, T.A.Z., [[Wes Wilson]], [[Stanley Mouse]], [[Lee Conklin]], [http://www.davidsinger.com/ David Singer], and [http://www.rtuten.com/ Randy Tuten].<ref>{{cite web |title=Visual Jams Poster |url=https://www.wolfgangs.com/posters/visual-jams/poster/POW950901.html |website=Wolfgang's Vault}}</ref>\n\nThat same year, Sperry, Grimshaw, and his wife, Laura, produced the first of two annual \u201cTemporary Insanity\u201d art shows at Off the Wall, a gallery on [[Haight Street]] in San Francisco, the first gallery exhibition in San Francisco of rock-poster art since the Joint Show at the Moore Gallery in 1967. Exhibiting artists included [[Victor Moscoso]], Frank Kozik, Coop, Gary Grimshaw, John Seabury, Psychic Sparkplug, Mark Arminski, Lindsey Kuhn, [[Emek]], Mats Stromberg, and Dennis Loren.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sperry |first1=Chuck |title=Temporary Insanity |url=http://www.rockpostercollector.com/TempInsane.html |website=RockPosterCollector.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Sperry worked with [https://clarionalleymuralproject.org/ Clarion Alley Mural Project (CAMP)] on two painted murals in collaboration with artists [[Barry McGee]], [[Ruby Neri]], [[Rigo 23]], Aaron Noble, [[Isis Rodriguez]], Susan Greene, John Fadeff, and many other artists representing San Francisco\u2019s [[Mission School]] Movement.\n\nBy 1997, Psychic Sparkplug had dissolved and reformed as the Firehouse Kustom Rockart Company,<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> which was run by Chuck Sperry and Ron Donovan until 2012. Initially located in an actual San Francisco Firehouse (complete with fire pole)<ref name=\"insiderock2010\" /> before relocating in Oakland, Firehouse designed and printed a series of posters for [[Virgin Megastore]] to promote record-release events and store openings. Many of these posters were die-cut to shape and promoted bands such as [[The Beatles]], [[The Rolling Stones]], Pearl Jam, [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[The Beastie Boys]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[U2]], and [[Limp Bizkit]], as well as performers such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. Over the course of 12 years, the Firehouse was also commissioned to design and print a series of posters for [[Eric Clapton]] and the musician\u2019s [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]].\n\nBeginning in 2008 and continuing until 2014, Sperry art directed nearly 200 posters for [[Goldenvoice]] Presents for its [[Warfield Theatre]] and Regency venues in San Francisco. During that period, Sperry designed and printed many of these posters himself, most notably an iconic poster for Bob Dylan and His Band, which performed at the Warfield on August 25, 2010.\n\nBy 2012, Sperry had severed his partnership with Ron Donovan and renamed the Firehouse, now in Oakland, Hangar 18. From that studio, Sperry has created designs for and printed hundreds of limited-edition posters for countless bands, including The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, [[The Who]], Eric Clapton, [[Dave Matthews]], U2, Madonna, Fleetwood Mac, Steve Miller, Smashing Pumpkins, The Beastie Boys, Pearl Jam, [[Soundgarden]], [[The Black Keys]], [[Nick Cave]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[Neko Case]], [[Mickey Hart]], [[Bob Weir]], [[Mumford and Sons]], [[Avett Brothers]], Widespread Panic, [[Greensky Bluegrass]], [[Twiddle (band)|Twiddle]], and [[Umphrey's McGee|Umphrey\u2019s McGee]].\n\nHangar 18 is also where Sperry prints his fine-art pieces on various types of paper and wood panel, usually oak, for exhibitions at [https://spoke-art.com/ Spoke Art] and [https://www.hashimotocontemporary.com/ Hashimoto Comtemporary] in San Francisco and [[New York City|New York]], [[Art Basel Miami]]/Context Art Miami, [https://www.loeilouvert.com/ L\u2019Oeil Ouvert Galerie] in [[Paris, France|Paris]], and [https://www.facebook.com/NextDoorGalleryGeneva/ Next Door Gallery] in [[Geneva]].\n\nIn 2018, the [[Fort Wayne Museum of Art]] presented \u201cAll Access: Exploring Humanism in the Art of Chuck Sperry,\u201d a solo exhibition that included screen-printed figurative artworks, drawings, brush-and-ink originals, ephemeral progressive studies, and three large format hand-woven tapestries.
