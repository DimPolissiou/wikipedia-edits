They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. However, ''B. pseudomallei'' often acquires resistance when this drug is used.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30&nbsp;mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200&nbsp;mg in children, 240/1200&nbsp;mg in adults weighing 40 to 60&nbsp;kg, and 320/1600&nbsp;mg in adults weighing more than 60&nbsp;kg, taken orally every 12 hours. In children, co-trimoxazole is taken together with [[folic acid]] (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg up to 5&nbsp;mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without involvement of internal organs or sepsis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Australia.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, [[arthrotomy]] washout and drainage is required. Surgical [[debridement]] may be necessary. For those with [[mycotic aneurysm]], urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Life-long therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because the majority of them can resolve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In Australia, prostate abscess may require routine imaging and drainage.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\n===Others===\nImmunomodulating therapies such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[Interleukin 7]], and anti-PDI ([[programmed cell death]]) could be useful in melioidosis treatment especially for those with septic shock. This is because these drugs could help to boost the human body immune function against the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIn well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nFor those with incomplete treatment, reppearance of symptoms after a period of disease [[cure|remission]] (\"[[recrudescence]]\") can occur. Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]].

The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells.\"<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' VIII, 547ff.</ref>  In sixteenth-century Italy, an aspect of the revival of Antiquity was the desire to recreate Classical spaces as extensions of the revived [[villa]].  Ovid's description of the cave of Achelous provided some specific inspiration to patrons in France as well as Italy for the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] garden [[grotto]], with its cool dampness, [[tuff]] vaulting and shellwork walls. The banquet served by Ovid's Achelous offered a prototype for Italian midday feasts in the fountain-cooled shade of garden grottoes.\n\nAt the mouth of the Achelous River lie the [[Echinades]] Islands. According to Ovid's pretty myth-making in the same ''Metamorphoses'' episode, the Echinades Islands were once five nymphs. Unfortunately for them, they forgot to honor Achelous in their festivities, and the god was so angry about this slight that he turned them into the islands.\n\nIn Hellenistic and Roman contexts, the river god was often reduced to a mask and used decoratively as an emblem of water, \"his uncut hair wreathed with reeds\".<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' ix.</ref> The feature survived in Romanesque carved details and flowered during the [[Middle Ages]] as one of the Classical prototypes of the [[Green Man]].\n\n==Iconography==\n[[Image:Annibale Fontana - Plaque with Hercules and Achelous - Walters 4171.jpg|thumb|The fight of Heracles and the river-god Achelous is depicted in this plaque by [[Annibale Fontana]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]] |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/21338 |title= Plaque with Hercules and Achelous }}</ref>]]\n\nThe contest of Achelous with Heracles was represented on the throne of [[Amyclae]],<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.18.16 3.18.16].</ref> and in the treasury of the [[Megara]]ns at [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] there was a statue of him made by [[Dontas]] of cedarwood and gold.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0525.tlg001.perseus-eng1:6.19.12 6.19.12].</ref> Achelous was sometimes depicted as a gray-haired old man or a vigorous bearded man in his prime, with a horned head and a serpent-like body.

Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\nIn the main lobby of Sesame Workshop, the Sesame Street Muppets in interactive frames featured [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]], [[Big Bird]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[The Bear family|Baby Bear]], [[Count von Count]], [[Murray Monster|Murray]], [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]], [[Abby Cadabby]], [[Grover]], Zoe, Telly, [[Oscar the Grouch]] and others.\n\nAt the main lobby, the characters from [[Sesame Street]] wear pajamas in interactive frames as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] (her purple doll), Telly (his doll Freddy) [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]] (Baby David), [[Abby Cadabby]] (Stuffed Frog Prince), Zoe (Mimi), [[Big Bird]] (Radar), [[Bert and Ernie]] (Rubber Duckie), [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Grover]] are singing a lullaby to [[Big Bird]] and go to sleep.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

They hired [[Evelyn Payne Davis]] from the [[Urban League]], whom Michael Davis called \"remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable\",<ref>Davis, p. 154</ref> as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and manager of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.<ref name=\"lesser-39\" /> Bob Hatch was hired to publicize their new series, both before its premiere and to take advantage of the media attention concerning ''Sesame Street'' during its first year of production.<ref>Lesser, p. 40</ref>\n\nAccording to Davis, despite her involvement with the project's initial research and development, Cooney's installment as CTW's executive director was questionable due to her lack of executive experience, untested financial management skills, and lack of experience with children's television and education. Davis also speculated that sexism was involved, stating, \"Doubters also questioned whether a woman could gain the full confidence of a quorum of men from the federal government and two elite philanthropies, institutions whose wealth exceeded the gross national product of entire countries\".<ref>Davis, p. 124</ref> At first, Cooney did not fight for the position. However she had the help of her husband and Morrisett, and the project's investors soon realized they could not begin without her. She was eventually named to the post in February 1968.

''[[3-2-1 Contact]]'' premiered in 1980, and were broadcast in various forms until 1988.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.  Immediately after its premiere, ''Sesame Street ''gained attention from marketers,<ref name=\"davis-203\" /> so the Workshop explored sources such as licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales, and became, as Cooney envisioned, a \"multiple media institution\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\">Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 197</ref> Licensing became the foundation of, as writer Louise Gikow stated, the Sesame Workshop endowment,<ref name=\"gikow-268\">Gikow, p. 268</ref> which had the potential to fund the organization and future productions and projects.<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> Muppet creator [[Jim Henson]] owned the trademarks to the [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppet characters]]: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control of all products and product decisions throughout its history; any product line associated with the series had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during broadcastings of ''Sesame Street''.<ref>Davis, pp. 203\u2013205</ref> As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.<ref>Davis, p. 204</ref> In the early 1970s, the CTW negotiated with the company [[Random House]] to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division.

Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/> and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, \"the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\" /> In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was featured in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published soon after the series featured it in 1983.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210</ref>  In 2019, ''Parade Magazine'' reported that 20 million copies of ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book: Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover|The Monster at the End of the Book]]'' and ''Another Monster at the End of this Book'' had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold.<ref name=\"wallace\"/>  Its [[YouTube]] channel had almost 5 million subscribers.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}\n\nAccording to director Jon Stone, the music of ''Sesame Street'' was unlike any other children's program on television.<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref> For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref> Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\",<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17</ref> so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\n\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\".<ref name=\"davis-256\">Davis, p. 256</ref> Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.<ref name=\"davis-256\"/> Songwriters of note were [[Joe Raposo]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[Christopher Cerf (producer)|Christopher Cerf]], [[Tony Geiss]], and [[Norman Stiles]].

Television producer [[Joan Ganz Cooney]] and foundation executive [[Lloyd Morrisett]] developed the idea to form an organization to produce ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a television series which would help children, especially those from low-income families, prepare for school. They spent two years, from 1966 to 1968, researching, developing, and raising money for the new series. Cooney was named as the Workshop's first executive director, which was termed \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\".<ref name=\"davis125126\" />\n\n''Sesame Street'' premiered as a series on [[National Educational Television]] (NET) in the United States on November 10, 1969, and moved to NET's successor, the Public Broadcasting Service ([[PBS]]), in late 1970. The Workshop was formally incorporated in 1970. [[Gerald S. Lesser]] and [[Edward L. Palmer]] were hired to perform research for the series; they were responsible for developing a system of planning, production, and evaluation, and the interaction between television producers and educators, later termed the \"CTW model\". They also hired a staff of producers and writers. After the initial success of ''Sesame Street'', they began to plan for its continued survival, which included procuring additional sources of funding and creating other television series. The early 1980s were a challenging period for the Workshop; difficulty finding audiences for their other productions and a series of bad investments harmed the organization until licensing agreements stabilized its revenues by 1985.\n\nAfter ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s initial success, the CTW began to think about its survival beyond the development and first season of the show, since their funding sources were composed of organizations and institutions that tended to start projects, not sustain them. Government funding ended by 1981, so the CTW developed other activities, including unsuccessful ventures into adult programs, the publications of books and music, international co-productions, interactive media and new technologies, licensing arrangements, and programs for preschools. By 2005, income from the CTW's international co-productions of the series was $96 million. By 2008, the ''Sesame Street'' [[List of Sesame Street Muppets|Muppets]] accounted for $15\u201317 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees. Cooney resigned as CEO in 1990; David Britt was named as her replacement.\n\nOn June 5, 2000, the CTW changed its name to Sesame Workshop<ref>http://www.sesameworkshop.org/about-us/leadership-team/joan-ganz-cooney/</ref> to better represent its activities beyond television, and [[Gary Knell]] became CEO. [[H. Melvin Ming]] replaced Knell in 2011. In 2014, Ming was succeeded by Jeffrey D. Dunn.\n\nIn the main lobby of Sesame Workshop, the Sesame Street Muppets in interactive frames featured [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]], [[Big Bird]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[Ernie (Sesame Street)|Ernie]], [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]], [[Cookie Monster]], [[The Bear family|Baby Bear]], [[Count von Count]], [[Murray Monster|Murray]], [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]], [[Abby Cadabby]], [[Grover]], Zoe, Telly, [[Oscar the Grouch]] and others.\n\nAt the main lobby, the characters from [[Sesame Street]] wear pajamas as [[Rosita (Sesame Street)|Rosita]] (her purple doll), [[Telly]] (his doll Freddy) [[Elmo (Sesame Street)|Elmo]] (Baby David), [[Abby Cadabby]] (Stuffed Frog Prince), [[Zoe (Sesame Street)|Zoe]] (Mimi), [[Big Bird]] (Radar), [[Bert and Ernie]] (Rubber Duckie), [[Cookie Monster]] and [[Grover]] are singing a lullaby to [[Big Bird]] and go to sleep.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nDuring the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hellman | first = Peter | title = Street Smart: How Big Bird & Company Do It | journal = New York Magazine | volume = 20 | issue = 46 | page = 52 | date = 23 November 1987 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=KOUCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48&vq=sesame+street&q=sesame%20street | issn = 0028-7369 | accessdate = 18 November 2019}}</ref> Early childhood educational research at the time had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned better grades and learned more effectively.

Eventually, the CTW got its own line item in the federal budget.<ref>Davis, pp. 218\u2013219</ref>  By 2019, the U.S. government donated about four percent of the Workshop's budget, or less than $5 million a year.<ref name=\"guthrie2\"/>\n\n[[File:Jim Henson (1989).jpg|left|thumb|upright|alt=A tall, thin man in his early fifties, with salty-gray hair and a full beard, and wearing a tuxedo.|[[Jim Henson]], creator of [[the Muppets]], in 1989]]\n\nFor the first time, a public broadcasting series had the potential to earn a great deal of money.

The Workshop decided that all materials its licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\"<ref name=\"davis-205\" /> the series' curriculum. Coloring books, for example, were prohibited because the Workshop felt they would restrict children's imaginations.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> The CTW published ''Sesame Street Magazine'' in 1970, which incorporated the show's curriculum goals in a magazine format.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 198</ref> As with the series, research was performed for the magazine, initially by CTW's research department for a year and a half, and then by the Magazine Research Group in 1975.<ref name=\"cherow-197\" />\n\nWorking with [[Random House]] editor Jason Epstein, the CTW hired Christopher Cerf to manage ''Sesame Street''{{'}}s book publishing program.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /><ref name=\"davis-205\" /> During the division's first year, Cerf earned $900,000 for the CTW. He quit to become more involved with writing and composing music for the series,<ref>Davis, p. 206</ref> and was replaced eventually by Bill Whaley. Ann Kearns, vice president of licensing for the CTW in 2000, stated that Whaley was responsible for expanding the licensing to other products, and for creating a licensing model used by other children's series.<ref name=\"gikow-268\" /> As of 2019, the Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/> and as researcher Renee Cherow-O'Leary stated in 2001, \"the print materials produced by CTW have been an enduring part of the legacy of Sesame Street\".<ref name=\"cherow-197\" /> In one of these books, for example, the death of the ''Sesame Street'' character [[Mr. Hooper]] was featured in a book entitled ''I'll Miss You, Mr. Hooper'', published soon after the series featured it in 1983.<ref>Cherow-O'Leary in Fisch & Truglio, p. 210</ref>  In 2019, ''Parade Magazine'' reported that 20 million copies of ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book: Starring Lovable, Furry Old Grover|The Monster at the End of the Book]]'' and ''Another Monster at the End of this Book'' had been sold, making them the top two best-selling e-books sold.<ref name=\"wallace\"/>  Its [[YouTube]] channel had almost 5 million subscribers.<ref name=\"guthrie\"/>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Sesame Street}}\n\nAccording to director Jon Stone, the music of ''Sesame Street'' was unlike any other children's program on television.<ref>Gikow, p. 220</ref> For the first time, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and was related to its curriculum.<ref>Gikow, p. 227</ref> Cooney observed in her initial report that children had an \"affinity for commercial jingles\",<ref>Palmer & Fisch in Fisch & Truglio, p. 17</ref> so many of the show's songs were like television advertisements.\n\nTo attract the best composers and lyricists, and to encourage them to compose more music for the series, the CTW allowed songwriters to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. For the first time in children's television, the writers earned lucrative profits, which as Davis reported, \"helped the show sustain the level of public interest in the show\".<ref name=\"davis-256\">Davis, p. 256</ref> Scriptwriters often wrote their own lyrics to accompany their scripts.<ref name=\"davis-256\"/> Songwriters of note were [[Joe Raposo]], [[Jeff Moss]], [[Christopher Cerf (producer)|Christopher Cerf]], [[Tony Geiss]], and [[Norman Stiles]].

He was born either in 1943 or 1945. It was claimed that he wrestled his last match around October 20, 1980. Some believed he died in 1980 or 1982. His Social Security Death Index listed as being born on December 14, 1941 and dying September 1980 (no exact day given, as is common with older dates of death). It was issued in Missouri. He apparently started in NWA-affiliated territories, which was headquartered in Missouri. That might account for Missouri being the state of issuance. One newspaper account (name and date unclear) from 1970 said that he was 28 years old. His having come over earlier in the year, and his birthdate apparently being in December is in line with the Social Security name and dates. His last newspaper listing was in an advertised bout in the September 2 Paris (Texas) News. There is no indication whether or not he actually made the match advertised in the bout, and his name disappeared in newspaper archives after that date. This is also in line with the September 1980 date of death. Some say he died in April 1982 and another source said January 1984. </ref><ref name=OWOW>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/p/pak-song/|title=Pak Song Profile|accessdate=2007-07-13|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>) was a Korean [[professional wrestler]] who appeared primarily under the name '''Pak Song'''.
