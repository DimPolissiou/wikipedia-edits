The film went on to gross more than any of Baumbach's previous films at the US box office.\n\n==Plot==\nMiddle-aged couple Josh and Cornelia Schrebnick have a shaky relationship while living in New York City. Josh is struggling on the post-production of his documentary film about leftist intellectual Ira Mandelstam. His previous documentary about the [[military-industrial complex]], titled ''The Power Elite'', was based on [[C. Wright Mills]]'s sociological theory.  After finishing a lecture at the college where he works, Josh is approached by Jamie and Darby Massey, a young couple who invite him and Cornelia out to dinner. Jamie claims to be a fan of both his works and the works of his accomplished documentary filmmaker father-in-law, Leslie Breitbart. Josh is immediately awestruck by Jamie and Darby's non-conservative outlook on life, and he and Cornelia begin spending time with them and joining in their activities.\n\nAn aspiring filmmaker himself, Jamie talks with Josh about their projects, including Josh's own documentary. This inspires Jamie to make a film about connecting with an old high school friend that he found on Facebook. Jamie and Darby invite Josh and Cornelia to an [[ayahuasca]] ceremony where a hallucinating Cornelia kisses Jamie while Jamie receives Josh's approval in helping with the production of his film. Later, Cornelia agrees to help produce the film. Jamie and Josh manage to find the old friend, Kent Arlington, who is in the hospital after a suicide attempt. Josh and Jamie discover that Kent was involved with a massacre during an Army tour in Afghanistan, creating an even bigger story for Jamie's film.\n\nWhile pitching his own film, Josh is dismayed when he cannot engage a [[hedge fund]] investor with the concept of his vague and confusing feature. Josh goes to Leslie for a second opinion. When Leslie's criticisms and suggestions are brought down by Josh, the two get into an argument over Josh and Cornelia's inability to have children, as well as Josh calling himself a disappointment in the eyes of his father-in-law. Josh then attends a party for a screening of Jamie's film, which is met far more positively by Leslie and the hedge fund investor. A jealous Josh argues with Cornelia over Jamie's success, and they separate. Josh meets up with Darby, who is growing sick of Jamie's increasingly self-centered attitude and tells him about Cornelia kissing Jamie. Josh confronts Cornelia the next morning and denounces Jamie.\n\nWhile teaming up with his editor on cutting his film, Josh comes across footage for Jamie's film, finding evidence in it that suggests his meeting with Kent was all staged. Finding him, Kent reveals that he was really friends with Darby, not Jamie, and that he was contacted by Jamie weeks before their shoot. Capturing his confession on camera, Josh goes to Jamie and Darby to confront him only to discover that a fed-up Darby is moving out and that Jamie is at a tribute celebrating Leslie at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]].\n\nJosh confronts Jamie in private at the event, admonishing him for compromising the truth and genuineness of his story for dramatic purposes. When Josh forces Jamie to admit to it in front of Leslie, he excuses it, saying that it's a good story regardless of the fabrication. This throws Josh into a rage, but not before admitting that Leslie was right about changing his film. Outside, Josh and Cornelia reconcile.\n\nOne year later, Josh and Cornelia are driving to the airport to adopt a baby from Haiti. Josh finds an article in a magazine lauding Jamie as a filmmaking genius, which Cornelia and Josh pass off by admitting, \"He's not evil, he's just young.\" They then watch a very young child at the gate playing with an [[iPhone]], staring at him with uncertainty.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Josh Schrebnick\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Cornelia Schrebnick (n\u00e9e Breitbart) \n* [[Adam Driver]] as Jamie Massey\n* [[Amanda Seyfried]] as Darby Massey\n* [[Charles Grodin]] as Leslie Breitbart\n* [[Ad-Rock|Adam Horovitz]] as Fletcher\n* [[Maria Dizzia]] as Marina\n* [[Dree Hemingway]] as Tipper\n* [[Brady Corbet]] as Kent Arlington\n* [[Matthew Maher (actor)|Matthew Maher]] as Tim\n* [[Ryan Serhant]] as Hedge Fund Dave\n* [[Peter Yarrow]] as Ira Mandelstam\n* [[Matthew Shear]] as Benny\n* [[James Saito]] as Dr. Nagato\n}}\n\n[[Peter Bogdanovich]] appears as an MC at an event celebrating Leslie Breitbart, and [[Greta Lee]] voices a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance]] interviewer.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was spotted shooting on September 17, 2013 in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news|date=September 18, 2013|title=\u2018While We\u2019re Young\u2019, starring Ben Stiller, filming in NYC|url=http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2013/09/18/while-were-young-starring-ben-stiller-filming-in-nyc/|website=onlocationvacations.com|accessdate=19 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] was composed by [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LCD Soundsystem\u2019s James Murphy Scoring Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u2018While We\u2019re Young\u2019|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2014/07/22/lcd-soundsystems-james-murphy-scoring-noah-baumbachs-while-were-young/|accessdate=August 1, 2014|publisher=filmmusicreporter.com|date=July 22, 2014}}</ref>\n\n# \"Golden Years\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"Concerto for Lute, 2 Violins and Continuo in D, RV. 93\" \u2013 [[Antonio Vivaldi]]\n# \"[[All Night Long (All Night)]]\"\u2013 [[Lionel Richie]]\n# \"Buggin' Out\" \u2013 [[A Tribe Called Quest]]\n# \"[[The Ghost in You]]\" \u2013 [[The Psychedelic Furs]]\n# \"The Inch Worm\" \u2013 [[Danny Kaye]]\n# \"Only the Stars Above Welcome Me Home\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"[[Falling (Haim song)|Falling (Duke Dumont Remix)]]\" \u2013 [[Haim]]\n# \"[[Eye of the Tiger]]\" \u2013 [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]]\n# \"Andante du Concerto Pour Flautino en ut Majeur\" (from the MGM film ''The Wild Child'') \u2013 [[Antonio Vivaldi]]\n# \"[[Waiting for a Girl Like You]]\" \u2013 [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]\n# \"[[Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five]]\" \u2013 [[Wings|Paul McCartney & Wings]]\n# \"We Used to Dance\" \u2013 [[James Murphy (electronic musician)|James Murphy]]\n# \"[[Golden Years (song)|Golden Years]]\" \u2013 [[David Bowie]]\n\n==Release==\nThe film premiered at the [[2014 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 6, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/were-young-toronto-review-730802|title='While We're Young': Toronto Review|author=Todd McCarthy|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}</ref> Shortly after, [[A24 (company)|A24]] acquired distribution rights to the film for $4 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2014/09/toronto-a24-4-million-deal-while-were-young-831421/|title=Toronto: A24 In $4 Million U.S. Deal For Noah Baumbach\u2019s \u2018While We\u2019re Young\u2019|publisher=Deadline.com|first=Mike|last=Fleming Jr|date=September 8, 2014|accessdate=January 25, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nThe film opened in [[limited release]] on March 27, 2015 and earned $227,688, ranking number 24 in the box office that weekend.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2015&wknd=13&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for March 27-29, 2015 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=March 30, 2015 | accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref> On April 17, the film was given a [[wide release]] and grossed $1,438,384, ranking number 12.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2015&wknd=16&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for April 17-19, 2015 | work=Box Office Mojo | publisher=Internet Movie Database | date=April 20, 2015 | accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref> The film eventually grossed $7,587,485 domestically, more than all of Baumbach's previous films in the United States box office.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n===Critical response===\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 84%, based on 204 reviews, with an average rating of 7.32/10.

Plastering fliers of her face around the city, Wren's a precursor of the \"[[famous for being famous]]\" personalities of the Internet age. Seidelman says that Wren's story \"is about something broader: the fragmented nature of life in the 80's. It could have taken place in other settings.\"<ref name=lemire2013 /><ref>Insdorf, Annette.

The members of a bereavement group experience classic romantic-comedy scenarios\u2014awkward first dates, sexual insecurity, miscommunication and misunderstandings\u2014after losing longtime partners. Seidelman had not seen older baby boomers dealing with loss, grief and romance in films and set out to create modern seniors without stereotyping.<ref name=BoyntonBeachClub />\n\nFurther genre mixing is evident in ''Making Mr Right'', which combines sci-fi with romance among an android, his maker, and a successful career woman whose job is to teach the android about emotions. ''Gaudi Afternoon'' blends the detective mystery with family drama. ''The Hot Flashes'' is an against-all-odds sports film with middle-aged underdogs going up against youthful champions.\n\n===Identity and self-actualization===\nAppearances and what they reveal and conceal is a recurring theme in Seidelman's films, along with how women rebel against or create a place for themselves within society's expectations.\n\nRoberta in ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' takes on Susan's mysterious and troublesome identity when she wears her clothes. Devoid of her usual suburban-housewife wardrobe and suffering from amnesia, Roberta embarks on an urban adventure by \"trying on\" the free-spirited persona of Susan.

In contrast, her suburban home is presented in cool pastels and hard edges\u2014an atmosphere where social mores and false fronts are more rigidly enforced. Performing as a magician's assistant, where costume and artifice is a requirement, she hones her survival skills that lead to personal satisfaction on and off the stage.\n\n''Smithereens'' explored the same colorful downtown scene, but with more grit and squalor, reflecting its low-budget independent production. Wren has more desire than creative skill, but like [[Giulietta Masina]]'s character in [[Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'', whom Seidelman notes as an inspiration, she's a survivor and her wish for recognition within the local punk-rock scene is presented without judgment.<ref name=lemire2013 />\n\nA magic club is also a feature of ''Gaud\u00ed Afternoon'' where asexual Cassandra, through her attraction to openly bisexual Hamilton\u2014an amateur magician\u2014acknowledges her own sexual awareness.

''Gaudi Afternoon'' blends the detective mystery with family drama. ''The Hot Flashes'' is an against-all-odds sports film with middle-aged underdogs going up against youthful champions.\n\n===Identity and self-actualization===\nAppearances and what they reveal and conceal is a recurring theme in Seidelman's films, along with how women rebel against or create a place for themselves within society's expectations.\n\nRoberta in ''Desperately Seeking Susan'' takes on Susan's mysterious and troublesome identity when she wears her clothes. Devoid of her usual suburban-housewife wardrobe and suffering from amnesia, Roberta embarks on an urban adventure by \"trying on\" the free-spirited persona of Susan.

Performing as a magician's assistant, where costume and artifice is a requirement, she hones her survival skills that lead to personal satisfaction on and off the stage.\n\n''Smithereens'' explored the same colorful downtown scene, but with more grit and squalor, reflecting its low-budget independent production. Wren has more desire than creative skill, but like [[Giulietta Masina]]'s character in [[Fellini]]'s ''[[Nights of Cabiria]]'', whom Seidelman notes as an inspiration, she's a survivor and her wish for recognition within the local punk-rock scene is presented without judgment.<ref name=lemire2013 />\n\nA magic club is also a feature of ''Gaud\u00ed Afternoon'' where asexual Cassandra, through her attraction to openly bisexual Hamilton\u2014an amateur magician\u2014acknowledges her own sexual awareness.
