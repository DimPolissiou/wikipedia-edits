The muons are cooled into a denser cloud by being directed through specially designed energy-absorbing materials while the beam is tightly focused by powerful superconducting magnetic lenses and can then be accelerated by a normal particle accelerator in a precise direction. This technique may allow the construction of a [[muon collider]]. Cooling the muons beams is crucial to achieve a high collision rate.<ref>{{cite news |title=World's most powerful particle accelerator one big step closer |url=https://phys.org/news/2020-02-world-powerful-particle-big-closer.html |website=phys.org |accessdate=8 March 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Garisto |first1=Daniel |title=MICE Cold: Collaboration Demonstrates Muon Ionization Cooling |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mice-cold-collaboration-demonstrates-muon-ionization-cooling/ |website=Scientific American |accessdate=8 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bogomilov |first1=M. |last2=Tsenov |first2=R. |last3=Vankova-Kirilova |first3=G. |last4=Song |first4=Y.

Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.

Rats stopped choosing candy they preferred over other candy when it meant hurting an unfamiliar, neighbour rat. Reducing brain activity in the ACC by injecting a local anesthetic reversed this behaviour. Moreover, they showed that their harm aversion can be limited as most rats, which previously switched to the less-preferred candy to avoid harm to their neighbours, stopped doing so when offered a choice between one and three candies. Their experiments may show that the [[morality|moral]] motivation that keeps humans from harming other humans has old evolutionary origins and is shared to some degree with other animals. They also suggest some level of [[personality]] in rats as they showed a wide range of variable responses in the experiment \u2013 including indifference and not choosing any of the two levers after the first electric shock was registered.
