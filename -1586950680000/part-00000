Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of [[Tenterground]] at [[Spitalfields]], [[London]]. Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"}}{{r|Location of Tenterground}}.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.{{r|\"CW:49\"}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

Published originally in 2016, it was translated from Arabic into English February 12, 2019 by Leri Price. The story is set in Syria as three siblings--Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima-- journey to complete their dead father's final wish of being buried next to his sister, Layla, in their hometown of Anabiya. The normally short drive turns into a few days' journey full of stress and violence as they must travel through warring territory with constant checkpoints they are stopped at. \n\nThe novel was one of the finalists of the [[National Book Award|National Book Awards]] and has been notably reviewed by numerous sources like the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Kirkus Reviews]],'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/deathishardwork/khaledkhalifa/9780374135737|title=Death Is Hard Work {{!}} Khaled Khalifa {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Background ==\nThe Syrian novel, ''Death is Hard Work'', was written in light of the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] (2011-current). At this point, the Syrian civil war set a nation against itself. Chemical weapons were used to subdue the general population, sowing more distrust among an already-shattered nation. Multiple military sectors competed for the upper hand, making civilian life dangerous as towns and roads became war zones. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/meast/syria-civil-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Syrian Civil War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

The medical condition left him temporarily bed-bound in a hospital where he reflected, with the constant noise of bombs bursting in the background, on what would soon bring his novel to life. The question of what would happen to his body if he were to die during this wartime concerned him, and so he wrote on a familial conflict regarding a corpse needing burial within a war zone. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-author-khaled-khalifa-on-latest-novel-about-%e2%80%98fear-in-all-its-manifestations%e2%80%99/|title=Syrian author Khaled Khalifa on latest novel about \u2018fear, in all its manifestations\u2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Syria Direct|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nConsiderable parallels are seen between the war in ''Death is Hard Work'' and the current Syrian civil war, as both show how war affects normal life.

With his children Bolbol, Hussien, and Fatima crowded around, Abdel reveals his dying wish to be buried beside his sister Layla in his hometown of Anabiya. Bolbol steps up in front of his family and pledges to honor his father's wishes, regardless of the troubles that he may encounter along the way.\n\nAfter his father's death, Bolbol sets out with his siblings to cross Syria with Abdel's corpse in tow. This journey proves to be more complex than originally thought; with the addition of military checkpoints every few miles, a few hours journey is turned into a days-long odyssey.\n\nAt the first of many military checkpoints, the guards recognize Abdel's corpse, and set out to have his dead body arrested for crimes against the regime. After much discussion with many guards, Bolbol manages to bribe the dead man's way to freedom, allowing the group to continue their voyage. As similar events continue to occur with each passing checkpoint, Bolbol contemplates how easy this journey would be if only they were transporting sacks of cumin rather than a dead body. This leads Bolbol to reminiscence on his past, recalling particular details of his youth, such as the neighborhood he grew up in, and the practical effects of being raised during wartime.\n\nAfter calling in a favor, the group stops at  Bolbol's childhood friend, Lamia's, house after dropping Abdel's body off in the local morgue for the night. Over the course of their stay, Lamia and her husband, Zuhayr, offer to help the group pass the next few checkpoints with relative ease, due to Zuhayr's family connections to the regime. It is also revealed that Lamia used to be an object of Bolbol's obsession, but their relationship was never directly addressed. Bolbol spends the night longing for the old days, when he was in love with Lamia. This leads directly into Bolbol recounting an old story regarding the relationship between Abdel and his wife, Navine, particularly from when they met, to when they got married.\n\nWith the corpse rapidly decaying, the guards at each checkpoint being to provide leniency  to the group more readily, allowing them swifter passage just to be rid of the sight. After the group passes a man's half-eaten corpse, an argument breaks out between Bolbol and Hussein about how easy it would be to simply leave their father's corpse there to be eaten by wolves, and no one would be the wiser. This leads Bolbol to provide backstory on Hussein, explaining his tendencies to overreact and lash out at loved ones, and his long history of causing trouble with family. Meanwhile, the corpse's decay has gotten to the point where the scent can no longer be masked with cologne.\n\nAfter stopping for the night in their van, the group is attacked by wild dogs after the scent of the corpse, leaving the siblings panicked and increasingly on-edge. At the peak of this panic, Hussein picks a fight with Bolbol, who goes down quite easily with a few punches. The stress of their journey has begun to break the siblings, as they all resolve to sob in silence for the night.\n\nAfter passing through several more checkpoints, the group is stopped by an extremist group, who end up withholding passage from Bolbol until he completes a \"religious reeducation course.\" Left with no other choice, Hussein and Fatima continue on without Bolbol, even more determined to reach Anabiya now that the corpse shows signs of maggot infestation. The two siblings reach Anabiya before sundown, and meet with a cousin of theirs: the only surviving relative in the village. Plans are made to bury the body at morning prayer. Bolbol arrives at the village and rejoins his siblings without a word. That night, each sibling reflects on how little they desire to see each other after the burial.\n\nAfter the burial, Bolbol resolves to be addressed only by his original name, Nabil. Fatima has gone mute from the shock of the journey. Hussein quite uncharacteristically keeps to himself. The siblings begin their journey home, and each show a large degree of relief as they pass through the checkpoints with ease, now that they are not in possession of their father's corpse. Hussein and Fatima drop Bolbol off at his neighborhood in Damascus, and leave without exchanging words. Bolbol contemplates how his house smells of his father's corpse, and how he wants his face to melt under the hot water like his father's corpse had melted away in rot.\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Main Characters ===\n\n*'''Abdel Latif al-Salim''' \u2013 Father of Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima, husband to Navine.

Published originally in 2016, it was translated from Arabic into English February 12, 2019 by Leri Price. The story is set in Syria as three siblings--Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima-- journey to complete their dead father's final wish of being buried next to his sister, Layla, in their hometown of Anabiya. The normally short drive turns into a few days' journey full of stress and violence as they must travel through warring territory with constant checkpoints they are stopped at. \n\nThe novel was one of the finalists of the [[National Book Award|National Book Awards]] and has been notably reviewed by numerous sources like the ''[[The Wall Street Journal]], [[Kirkus Reviews]],'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times|The Los Angeles Times]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.macmillan.com/deathishardwork/khaledkhalifa/9780374135737|title=Death Is Hard Work {{!}} Khaled Khalifa {{!}} Macmillan|website=US Macmillan|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  \n\n== Background ==\nThe Syrian novel, ''Death is Hard Work'', was written in light of the ongoing [[Syrian civil war]] (2011-current). At this point, the Syrian civil war set a nation against itself. Chemical weapons were used to subdue the general population, sowing more distrust among an already-shattered nation. Multiple military sectors competed for the upper hand, making civilian life dangerous as towns and roads became war zones. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2013/08/27/world/meast/syria-civil-war-fast-facts/index.html|title=Syrian Civil War Fast Facts|last=Library|first=C.

The medical condition left him temporarily bed-bound in a hospital where he reflected, with the constant noise of bombs bursting in the background, on what would soon bring his novel to life. The question of what would happen to his body if he were to die during this wartime concerned him, and so he wrote on a familial conflict regarding a corpse needing burial within a war zone. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://syriadirect.org/news/syrian-author-khaled-khalifa-on-latest-novel-about-%e2%80%98fear-in-all-its-manifestations%e2%80%99/|title=Syrian author Khaled Khalifa on latest novel about \u2018fear, in all its manifestations\u2019|last=|first=|date=|website=Syria Direct|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nConsiderable parallels are seen between the war in ''Death is Hard Work'' and the current Syrian civil war, as both show how war affects normal life.

With his children Bolbol, Hussien, and Fatima crowded around, Abdel reveals his dying wish to be buried beside his sister Layla in his hometown of Anabiya. Bolbol steps up in front of his family and pledges to honor his father's wishes, regardless of the troubles that he may encounter along the way.\n\nAfter his father's death, Bolbol sets out with his siblings to cross Syria with Abdel's corpse in tow. This journey proves to be more complex than originally thought; with the addition of military checkpoints every few miles, a few hours journey is turned into a days-long odyssey.\n\nAt the first of many military checkpoints, the guards recognize Abdel's corpse, and set out to have his dead body arrested for crimes against the regime. After much discussion with many guards, Bolbol manages to bribe the dead man's way to freedom, allowing the group to continue their voyage. As similar events continue to occur with each passing checkpoint, Bolbol contemplates how easy this journey would be if only they were transporting sacks of cumin rather than a dead body. This leads Bolbol to reminiscence on his past, recalling particular details of his youth, such as the neighborhood he grew up in, and the practical effects of being raised during wartime.\n\nAfter calling in a favor, the group stops at  Bolbol's childhood friend, Lamia's, house after dropping Abdel's body off in the local morgue for the night. Over the course of their stay, Lamia and her husband, Zuhayr, offer to help the group pass the next few checkpoints with relative ease, due to Zuhayr's family connections to the regime. It is also revealed that Lamia used to be an object of Bolbol's obsession, but their relationship was never directly addressed. Bolbol spends the night longing for the old days, when he was in love with Lamia. This leads directly into Bolbol recounting an old story regarding the relationship between Abdel and his wife, Navine, particularly from when they met, to when they got married.\n\nWith the corpse rapidly decaying, the guards at each checkpoint being to provide leniency  to the group more readily, allowing them swifter passage just to be rid of the sight. After the group passes a man's half-eaten corpse, an argument breaks out between Bolbol and Hussein about how easy it would be to simply leave their father's corpse there to be eaten by wolves, and no one would be the wiser. This leads Bolbol to provide backstory on Hussein, explaining his tendencies to overreact and lash out at loved ones, and his long history of causing trouble with family. Meanwhile, the corpse's decay has gotten to the point where the scent can no longer be masked with cologne.\n\nAfter stopping for the night in their van, the group is attacked by wild dogs after the scent of the corpse, leaving the siblings panicked and increasingly on-edge. At the peak of this panic, Hussein picks a fight with Bolbol, who goes down quite easily with a few punches. The stress of their journey has begun to break the siblings, as they all resolve to sob in silence for the night.\n\nAfter passing through several more checkpoints, the group is stopped by an extremist group, who end up withholding passage from Bolbol until he completes a \"religious reeducation course.\" Left with no other choice, Hussein and Fatima continue on without Bolbol, even more determined to reach Anabiya now that the corpse shows signs of maggot infestation. The two siblings reach Anabiya before sundown, and meet with a cousin of theirs: the only surviving relative in the village. Plans are made to bury the body at morning prayer. Bolbol arrives at the village and rejoins his siblings without a word. That night, each sibling reflects on how little they desire to see each other after the burial.\n\nAfter the burial, Bolbol resolves to be addressed only by his original name, Nabil. Fatima has gone mute from the shock of the journey. Hussein quite uncharacteristically keeps to himself. The siblings begin their journey home, and each show a large degree of relief as they pass through the checkpoints with ease, now that they are not in possession of their father's corpse. Hussein and Fatima drop Bolbol off at his neighborhood in Damascus, and leave without exchanging words. Bolbol contemplates how his house smells of his father's corpse, and how he wants his face to melt under the hot water like his father's corpse had melted away in rot.\n\n== Characters ==\n=== Main Characters ===\n\n*'''Abdel Latif al-Salim''' \u2013 Father of Bolbol, Hussein, and Fatima, husband to Navine.

It neighbours [[Hatfield College]] to its north, while [[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]] and [[St Cuthbert's Society]] are to its south. The college is named after [[Chad of Mercia|St Chad]] of [[Mercia]], a 7th-century bishop.\n\nAlthough it is the smallest of Durham's colleges in terms of student numbers (in 2018\u201319, the college had 409 undergraduates and 150 active postgraduates),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/student.registry/statistics/summary/1.9ttaccom/181-9.pdf|title=Term-Time Accommodation|date=2018|website=Durham University|access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> it has the largest staff, extensive college library facilities, and among the highest undergraduate academic results in Durham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/spa/statistics/ |title=Comparison stats re percent of first and upper second results over recent years.

He was supported by lady of the manor [[Julia Warde-Aldam]], who in 1903 funded a dedicated building for the hostel in Hooton Pagnell.<ref name='wardealdam'>{{cite journal|journal=The Chadsian|pages=22\u201326|issue=2018|title=St Chad's Other Founder|url=https://issuu.com/stchadscollege/docs/chadsian_2018}}</ref>\n\nThe further financial support of [[Douglas Horsfall]], a wealthy [[Liverpool]] businessman and devoted churchman (who also funded the building of several large [[Anglo-Catholic]] churches in his home city), made it possible in 1904 to establish a hall at [[Durham University]] as a sister institution to the Hooton Pagnell hostel, to allow students to read for university degrees alongside training for ordination. Durham University had a provision in its statutes to recognise independent colleges, permitting students to matriculate through those institutions and then to sit for Durham exams.\n\n[[File:1 South Bailey.jpg|thumb|1 South Bailey, the first home of St Chad's Hall in Durham. The college's second building, 28 North Bailey, is on the left.

In 1909, a small wooden chapel was constructed behind the South Bailey buildings, and dedicated by the Bishop of Jarrow.<ref name='whiting' />\n\nThe Durham hall and Hooton Pagnell hostel continued to operate in partnership, with students studying for a year at the hostel before moving to the hall to complete their studies, until 1916 when the Hooton Pagnell building was requisitioned as a war hospital and all teaching was moved to Durham. The hostel building was returned after the war, and re-opened for a short time, but the financial problems of running in two locations led to the hostel finally closing in 1921.<ref name='wardealdam' />\n\n=== St Chad's College ===\n\nIn 1918, after the college had established a number of endowed fellowships, the university recognised St Chad's as the university's second college.<ref name='history'>{{cite web|url=https://www.stchads.ac.uk/about/history/|title=History|website=St Chad's College, Durham|access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe college continued to expand with the lease and purchase of further buildings on the Bailey, including Douglas House at 18 North Bailey, purchased in 1925.

It consists of two adjacent Grade II [[listed building]]s that were constructed in the 18th century and have since been connected internally. The building is used as a hall of residence for first-year and third-year [[undergraduate]]s. It is named after [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]], who was [[Bishop of Durham]] from 1879 to 1889.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/buildings.html\n |title       = Buildings\n |work        = St Chad's College\n |date        = 2005-11-30\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101105044213/http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/buildings.html\n |archivedate = 2010-11-05\n}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num=1121425 |desc=19 (North) North Bailey - commonly known as Lightfoot House \"dark side\" |accessdate=29 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num=1254243 |desc=19 North Bailey - commonly known as Lightfoot House \"light side\" |accessdate=29 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== Langford House ====\n\nLangford House, 21 North Bailey, is a grade II [[listed building]] built in the 18th century and named after a former Judaism scholar and College Chaplain. For many decades, it was the home of the College\u2019s chaplains, but today is used as a hall of residence for third year (and some first year) [[undergraduate]] students.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==== Grads House ====\n\nGrads House, 22 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building used as undergraduate accommodation. The building is largely late 18th-century, with a rainwater head dated 1796, but it contains a notable 17th century staircase. Its name derives from its use in the 1960s and 70s as a residence for students studying for postgraduate diplomas in Theology.<ref name=buildings />\n\n==== Ramsey House ====\n\nRamsey House, 25 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building built around 1820, now owned by the college and now used primarily for undergraduate accommodation. It is named for [[Arthur Michael Ramsey]], the 100th [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was once resident in Ramsey House. He was also a member of the Governing Council for the college.\n\nFor many decades, Ramsey House was the home of successive college principals, but it is now given over to student accommodation. There are now seven student rooms and a self-contained flat, which is typically home to the [[artist-in-residence]] of St Chad's College. The Middle Common Room of the College is located on the ground floor.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1121428 |desc=25 North Bailey|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n==== Trinity Hall ====\n\nTrinity Hall is a former [[Durham School]] boarding house, located on Grove Street, across the river from the main college site. It was built in 1847 as the Second Master's House, later called Caffinites after Benjamin Charles Caffin, Second Master from 1863-1877, before becoming the school's junior house under the name Ferens House. It was acquired by the college in 2002 and converted into housing for 25 postgraduates and a house for the college principal.  In 2017 the principal's house was converted into additional postgraduate accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicaccess.durham.gov.uk/online-applications/files/ED9076E3FD3B3162AA3B74B4D647B168/pdf/DM_17_01190_FPA-DESIGN_STATEMENT-1973289.pdf|title=Design Statement: Trinity House Durham for St Chad's College|author=Howarth Litchfield|date=2017|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=mcraccom>{{cite web|url=http://mcr.stchads.ac.uk/about_Accomodation.php|title=Accommodation|website=St Chad's College MCR|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Hallgarth Street ====\n\n30 Hallgarth Street, located across the river from the main college site, is a grade II listed building constructed around 1840. Formerly the college chaplain's house, it is now used as postgraduate accommodation.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1120617|grade=II|desc=23-32, Hallgarth Street}}</ref><ref name=mcraccom />\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThere are three library rooms on the ground floor of Main College (the Bettenson Room and the Brewis and Williams Libraries). The Williams Library doubles as a multi-media room and is often used for meetings and lectures. There are two more libraries on the first floor: the Wetherall Library, which houses most of the theology and philosophy collections; and the Reserve Library, which contains the core curricula texts for all of the courses currently on offer in the university (as well as the special church history and liturgy collections). The Fenton Library and the Trounson Library, which opened in October 2006, are located on the third floor. Comprising three separate rooms, the Fenton and Trounson Libraries contain individual study carrels and are used primarily for private study. The college is unusual (in the Durham collegiate context) in the extent to which it has invested in libraries and study space.\n\nThe [[Durham University Library]] holds most of the college's medieval manuscripts and its oldest books, which include a number of 16th and 17th century imprints including [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]]'s ''Epistolae familiares'' and the ''Concilia omnia''.\n\n===Chapel===\n[[File:Chapel of St Chad's college - geograph.org.uk - 979576.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The chapel from the croquet lawn]]\n\nThe college chapel, located behind Main College, was built in 1928, replacing an earlier chapel built on South Bailey in 1909. Intended only as a temporary building, the unheated wood-frame building seats 120 people and has been in continuous use. The chapel's contents are older than its structures, with older donated pews from various churches and a ballroom dance floor from a decommissioned ocean-liner.\n\n{{quote|Though still intended as only a temporary chapel, it is beautifully fitted up. Some day, when the permanent chapel is built, this and a good deal of the other furnishings can easily be transferred to the new building.|C E Whiting (1932), ''The University of Durham 1832-1932''<ref name=whiting />}}\n\nThe chapel is overseen by the college chaplain, an Anglican priest. The college's roots in the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition of the Church of England are still evident in services in the college chapel. Chapel attendance is entirely voluntary, given that the college accepts students without regard to their religious background.\n\nThe college maintains a collegiate choral tradition, headed by the director of music. Membership in the college choir is by audition.  The choir tours regionally and internationally and produces an annual CD of their music. The regional tours include regular visits schools in the North East, especially those on council estates, providing music workshops to students. The college offers a number of choral and organ scholarships every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/chapel_page.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929040850/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/chapel_page.htm |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Youth hostel===\nThe main building and adjoining undergraduate accommodation become the [[Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales)|Youth Hostels Association]]'s hostel (for Durham) during the Easter and summer holidays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/durham |title=Durham &#124; City Accommodation at St Chad University College |website=Yha.org.uk |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==College life==\n\n===Academic dress===\nAlong with most [[Bailey Colleges]], St Chad's students wear their college gowns to formal hall, matriculation, college congregations and other academic or formal events. The college gown is similar to others in Durham, with the addition of green cord across the edge of the vented sleeves (in practice most undergraduates' gowns do not have this feature). St Chad's also has retained its own distinctive academic hood (of black stuff with green lining and trim): previously designed for pre-1970s ordinands, the hood is today worn by graduates of the North East Institute for Theological Education and by honorary fellows. The rector has a distinctive robe (a full-sleeved gown of black corded silk, faced with silver-trimmed palatinate purple, and with sleeves lined with palatinate purple); college officers generally wear the academic regalia associated with their highest degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/academic_dress.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090639/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/academic_dress.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Matriculation===\nThough all Durham University students now participate in large matriculation ceremonies in the Cathedral, St Chad's has, for over a hundred years, conducted its own [[matriculation]]. This signals the fact that students are obliged to follow the regulations both of the university and of the college. Matriculands wear academic dress at the ceremony and every student signs the university's matriculation book, thereby sealing an oath to adhere to the rules and traditions of the college and the university.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Advent procession===\nFor over a half-century, the college has conducted an [[Advent]] procession in [[Durham Cathedral]]. The candle-lit choral service is unusual in not solely anticipating Christmas, but in anticipating the [[Second Coming]], which is the traditional theological focus of the Advent season itself. The choir splits into two, with one group seated in the choir and the other processing from the entrance to the cathedral. The two groups call back and forth to each other, using chants based on the Great Advent Antiphons. These antiphons form the basis not only of the advent procession, but also of the popular advent hymn, \"O come, O come, Emmanuel\". The procession is advertised widely in the City of Durham; after the event the college hosts its annual reception for city residents.\n\n===Bars===\nThe college bar won the \"university bar\" category of the 2009 Best Bar None awards for Durham City and held this title until the end of the 2009\u201310 academic year. St Chad's bar is one of the few remaining college bars still run by full-time undergraduate students elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/bars.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090636/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/bars.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Societies and events===\n[[File:St_Chads_College_Boat_Club_Blade.svg|thumb|St Chad's College Boat Club blade]]\nSt Chad's College Boat Club (SCCBC) is the college rowing club and was founded in 1906.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} It operates from the college boathouse on the [[River Wear]].\n\n2011 has seen the re-establishment of a theatre company at St Chad's, Green Door Productions, which aims to promote all aspects of theatre within the college, be it acting, directing, set design or backstage work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/culture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929061443/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/culture.html |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref> In 2011, Australian actor [[Russell Crowe]] visited the college to give a masterclass in acting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nEvery year the college hosts a [[Candlemas]] Ball. Founded in 1956, this is one of the older and more flamboyant balls in the university. It is recognised, along with [[University College, Durham|University College's]] June Ball, as being one of Durham's versions of the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[May Ball]]s.\n\n====Formal hall====\nTwice a week throughout most of the whole academic year, members of the college don academic gowns and gather for [[formal hall]]. This tradition brings students and staff together, though fellows, tutors and their guests sit at high table. This not only enables students who are living out to visit college, but it enables the college to entertain official guests regularly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/moulsdale.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084128/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/moulsdale.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Feasts====\nThe college has a number of feasts throughout the year. Both the Dining Hall and the Quad are used to provide a four-course meal for up to 250 people. Among the largest is the Principal's Feast, usually scheduled within a week or two of St Chad's Day.  The Rector's Feast, a relatively new tradition, welcomes the rector to the college for a formal \"visitation\". The Domus Dinner is an annual gathering of college fellows along with college benefactors and guests.  Feasts are often used to induct new fellows into the college.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/events.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929044716/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/events.html |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====St Chad's Day====\nSt Chad's Day features a day-long celebration (sometimes called a \"[[gaudy]]\" because of the formal proclamation of the day) and begins before sunrise with a noisy wake-up call: in the past, the students would 'invade' neighbouring colleges, waking them up as well; though after a particularly boisterous event in 2009, which garnered much unwanted attention from the student media, the college successfully reshaped the celebration. After a green breakfast, students wear green clothes and body paint to various events and challenges held throughout the day, gathering at noon for a run around [[Palace Green]]. Various musical and social events are held throughout the day and night.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\n[[File:StChadsHostelArms.png|thumb|upright=0.5|right|Early arms used by the hostel and hall (1905)]]\n\n===Arms and motto===\nThe college's motto, ''non-vestra sed vos'' (literally \"not yours but you\") reflects the college's beginnings, when it sought to enable students of modest means to gain access to a university education.  The motto commits the college to being concerned with the person, rather than with what the person owns.\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Status===\nSt Chad's is a \"recognised college\" of Durham University, but it is not maintained or governed by the university ([[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]] has the same status). The college was originally licensed by the university as a hall of residence, becoming a college in 1919. The distinction between colleges and halls at that time was more a matter of style than substance, as nothing but the name changed. The college had argued for the change because it had gradually built up several endowed fellowships, which it thought were characteristic more of a college than of a hall (that said, other halls in Durham quickly followed suit without having such endowments). The term \"recognised college\" was first used in the 1937 statutes to refer to those colleges not maintained by the university. It remains an unusual arrangement and it means that, though most students at the college matriculate for degrees at Durham University, the college itself still remains a separate legal entity. A limited company and registered charity in its own right, it is financially autonomous, independently staffed and entirely self-governed. The governing body includes, among others, college staff and students, representatives of Durham University, of the Archbishop of York and of the bishops of Durham, Newcastle and Carlisle. All external representatives are appointed by the governing body itself (even if they are nominated by external bodies). All governors are legally obliged to further the interests of the college and they cannot privilege the interests of the bodies that nominated them.\n\nIn contrast, the university's \"council colleges\" do not have a separate legal identity and are actually owned, managed and governed directly by the university itself. The relationship between the two recognised colleges and the university proper is still unique to Durham and is for that reason often misunderstood. In contrast, Oxford and Cambridge colleges are generally constituent parts of the university via Royal Charter, as are the various colleges and institutes of the University of London.\n\nThe university's council (its governing body for non-academic matters) is forbidden by statute from having any \"property in or financial responsibility for\" the college. As the college no longer receives any direct public funds, it is generally reliant on its own ability to raise funds. Thus the generation of research income by resident research staff, the generation of conference income and the support of alumni are crucial for the college. As a consequence of this status, any formal or financial relations between the college and the university are effectively governed by agreements and contracts. Goods and services provided by the university to the college are charged for by the university; similarly, goods and services provided by the college to the university are charged by the college.\n\nNotwithstanding its independence, the relationship between the college and the university is symbiotic. The university's council approves the appointment of the college's principal (this is chiefly because the principal is an ''ex officio'' member of Senate). If pressed this would effectively amount to a veto, but short-lists are invariably constructed in dialogue with the university. Again, though the university council does not have the power to approve or disapprove of any changes to the college's constitution, the college, in accepting recognition by the university, agrees to ''notify'' the university of any such changes.  If those changes unfavourably affect the college's status in the university, recognition can be withdrawn, which is to say the college would remain but it would no longer be able to admit students to the university.\n\nThe college has a subsidiary trading arm, through which the college manages its non-academic activities. The status of the various institutes attached to the college varies, with some being wholly owned by the college, and others being partnerships or joint-ventures with outside bodies.\n\n===Governance===\nThe college's [[visitor]] is the [[Archbishop of York]], currently [[John Sentamu]]. The visitor exercises customary visitorial functions and is the court of final appeal for any matters referred to the archbishop by the governing body. The visitor is appointed by the governing body for a renewable five-year period. In matters regarding the university itself (such as those brought forward by students), the university's visitor has jurisdiction.\n\nThe college's [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is [[Michael Sadgrove]], previously [[Dean of Durham]] and since 2016 Dean [[:wikt:Emeritus|Emeritus]] of Durham. The rector is the titular head of the college, who has responsibility for monitoring the college's furtherance of its Anglican tradition and for interpreting college statutes. Ceremonially, the rector presides at many official functions in college: the role is akin to the chancellor's role in the university.\n\nThe college is governed by a twenty-member governing body, headed by Jonathan Blackie CBE, who retired in 2011 from his post as Regional Director of [[Government Office]] North East. Responsibility for purely academic matters is usually devolved to the council of fellows. The Principal, as chief executive, sits on both the governing body and the council of fellows. The majority of governors are lay members, which means they are from outside the college. The university and the dioceses of York, Durham, Newcastle and Carlisle all nominate governors, though they must be approved by the college's governing body.\n\n===Finance===\nThe college has a modest endowment, which is enough to fund significant annual capital improvements, up to ten professorial fellowships and several dozen named scholarships.  A private charity, as opposed to a public body, the college is ineligible for HEFCE (government) funding: around 12% of its income comes from charges to the university, a further 25% comes from research activities, with the rest raised through student fees, donations and conference income.  The college is a registered charity.  The college's turnover is \u00a32.6 million and total assets in 2010 were \u00a38 million (based on a deliberately conservative evaluation of the college's properties).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/finance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606013425/http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/finance.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011 }}</ref> In 2008, the college's previous bursar, Christine Starkey, was jailed for fraud for having stolen close to a half-million pounds, which would otherwise have been in the college's endowment. Starkey had deposited into the bank proceeds from the conference and B&B trade, but she failed to put these monies through the college's accounts.  She then transferred the funds directly from the college's account to her own, hiding the transfers in bulk bank-to-bank BACS transfers. Starkey's house was sold and the college was eventually successful in recovering all of the money that had been stolen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/northeast/cps_northumbria_news/university_bursar_forced_to_handover_house_sale_cash/ |title=University bursar forced to handover house sale cash |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=1 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170158/http://www.cps.gov.uk/northeast/cps_northumbria_news/university_bursar_forced_to_handover_house_sale_cash/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nCompetition for membership in the college is strong and the college is the second most popular college (after the Castle) in Durham in terms of applications per place. Applications for postgraduate places similarly outnumber beds by a wide margin. Like other colleges, applicants are considered chiefly on the basis of academic merit, and 90% of undergraduates at St Chad's attain a first or upper second class degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/chads/ |title=St Chad's College, Durham |publisher=Durham University |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the recent past, the college was one of four Durham colleges designated by the university to accept open postgraduate applications in all disciplines, though now virtually all colleges accept such applicants. St Chad's has a number of dedicated postgraduate residences and an unusually high percentage (more than 30%) of postgraduate students. The welfare of postgraduates is overseen by the college's Postgraduate Director.\n\n===Patronage===\nThe governing body of the college has an [[advowson]] over ten [[benefice]]s of the Church of England.

The college includes a number of institutes and research groups: the Durham Policy Research Group, a group of more than a dozen academics headed by professors Fred Robinson, Ian Stone and Tony Chapman, each of whom has his own research team. They advise on government policy and conduct primary research into regional development, regional economics and third sector activities.  Other academics work full-time in the college but often in conjunction with various university departments (e.g. in the medical humanities). Still others work chiefly outside the college and university: for instance the filmmaker and professor Richard Else, in conjunction with Triple Echo Productions (a Scottish-based film production firm), works regularly with [[Traidcraft]] on behalf of the college.\n\n===Charitable activities===\nIn addition to its primary charitable object of supporting students and scholars in Durham, the college works closely with [[Traidcraft]], with whom it jointly promotes fair trade practices and offers the Traidcraft Fellowship. The college jointly sponsors the [[Ruth First]] scholarship, which annually enables a South African postgraduate student to study at Durham University. To widen participation, the college has created partnerships with a number of secondary schools in the North East and beyond and has worked with primary schools in the market town of [[Crook, County Durham|Crook]].\n\n===Collegiate studies===\nAll Durham colleges are interdisciplinary, enabling staff and students to broaden their study and research interests. St Chad's runs a collegiate studies programme, which complements departmentally-based studies. The programme is explicitly justice-orientated, reflecting the ethos and history of the college. Students and staff are introduced to complex social issues in the North East of England through study tours and seminars; they are invited to participate in a weekly programme of training-events that go beyond traditional transferable skills to include such things as ethical decision-making and introductions to fair-trade practices, social accounting and eco-friendly life-strategies.\n\n===International dimension===\nIn addition to the usual sports and cultural activities offered in most colleges, St Chad's has an international placement programme. Under the auspices of the Historic Schools Restoration Project, the college has a link with St Matthew's High School in [[Keiskammahoek]], Eastern Cape, South Africa, where students and recent grads mentor and teach for up to four months, some also providing in-service subject-specialist support to staff. The South African project includes training with staff from [[St. Andrew's College (South Africa)|St Andrew's College]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Durham - St Chads arms.png|thumb|St. Chad's College's Coat of Arms]]\n\n===College fellows===\n[[Joseph Cassidy (Anglican priest)|Joseph Cassidy]] was principal<ref>The principal may also use the title \"President\".

A Canadian social ethicist and Anglican priest, he was also a non-residentiary canon of [[Durham Cathedral]]. On 1 March 2016, [[Margaret Masson]], previously Vice-Principal and Senior Tutor of St Chad's, was appointed Principal.\n\nSenior college officers include the principal, the vice-principal/senior tutor, the chaplain, the directors of the various academic centres, the librarian, bursar and commercial director. In addition, St Chad's has over 30 college fellows, research fellows and research associates. There are over 50 college tutors who act as mentors for both undergraduates and postgraduates. The college offers a number of visiting fellowships to academics of all disciplines. A further 100 university staff associate themselves with the college, chiefly through membership in the Senior Common Room. The college awards honorary fellowships, usually to distinguished alumni of the college, but also to others who have made significant contributions to the college, the church or to public life.\n\n===List of principals===\n* 1904 [[Stephen Moulsdale|Stephen R.

The main part of the college is located on [[the Bailey]], occupying nine historic buildings at the east end of [[Durham Cathedral]]. It neighbours [[Hatfield College]] to its north, while [[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]] and [[St Cuthbert's Society]] are to its south. The college is named after [[Chad of Mercia|St Chad]] of [[Mercia]], a 7th-century bishop.\n\nAlthough it is the smallest of Durham's colleges in terms of student numbers (in 2018\u201319, the college had 409 undergraduates and 150 active postgraduates),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/student.registry/statistics/summary/1.9ttaccom/181-9.pdf|title=Term-Time Accommodation|date=2018|website=Durham University|access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> it has the largest staff, extensive college library facilities, and among the highest undergraduate academic results in Durham.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/spa/statistics/ |title=Comparison stats re percent of first and upper second results over recent years.

He was supported by lady of the manor [[Julia Warde-Aldam]], who in 1903 funded a dedicated building for the hostel in Hooton Pagnell.<ref name='wardealdam'>{{cite journal|journal=The Chadsian|pages=22\u201326|issue=2018|title=St Chad's Other Founder|url=https://issuu.com/stchadscollege/docs/chadsian_2018}}</ref>\n\nThe further financial support of [[Douglas Horsfall]], a wealthy [[Liverpool]] businessman and devoted churchman (who also funded the building of several large [[Anglo-Catholic]] churches in his home city), made it possible in 1904 to establish a hall at [[Durham University]] as a sister institution to the Hooton Pagnell hostel, to allow students to read for university degrees alongside training for ordination. Durham University had a provision in its statutes to recognise independent colleges, permitting students to matriculate through those institutions and then to sit for Durham exams.\n\n[[File:1 South Bailey.jpg|thumb|1 South Bailey, the first home of St Chad's Hall in Durham. The college's second building, 28 North Bailey, is on the left.

In 1909, a small wooden chapel was constructed behind the South Bailey buildings, and dedicated by the Bishop of Jarrow.<ref name='whiting' />\n\nThe Durham hall and Hooton Pagnell hostel continued to operate in partnership, with students studying for a year at the hostel before moving to the hall to complete their studies, until 1916 when the Hooton Pagnell building was requisitioned as a war hospital and all teaching was moved to Durham. The hostel building was returned after the war, and re-opened for a short time, but the financial problems of running in two locations led to the hostel finally closing in 1921.<ref name='wardealdam' />\n\n=== St Chad's College ===\n\nIn 1918, after the college had established a number of endowed fellowships, the university recognised St Chad's as the university's second college.<ref name='history'>{{cite web|url=https://www.stchads.ac.uk/about/history/|title=History|website=St Chad's College, Durham|access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe college continued to expand with the lease and purchase of further buildings on the Bailey, including Douglas House at 18 North Bailey, purchased in 1925.

It is named after [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]], who was [[Bishop of Durham]] from 1879 to 1889.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/buildings.html\n |title       = Buildings\n |work        = St Chad's College\n |date        = 2005-11-30\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101105044213/http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/buildings.html\n |archivedate = 2010-11-05\n}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num=1121425 |desc=19 (North) North Bailey - commonly known as Lightfoot House \"dark side\" |accessdate=29 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{NHLE |num=1254243 |desc=19 North Bailey - commonly known as Lightfoot House \"light side\" |accessdate=29 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n==== Langford House ====\n\nLangford House, 21 North Bailey, is a grade II [[listed building]] built in the 18th century and named after a former Judaism scholar and College Chaplain. For many decades, it was the home of the College\u2019s chaplains, but today is used as a hall of residence for third year (and some first year) [[undergraduate]] students.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==== Grads House ====\n\nGrads House, 22 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building used as undergraduate accommodation. The building is largely late 18th-century, with a rainwater head dated 1796, but it contains a notable 17th century staircase. Its name derives from its use in the 1960s and 70s as a residence for students studying for postgraduate diplomas in Theology.<ref name=buildings />\n\n==== Ramsey House ====\n\nRamsey House, 25 North Bailey, is a Grade II listed building built around 1820, now owned by the college and now used primarily for undergraduate accommodation. It is named for [[Arthur Michael Ramsey]], the 100th [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] who was once resident in Ramsey House. He was also a member of the Governing Council for the college.\n\nFor many decades, Ramsey House was the home of successive college principals, but it is now given over to student accommodation. There are now seven student rooms and a self-contained flat, which is typically home to the [[artist-in-residence]] of St Chad's College. The Middle Common Room of the College is located on the ground floor.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1121428 |desc=25 North Bailey|accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Other sites ===\n\n==== Trinity Hall ====\n\nTrinity Hall is a former [[Durham School]] boarding house, located on Grove Street, across the river from the main college site. It was built in 1847 as the Second Master's House, later called Caffinites after Benjamin Charles Caffin, Second Master from 1863-1877, before becoming the school's junior house under the name Ferens House. It was acquired by the college in 2002 and converted into housing for 25 postgraduates and a house for the college principal.  In 2017 the principal's house was converted into additional postgraduate accommodation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://publicaccess.durham.gov.uk/online-applications/files/ED9076E3FD3B3162AA3B74B4D647B168/pdf/DM_17_01190_FPA-DESIGN_STATEMENT-1973289.pdf|title=Design Statement: Trinity House Durham for St Chad's College|author=Howarth Litchfield|date=2017|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=mcraccom>{{cite web|url=http://mcr.stchads.ac.uk/about_Accomodation.php|title=Accommodation|website=St Chad's College MCR|access-date=24 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==== Hallgarth Street ====\n\n30 Hallgarth Street, located across the river from the main college site, is a grade II listed building constructed around 1840. Formerly the college chaplain's house, it is now used as postgraduate accommodation.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1120617|grade=II|desc=23-32, Hallgarth Street}}</ref><ref name=mcraccom />\n\n=== Libraries ===\n\nThere are three library rooms on the ground floor of Main College (the Bettenson Room and the Brewis and Williams Libraries). The Williams Library doubles as a multi-media room and is often used for meetings and lectures. There are two more libraries on the first floor: the Wetherall Library, which houses most of the theology and philosophy collections; and the Reserve Library, which contains the core curricula texts for all of the courses currently on offer in the university (as well as the special church history and liturgy collections). The Fenton Library and the Trounson Library, which opened in October 2006, are located on the third floor. Comprising three separate rooms, the Fenton and Trounson Libraries contain individual study carrels and are used primarily for private study. The college is unusual (in the Durham collegiate context) in the extent to which it has invested in libraries and study space.\n\nThe [[Durham University Library]] holds most of the college's medieval manuscripts and its oldest books, which include a number of 16th and 17th century imprints including [[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]]'s ''Epistolae familiares'' and the ''Concilia omnia''.\n\n===Chapel===\n[[File:Chapel of St Chad's college - geograph.org.uk - 979576.jpg|thumb|right|230px|The chapel from the croquet lawn]]\n\nThe college chapel, located behind Main College, was built in 1928, replacing an earlier chapel built on South Bailey in 1909. Intended only as a temporary building, the unheated wood-frame building seats 120 people and has been in continuous use. The chapel's contents are older than its structures, with older donated pews from various churches and a ballroom dance floor from a decommissioned ocean-liner.\n\n{{quote|Though still intended as only a temporary chapel, it is beautifully fitted up. Some day, when the permanent chapel is built, this and a good deal of the other furnishings can easily be transferred to the new building.|C E Whiting (1932), ''The University of Durham 1832-1932''<ref name=whiting />}}\n\nThe chapel is overseen by the college chaplain, an Anglican priest. The college's roots in the [[Anglo-Catholicism|Catholic]] tradition of the Church of England are still evident in services in the college chapel. Chapel attendance is entirely voluntary, given that the college accepts students without regard to their religious background.\n\nThe college maintains a collegiate choral tradition, headed by the director of music. Membership in the college choir is by audition.  The choir tours regionally and internationally and produces an annual CD of their music. The regional tours include regular visits schools in the North East, especially those on council estates, providing music workshops to students. The college offers a number of choral and organ scholarships every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/chapel_page.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929040850/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/chapel_page.htm |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Youth hostel===\nThe main building and adjoining undergraduate accommodation become the [[Youth Hostels Association (England & Wales)|Youth Hostels Association]]'s hostel (for Durham) during the Easter and summer holidays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/durham |title=Durham &#124; City Accommodation at St Chad University College |website=Yha.org.uk |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==College life==\n\n===Academic dress===\nAlong with most [[Bailey Colleges]], St Chad's students wear their college gowns to formal hall, matriculation, college congregations and other academic or formal events. The college gown is similar to others in Durham, with the addition of green cord across the edge of the vented sleeves (in practice most undergraduates' gowns do not have this feature). St Chad's also has retained its own distinctive academic hood (of black stuff with green lining and trim): previously designed for pre-1970s ordinands, the hood is today worn by graduates of the North East Institute for Theological Education and by honorary fellows. The rector has a distinctive robe (a full-sleeved gown of black corded silk, faced with silver-trimmed palatinate purple, and with sleeves lined with palatinate purple); college officers generally wear the academic regalia associated with their highest degrees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/academic_dress.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090639/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/academic_dress.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Matriculation===\nThough all Durham University students now participate in large matriculation ceremonies in the Cathedral, St Chad's has, for over a hundred years, conducted its own [[matriculation]]. This signals the fact that students are obliged to follow the regulations both of the university and of the college. Matriculands wear academic dress at the ceremony and every student signs the university's matriculation book, thereby sealing an oath to adhere to the rules and traditions of the college and the university.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\n===Advent procession===\nFor over a half-century, the college has conducted an [[Advent]] procession in [[Durham Cathedral]]. The candle-lit choral service is unusual in not solely anticipating Christmas, but in anticipating the [[Second Coming]], which is the traditional theological focus of the Advent season itself. The choir splits into two, with one group seated in the choir and the other processing from the entrance to the cathedral. The two groups call back and forth to each other, using chants based on the Great Advent Antiphons. These antiphons form the basis not only of the advent procession, but also of the popular advent hymn, \"O come, O come, Emmanuel\". The procession is advertised widely in the City of Durham; after the event the college hosts its annual reception for city residents.\n\n===Bars===\nThe college bar won the \"university bar\" category of the 2009 Best Bar None awards for Durham City and held this title until the end of the 2009\u201310 academic year. St Chad's bar is one of the few remaining college bars still run by full-time undergraduate students elected by the student body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/bars.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006090636/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/bars.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n===Societies and events===\n[[File:St_Chads_College_Boat_Club_Blade.svg|thumb|St Chad's College Boat Club blade]]\nSt Chad's College Boat Club (SCCBC) is the college rowing club and was founded in 1906.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} It operates from the college boathouse on the [[River Wear]].\n\n2011 has seen the re-establishment of a theatre company at St Chad's, Green Door Productions, which aims to promote all aspects of theatre within the college, be it acting, directing, set design or backstage work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/culture.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929061443/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/culture.html |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref> In 2011, Australian actor [[Russell Crowe]] visited the college to give a masterclass in acting.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nEvery year the college hosts a [[Candlemas]] Ball. Founded in 1956, this is one of the older and more flamboyant balls in the university. It is recognised, along with [[University College, Durham|University College's]] June Ball, as being one of Durham's versions of the [[University of Cambridge]]'s [[May Ball]]s.\n\n====Formal hall====\nTwice a week throughout most of the whole academic year, members of the college don academic gowns and gather for [[formal hall]]. This tradition brings students and staff together, though fellows, tutors and their guests sit at high table. This not only enables students who are living out to visit college, but it enables the college to entertain official guests regularly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/moulsdale.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006084128/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/moulsdale.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====Feasts====\nThe college has a number of feasts throughout the year. Both the Dining Hall and the Quad are used to provide a four-course meal for up to 250 people. Among the largest is the Principal's Feast, usually scheduled within a week or two of St Chad's Day.  The Rector's Feast, a relatively new tradition, welcomes the rector to the college for a formal \"visitation\". The Domus Dinner is an annual gathering of college fellows along with college benefactors and guests.  Feasts are often used to induct new fellows into the college.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/events.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=1 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929044716/http://community.dur.ac.uk/chads/events.html |archivedate=29 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\n====St Chad's Day====\nSt Chad's Day features a day-long celebration (sometimes called a \"[[gaudy]]\" because of the formal proclamation of the day) and begins before sunrise with a noisy wake-up call: in the past, the students would 'invade' neighbouring colleges, waking them up as well; though after a particularly boisterous event in 2009, which garnered much unwanted attention from the student media, the college successfully reshaped the celebration. After a green breakfast, students wear green clothes and body paint to various events and challenges held throughout the day, gathering at noon for a run around [[Palace Green]]. Various musical and social events are held throughout the day and night.<ref name=\"dur.ac.uk\"/>\n\n[[File:StChadsHostelArms.png|thumb|upright=0.5|right|Early arms used by the hostel and hall (1905)]]\n\n===Arms and motto===\nThe college's motto, ''non-vestra sed vos'' (literally \"not yours but you\") reflects the college's beginnings, when it sought to enable students of modest means to gain access to a university education.  The motto commits the college to being concerned with the person, rather than with what the person owns.\n\n==Organisation and administration==\n===Status===\nSt Chad's is a \"recognised college\" of Durham University, but it is not maintained or governed by the university ([[St John's College, Durham|St John's College]] has the same status). The college was originally licensed by the university as a hall of residence, becoming a college in 1919. The distinction between colleges and halls at that time was more a matter of style than substance, as nothing but the name changed. The college had argued for the change because it had gradually built up several endowed fellowships, which it thought were characteristic more of a college than of a hall (that said, other halls in Durham quickly followed suit without having such endowments). The term \"recognised college\" was first used in the 1937 statutes to refer to those colleges not maintained by the university. It remains an unusual arrangement and it means that, though most students at the college matriculate for degrees at Durham University, the college itself still remains a separate legal entity. A limited company and registered charity in its own right, it is financially autonomous, independently staffed and entirely self-governed. The governing body includes, among others, college staff and students, representatives of Durham University, of the Archbishop of York and of the bishops of Durham, Newcastle and Carlisle. All external representatives are appointed by the governing body itself (even if they are nominated by external bodies). All governors are legally obliged to further the interests of the college and they cannot privilege the interests of the bodies that nominated them.\n\nIn contrast, the university's \"council colleges\" do not have a separate legal identity and are actually owned, managed and governed directly by the university itself. The relationship between the two recognised colleges and the university proper is still unique to Durham and is for that reason often misunderstood. In contrast, Oxford and Cambridge colleges are generally constituent parts of the university via Royal Charter, as are the various colleges and institutes of the University of London.\n\nThe university's council (its governing body for non-academic matters) is forbidden by statute from having any \"property in or financial responsibility for\" the college. As the college no longer receives any direct public funds, it is generally reliant on its own ability to raise funds. Thus the generation of research income by resident research staff, the generation of conference income and the support of alumni are crucial for the college. As a consequence of this status, any formal or financial relations between the college and the university are effectively governed by agreements and contracts. Goods and services provided by the university to the college are charged for by the university; similarly, goods and services provided by the college to the university are charged by the college.\n\nNotwithstanding its independence, the relationship between the college and the university is symbiotic. The university's council approves the appointment of the college's principal (this is chiefly because the principal is an ''ex officio'' member of Senate). If pressed this would effectively amount to a veto, but short-lists are invariably constructed in dialogue with the university. Again, though the university council does not have the power to approve or disapprove of any changes to the college's constitution, the college, in accepting recognition by the university, agrees to ''notify'' the university of any such changes.  If those changes unfavourably affect the college's status in the university, recognition can be withdrawn, which is to say the college would remain but it would no longer be able to admit students to the university.\n\nThe college has a subsidiary trading arm, through which the college manages its non-academic activities. The status of the various institutes attached to the college varies, with some being wholly owned by the college, and others being partnerships or joint-ventures with outside bodies.\n\n===Governance===\nThe college's [[visitor]] is the [[Archbishop of York]], currently [[John Sentamu]]. The visitor exercises customary visitorial functions and is the court of final appeal for any matters referred to the archbishop by the governing body. The visitor is appointed by the governing body for a renewable five-year period. In matters regarding the university itself (such as those brought forward by students), the university's visitor has jurisdiction.\n\nThe college's [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] is [[Michael Sadgrove]], previously [[Dean of Durham]] and since 2016 Dean [[:wikt:Emeritus|Emeritus]] of Durham. The rector is the titular head of the college, who has responsibility for monitoring the college's furtherance of its Anglican tradition and for interpreting college statutes. Ceremonially, the rector presides at many official functions in college: the role is akin to the chancellor's role in the university.\n\nThe college is governed by a twenty-member governing body, headed by Jonathan Blackie CBE, who retired in 2011 from his post as Regional Director of [[Government Office]] North East. Responsibility for purely academic matters is usually devolved to the council of fellows. The Principal, as chief executive, sits on both the governing body and the council of fellows. The majority of governors are lay members, which means they are from outside the college. The university and the dioceses of York, Durham, Newcastle and Carlisle all nominate governors, though they must be approved by the college's governing body.\n\n===Finance===\nThe college has a modest endowment, which is enough to fund significant annual capital improvements, up to ten professorial fellowships and several dozen named scholarships.  A private charity, as opposed to a public body, the college is ineligible for HEFCE (government) funding: around 12% of its income comes from charges to the university, a further 25% comes from research activities, with the rest raised through student fees, donations and conference income.  The college is a registered charity.  The college's turnover is \u00a32.6 million and total assets in 2010 were \u00a38 million (based on a deliberately conservative evaluation of the college's properties).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/finance.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606013425/http://www.dur.ac.uk/StChads/finance.pdf |archivedate=6 June 2011 }}</ref> In 2008, the college's previous bursar, Christine Starkey, was jailed for fraud for having stolen close to a half-million pounds, which would otherwise have been in the college's endowment. Starkey had deposited into the bank proceeds from the conference and B&B trade, but she failed to put these monies through the college's accounts.  She then transferred the funds directly from the college's account to her own, hiding the transfers in bulk bank-to-bank BACS transfers. Starkey's house was sold and the college was eventually successful in recovering all of the money that had been stolen.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/northeast/cps_northumbria_news/university_bursar_forced_to_handover_house_sale_cash/ |title=University bursar forced to handover house sale cash |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |accessdate=1 June 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714170158/http://www.cps.gov.uk/northeast/cps_northumbria_news/university_bursar_forced_to_handover_house_sale_cash/ |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Admissions===\nCompetition for membership in the college is strong and the college is the second most popular college (after the Castle) in Durham in terms of applications per place. Applications for postgraduate places similarly outnumber beds by a wide margin. Like other colleges, applicants are considered chiefly on the basis of academic merit, and 90% of undergraduates at St Chad's attain a first or upper second class degree.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/chads/ |title=St Chad's College, Durham |publisher=Durham University |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the recent past, the college was one of four Durham colleges designated by the university to accept open postgraduate applications in all disciplines, though now virtually all colleges accept such applicants. St Chad's has a number of dedicated postgraduate residences and an unusually high percentage (more than 30%) of postgraduate students. The welfare of postgraduates is overseen by the college's Postgraduate Director.\n\n===Patronage===\nThe governing body of the college has an [[advowson]] over ten [[benefice]]s of the Church of England. Five are located in the [[Diocese of Liverpool]] (St Agnes', Toxteth; St Stephen's with St Catherine's; St Faith's, Great Crosby; St Paul's, Stoneycroft; and St Margaret's, Toxteth),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldiocesanregistry.co.uk/patrons.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=29 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106021350/http://www.liverpooldiocesanregistry.co.uk/patrons.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}</ref> two in the [[Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich]] (Hadley (St Mary), and Wratting (Great and Little)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/university.calendar/volumei/committee_membership/college_councils/chads/ |title=University Calendar : St. Chad's College|publisher=Durham University |date=9 December 2016 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}</ref> and one in each in the [[Diocese of Durham|Durham]] (Longnewton), [[Diocese of Hereford|Hereford]] (Pontesbury) and [[Diocese of Leicester|Leicester]] (Syston) dioceses.

The college includes a number of institutes and research groups: the Durham Policy Research Group, a group of more than a dozen academics headed by professors Fred Robinson, Ian Stone and Tony Chapman, each of whom has his own research team. They advise on government policy and conduct primary research into regional development, regional economics and third sector activities.  Other academics work full-time in the college but often in conjunction with various university departments (e.g. in the medical humanities). Still others work chiefly outside the college and university: for instance the filmmaker and professor Richard Else, in conjunction with Triple Echo Productions (a Scottish-based film production firm), works regularly with [[Traidcraft]] on behalf of the college.\n\n===Charitable activities===\nIn addition to its primary charitable object of supporting students and scholars in Durham, the college works closely with [[Traidcraft]], with whom it jointly promotes fair trade practices and offers the Traidcraft Fellowship. The college jointly sponsors the [[Ruth First]] scholarship, which annually enables a South African postgraduate student to study at Durham University. To widen participation, the college has created partnerships with a number of secondary schools in the North East and beyond and has worked with primary schools in the market town of [[Crook, County Durham|Crook]].\n\n===Collegiate studies===\nAll Durham colleges are interdisciplinary, enabling staff and students to broaden their study and research interests. St Chad's runs a collegiate studies programme, which complements departmentally-based studies. The programme is explicitly justice-orientated, reflecting the ethos and history of the college. Students and staff are introduced to complex social issues in the North East of England through study tours and seminars; they are invited to participate in a weekly programme of training-events that go beyond traditional transferable skills to include such things as ethical decision-making and introductions to fair-trade practices, social accounting and eco-friendly life-strategies.\n\n===International dimension===\nIn addition to the usual sports and cultural activities offered in most colleges, St Chad's has an international placement programme. Under the auspices of the Historic Schools Restoration Project, the college has a link with St Matthew's High School in [[Keiskammahoek]], Eastern Cape, South Africa, where students and recent grads mentor and teach for up to four months, some also providing in-service subject-specialist support to staff. The South African project includes training with staff from [[St. Andrew's College (South Africa)|St Andrew's College]].\n\n==Notable people==\n[[File:Durham - St Chads arms.png|thumb|St. Chad's College's Coat of Arms]]\n\n===College fellows===\n[[Joseph Cassidy (Anglican priest)|Joseph Cassidy]] was principal<ref>The principal may also use the title \"President\".

A Canadian social ethicist and Anglican priest, he was also a non-residentiary canon of [[Durham Cathedral]]. On 1 March 2016, [[Margaret Masson]], previously Vice-Principal and Senior Tutor of St Chad's, was appointed Principal.\n\nSenior college officers include the principal, the vice-principal/senior tutor, the chaplain, the directors of the various academic centres, the librarian, bursar and commercial director. In addition, St Chad's has over 30 college fellows, research fellows and research associates. There are over 50 college tutors who act as mentors for both undergraduates and postgraduates. The college offers a number of visiting fellowships to academics of all disciplines. A further 100 university staff associate themselves with the college, chiefly through membership in the Senior Common Room. The college awards honorary fellowships, usually to distinguished alumni of the college, but also to others who have made significant contributions to the college, the church or to public life.\n\n===List of principals===\n* 1904 [[Stephen Moulsdale|Stephen R.

The name is sometimes applied to the immediate vicinity of the eponymous railway station, but King's Cross is the usual name for the area around the two mainline stations as a whole.\n\n[[File:LONDON, MARYLEBONE by BARTLETT, F.A. and B.J.

However, in the 14th century the population moved ''en masse'' to [[Kentish Town]], probably due to flooding by the [[River Fleet]] and the availability of better wells at the new location. A [[chapel of ease]] was established there, and the old settlement was abandoned, except for a few farms, until the growth of London in the late eighteenth century.\n\nIn the 1790s [[Earl Camden]] began to develop some fields to the north and west of the old church as [[Camden Town]].<ref>Camden Town and Primrose Hill Past by John Richardson (1991) {{ISBN|0-948667-12-5}}</ref> About the same time, a residential district was built to the south and east of the church, usually known as [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]. In 1822 the [[St Pancras New Church|new church of St Pancras]] was dedicated as the [[parish church]]. The site was chosen on what was then called the New Road, now [[Euston Road]], which had been built as London's first bypass, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] of its day. The two sites are about a kilometer apart. The new church is [[Grade I listed]] for its [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival style]]; the old church [[Victorian restoration|was rebuilt]] in 1847. In the mid 19th century two major railway stations were built to the south of the Old Church, first [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and later [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]]. The new church is closer to [[Euston railway station|Euston station]].\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century the ancient parish had been divided into 37 parishes, including one for the old church. There are currently 17 [[Church of England]] parishes completely contained within the boundaries of the ancient parish, all of which benefit from the distributions from the St Pancras Lands Trust, and most of which are in South Camden Deanery in the [[Bishop of Edmonton (London)|Edmonton Area]] of the [[Diocese of London]].\n\n===Metropolitan borough===\nThe parish of St Pancras was administered by a [[vestry]] until the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras]] was established in 1900. In 1965 the former area of the borough was combined with that of two others to form the [[London Borough of Camden]].\n\nIn the 1950s, St Pancras Council gained a reputation for left-wing radicalism, being referred to as \"the most freakish borough in London.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=86}}</ref>  The council refused to take part in [[civil defence]] preparations for war, which local councils were obliged to provide.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=110}}</ref>  John Lawrence as Mayor was monitored by the Home Office and, as of 2016, the Home Office still refuses Freedom of Information requests relating to Lawrence on the grounds of protecting national security.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=215}}</ref> \n\nHousing was in [[excess demand]] after the damage and disruption of the [[Second World War]].  There was strong opposition to the [[History_of_rent_control_in_England_and_Wales#Decontrol_1957_to_1965|1957 Rent Act]], which led to a series of decisions that caused serious financial difficulty.  John Lawrence and several other councillors were expelled from the Labour Party in 1958, but continued to serve as the Independent Socialists.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=154}}</ref>  The Conservative Party won the 1958 council election.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=158}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, there was a widespread rent strike in the district, which led to rioting in September.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=180}}</ref>\n\n==Cemeteries==\n[[File:2780theHardyTreeOldStPancrasChurchyard.jpg|thumb|The Hardy Tree, growing between gravestones moved while [[Thomas Hardy]] was working here]]\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, St Pancras was famous for its cemeteries: as well as the graveyard of Old St Pancras Church, it also contained the cemeteries of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]], [[St Giles in the Fields]], [[St Andrew, Holborn]], [[St. George's Church, Bloomsbury]], and [[St George the Martyr Holborn|St George the Martyr, Holborn]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/MDX/StPancras/StPancrasHistory |title=St. Pancras |last=Hinson |first=Colin |year=2003 |website=GENUKI: UK & Ireland Genealogy |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> These were all closed under the [[Extramural Interment Act 1854|Extramural Interment Act]] in 1854; the parish was required to purchase land some distance away, and chose [[East Finchley]] for its new [[St Pancras Cemetery]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stpancras.com/history |title=History |website=St Pancras International |publisher=HS1 Ltd |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> \n\nThe disused graveyard at St Pancras Old Church was left alone for over thirty years, until the building of the [[Midland Railway]] required the removal of many of the graves. [[Thomas Hardy]], then a junior architect and later a novelist and poet, was involved in this work. Particularly, he placed a number of gravestones around a tree, now known as \"the Hardy Tree\".<ref name=\"vweb\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/photos/hardy/74.html |title=The Hardy Tree, St Pancras Churchyard, London |date=2006-04-17 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> The cemetery was disturbed again in 2002\u201303 by the construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]], but much more care was given to the removal of remains than in the 19th century.\n\n==Political divisions==\nThe name St Pancras survives in the name of the local parliamentary [[constituency]], [[Holborn and St. Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St. Pancras]]. One of the political [[Ward (subnational entity)|wards]] in Camden is called St Pancras and Somers Town; however, ward boundaries are chosen to divide a borough into roughly equal slices with little regard to historical boundaries or day-to-day usage. Besides Somers Town and the area around St Pancras Old Church, the ward includes much of Camden Town and the former Kings Cross Goods Yard, which is being redeveloped as a mixed-use district under the name [[Kings Cross Central]].\n\n==Landmarks==\n[[File:Haringay Camden boundary.jpg|thumb|upright|Boundary stone between St Pancras and [[Hornsey]] at [[Highgate]]]]\nOld St Pancras Church and its graveyard have links to [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], and the [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]] circle.<ref name=\"vweb\" /> Immediately to the north of the churchyard is [[St Pancras Hospital]], originally the parish [[workhouse]] and latterly the [[London Hospital for Tropical Diseases]].

However, in the 14th century the population moved ''en masse'' to [[Kentish Town]], probably due to flooding by the [[River Fleet]] and the availability of better wells at the new location. A [[chapel of ease]] was established there, and the old settlement was abandoned, except for a few farms, until the growth of London in the late eighteenth century.\n\nIn the 1790s [[Earl Camden]] began to develop some fields to the north and west of the old church as [[Camden Town]].<ref>Camden Town and Primrose Hill Past by John Richardson (1991) {{ISBN|0-948667-12-5}}</ref> About the same time, a residential district was built to the south and east of the church, usually known as [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]]. In 1822 the [[St Pancras New Church|new church of St Pancras]] was dedicated as the [[parish church]]. The site was chosen on what was then called the New Road, now [[Euston Road]], which had been built as London's first bypass, the [[M25 motorway|M25]] of its day. The two sites are about a kilometer apart. The new church is [[Grade I listed]] for its [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival style]]; the old church [[Victorian restoration|was rebuilt]] in 1847. In the mid 19th century two major railway stations were built to the south of the Old Church, first [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]] and later [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras]]. The new church is closer to [[Euston railway station|Euston station]].\n\nBy the end of the nineteenth century the ancient parish had been divided into 37 parishes, including one for the old church. There are currently 17 [[Church of England]] parishes completely contained within the boundaries of the ancient parish, all of which benefit from the distributions from the St Pancras Lands Trust, and most of which are in South Camden Deanery in the [[Bishop of Edmonton (London)|Edmonton Area]] of the [[Diocese of London]].\n\n===Metropolitan borough===\nThe parish of St Pancras was administered by a [[vestry]] until the [[Metropolitan Borough of St Pancras]] was established in 1900. In 1965 the former area of the borough was combined with that of two others to form the [[London Borough of Camden]].\n\nIn the 1950s, St Pancras Council gained a reputation for left-wing radicalism, being referred to as \"the most freakish borough in London.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=86}}</ref>  The council refused to take part in [[civil defence]] preparations for war, which local councils were obliged to provide.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=110}}</ref>  John Lawrence as Mayor was monitored by the Home Office and, as of 2016, the Home Office still refuses Freedom of Information requests relating to Lawrence on the grounds of protecting national security.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=215}}</ref> \n\nHousing was in [[excess demand]] after the damage and disruption of the [[Second World War]].  There was strong opposition to the [[History_of_rent_control_in_England_and_Wales#Decontrol_1957_to_1965|1957 Rent Act]], which led to a series of decisions that caused serious financial difficulty.  John Lawrence and several other councillors were expelled from the Labour Party in 1958, but continued to serve as the Independent Socialists.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=154}}</ref>  The Conservative Party won the 1958 council election.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=158}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, there was a widespread rent strike in the district, which led to rioting in September.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mathieson |first=David |date=2016 |title=Radical London in the 1950s |location=Stroud, UK |publisher=Amberley |isbn=9781445661032|page=180}}</ref>\n\n==Cemeteries==\n[[File:2780theHardyTreeOldStPancrasChurchyard.jpg|thumb|The Hardy Tree, growing between gravestones moved while [[Thomas Hardy]] was working here]]\n\nDuring the 18th and 19th centuries, St Pancras was famous for its cemeteries: as well as the graveyard of Old St Pancras Church, it also contained the cemeteries of [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]], [[St Giles in the Fields]], [[St Andrew, Holborn]], [[St. George's Church, Bloomsbury]], and [[St George the Martyr Holborn|St George the Martyr, Holborn]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/MDX/StPancras/StPancrasHistory |title=St. Pancras |last=Hinson |first=Colin |year=2003 |website=GENUKI: UK & Ireland Genealogy |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> These were all closed under the [[Extramural Interment Act 1854|Extramural Interment Act]] in 1854; the parish was required to purchase land some distance away, and chose [[East Finchley]] for its new [[St Pancras Cemetery]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://stpancras.com/history |title=History |website=St Pancras International |publisher=HS1 Ltd |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> \n\nThe disused graveyard at St Pancras Old Church was left alone for over thirty years, until the building of the [[Midland Railway]] required the removal of many of the graves.

Particularly, he placed a number of gravestones around a tree, now known as \"the Hardy Tree\".<ref name=\"vweb\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/photos/hardy/74.html |title=The Hardy Tree, St Pancras Churchyard, London |date=2006-04-17 |website=The Victorian Web |access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> The cemetery was disturbed again in 2002\u201303 by the construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]], but much more care was given to the removal of remains than in the 19th century.\n\n==Political divisions==\nThe name St Pancras survives in the name of the local parliamentary [[constituency]], [[Holborn and St. Pancras (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St. Pancras]]. One of the political [[Ward (subnational entity)|wards]] in Camden is called St Pancras and Somers Town; however, ward boundaries are chosen to divide a borough into roughly equal slices with little regard to historical boundaries or day-to-day usage.
