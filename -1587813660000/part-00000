It was traditionally the entertainment hub of inner-city Melbourne, and is now also a popular tourist destination and tram [[thoroughfare]].\n\nDuring the ''[[Marvellous Melbourne]]'' era, Bourke Street was the location of many of the city's theatres and cinemas. Today it continues as a major [[retailer|retail shopping]] precinct with the Bourke Street Mall running between [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth]] and [[Swanston Street]]s, numerous offices to the west end and restaurants to the east.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM00219b.htm|title=Bourke Street|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> Bourke Street's liveliness and activity has often been contrasted with the sobering formality of nearby [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]].<ref name=\":0\" /> For this reason, \"Busier than Bourke Street\" is a popular [[colloquialism]] denoting a crowded or busy environment.\n\nBourke Street is named for Irish-born British army officer Sir [[Richard Bourke]], who served as the [[Governor of New South Wales]] from 1831 and 1837 during the drafting of the Hoddle Grid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historyvictoria.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Melbournes-Streets-and-Lanes_Discovery-Series-No.-2.pdf|publisher=The Royal Historical Society of Victoria|title=Melbourne's Streets & Lanes|accessdate=28 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610142042/http://www.historyvictoria.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Melbournes-Streets-and-Lanes_Discovery-Series-No.-2.pdf|archive-date=10 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n==Geography==\n[[File:Bourke Street, Melbourne in 1935.tif|thumb|left|Easterly view of Bourke Street, towards the Elizabeth Street intersection, ca 1935.]]\n\n[[File:D2.5007 + C2.5111 bourke.JPG|thumb|right|[[Melbourne tram route 96|Route 96 trams]] on Bourke Street]]\n\n[[File:Bourke Street Mall night view 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Bourke Street at night]]\n[[File:Pellegrini's cafe, Bourke Street, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|Pellegrini's cafe]]\n\nBourke Street runs roughly from east to west and bisects the city centre along its long axis.<ref>{{citation|title=Untitled|date=21 February 1885|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=BOPT18850221.2.16|work=Bay Of Plenty Times|volume=XIV|issue=1804|page=4}}</ref> Bourke Street runs parallel between [[Little Collins Street]] to the south and [[Little Bourke Street]] to the north.\n\nThere are two primary stretches of Bourke Street, split by [[Southern Cross railway station]]: the historic [[Melbourne central business district|city centre]] and the modern [[Docklands, Victoria|Docklands]] precinct. The city centre portion runs from [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]] in the east (overlooked by [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]]) to [[Spencer Street]] and Southern Cross station. The newer Docklands end continues on the other side of the station (which is only accessible to pedestrians) and finishes at its intersection with [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] further west.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tom Roberts-Allegro con brio, Bourke Street west c 1885-86.jpg|thumb|''[[Bourke Street (painting)|Bourke Street]]'' (1886) by [[Tom Roberts]], oil on canvas on composition board.]]\nHaving been laid out as part of the [[Hoddle Grid]] in 1837, Bourke Street was considered \"out of town\" until the 1840s when the western end saw the opening of St Patrick's Hall, the first synagogue and the first public hospital. During the 1850s it gained a reputation as a busy thoroughfare popular as the centre for Saturday nightlife. As retail presence increased the street was often compared to [[London]]'s [[Oxford Street]].\n\nMelbourne's first theatre opened on Bourke Street as the Pavilion (1841), and by the late 1840s the east end was established as Melbourne's main entertainment zone. Theatres and public halls were complemented by [[billiard hall]]s, cigar divans, rifle galleries, bowling alleys and sideshows. While the early evening crowd trod Bourke Street's pavements for entertainment or for show, the night-time street was also notorious for public disorder, fights, brothel touts and drinking and drunkenness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCheap restaurants appeared from the 1870s, when ''Parer's Hotel and Crystal Tea Rooms'' <ref>[https://parerhistory.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/parers-crystal-cafe-hotel/</ref> became a Melbourne institution, while the Caf\u00e9 de Paris was a favourite literary and artistic meeting place. Twentieth-century restaurants such as Florentino's, Pellegrini's and the Society Caf\u00e9 have become Melbourne institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe late 20th century onwards has resulted in office block developments, residential skyscrapers, the introduction of several shopping arcades and the Bourke Street Mall.\n\n==Bourke Street Mall==\nThe Bourke Street Mall is a pedestrian and tram-only strip running between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets. The mall is Bourke Street's most famous feature and contains retail hubs like [[General Post Office, Melbourne|Melbourne's GPO]], [[Myer]]'s [[flagship store]] and [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]' second flagship.\n\nConcepts for a Bourke Street Mall were drawn up as early as 1964 by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Frederick Romberg]]<ref>[http://gallery.slv.vic.gov.au/image.php?id=821 ''Bourke Street development'', Frederick Romberg and Robin Boyd, 1964, courtesy Robin Boyd Foundation and Diane Masters.  State Library of Victoria collection.]</ref> however the ambitious multi-platform design which separated cars from pedestrians was never realised. Plans were eventually scaled down with pedestrians sharing space with a grade level [[Trams in Melbourne|tramline]]. Vehicular traffic was removed from the section on 13 February 1978.<ref>\"City Section\" ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 175 April 1978 page 21</ref> The pedestrian mall was officially opened in 1983 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\nThe mall received a major facelift in preparation for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] and elevated tram super-stops were later installed.\n\nIn the [[January 2017 Melbourne car attack]], a mentally ill person driving a sedan being pursued by the police deliberately drove the vehicle onto the footpath and ran over innocent bystanders at Bourke Street Mall. The crime claimed the lives of six people, including one baby and one child. Over twenty-five victims were hospitalised with injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/live-pedestrians-hit-gunshots-heard-in-melbourne-cbd-20170120-gtvf3x.html|title=Live: CBD horror, three dead, 15 injured as car knocks down pedestrians|last=Butt|first=Craig|date=2017-01-20|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2018 Melbourne stabbing attack]] also took place near the Target Centre on Bourke Street. An [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] inspired male set fire to his [[Ute (vehicle)|ute]] before exiting the vehicle and stabbing three bystanders.

It was home to the city's first permanent cinema (although this was initially established near [[Princes Bridge, Melbourne|Princes Bridge]]), and by 1913 had developed into Melbourne's principal cinema precinct. In 1908, Arthur Russell began screening films at St. George's Hall, which was rebuilt as Hoyt's De Luxe Theatre in 1914, marking the beginning of the [[Hoyts]] cinema chain.\n\nBourke Street remained a centre for cinema-goers until quite recently. In 2005, the Hoyts cinema moved to larger premises at the [[Melbourne Central Shopping Centre]]. On 15 February 2006 the [[Village Roadshow|Village]] cinema closed down, leaving Village cinemas at nearby [[Crown Melbourne|Crown Casino]] as the main Village branded city cinemas. The Chinatown Cinema, which inhabits the former Hoyts MidCity cinema, is the only cinema left in Bourke Street. On nearby Collins Street, the newly expanded Kino Dendy cinemas continues to be a cinema drawcard. The adjacent Russell Street [[Greater Union]] cinemas closed in 2013 and has since been demolished.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal-inline|Australian Roads}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bourke Street, Melbourne}}\n*[https://www.visitvictoria.com/regions/melbourne/destinations/bourke-street-mall Bourke Street Mall] \u2013 Official government tourism site\n\n{{Melbourne CBD Streets}}\n\n[[Category:Streets in Melbourne]]\n[[Category:Melbourne City Centre]]\n[[Category:Pedestrian malls in Australia]]\n[[Category:Shopping districts and streets in Australia]]\n[[Category:Bourke Street, Melbourne]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Bourke Street|the painting by Tom Roberts|Bourke Street (painting)}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=August 2016}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox Australian road\n| type         = street\n| road_name    = Bourke Street\n| state        = vic\n| image        = BourkeStreetMall-rain.jpg\n| caption      = Bourke Street Mall, between [[Swanston Street]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]] looking west\n| coordinates_a  = {{Coord|-37.8139|144.96452|region:AU-VIC_type:landmark|display=inline, title}}\n| est          =\n| length       = 2\n|route=| direction_a  = West\n| end_a        = [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street, Docklands]]\n| exits        ={{AUshield|S|2}} [[Harbour Esplanade]]<br>[[Southern Cross railway station]]<br>{{AUshield|S|50}} [[Spencer Street]]<br>{{AUshield|S|60}} [[King Street, Melbourne|King Street]]<br>[[William Street, Melbourne|William Street]]<br>[[Queen Street, Melbourne|Queen Street]]<br>[[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]]<br>[[Swanston Street]]<br>[[Russell Street, Melbourne|Russell Street]]<br>[[Exhibition Street]] \n| direction_b  = East\n| end_b        = [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]], [[East Melbourne]]\n| through      = [[Melbourne central business district|Melbourne CBD]]\n| alternative_location_map=Australia Victoria metropolitan Melbourne\n}}\n\n'''Bourke Street''' is one of the main streets in the [[Melbourne central business district]] and a core feature of the [[Hoddle Grid]].

The city centre portion runs from [[Spring Street, Melbourne|Spring Street]] in the east (overlooked by [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]]) to [[Spencer Street]] and Southern Cross station. The newer Docklands end continues on the other side of the station (which is only accessible to pedestrians) and finishes at its intersection with [[Collins Street, Melbourne|Collins Street]] further west.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tom Roberts-Allegro con brio, Bourke Street west c 1885-86.jpg|thumb|''[[Bourke Street (painting)|Bourke Street]]'' (1886) by [[Tom Roberts]], oil on canvas on composition board.]]\nHaving been laid out as part of the [[Hoddle Grid]] in 1837, Bourke Street was considered \"out of town\" until the 1840s when the western end saw the opening of St Patrick's Hall, the first synagogue and the first public hospital. During the 1850s it gained a reputation as a busy thoroughfare popular as the centre for Saturday nightlife. As retail presence increased the street was often compared to [[London]]'s [[Oxford Street]].\n\nMelbourne's first theatre opened on Bourke Street as the Pavilion (1841), and by the late 1840s the east end was established as Melbourne's main entertainment zone. Theatres and public halls were complemented by [[billiard hall]]s, cigar divans, rifle galleries, bowling alleys and sideshows. While the early evening crowd trod Bourke Street's pavements for entertainment or for show, the night-time street was also notorious for public disorder, fights, brothel touts and drinking and drunkenness.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCheap restaurants appeared from the 1870s, when ''Parer's Hotel and Crystal Tea Rooms'' <ref>[https://parerhistory.wordpress.com/2017/11/24/parers-crystal-cafe-hotel/</ref> became a Melbourne institution, while the Caf\u00e9 de Paris was a favourite literary and artistic meeting place. Twentieth-century restaurants such as Florentino's, Pellegrini's and the Society Caf\u00e9 have become Melbourne institutions.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe late 20th century onwards has resulted in office block developments, residential skyscrapers, the introduction of several shopping arcades and the Bourke Street Mall.\n\n==Bourke Street Mall==\nThe Bourke Street Mall is a pedestrian and tram-only strip running between Swanston and Elizabeth Streets. The mall is Bourke Street's most famous feature and contains retail hubs like [[General Post Office, Melbourne|Melbourne's GPO]], [[Myer]]'s [[flagship store]] and [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]]' second flagship.\n\nConcepts for a Bourke Street Mall were drawn up as early as 1964 by [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] and [[Frederick Romberg]]<ref>[http://gallery.slv.vic.gov.au/image.php?id=821 ''Bourke Street development'', Frederick Romberg and Robin Boyd, 1964, courtesy Robin Boyd Foundation and Diane Masters.  State Library of Victoria collection.]</ref> however the ambitious multi-platform design which separated cars from pedestrians was never realised. Plans were eventually scaled down with pedestrians sharing space with a grade level [[Trams in Melbourne|tramline]]. Vehicular traffic was removed from the section on 13 February 1978.<ref>\"City Section\" ''[[Trolley Wire]]'' issue 175 April 1978 page 21</ref> The pedestrian mall was officially opened in 1983 by [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].\n\nThe mall received a major facelift in preparation for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] and elevated tram super-stops were later installed.\n\nIn the [[January 2017 Melbourne car attack]], a mentally ill person driving a sedan being pursued by the police deliberately drove the vehicle onto the footpath and ran over innocent bystanders at Bourke Street Mall. The crime claimed the lives of six people, including one baby and one child. Over twenty-five victims were hospitalised with injuries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/victoria/live-pedestrians-hit-gunshots-heard-in-melbourne-cbd-20170120-gtvf3x.html|title=Live: CBD horror, three dead, 15 injured as car knocks down pedestrians|last=Butt|first=Craig|date=2017-01-20|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2018 Melbourne stabbing attack]] also took place near the Target Centre on Bourke Street.

The name of the species is doubly apt, as not only is the flower of ''Stellera chamaejasme'' fragrant like that of jasmine, but it also has a corolla with a wine-red exterior, like that of certain species of jasmine.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.

The oldest rootstocks of this plant can reach the size of a large carrot, and [if taken as medicine] produce the most violent effects. Such old roots can produce more than fifty - and sometimes as many as a hundred - flowering shoots, which, crowned with their beautiful and fragrant flowers, give not the least hint of the violent and pernicious effects residing in the root that bore them. The exterior of the flower is usually of a dark reddish-purple, or, more rarely [[sulphur]]-yellow colour; while the interior is white. Add to this the fact that the flowers display, upon opening, a white border and in the middle a red or yellow patch, and the flowers present the most [[Beauty|ravishing]] aspect. The young [[Evenk|Tungus]] boys are in the habit of adorning their bare heads with a kind of hat which they create most artistically by interweaving whole flowering stems of the plant. On this plant one often finds a flower in which two normal flowers seem fused into one, bearing a corolla with nine lobes and eighteen stamens arranged in two rows.

It is operated by [[MediaWorks New Zealand]].\n\nMore FM broadcasts in 25 centres throughout New Zealand on 83 transmitters with a mix of local and network programming. The station targets a 25 to 49 year old audience and has the most local shows of any radio network in New Zealand. Currently there are 12 different breakfast shows and 15 day shows.\n\nThe More FM network has grown from a local Wellington station to a large Network brand developed through expansion, acquisitions and re-branding of local stations already owned by MediaWorks.\n\nMore FM remained New Zealand's number 1 music radio station for all 4 rating surveys in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/first-2018-radio-survey-shows-more-people-are-listening-to-mediaworks-radio-than-ever-before.html|title=First 2018 radio survey shows NZ's overall listenership has increased again|date=2018-05-03|work=Newshub|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n''More FM'', with the on air position of \"Not to Heavy, Not too Soft\", first began in Wellington on 6 May 1991 as a local radio station. The very first station was started by Doug Gold and Craig Thompson; previously Doug Gold was the managing director of Wellington radio station [[Radio Windy]]. Gold and Thompson were joined by fellow investors Chris Muirhead, Simon \"Swampy\" Marsh, Lyn Chung and Bill Mathieson.The very first song to play on the first More FM station by Breakfast Show hosts Simon \"Swampy\" Marsh and Anemarie Gold was [[Rhythm of My Heart]] by [[Rod Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=212815|title=Doug Gold: The More FM Story|date=1 September 2001|accessdate=5 January 2015 }}</ref> In the early nineties More FM began broadcasting in Christchurch and Auckland, both as local stations separate from the Wellington station.\n\n===Change of ownership===\nIn the late nineties More FM's parent company The More FM Group was sold to [[CanWest|CanWest Mediaworks]] who at the time were the owners of [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] New Zealand; the sale also included [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] in Wellington and [[Channel Z (New Zealand radio station)|Channel Z]]. Programming was extended to Dunedin in 1997 as a local station but networked from Christchurch during breakfast and evenings. A fifth More FM station was started in the Waikato in 1999 as a totally local station.\n\nIn 2000 [[CanWest|CanWest Mediaworks]] purchased [[RadioWorks]] which at that stage was operating 4 network brands across New Zealand and a local station in most markets across New Zealand. RadioWorks later became known as MediaWorks.\n\n===Expansion to other regions===\nIn 2004 MediaWorks began nationalising many of their local stations previously marketed as [[LocalWorks]] stations. Regions with just one local station had their station rebranded as More FM, regions with more than one local station typically had the station considered to be the flagship station in that area rebranded as More FM and secondary stations rebranded as [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]]. Some markets had secondary local stations replaced with a network station run by MediaWorks. The changes saw More FM extended to more than 15 markets with all stations initially retaining their local announcers up to 7pm. The number of stations was later expanded to 24 after further station re-branding as well as MediaWorks purchasing other independent stations.\n\n===Introduction of network programming===\n\n====Network Night show====\nNetwork programming on More FM began with the Evening and overnight shows in January 2005. The 'More FM Most Wanted' Night show was originally hosted by [[Dominic Bowden]] until the middle of 2005 and then by Tarsha Tolson until the middle of 2007 when Tarsha moved to Wellington to co-host the More FM breakfast show. The overnight show was originally hosted by Asher Bastion until he left to go to [[Life FM (radio network)|Life FM]] in June 2006. Since 2015 the night show is currently hosted by [[Joe Cotton]] .\n\n====Network Drive and daytime shows====\nIn August 2009 the first Network Drive show was created. The Wellington weekday Drive show team, 'Josh & Tom' Josh van Berkel and Tom McKenzie (ex-Classic Hits South Canterbury) were re-located to Auckland and their show was networked into 19 of the 22 More FM markets over the following months.\n\nIn March 2011 Josh & Tom announced they were leaving More FM. The structure of the day was reworked ending the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up. From 4 April 2011 the More FM stations were local in all markets with the network programming starting at 1pm, an hour earlier. The afternoon lineup consisted of a 1pm-4pm Afternoon show hosted by former More FM Waikato breakfast host Stu Tolan and a 4-7pm Drive show hosted by media personality [[Clarke Gayford]]. Christchurch, Manawatu and Nelson were the exception to the change in format as these stations continued to broadcast locally up to 7pm until 2015.\n\nNetworked programming during the daytime began in 2013 with the introduction of a show presented by Geoff Stagg from Wellington and networked to selected regions.\n\nIn 2015 More FM reverted to the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up and local programming was extended in some markets to run between 6am - 3pm or 10am - 3pm for those markets taking the networked breakfast show. From 2014, Jason Gunn and Lana Searle hosted the 3pm - 7pm show, before Lana was replaced by [[Jay-Jay Feeney]] in 2018. Paul '[[Flynny]]' Flynn joined the show in 2019, as Jason Gunn moved to co-host the show part-time. Since April 2020, the drive show is hosted by Jay-Jay and Flynny, along with producer George Smith <ref>{{cite web |title=More FM Shows |url=https://www.morefm.co.nz/home/shows.html |website=More FM |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n====Network breakfast====\nIn 2007, the More FM Christchurch breakfast show, then presented by Si and Gary, was networked into the Nelson region.\nIn October 2011, More FM Auckland breakfast presenter [[Jeremy Corbett]] resigned from his long standing breakfast show. Marc Ellis was announced as his replacement along with Amber Peebles & Stu Tolan. In November 2011 an announcement was made that new Auckland based breakfast show would networked into the Waikato and Wellington region. The 'local' daytime host read out local news and weather in their respective region as part of the networked breakfast show from 6am to 10am. In December 2012 Amber Peebles left the show to pursue a television project. Her replacement was [[Hayley Holt]]. Marc Ellis left the show in October 2013. Stu and Hayley continued to present the network breakfast for the remainder of 2013, along with Joe Cotton.\n\nIn 2014 the Christchurch breakfast, then presented by Si and Gary, became the new network breakfast show and continued to be presented from Christchurch. In April 2015 the networked breakfast was extended to Dunedin and Hawkes Bay with the local presenters in those markets moved to the local [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] station in their respective markets. The show is now presented by [[Lana Searle]] [[Gary McCormick]] and [[Jason 'JMac' Mac]].\n\nIn July 2017, Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kereama launched a Wellington-based breakfast show, which also airs in Kapiti/Horowhenua. In January 2018 this show was networked into five other markets, but in 2020 the show reverted to a local Wellington breakfast show.\n\n====Weekend programming====\nOriginally weekend programming on all More FM stations remained local after the expansion and rebranding in 2005 including during Saturday and Sunday evenings and overnight. A networked evening show for weekends was introduced in late 2005. More FM began replacing local programming at the weekends with networked programming from 2007 onwards initially networking stations after 2pm. From 2014 all More FM stations were local on Saturday morning from 6am to 10am, with Auckland and Christchurch local to 7pm.\n\n==The More FM network==\nNetworked shows on the More FM stations either originate from the Auckland or Christchurch studios.\n\n'''Breakfast''' There are 10 local shows throughout NZ and one network shows.

A networked workday show presented by Tyler McDonald from the Auckland studios can be heard in Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga, Gisborne/Wairoa, Taranaki, Manawatu, Wairarapa, Central Otago, Queenstown, Clutha and Southland.\n\n'''Drivetime & Nighttime''' The network drive show is hosted by Jay-Jay Feeney and Paul \"Flynny\" Flynn, followed by an evening show presented by [[Joe Cotton]] Sunday to Thursday. All More FM stations are networked between 3pm and 5am.\n\n'''Weekends''' Most More FMs run a local Saturday breakfast show.

Today the station is known as '''95-3 99-7 More FM Wellington''', again following a change in frequency.\n\nIn 2007 the 98.9&nbsp;MHz frequency originally used by More FM Wellington was relocated to 94.7&nbsp;MHz (formerly used by Channel Z) and provided coverage to the [[Hutt Valley]] area of Wellington. The more powerful 100&nbsp;MHz frequency provided coverage to the majority of the Wellington urban area, and could often be heard at the top of the [[South Island]] and into the southern [[Wairarapa]]. In 2010, the station frequencies were moved to 95.3 and 99.7 respectively after a nationwide reorganisation of the FM band. The main transmitter is located atop [[Mount Kaukau]] in Khandallah, 6&nbsp;km north of central Wellington, and broadcasts on 99.7.

Networking of Si and Gary's breakfast show to Dunedin was discontinued at the end of 2004 following the changes made to the network at the time. The show was then networked to Nelson since 2007 and in 2014 became the new More FM network breakfast show, networked to various More FM stations across the country.

In recent years the station was branded as '''More FM's Big River Radio''' during local programming. Local programming was removed in 2017 with local announcer Brad Jeffrey moved to Dunedin to present a local daytime show for Dunedin and Balclutha. Today More FM Clutha runs network programming at all times with local station ids and adverts.\n\n===Queenstown, Wanaka and Central Otago===\n'''More FM Queenstown, Wanaka and Central Otago''' broadcasts on 92.0, 99.4 90.3 and 94.3&nbsp;MHz and covers [[Queenstown, New Zealand|Queenstown]], [[Wanaka, New Zealand|Wanaka]], [[Alexandra, New Zealand|Alexandra]], [[Cromwell, New Zealand|Cromwell]] and other parts of Central Otago.

More FM also continued to broadcast on 1224 AM until October 2007 when [[BSport]] launched on this frequency. The 91.6&nbsp;MHz frequency that Radio Pacific (BSport's predecessor) broadcast on was used to launch [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] into Southland.

The station broadcast on 91.9&nbsp;MHz from studios in Hastings Street and featured Peter Mac (McIlwaine) and Nicki Sunderland on breakfast. Other announcers included Kyllee Higgins (now Kyllee King-Turner), Scotty Mac, Nik Menzies, Cath White, James Milner, Grant Magrath (pre-recorded mid-dawns) Kev Stanton and Greg Wattam. The station's slogan was 'More Music, More Variety' which was in line with the other More FM stations around the country at that time. The station was operated as a franchise by Radio Otago. In 1996, 92 More FM was relocated to Hastings where it joined fellow Radio Otago station Hot 93 in the BNZ Building. Live content was reduced around this time with the night show being fully automated. In 1997 Radio Otago sold their 7 North Island stations to [[Energy Enterprises]], at this point the More FM branding was dropped and later the station was replaced with network station [[Solid Gold (radio)|Solid Gold FM]]. Solid Gold has since been rebranded as The Sound.\n\n'''Kapiti's 99.6 More FM''' began transmission across the Kapiti Coast and Horowhenua regions around 1994 and remained on air until 2004 when it was replaced by The Breeze. The station's programming was generated from More FM in Wellington, although it ran an entirely separate program to the Wellington station outside of breakfast. Voicebreaks were recorded in advance by the announcer in the Wellington studio. Localised weather forecasts, station IDs and jingles also helped create a local sound. 99.6 More FM played a slightly different music mix to the Wellington station where its programming originated from, although they both shared the 'More Music, More Variety' and later 'Today's Best Music Mix' slogans.\n\n'''Dunedin's 98 More FM''' began broadcasting in Dunedin around 1997. The breakfast show, originally presented by Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford was a simulcast from Christchurch's 92 More FM. Other shows were a mixture of locally produced shows and shows prerecorded also from More FM in Christchurch.\n98 More FM was replaced with a simulcast of The Breeze Christchurch when local station [[4XO]] was rebranded as 97.4 More FM.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.morefm.co.nz/ More FM's official website]\n* [http://www.mediaworks.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=74 RadioWorks Information Site About More FM]\n\n{{MediaWorks (New Zealand)}}\n{{New Zealand radio networks}}\n{{coord missing|New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:More FM|*]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use New Zealand English|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2009}}\n{{Infobox Radio Station |\n\n[[File:Https://www.morefm.co.nz/design/clientlibs/assets/morefm/imgs/ui/logo-desktop.svg|frameless|center|Current More Fm logo]]\n name      =  |\n  airdate   = |\n  frequency = |\n  area      = 25 markets in New Zealand |\n  format    = [[Adult contemporary music]], [[Pop music]] |\n  owner     = [[MediaWorks Radio]] |\n  erp       = |\n  branding  = |\n  slogan    = \"Today's Best Music Mix\" |\n  class     = |\n  webcast   = http://www.morefm.co.nz/home.player.html|\n  website   = http://www.morefm.co.nz/ |\n  callsign_meaning =  |\n|city=|coordinates=}}\n\n'''More FM''' is a New Zealand [[radio network]] playing [[adult contemporary music]] or [[Pop music]]. It is operated by [[MediaWorks New Zealand]].\n\nMore FM broadcasts in 25 centres throughout New Zealand on 83 transmitters with a mix of local and network programming. The station targets a 25 to 49 year old audience and has the most local shows of any radio network in New Zealand. Currently there are 12 different breakfast shows and 15 day shows.\n\nThe More FM network has grown from a local Wellington station to a large Network brand developed through expansion, acquisitions and re-branding of local stations already owned by MediaWorks.\n\nMore FM remained New Zealand's number 1 music radio station for all 4 rating surveys in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/entertainment/2018/05/first-2018-radio-survey-shows-more-people-are-listening-to-mediaworks-radio-than-ever-before.html|title=First 2018 radio survey shows NZ's overall listenership has increased again|date=2018-05-03|work=Newshub|access-date=2018-06-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\n''More FM'', with the on air position of \"Not to Heavy, Not too Soft\", first began in Wellington on 6 May 1991 as a local radio station. The very first station was started by Doug Gold and Craig Thompson; previously Doug Gold was the managing director of Wellington radio station [[Radio Windy]]. Gold and Thompson were joined by fellow investors Chris Muirhead, Simon \"Swampy\" Marsh, Lyn Chung and Bill Mathieson.The very first song to play on the first More FM station by Breakfast Show hosts Simon \"Swampy\" Marsh and Anemarie Gold was [[Rhythm of My Heart]] by [[Rod Stewart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=212815|title=Doug Gold: The More FM Story|date=1 September 2001|accessdate=5 January 2015 }}</ref> In the early nineties More FM began broadcasting in Christchurch and Auckland, both as local stations separate from the Wellington station.\n\n===Change of ownership===\nIn the late nineties More FM's parent company The More FM Group was sold to [[CanWest|CanWest Mediaworks]] who at the time were the owners of [[TV3 (New Zealand)|TV3]] New Zealand; the sale also included [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] in Wellington and [[Channel Z (New Zealand radio station)|Channel Z]]. Programming was extended to Dunedin in 1997 as a local station but networked from Christchurch during breakfast and evenings. A fifth More FM station was started in the Waikato in 1999 as a totally local station.\n\nIn 2000 [[CanWest|CanWest Mediaworks]] purchased [[RadioWorks]] which at that stage was operating 4 network brands across New Zealand and a local station in most markets across New Zealand. RadioWorks later became known as MediaWorks.\n\n===Expansion to other regions===\nIn 2004 MediaWorks began nationalising many of their local stations previously marketed as [[LocalWorks]] stations. Regions with just one local station had their station rebranded as More FM, regions with more than one local station typically had the station considered to be the flagship station in that area rebranded as More FM and secondary stations rebranded as [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]]. Some markets had secondary local stations replaced with a network station run by MediaWorks. The changes saw More FM extended to more than 15 markets with all stations initially retaining their local announcers up to 7pm. The number of stations was later expanded to 24 after further station re-branding as well as MediaWorks purchasing other independent stations.\n\n===Introduction of network programming===\n\n====Network Night show====\nNetwork programming on More FM began with the Evening and overnight shows in January 2005. The 'More FM Most Wanted' Night show was originally hosted by [[Dominic Bowden]] until the middle of 2005 and then by Tarsha Tolson until the middle of 2007 when Tarsha moved to Wellington to co-host the More FM breakfast show. The overnight show was originally hosted by Asher Bastion until he left to go to [[Life FM (radio network)|Life FM]] in June 2006. Since 2015 the night show is currently hosted by [[Joe Cotton]] .\n\n====Network Drive and daytime shows====\nIn August 2009 the first Network Drive show was created. The Wellington weekday Drive show team, 'Josh & Tom' Josh van Berkel and Tom McKenzie (ex-Classic Hits South Canterbury) were re-located to Auckland and their show was networked into 19 of the 22 More FM markets over the following months.\n\nIn March 2011 Josh & Tom announced they were leaving More FM. The structure of the day was reworked ending the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up. From 4 April 2011 the More FM stations were local in all markets with the network programming starting at 1pm, an hour earlier. The afternoon lineup consisted of a 1pm-4pm Afternoon show hosted by former More FM Waikato breakfast host Stu Tolan and a 4-7pm Drive show hosted by media personality [[Clarke Gayford]]. Christchurch, Manawatu and Nelson were the exception to the change in format as these stations continued to broadcast locally up to 7pm until 2015.\n\nNetworked programming during the daytime began in 2013 with the introduction of a show presented by Geoff Stagg from Wellington and networked to selected regions.\n\nIn 2015 More FM reverted to the traditional Breakfast/Day/Drive line up and local programming was extended in some markets to run between 6am - 3pm or 10am - 3pm for those markets taking the networked breakfast show. From 2014, Jason Gunn and Lana Searle hosted the 3pm - 7pm show, before Lana was replaced by [[Jay-Jay Feeney]] in 2018. Paul '[[Flynny]]' Flynn joined the show in 2019, as Jason Gunn moved to co-host the show part-time. Since April 2020, the drive show is hosted by Jay-Jay and Flynny, along with producer George Smith <ref>{{cite web |title=More FM Shows |url=https://www.morefm.co.nz/home/shows.html |website=More FM |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref>.\n\n====Network breakfast====\nIn 2007, the More FM Christchurch breakfast show, then presented by Si and Gary, was networked into the Nelson region.\nIn October 2011, More FM Auckland breakfast presenter [[Jeremy Corbett]] resigned from his long standing breakfast show. Marc Ellis was announced as his replacement along with Amber Peebles & Stu Tolan. In November 2011 an announcement was made that new Auckland based breakfast show would networked into the Waikato and Wellington region. The 'local' daytime host read out local news and weather in their respective region as part of the networked breakfast show from 6am to 10am. In December 2012 Amber Peebles left the show to pursue a television project. Her replacement was [[Hayley Holt]]. Marc Ellis left the show in October 2013. Stu and Hayley continued to present the network breakfast for the remainder of 2013, along with Joe Cotton.\n\nIn 2014 the Christchurch breakfast, then presented by Si and Gary, became the new network breakfast show and continued to be presented from Christchurch. In April 2015 the networked breakfast was extended to Dunedin and Hawkes Bay with the local presenters in those markets moved to the local [[The Breeze (New Zealand)|The Breeze]] station in their respective markets. The show is now presented by [[Lana Searle]] [[Gary McCormick]] and [[Jason 'JMac' Mac]].\n\nIn July 2017, Pauline Gillespie and Grant Kereama launched a Wellington-based breakfast show, which also airs in Kapiti/Horowhenua. In January 2018 this show was networked into five other markets, but in 2020 the show reverted to a local Wellington breakfast show.\n\n====Weekend programming====\nOriginally weekend programming on all More FM stations remained local after the expansion and rebranding in 2005 including during Saturday and Sunday evenings and overnight. A networked evening show for weekends was introduced in late 2005. More FM began replacing local programming at the weekends with networked programming from 2007 onwards initially networking stations after 2pm. From 2014 all More FM stations were local on Saturday morning from 6am to 10am, with Auckland and Christchurch local to 7pm.\n\n==The More FM network==\nNetworked shows on the More FM stations either originate from the Auckland, Wellington or Christchurch studios.\n\n'''Breakfast''' There are 10 local shows throughout NZ and 2 network shows. Jason \"JMac\" Mac, [[Gary McCormick]] and Lana Searle present a networked breakfast show from the More FM Christchurch studios to listeners in Auckland, Tauranga, Hawkes Bay, Nelson, Marlborough, Christchurch, South Canterbury, Dunedin & Clutha. \n\n'''Workday''' \"Workplace Social Club\" programming runs from 10am to 3pm and some markets have a local show during this time. A networked workday show presented by Tyler McDonald from the Auckland studios can be heard in Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga, Gisborne/Wairoa, Taranaki, Manawatu, Wairarapa, Central Otago, Queenstown, Clutha and Southland.\n\n'''Drivetime & Nighttime''' The network drive show is hosted by Jay-Jay Feeney and Paul \"Flynny\" Flynn, followed by an evening show presented by [[Joe Cotton]] Sunday to Thursday. All More FM stations are networked between 3pm and 5am.\n\n'''Weekends''' Most More FMs run a local Saturday breakfast show. [[Pauline Gillespie]] and [[Grant Kereama]] host Auckland, Waikato, Tauranga, Rotorua, Hawkes Bay & Wanganui.

The station's programming was generated from More FM in Wellington, although it ran an entirely separate program to the Wellington station outside of breakfast. Voicebreaks were recorded in advance by the announcer in the Wellington studio. Localised weather forecasts, station IDs and jingles also helped create a local sound. 99.6 More FM played a slightly different music mix to the Wellington station where its programming originated from, although they both shared the 'More Music, More Variety' and later 'Today's Best Music Mix' slogans.\n\n'''Dunedin's 98 More FM''' began broadcasting in Dunedin around 1997. The breakfast show, originally presented by Simon Barnett and Phil Gifford was a simulcast from Christchurch's 92 More FM. Other shows were a mixture of locally produced shows and shows prerecorded also from More FM in Christchurch.\n98 More FM was replaced with a simulcast of The Breeze Christchurch when local station [[4XO]] was rebranded as 97.4 More FM.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.morefm.co.nz/ More FM's official website]\n* [http://www.mediaworks.co.nz/Default.aspx?tabid=74 RadioWorks Information Site About More FM]\n\n{{MediaWorks (New Zealand)}}\n{{New Zealand radio networks}}\n{{coord missing|New Zealand}}\n\n[[Category:More FM|*]]\n", "name_user": "SNZ 1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Updated network schedule", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/More_FM"}

Written by [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]] and directed by [[Guillem Morales]], the episode was first shown on 7 March 2017, on [[BBC Two]]. \"Empty Orchestra\" is set in a [[karaoke]] booth, and follows a group of work colleagues\u2014Greg (Shearsmith), Fran ([[Sarah Hadland]]), Connie ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), Janet (Emily Howlett) and Duane ([[Javone Prince]])\u2014celebrating the promotion of Roger (Pemberton). Rebekah Hinds also stars.\n\n\"Empty Orchestra\" is close to a [[musical film|musical]]. The characters sing throughout much of the episode, with the story being told through the lyrics and the way the characters interact during songs. In comparison to other episodes of ''Inside No. 9'', \"Empty Orchestra\" is upbeat, features [[Romance film|romantic]] elements, and lacks explicitly bloody or [[macabre]] references. The filming experience and resulting episode was a highlight of the series for Pemberton, but raised technical challenges, in part due to simultaneous singing and talking.\n\nTelevision critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. In both ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]'', it was characterised as weaker than others in the series. The change in tone dividing commentators, some of whom found the setting and constant noise a distraction. The writing and production, however, were praised, while the cast were commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept.\n\n==Production==\nThe third series of ''Inside No. 9'' was announced in October 2015, and was heavily publicised beginning in January 2016, at which time [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Javone Prince]] and [[Tamzin Outhwaite]] were named as guest stars in the series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9 gets a third series|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Dowell, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Keeley Hawes and Jessica Raine to star in the new series of Inside No. 9|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Travis, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Inside No 9: Keeley Hawes, Philip Glenister, and Morgana Robinson confirmed as Series 3 starts shooting|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> \"Empty Orchestra\" was the fourth episode of the series, and the third of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017\u2014the series's first episode being the December 2016 [[Christmas special]] \"[[The Devil of Christmas]]\".

The sides of the set could be removed for filming purposes, but, for the most part, the performers were confined.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n\"Empty Orchestra\" was originally intended as a wholly [[Musical film|musical episode]].<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> The initial [[conceit]] was that the story would be wholly told through song, but this was not possible. For Shearsmith, the reality of this was difficult to maintain; on the [[episode commentary]], Pemberton expressed a wish that there was less dialogue. The closest example to the original intention of storytelling wholly through singing in the final episode was the performance of \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\".<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Nonetheless, the resulting episode, for Pemberton, was \"a kind of musical\", in that \"there's music all the way through it\".<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> While he would be interested in doing \"a proper ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]''-style musical\" in the future, \"Empty Orchestra\" serves to \"[tick] that box to some degree\".<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised \"Empty Orchestra\", was also \"very appealing\".<ref name=\"BCG interview\"/> Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of ''Inside No. 9''.<ref name=\"BCG interview\"/> At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode \"[[The Riddle of the Sphinx (Inside No. 9)|The Riddle of the Sphinx]]\", Pemberton said that \"When you\u2019ve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, you kind of go, well, better try something different!\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> One influence on the episode was [[Shane Meadows]]'s ''[[This Is England]]''; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film.<ref name=\"Bradford\"/>\n\n===Cast and filming===\n[[File:Tamzin Outhwaite 2015.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Tamzin Outhwaite]] ''(pictured, 2015)'' starred in \"Empty Orchestra\" as Connie, who is in [[fancy dress]] as [[Amy Winehouse]].]]\n\"Empty Orchestra\" stars Pemberton as Roger, who is celebrating a promotion with five colleagues: Greg, played by Shearsmith; Connie, played by Outhwaite; Fran, played by Hadland; Janet, played by Emily Howlett; and Duane, played by Prince.

She possesses, she explained, \"very little understanding of what constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody \u2013 I even struggle with the concept of 'high' and 'low' sounds\".<ref name=\"Howlett\"/> The song Janet sings\u2014\"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\" by [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]\u2014was particularly challenging.<ref name=\"Howlett\"/> Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a \"board of 'tune'\", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but \"In the end, it paid off, because I got the role. It was one of the best and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. I never once felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful.\"<ref name=\"Howlett\"/>\n\nThe writers opted to have the characters in [[fancy dress]] to add a layer of visual interest.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Outhwaite, Howlett, and Shearsmith expressed their enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode.<ref name=\"Howlett\"/><ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/><ref name=\"Bradford\"/> Shearsmith initially wore an inflatable sumo suit, but air in the suit produced sounds that interfered with music. The alternative suit was made of foam. Pemberton's character wore a very minimal costume, and Pemberton himself was mostly unchanged; he simply wore glasses and had his hair brushed forward.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nOuthwaite had long been a fan of ''Inside No. 9'' and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of ''[[Hotel Babylon]]''. She was particularly pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene.<ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> She loved her \"selfish, sad and manipulative\" character, Connie.<ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable.<ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite \"brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room\", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series.<ref name=\"Bradford\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which \"a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing.

Connie, dressed as [[Amy Winehouse]], arrives; the two kiss, but break apart when Greg's partner Fran (dressed as [[Britney Spears]]) enters. Roger arrives with his assistant Janet; Janet, who is deaf, is dressed as [[Boy George]], and Roger puts on a [[clown]]'s nose when prompted. The group are celebrating Roger's promotion and, to Greg's alarm, Roger has an envelope with a list of names. Fran begins singing [[Whigfield]]'s \"[[Saturday Night (Whigfield song)|Saturday Night]]\" before Duane, dressed as [[Michael Jackson]], arrives. He has the group play \"pills roulette\"; each take either [[MDMA|ecstasy]], [[Viagra]], [[ketamine]], [[Paracetamol]], a [[laxative]] or a [[Tic Tac]]. Roger is distracted, soon leaving for more drinks; Greg is keen to know what he has written, believing someone is being [[laid off]].\n\nDuane starts [[Wham!]]'s \"[[Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)|Wham Rap!]]\"; Janet \"listens\" by placing her hand on the speaker, until Greg quizzes her on lay-offs. Connie takes Duane's phone to text Janet, and Roger returns with [[Shot glass|shots]], which he drinks alone. Janet's text from \"Duane\" asks her to sing him a song if she likes him. Watched by Janet, Connie tells Greg to make a choice between her and Fran. Roger starts [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]'s \"[[Since You Been Gone]]\" and Greg conspires with Connie and Fran to acquire the envelope. Roger, having danced with Connie, is aroused, but Duane says that all the pills were Tic Tacs. Greg finally reaches the envelope, and Fran's name is circled. Roger reveals that the envelope contains [[divorce]] papers; his wife is leaving him. Fran sings \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" ([[Elaine Paige]] and [[Barbara Dickson]]), first to Roger and then Greg. She duets with Connie, and, hugging Fran, Greg mouths to Connie that Fran is getting sacked. Connie and Fran, the latter oblivious, sing to each other, as Roger signs his divorce papers. When the song finishes, Greg sombrely talks to Fran.\n\nJanet sings [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\" to Duane, who stops the music after Fran whispers to him. Chastising Connie, Duane says that he does not like Janet \"in that way\". Roger steps in; someone has to be made redundant, but it will be him, and he has recommended that Fran be promoted. A [[hen do]] arrives in the booth, and a newcomer, Chantel, begins \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" ([[David Guetta]] and [[Sia (singer)|Sia]]). Watched by Janet, Connie confronts and kisses Greg; Roger meets eyes with a young woman. Connie mocks Janet, who reminds the former that she can lip read. Janet whispers to Fran, who confronts Greg and Connie; [[UV light]] reveals Connie's lipstick on Greg's mouth, and Fran tells them that they are both fired. Fran sings with Chantel, Roger dances with the young woman, and Greg and Connie argue. Duane and Janet meet eyes, and Duane places her hand on his chest; she feels his heartbeat as the two kiss.\n\n==Analysis==\n\"Empty Orchestra\" follows a relatively simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations and relevant song lyrics.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Phil Harrison, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', characterised the episode as \"a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them\".<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> Possibilities for [[macabre]] developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's \"pills\" are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list\u2014as revealed in his \"[[David Brent]]ish\" speech<ref name=\"Dessau\"/>\u2014has no sinister purpose.<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Butler\"/> Viewer expectations (and possible criticisms) are anticipated by Pemberton's Roger saying \"it's not just going to be one song after another, is it?\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\nMuch of the story is told by the songs, with the lyrics coordinating with the events of the story.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Empire\"/><ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><ref name=\"i\"/> For example, \"Don't You Want Me\" introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line \"we will both be sorry\"; this is unsung, but nonetheless emphasised. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing \"don't you want me?\" when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including \"Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And I can put you back there too\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Empty Orchestra\" had a mixed reception from television critics, being awarded four out of five by Mark Ward of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', three out of five by Ben Lawrence of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', and two out of five by the freelance journalist Dan Owen,<ref name=\"Ward\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/><ref name=\"Owen\"/> who claimed that he \"never warmed to\" the episode, but considered it nonetheless worth watching.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> The comedy critic [[Bruce Dessau]] called it \"a hit\",<ref name=\"Dessau\"/> and Mark Butler, of ''[[i (newspaper)|i]]'', offered a positive review of an episode that, for him, \"ended up being a down-to-earth, relatable and ultimately feel-good slice of drama\".<ref name=\"Butler\"/> Many critics characterised it as weaker than other episodes of ''Inside No. 9'',<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/><ref name=\"McDowall\"/> though both Julie McDowall (''[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]'') and Lawrence stressed the quality of the programme overall, emphasising that \"Empty Orchestra\" was still commendable.<ref name=\"McDowall\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> The more upbeat story was \"a refreshingly restrained change of pace for the show\" for Butler,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> and possessed its \"own charm\" for Owen.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Butler wrote that \"some will have no doubt been disappointed\" by the lack of a bloody climax, but that \"variety in tone and story is what helps make ''Inside No. 9'' work so well. You can't begrudge it a happy, straightforward ending every now and then.\"<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nThe episode's plot and production were praised. For Mellor, \"In barely any time at all, we'd been told a complete story that was satisfying, romantic and unexpectedly uplifting.\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Owen, similarly, argued that the episode \"achieved what it wanted to, ending with a fantastic reveal [concerning UV lights] and each of the storylines were resolved quite nicely\",<ref name=\"Owen\"/> though Lawrence felt that the \"twist\" involving Janet's ability to lip-read was \"obvious\".<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> Patrick Mulkern (''[[Radio Times]]'') commended the production, and the inclusion of Janet,<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/> while Phil Harrison (''[[The Guardian]]'') called the episode an \"object lesson in economical narrative\".<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> Mellor summarised the strength of the production and writing by saying that the elements \"slotted in with real efficiency. Seeding the UV light early on provided a satisfying pay-off, and the shifts to Janet's aural point of view, along with the use of subtitles and director Guillem Morales' continually inventive shifts in [point of view], kept things varied and lively.\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Nonetheless, she considered the costumes a missed opportunity, perceiving no meaning behind the choices.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> The episode's greatest achievement, for Mellor, was the \"lyrical cleverness\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\nA number of commentators were critical of the choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it \"illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget\",<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode.<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Shennan\"/> For Owen, it \"offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough\".<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Similarly, Lawrence felt that \"amid the karaoke din, it was hard to get a proper handle on the characters or, indeed, really care about their fates\".<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nWhile Owen did not consider the episode funny,<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Mellor called Roger's song \"(tragi) comedy gold to match the farcical comedy of Greg's perpetually thwarted heist attempts\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Lawrence described the characterisation as \"painted with the broadest of brush strokes, but that suited the super-annuated, hypercharged nature of the plot and the faintly camp dialogue\",<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> praising Pemberton in particular.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> The guest stars were praised for their willingness to support the episode's concept.<ref name=\"Tate\"/><ref name=\"Dessau\"/> Dessau picked out Outhwaite's performance as particularly strong;<ref name=\"Dessau\"/> both Mulkern and Lawrence praised Howlett,<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> with Mulkern saying that she put him \"in mind of a young [[Victoria Wood]] and the sympathetic women she used to bring to life\".<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Jeffery\">{{cite web|author=Jeffery, Morgan|date=15 February 2017|title= Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton reveal 9 secrets from Inside No. 9|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a821260/inside-no-9-series-3-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton-interview/|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Outhwaite\">{{cite web|title=Tamzin Outhwaite interview|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/interview/tamzin_outhwaite/|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Howlett\">{{cite web|author=Howlett, Emily|date=8 March 2017|title=Learning to \u2018sing\u2019 for my performance in last night\u2019s episode of the BBC\u2019s Inside No. 9|url=http://limpingchicken.com/2017/03/08/emily-howlett-learning-to-sing-for-my-performance-in-last-nights-episode-of-the-bbcs-inside-no-9/|publisher=The Limping Chicken|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BCG interview\">{{cite web|title=Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith Series 3 interview|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/interview/steve_pemberton_and_reece_shearsmith/|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/inside-no-9-actors-jealous-over-who-was-screenwriters-favourite-cast-member-35445555.html|title=Inside No 9 actors 'jealous over who was screenwriters' favourite cast member'|publisher=[[Independent.ie]]|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Owen\">{{cite web|author=Owen, Dan|date=9 March 2017|title= INSIDE \u21169 \u2014 \u2018Empty Orchestra\u2019|url=https://dansmediadigest.co.uk/inside-9-empty-orchestra-135a8c735d5b|publisher=Dan's Media Digest|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Mellor\">{{cite web|author=Mellor, Louisa|date=7 March 2017|title=Inside No. 9 series 3 episode 4 review: Empty Orchestra|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/inside-no-9/47756/inside-no-9-series-3-episode-4-review-empty-orchestra|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Lawrence\">{{cite news|author=Lawrence, Ben|date=7 March 2017|title= Inside No 9: Empty Orchestra -

Written by [[Steve Pemberton]] and [[Reece Shearsmith]] and directed by [[Guillem Morales]], the episode was first shown on 7 March 2017, on [[BBC Two]]. \"Empty Orchestra\" is set in a [[karaoke]] booth, and follows a group of work colleagues\u2014Greg (Shearsmith), Fran ([[Sarah Hadland]]), Connie ([[Tamzin Outhwaite]]), Janet (Emily Howlett) and Duane ([[Javone Prince]])\u2014celebrating the promotion of Roger (Pemberton). Rebekah Hinds also stars.\n\n\"Empty Orchestra\" is close to a [[musical film|musical]]. The characters sing throughout much of the episode, with the story being told through the lyrics and the way the characters interact during songs. In comparison to other episodes of ''Inside No. 9'', \"Empty Orchestra\" is upbeat, features [[Romance film|romantic]] elements, and lacks explicitly bloody or [[macabre]] references. The filming experience and resulting episode was a highlight of the series for Pemberton, but raised technical challenges, in part due to simultaneous singing and talking.\n\nTelevision critics had a mixed reaction to the episode. In both ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and ''[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]'', it was characterised as weaker than others in the series. The change in tone dividing commentators, some of whom found the setting and constant noise a distraction. The writing and production, however, were praised, while the cast were commended both for their performances and their willingness to embrace the episode's concept.\n\n==Production==\nThe third series of ''Inside No. 9'' was announced in October 2015, and was heavily publicised beginning in January 2016, at which time [[Sarah Hadland]], [[Javone Prince]] and [[Tamzin Outhwaite]] were named as guest stars in the series.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inside No. 9 gets a third series|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-10-21/inside-no-9-gets-a-third-series}}</ref><Ref>{{cite news|author=Dowell, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Keeley Hawes and Jessica Raine to star in the new series of Inside No. 9|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-20/keeley-hawes-and-jessica-raine-to-star-in-the-new-series-of-inside-no-9|publisher=[[RadioTimes.com]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Travis, Ben|date=20 January 2016|title=Inside No 9: Keeley Hawes, Philip Glenister, and Morgana Robinson confirmed as Series 3 starts shooting|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/inside-no-9-keeley-hawes-philip-glenister-and-morgana-robinson-confirmed-as-series-3-starts-shooting-a3160831.html|accessdate=19 March 2017}}</ref> \"Empty Orchestra\" was the fourth episode of the series, and the third of a run of five episodes beginning February 2017\u2014the series's first episode being the December 2016 [[Christmas special]] \"[[The Devil of Christmas]]\".

The sides of the set could be removed for filming purposes, but, for the most part, the performers were confined.<ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\n\"Empty Orchestra\" was originally intended as a wholly [[Musical film|musical episode]].<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> The initial [[conceit]] was that the story would be wholly told through song, but this was not possible. For Shearsmith, the reality of this was difficult to maintain; on the [[episode commentary]], Pemberton expressed a wish that there was less dialogue. The closest example to the original intention of storytelling wholly through singing in the final episode was the performance of \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\".<ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Nonetheless, the resulting episode, for Pemberton, was \"a kind of musical\", in that \"there's music all the way through it\".<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> While he would be interested in doing \"a proper ''[[La La Land (film)|La La Land]]''-style musical\" in the future, \"Empty Orchestra\" serves to \"[tick] that box to some degree\".<ref name=\"Jeffery\"/> The idea of a love story, which is how Pemberton characterised \"Empty Orchestra\", was also \"very appealing\".<Ref name=\"BCG interview\"/> Pemberton ultimately chose the episode as his favourite of the series, calling it very different to other episodes of ''Inside No. 9''.<Ref name=\"BCG interview\"/> At the series launch, speaking in reference to the previous episode \"[[The Riddle of the Sphinx (Inside No. 9)|The Riddle of the Sphinx]]\", Pemberton said that \"When you\u2019ve cut someone's bum off and eaten it, you kind of go, well, better try something different!\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> One influence on the episode was [[Shane Meadows]]'s ''[[This Is England]]''; Pemberton drew inspiration from the way that characters' enjoyment of music events was portrayed in the film.<ref name=\"Bradford\"/>\n\n===Cast and filming===\n[[File:Tamzin Outhwaite 2015.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Tamzin Outhwaite]] ''(pictured, 2015)'' starred in \"Empty Orchestra\" as Connie, who is in [[fancy dress]] as [[Amy Winehouse]].]]\n\"Empty Orchestra\" stars Pemberton as Roger, who is celebrating a promotion with five colleagues: Greg, played by Shearsmith; Connie, played by Outhwaite; Fran, played by Hadland; Janet, played by Emily Howlett; and Duane, played by Prince.

She possesses, she explained, \"very little understanding of what constitutes music, and no idea at all about things like keys, pitch or melody \u2013 I even struggle with the concept of 'high' and 'low' sounds\".<ref name=\"Howlett\"/> The song Janet sings\u2014\"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\" by [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]\u2014was particularly challenging.<ref name=\"Howlett\"/> Howlett sought help from the composer John Chambers, with whom she had previously worked, and with his help, learnt the song's rhythm and then placed the lyrics relative to it. Chambers then produced a \"board of 'tune'\", with words sung with a high note placed physically higher on the board, and Howlett tried various methods to train herself to sing different pitches. The whole process took a considerable amount of time, but \"In the end, it paid off, because I got the role. It was one of the best and most welcoming sets I've been on, especially in mainstream filming. I never once felt like a token Deaf, which is rare and beautiful.\"<ref name=\"Howlett\"/>\n\nThe writers opted to have the characters in [[fancy dress]] to add a layer of visual interest.<Ref name=\"Commentary\"/> Outhwaite, Howlett, and Shearsmith expressed their enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode.<ref name=\"Howlett\"/><ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/><Ref name=\"Bradford\"/> Shearsmith initially wore an inflatable sumo suit, but air in the suit produced sounds that interfered with music. The alternative suit was made of foam. Pemberton's character wore a very minimal costume, and Pemberton himself was mostly unchanged; he simply wore glasses and had his hair brushed forward.<Ref name=\"Commentary\"/>\n\nOuthwaite had long been a fan of ''Inside No. 9'' and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of ''[[Hotel Babylon]]''. She was particularly pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene.<Ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> She loved her \"selfish, sad and manipulative\" character, Connie.<Ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable.<ref name=\"Outhwaite\"/> Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite \"brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room\", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series.<ref name=\"Bradford\"/><ref name=\"Mitchell\"/> Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which \"a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing.

Connie, dressed as [[Amy Winehouse]], arrives; the two kiss, but break apart when Greg's partner Fran (dressed as [[Britney Spears]]) enters. Roger arrives with his assistant Janet; Janet, who is deaf, is dressed as [[Boy George]], and Roger puts on a [[clown]]'s nose when prompted. The group are celebrating Roger's promotion and, to Greg's alarm, Roger has an envelope with a list of names. Fran begins singing [[Whigfield]]'s \"[[Saturday Night (Whigfield song)|Saturday Night]]\" before Duane, dressed as [[Michael Jackson]], arrives. He has the group play \"pills roulette\"; each take either [[MDMA|ecstasy]], [[Viagra]], [[ketamine]], [[Paracetamol]], a [[laxative]] or a [[Tic Tac]]. Roger is distracted, soon leaving for more drinks; Greg is keen to know what he has written, believing someone is being [[laid off]].\n\nDuane starts [[Wham!]]'s \"[[Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)|Wham Rap!]]\"; Janet \"listens\" by placing her hand on the speaker, until Greg quizzes her on lay-offs. Connie takes Duane's phone to text Janet, and Roger returns with [[Shot glass|shots]], which he drinks alone. Janet's text from \"Duane\" asks her to sing him a song if she likes him. Watched by Janet, Connie tells Greg to make a choice between her and Fran. Roger starts [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]'s \"[[Since You Been Gone]]\" and Greg conspires with Connie and Fran to acquire the envelope. Roger, having danced with Connie, is aroused, but Duane says that all the pills were Tic Tacs. Greg finally reaches the envelope, and Fran's name is circled. Roger reveals that the envelope contains [[divorce]] papers; his wife is leaving him. Fran sings \"[[I Know Him So Well]]\" ([[Elaine Paige]] and [[Barbara Dickson]]), first to Roger and then Greg. She duets with Connie, and, hugging Fran, Greg mouths to Connie that Fran is getting sacked. Connie and Fran, the latter oblivious, sing to each other, as Roger signs his divorce papers. When the song finishes, Greg sombrely talks to Fran.\n\nJanet sings [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\" to Duane, who stops the music after Fran whispers to him. Chastising Connie, Duane says that he does not like Janet \"in that way\". Roger steps in; someone has to be made redundant, but it will be him, and he has recommended that Fran be promoted. A [[hen do]] arrives in the booth, and a newcomer, Chantel, begins \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\" ([[David Guetta]] and [[Sia (singer)|Sia]]). Watched by Janet, Connie confronts and kisses Greg; Roger meets eyes with a young woman. Connie mocks Janet, who reminds the former that she can lip read. Janet whispers to Fran, who confronts Greg and Connie; [[UV light]] reveals Connie's lipstick on Greg's mouth, and Fran tells them that they are both fired. Fran sings with Chantel, Roger dances with the young woman, and Greg and Connie argue. Duane and Janet meet eyes, and Duane places her hand on his chest; she feels his heartbeat as the two kiss.\n\n==Analysis==\n\"Empty Orchestra\" follows a relatively simple narrative of co-workers on a night out, telling several interweaved stories through body language, muffled conversations and relevant song lyrics.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Phil Harrison, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', characterised the episode as \"a study in communication breakdown; how people use booze, loud music and enforced jollity to fill the gaps between them\".<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> Possibilities for [[macabre]] developments are seeded in the early episode, but, contrary to viewer expectations, these possibilities are cut off; for example, Duane's \"pills\" are merely Tic Tacs, and Roger's list\u2014as revealed in his \"[[David Brent|David Brentish]]\" speech<ref name=\"Dessau\"/>\u2014has no sinister purpose.<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Butler\"/> Viewer expectations (and possible criticisms) are anticipated by Pemberton's Roger saying \"it's not just going to be one song after another, is it?\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\nMuch of the story is told by the songs, with the lyrics coordinating with the events of the story.<Ref name=\"Mellor\"/><ref name=\"Empire\"/><ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><Ref name=\"i\"/> For example, \"Don't You Want Me\" introduces the affair between Greg and Connie, allowing them to flirt in the presence of Fran. It pre-empts the result of their relationship with the line \"we will both be sorry\"; this is unsung, but nonetheless emphasised. The song also speaks to the relationship between Greg and Roger, with Greg singing \"don't you want me?\" when he fears that he will be fired, and tells of Greg's character with lines including \"Don't forget it's me who put you where you are now // And I can put you back there too\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n\"Empty Orchestra\" had a mixed reception from television critics, being awarded four out of five by Mark Ward of the ''[[Daily Express]]'', three out of five by Ben Lawrence of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', and two out of five by the freelance journalist Dan Owen,<Ref name=\"Ward\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/><ref name=\"Owen\"/> who claimed that he \"never warmed to\" the episode, but considered it nonetheless worth watching.<Ref name=\"Owen\"/> The comedy critic [[Bruce Dessau]] called it \"a hit\",<Ref name=\"Dessau\"/> and Mark Butler, of ''[[i (newspaper)|i]]'', offered a positive review of an episode that, for him, \"ended up being a down-to-earth, relatable and ultimately feel-good slice of drama\".<ref name=\"Butler\"/> Many critics characterised it as weaker than other episodes of ''Inside No. 9'',<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/><ref name=\"McDowall\"/> though both Julie McDowall (''[[The National (Scotland)|The National]]'') and Lawrence stressed the quality of the programme overall, emphasising that \"Empty Orchestra\" was still commendable.<Ref name=\"McDowall\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> The more upbeat story was \"a refreshingly restrained change of pace for the show\" for Butler,<ref name=\"Butler\"/> and possessed its \"own charm\" for Owen.<ref name=\"Owen\"/> Butler wrote that \"some will have no doubt been disappointed\" by the lack of a bloody climax, but that \"variety in tone and story is what helps make ''Inside No. 9'' work so well. You can't begrudge it a happy, straightforward ending every now and then.\"<ref name=\"Butler\"/>\n\nThe episode's plot and production were praised. For Mellor, \"In barely any time at all, we'd been told a complete story that was satisfying, romantic and unexpectedly uplifting.\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Owen, similarly, argued that the episode \"achieved what it wanted to, ending with a fantastic reveal [concerning UV lights] and each of the storylines were resolved quite nicely\",<Ref name=\"Owen\"/> though Lawrence felt that the \"twist\" involving Janet's ability to lip-read was \"obvious\".<Ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> Patrick Mulkern (''[[Radio Times]]'') commended the production, and the inclusion of Janet,<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/> while Phil Harrison (''[[The Guardian]]'') called the episode an \"object lesson in economical narrative\".<ref name=\"Harrison\"/> Mellor summarised the strength of the production and writing by saying that the elements \"slotted in with real efficiency. Seeding the UV light early on provided a satisfying pay-off, and the shifts to Janet's aural point of view, along with the use of subtitles and director Guillem Morales' continually inventive shifts in [point of view], kept things varied and lively.\"<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Nonetheless, she considered the costumes a missed opportunity, perceiving no meaning behind the choices.<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> The episode's greatest achievement, for Mellor, was the \"lyrical cleverness\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/>\n\nA number of commentators were critical of the choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it \"illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget\",<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode.<ref name=\"Owen\"/><ref name=\"Shennan\"/> For Owen, it \"offered a definite production challenge that was made to look effortless ... but an appreciation of how well something was made isn't enough\".<Ref name=\"Owen\"/> Similarly, Lawrence felt that \"amid the karaoke din, it was hard to get a proper handle on the characters or, indeed, really care about their fates\".<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/>\n\nWhile Owen did not consider the episode funny,<Ref name=\"Owen\"/> Mellor called Roger's song \"(tragi) comedy gold to match the farcical comedy of Greg's perpetually thwarted heist attempts\".<ref name=\"Mellor\"/> Lawrence described the characterisation as \"painted with the broadest of brush strokes, but that suited the super-annuated, hypercharged nature of the plot and the faintly camp dialogue\",<Ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> praising Pemberton in particular.<ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> The guest stars were praised for their willingness to support the episode's concept.<ref name=\"Tate\"/><ref name=\"Dessau\"/> Dessau picked out Outhwaite's performance as particularly strong;<ref name=\"Dessau\"/> both Mulkern and Lawrence praised Howlett,<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/><ref name=\"Lawrence\"/> with Mulkern saying that she put him \"in mind of a young [[Victoria Wood]] and the sympathetic women she used to bring to life\".<ref name=\"Mulkern\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Jeffery\">{{cite web|author=Jeffery, Morgan|date=15 February 2017|title= Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton reveal 9 secrets from Inside No. 9|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/feature/a821260/inside-no-9-series-3-reece-shearsmith-steve-pemberton-interview/|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=29 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Outhwaite\">{{cite web|title=Tamzin Outhwaite interview|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/interview/tamzin_outhwaite/|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Howlett\">{{cite web|author=Howlett, Emily|date=8 March 2017|title=Learning to \u2018sing\u2019 for my performance in last night\u2019s episode of the BBC\u2019s Inside No. 9|url=http://limpingchicken.com/2017/03/08/emily-howlett-learning-to-sing-for-my-performance-in-last-nights-episode-of-the-bbcs-inside-no-9/|publisher=The Limping Chicken|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BCG interview\">{{cite web|title=Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith Series 3 interview|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/inside_no_9/interview/steve_pemberton_and_reece_shearsmith/|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|accessdate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"jealous\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/inside-no-9-actors-jealous-over-who-was-screenwriters-favourite-cast-member-35445555.html|title=Inside No 9 actors 'jealous over who was screenwriters' favourite cast member'|publisher=[[Independent.ie]]|date=13 February 2017|accessdate=10 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Owen\">{{cite web|author=Owen, Dan|date=9 March 2017|title= INSIDE \u21169 \u2014 \u2018Empty Orchestra\u2019|url=https://dansmediadigest.co.uk/inside-9-empty-orchestra-135a8c735d5b|publisher=Dan's Media Digest|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Mellor\">{{cite web|author=Mellor, Louisa|date=7 March 2017|title=Inside No. 9 series 3 episode 4 review: Empty Orchestra|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/uk/tv/inside-no-9/47756/inside-no-9-series-3-episode-4-review-empty-orchestra|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=1 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Lawrence\">{{cite news|author=Lawrence, Ben|date=7 March 2017|title= Inside No 9: Empty Orchestra -

The protests were sparked by a sudden increase of prices of food and other everyday items. As a result of the strikes, which were put down by the [[Polish People's Army]] and the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizen's Militia]], at least 42 people were killed and more than 1,000 wounded.\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1970 the government suddenly announced major increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, especially dairy products after a bad harvest throughout the course of that year.

With the consent of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in [[Moscow]], Gomu\u0142ka, Kliszko, and other leaders were forced to resign: if the price rises had been a plot against Gomu\u0142ka, it succeeded. Since Moscow would not accept [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new leader. The price increases were reversed, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised. Gierek went to Gda\u0144sk and met the workers, apologised for the mistakes of the past, promised a political renewal and said that as a worker himself he would now govern for the people.<ref name=\"Burda\">{{cite book | author = | coauthors = | title =Sejm Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej | year =1975 | editor =Andrzej Burda | pages =55 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Zak\u0142ad Narodowy im.

The protests were sparked by a sudden increase of prices of food and other everyday items. As a result of the strikes, which were put down by the [[Polish People's Army]] and the [[Milicja Obywatelska|Citizen's Militia]], at least 42 people were killed and more than 1,000 wounded.\n\n==Background==\nIn December 1970 the government suddenly announced major increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs, especially dairy products after a bad harvest throughout the course of that year. The rise in prices proved to be a major shock to ordinary citizens, especially in the larger cities.<ref name=\"Singer\">{{cite book | author =Daniel Singer | coauthors = | title =The Road to Gdansk | year =1981 | editor = | pages =157 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Monthly Review Press,U.S. | location = | isbn =0-85345-567-8| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=R1YKAAAAIAAJ&dq=Grudzie%C5%84+1970&q=December+1970 | format = | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n==Events==\nDemonstrations against the price rises broke out in the northern [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coastal cities of [[Gda\u0144sk]], [[Gdynia]], [[Elbl\u0105g]], and [[Szczecin]].

Only six people were reported dead by the government at the time. All those who died were buried overnight, with only the closest relatives present, in order to avoid spreading the riots.\n\n==Resolution==\nThe Party leadership met in [[Warsaw]] and decided that a full-scale working-class revolt was inevitable unless drastic steps were taken. With the consent of [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in [[Moscow]], Gomu\u0142ka, Kliszko, and other leaders were forced to resign: if the price rises had been a plot against Gomu\u0142ka, it succeeded. Since Moscow would not accept [[Mieczys\u0142aw Moczar]], [[Edward Gierek]] was drafted as the new leader. The price increases were reversed, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes were promised. Gierek went to Gda\u0144sk and met the workers, apologised for the mistakes of the past, promised a political renewal and said that as a worker himself he would now govern for the people.<ref name=\"Burda\">{{cite book | author = | coauthors = | title =Sejm Polskiej Rzeczypospolitej Ludowej | year =1975 | editor =Andrzej Burda | pages =55 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =[[Zak\u0142ad Narodowy im.
