It spread outward from '''Imerina''', the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] region primarily inhabited by the [[Merina people|Merina]] [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|ethnic group]] with a spiritual capital at [[Ambohimanga]] and a political capital {{convert|24|km}} west at [[Antananarivo]], currently the seat of government for the modern state of Madagascar. The Merina kings and queens who ruled over greater Madagascar in the 19th century were the descendants of a [[List of Imerina monarchs|long line of hereditary Merina royalty]] originating with [[Andriamanelo]], who is traditionally credited with founding Imerina in 1540.\n\n==History==\n\n===Hova-Vazimba conflict===\n[[File:Imerina countryside riziere rice paddies Madagascar.jpg|thumb|alt=colorful rice paddies cover rolling hills|Andriamanelo waged war against the Vazimba in an effort to expel them from the highlands.]]\nMadagascar's central highlands were first inhabited between 200 BCE\u2013300 CE by the island's earliest settlers,<ref name = prehistory>{{cite journal | last = Crowley | first = B.E. | title = A refined chronology of prehistoric Madagascar and the demise of the megafauna | journal = Quaternary Science Reviews | volume = 29 | issue = 19\u201320 | pages = 2591\u20132603 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1016/j.quascirev.2010.06.030|bibcode = 2010QSRv...29.2591C }}</ref> the [[Vazimba]], who appear to have arrived by [[pirogue]] from southeastern [[Borneo]] to establish simple villages in the island's dense forests.{{sfn|Dahl|1991|p=72}} By the 15th century the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hova]] people from the southeastern coast had gradually migrated into the central highlands<ref name=\"Campbell 1993\">{{cite journal | last = Campbell | first = Gwyn | title = The Structure of Trade in Madagascar, 1750\u20131810 | journal = The International Journal of African Historical Studies | volume = 26 | issue = 1 |pages = 111\u2013148 | year = 1993 | doi = 10.2307/219188 }}</ref> where they established hilltop villages interspersed among the existing Vazimba settlements, which were ruled by local kings and queens.{{sfn|Ranaivoson|2005|p=35}} The two peoples coexisted peacefully for several generations and are known to have intermarried.

Their oldest son, [[Andriamanelo]] (1540\u20131575), broke this tradition by launching a largely successful war to subjugate the surrounding Vazimba communities and force them to either submit to Hova dominance and assimilate, or flee.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=142}}\n\nAndriamanelo was succeeded by his son [[Ralambo]] (1575\u20131612), whose many enduring and significant political and cultural achievements earned him a heroic and near mythical status among the greatest ancient sovereigns of Merina history.<ref name=Ark2>{{Cite web|last=Buyers |first=Christopher |title=The Merina (or Hova) Dynasty: Imerina 2 |url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wcscsZk3?url=http://www.royalark.net/Madagascar/imerina2.htm |accessdate=October 8, 2010 |archivedate=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{Sfn|Bloch|1971|p=17}} Ralambo was the first to assign the name of Imerina (\"Land of the [[Merina people]]\") to the central highland territories where he ruled.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140\u2013154}}  Ralambo expanded and defended the Kingdom of Imerina through a combination of diplomacy and successful military action aided by the procurement of the first firearms in Imerina by way of trade with kingdoms on the coast. {{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=63\u201371}} Imposing a [[Tax per head|capitation tax]] for the first time (the ''vadin-aina'', or \"price of secure life\"), he was able to establish the first standing Merina royal army{{Sfn|Kent|1968|pp=517\u2013546}} and established units of blacksmiths and silversmiths to equip them.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} He famously repelled an attempted invasion by an army of the powerful western coastal [[Betsimisaraka people]].{{Sfn|Kent|1968|pp=517\u2013546}} According to oral history, the wild [[zebu]] cattle that roamed the Highlands were first domesticated for food in Imerina under the reign of Ralambo,{{Sfn|Bloch|1985|pp=631\u2013646}}{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141\u2013142}} and he introduced the practice and design of cattle pen construction,{{Sfn|Bloch|1985|pp=631\u2013646}} as well as the traditional ceremony of the ''fandroana'' (the \"Royal Bath\"),{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}} to celebrate his culinary discovery.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=285\u2013290}}\n\nUpon succeeding his father, [[Andrianjaka]] (1612\u20131630) led a successful military campaign to capture the final major Vazimba stronghold in the highlands on the [[Twelve sacred hills of Imerina#Hill of Analamanga|hill of Analamanga]]. There he established the fortified compound (''rova'') that would form the heart of his new capital city of [[Antananarivo]].  Upon his orders, the first structures within this fortified compound (known as the [[Rova of Antananarivo]]) were constructed: several traditional royal houses were built, and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed. These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance, ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995. Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder, materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina.\n<!--\n===Establishing the Merina identity===\n\n-->\n\n===Expansion of sovereignty===\nPolitical life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave-hunting incursions into Imerina.\n\n===Division and civil war===\nKing [[Andriamasinavalona]] quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. He extended the borders of the kingdom to their largest historical extent prior to the kingdom's fragmentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Reunification===\n[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|left|King Andrianampoinimerina (ca. 1787\u20131810)]]\nIt was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King [[Andrianjafy]] of [[Ambohimanga]] (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule.\n\n===Kingdom of Madagascar===\n[[File:Ranavalona III of Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranavalona III]] was the last monarch of Madagascar.]]\nThis objective was largely completed under his son, [[Radama I]], who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo.\n\nThe 33-year reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]], the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Her son and heir, King [[Radama II]], signed the unpopular [[Lambert Charter]] giving French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the [[andriana|aristocracy]], however, and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]  had the King strangled in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This aristocratic revolution saw [[Rasoherina]], the [[queen dowager]], placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a [[constitutional monarchy]] that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, [[Ranavalona II]], converted the nation to Christianity and had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen [[Ranavalona III]], acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to [[R\u00e9union Island]] and later [[French Algeria]] following [[French Madagascar|French colonisation]] of the island in 1896.\n\n===French colonisation===\n{{main|Franco-Hova Wars}}\n[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur \u00e0 Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 and 24 May 1895.]]\nAngry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, [[French Third Republic|France]] invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the [[First Madagascar expedition|First Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' referring to the ''[[andriana]]''). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Di\u00e9go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats [[Berlin Conference|partitioning the African continent]] worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over [[Heligoland]] to the [[German Empire]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.\n\nIn 1895, a French [[flying column|flying-column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French [[Protectorate|protection]] as the [[Malagasy Protectorate]] and in 1897 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.{{Sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=142}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Spatial organization===\n[[File:Map of sacred hills of Imerina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=map showing villages of highland Madagascar around Antananarivo|Sacred hills of Imerina]]\nAndriamanelo established the first fortified ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|rova]]'' (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora.

He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2005|p=120}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]] at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka.<ref name=\"Ark2\"/> These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when [[Andrianampoinimerina]] redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.{{Sfn|Administration coloniale|1898|p=895}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nUnder Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (''toko''): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest.  Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people.{{Sfn|Campbell|2012|p=500}}\n\n==Social organization==\n\n===Caste system===\nAndriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.{{Sfn|Miller|Rowlands|1989|p=143}} From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140\u2013154}} The first sub-divisions of the ''[[andriana]]'' noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nAndrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).<ref name = Piolet>Piolet (1895), pp. 209\u2013210</ref> To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|small sacred house]] on top of his tomb.  Future [[Merina]] sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Malagasy mythology}}\nAndriamanelo is credited with introducing [[astrology]] (''sikidy'') in Imerina.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers.{{Sfn|Radimilahy|1993|pp=478\u2013483}}\n\n[[File:Sampy talisman idol Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=boar tusks and metal trinkets fastened with twine to a cluster of wooden dowels|Each ''sampy'' was fashioned from diverse components.]]\nUnder Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the ''[[sampy]]'', traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ''ody'' had long occupied an important place among many [[ethnic groups of Madagascar]], but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful ''sampy'' called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified\u2014complete with a distinct personality\u2014and offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy\u2014twelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology\u2014and transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.{{Sfn|Graeber|2007|pp=35\u201338}}  Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against [[Sakalava]] marauders.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=63\u201371}} The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141\u2013142}} These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the ''sampin'andriana'': the \"Royal Sampy\") which were all in the possession of the king.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141\u2013142}} These royal sampy, including ''Kelimalaza'', continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen [[Ranavalona II]] upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|p=118}}\n\nAlso beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual ''fandroana'' festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37\u201370}} Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \"orgy\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37\u201370}} On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to [[Anointing|anoint]] the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=285\u2013290}} Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar. The [[confit]] would then be conserved in a pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=29}}\n\n===Customs===\nThe marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry\u2014meat from the hindquarters of a sheep\u2014which he believed to be the tastiest portion.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kent | first = R.K. | title = Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 517\u2013546 | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700009026 | ref = harv}}</ref> The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due.

While the Vazimba had historically tended to favor rule by queens, the Hova favored male heirs, and the marriage between Andriamanelo's Vazimba and Hova parents had produced two sons and a daughter. To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.{{Sfn|Kus|1982|pp=47\u201362}} This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}}  Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line.<ref name=\"iarivo\">{{Cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=French |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}\n\nImerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora.

There he established the fortified compound (''rova'') that would form the heart of his new capital city of [[Antananarivo]].  Upon his orders, the first structures within this fortified compound (known as the [[Rova of Antananarivo]]) were constructed: several traditional royal houses were built, and plans for a series of royal tombs were designed. These buildings took on an enduring political and spiritual significance, ensuring their preservation until being destroyed by fire in 1995. Andrianjaka obtained a sizable cache of firearms and gunpowder, materials that helped to establish and preserve his dominance and expand his rule over greater Imerina.\n<!--\n===Establishing the Merina identity===\n\n-->\n\n===Expansion of sovereignty===\nPolitical life on the island from the 16th century was characterised by sporadic conflict between the Merina and Sakalava kingdoms, originating with Sakalava slave-hunting incursions into Imerina.\n\n===Division and civil war===\nKing [[Andriamasinavalona]] quartered the kingdom to be ruled by his four favourite sons, producing persistent fragmentation and warfare between principalities in Imerina. He extended the borders of the kingdom to their largest historical extent prior to the kingdom's fragmentation.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Reunification===\n[[File:Andrianampoinimerina.jpg|thumb|left|King Andrianampoinimerina (ca. 1787\u20131810)]]\nIt was from this context in 1787 that Prince Ramboasalama, nephew of King [[Andrianjafy]] of [[Ambohimanga]] (one of the four kingdoms of Imerina) expelled his uncle and took the throne under the name [[Andrianampoinimerina]]. The new king used both diplomacy and force to reunite Imerina with the intent to bring all of Madagascar under his rule.\n\n===Kingdom of Madagascar===\n[[File:Ranavalona III of Madagascar.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranavalona III]] was the last monarch of Madagascar.]]\nThis objective was largely completed under his son, [[Radama I]], who was the first to admit and regularly engage European missionaries and diplomats in Antananarivo.\n\nThe 33-year reign of Queen [[Ranavalona I]], the widow of Radama I, was characterised by a struggle to preserve the cultural isolation of Madagascar from modernity, especially as represented by the French and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]]. Her son and heir, King [[Radama II]], signed the unpopular [[Lambert Charter]] giving French entrepreneur [[Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert]] exclusive rights to many of the island's resources. His liberal policies angered the [[andriana|aristocracy]], however, and Prime Minister [[Rainivoninahitriniony]]  had the King strangled in a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]''. This aristocratic revolution saw [[Rasoherina]], the [[queen dowager]], placed on the throne upon her acceptance of a [[constitutional monarchy]] that gave greater power to the Prime Minister. She replaced the incumbent Prime Minister with his brother, [[Rainilaiarivony]], who retained the role for three decades and married each successive queen. The next sovereign, [[Ranavalona II]], converted the nation to Christianity and had all the ''[[sampy]]'' (ancestral royal talismans) burnt in a public display. The last Merina sovereign, Queen [[Ranavalona III]], acceded the throne at age 22 and was exiled to [[R\u00e9union Island]] and later [[French Algeria]] following [[French Madagascar|French colonisation]] of the island in 1896.\n\n===French colonisation===\n{{main|Franco-Hova Wars}}\n[[File:FrenchTroopsMadagasgar.jpg|thumb|Landing of the ''40th Battaillon de Chasseur \u00e0 Pieds'' in [[Majunga]], between 5 and 24 May 1895.]]\nAngry at the cancellation of the Lambert Charter and seeking to restore property taken from French citizens, [[French Third Republic|France]] invaded Madagascar in 1883 in what became known as the [[First Madagascar expedition|First Franco-Hova War]] (''Hova'' referring to the ''[[andriana]]''). At the war's end, Madagascar ceded [[Antsiranana]] (Di\u00e9go Suarez) on the northern coast to France and paid 560,000 [[gold franc]]s to the heirs of Joseph-Fran\u00e7ois Lambert. Meanwhile, in Europe, diplomats [[Berlin Conference|partitioning the African continent]] worked out an agreement whereby Britain, in order to obtain the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar]], ceded its rights over [[Heligoland]] to the [[German Empire]] and renounced all claims to Madagascar in favor of France. The agreement proved detrimental for the monarchy of Madagascar. Prime Minister Rainilaiarivory had succeeded in playing Great Britain and France against one another, but now France could meddle without fear of reprisals from Britain.\n\nIn 1895, a French [[flying column|flying-column]] landed in [[Mahajanga]] (Majunga) and marched by way of the [[Betsiboka River]] to the capital, [[Antananarivo]], taking the city's defenders by surprise since they had expected an attack from the much closer eastern coast. Twenty French soldiers died in combat while 6,000 died of [[malaria]] and other diseases before the Second Franco-Hova War ended. In 1896, the Merina Kingdom was put under French [[Protectorate|protection]] as the [[Malagasy Protectorate]] and in 1897 the [[French Parliament]] voted to [[annexation|annex]] the island as a colony, effectively ending Merina sovereignty.{{Sfn|Thompson|Adloff|1965|p=142}}\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Spatial organization===\n[[File:Map of sacred hills of Imerina Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|alt=map showing villages of highland Madagascar around Antananarivo|Sacred hills of Imerina]]\nAndriamanelo established the first fortified ''[[Rova (Madagascar)|rova]]'' (royal compound) at his capital at Alasora. This fortified palace bore specific features - ''[[Architecture of Madagascar#Earth-based construction|hadivory]]'' (dry moats), ''hadifetsy'' (defensive trenches) and ''vavahady'' (town gates protected by a large rolled stone disc acting as a barrier) - that rendered the town more resistant to Vazimba attacks.{{Sfn|de la Vassi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|p=62}}\n\nAndrianjaka's policies and tactics highlighted and increased the separation between the king and his subjects. He transformed social divisions into spatial divisions by assigning each clan to a specific geographical region within his kingdom.{{Sfn|Campbell|2005|p=120}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nAndrianjaka unified the principalities on what he later designated as the [[twelve sacred hills of Imerina]] at Ambohitratrimo, Ambohimanga, Ilafy, Alasora, Antsahadita, Ambohimanambony, Analamanga, Ambohitrabiby, Namehana, Ambohidrapeto, Ambohijafy and Ambohimandranjaka.<ref name=\"Ark2\"/> These hills became and remain the spiritual heart of Imerina, which was further expanded over a century later when [[Andrianampoinimerina]] redesignated the twelve sacred hills to include several different sites.{{Sfn|Administration coloniale|1898|p=895}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}\n\nUnder Andriamasinavalona, the Kingdom of Imerina was composed of six provinces (''toko''): Avaradrano, constituting Antananarivo and land to the northeast of the capital, including Ambohimanga; Vakinisisaony, including the land to the south of Avaradrano and its capital at Alasora; Vonizongo to the northwest of Antananarivo with its capital at Fihaonana; Marovatana to the south of Vonizongo, with its capital at Ambohidratrimo; Ambodirano, south of Marovatana with its capital at Fenoarivo; and Vakinankaratra to the south of Antananarivo with its capital at Betafo. Andrianampoinimerina reunited these provinces and added Imamo to the west, which has been described by some historians as having been incorporated into Ambodirano, and by others as separate from it; and Valalafotsy to the northwest.  Together, these areas constitute the core territory rightly called Imerina, the homeland of the Merina people.{{Sfn|Campbell|2012|p=500}}\n\n==Social organization==\n\n===Caste system===\nAndriamanelo was reportedly the first to formally establish the [[andriana]] as a caste of Merina nobles, thereby laying the foundation for a stratified and structured society.{{Sfn|Miller|Rowlands|1989|p=143}} From this point forward, the term Hova was used to refer only to the non-noble free people of the society which would later be renamed Merina by Andriamanelo's son Ralambo.{{Sfn|Kus|1995|pp=140&ndash;154}} The first sub-divisions of the ''[[andriana]]'' noble caste were created when Ralambo split it into four ranks.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}}\n\nAndrianjaka was the first king to be buried on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo, his tomb forming the first of the Fitomiandalana (seven tombs placed in a row on the Rova grounds).<ref name = Piolet>Piolet (1895), pp. 209&ndash;210</ref> To commemorate his greatness, his subjects erected a small wooden house called a [[Architecture of Madagascar#Highlands traditions|small sacred house]] on top of his tomb.  Future [[Merina]] sovereigns and nobles continued to construct similar tomb houses on their tombs well into the 19th century.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}\n\n===Religion===\n{{main|Malagasy mythology}}\nAndriamanelo is credited with introducing [[astrology]] (''sikidy'') in Imerina.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} The Merina rite of [[circumcision]], described by Bloch (1986) in great detail, continued to be practiced by the Merina monarchy through the end of the 19th century in precisely the way first established by Andriamanelo generations before. Many elements of these rituals continue to form part of the circumcision traditions of Merina families in the 21st century. The origins of these practices can be traced back to the southeastern part of the island that the Hova had left behind as they migrated into the central highlands. Astrology, for instance, had been introduced early to the island by way of trade contacts between coastal Malagasy communities and Arab seafarers.{{Sfn|Radimilahy|1993|pp=478-483}}\n\n[[File:Sampy talisman idol Madagascar.jpg|thumb|right|alt=boar tusks and metal trinkets fastened with twine to a cluster of wooden dowels|Each ''sampy'' was fashioned from diverse components.]]\nUnder Andriamanelo's son Ralambo, the sovereign became imbued with increasing power to protect the realm. This was preserved by honoring the ''[[sampy]]'', traditional amulets made from assorted natural materials. Amulets and idols called ''ody'' had long occupied an important place among many [[ethnic groups of Madagascar]], but these were believed to offer protection to the individual wearer only and were commonplace objects possessed by anyone from slave children to kings. After Ralambo received a highly powerful ''sampy'' called Kelimalaza that was distinguished by its supposed capacity to extend protection to an entire community, he sought out and amassed a total of twelve others from communities across Imerina believed to have such a quality. These sampy were personified&mdash;complete with a distinct personality&mdash;and offered their own house with guardians dedicated to their service. Ralambo then transformed the nature of the relationship between sampy and ruler: whereas previously the sampy had been seen as tools at the disposal of community leaders, under Ralambo they became divine protectors of the king's sovereignty and the integrity of the state, which would be preserved through their power on the condition that the line of sovereigns ensured the sampy were shown the respect due to them. By collecting the twelve greatest sampy&mdash;twelve being a sacred number in Merina cosmology&mdash;and transforming their nature, Ralambo strengthened the supernatural power and legitimacy of the royal line of Imerina.{{Sfn|Graeber|2007|pp=35&ndash;38}}  Oral history recounts numerous instances where sampy were taken into battle, and subsequent successes and varying miracles were attributed to them, including several key victories against [[Sakalava]] marauders.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=63&ndash;71}} The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the ''sampin'andriana'': the \"Royal Sampy\") which were all in the possession of the king.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|pp=141&ndash;142}} These royal sampy, including ''Kelimalaza'', continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen [[Ranavalona II]] upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.{{Sfn|Oliver|1886|p=118}}\n\nAlso beginning under Ralambo, the ritual sanctification of the realm occurred through the annual ''fandroana'' festival at the start of each year. Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and its traditions have evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts provide insight into the festival as it was practiced at that time.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the fandroana (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an \"orgy\") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.{{Sfn|Larson|1999|p=37&ndash;70}} On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to [[Anointing|anoint]] the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.{{Sfn|de la Vaissi\u00e8re|Abinal|1885|pp=285&ndash;290}} Children would celebrate the fandroana by carrying lighted torches and lanterns in a nighttime processional through their villages. The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. This delicacy was made during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar. The [[confit]] would then be conserved in a pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's fandroana.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=29}}\n\n===Customs===\nThe marriage tradition of the ''vodiondry'', still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, is said to have originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondry&mdash;meat from the hindquarters of a sheep&mdash;which he believed to be the tastiest portion.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Kent | first = R.K. | title = Madagascar and Africa II: The Sakalava, Maroserana, Dady and Tromba before 1700 | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 517&ndash;546 | year = 1968 | doi = 10.1017/S0021853700009026 | ref = harv}}</ref> The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due.

To prevent conflict, the queen decided that Andriamanelo would inherit the crown upon his mother's death and would be succeeded not by his own child but by his younger brother.{{Sfn|Kus|1982|pp=47-62}} This system of succession was ordered by the queens to be followed for all time, and applied to families as well: in any instance where there was an elder child and a younger one, the parents would designate an elder child to assume authority within the family upon their death, and that authority would be handed to the designated younger child in the event of the death of the elder child.{{Sfn|Raison-Jourde|1983|p=239}}  Ralambo was the first Merina sovereign to practice polygamy, and his second wife was the first to give him a son. While his younger son by his first wife was to rule, Ralambo sought to assuage the elder son by declaring that the crown could henceforth only be passed to a child born of the reigning sovereign and a princess from the elder son Andriantompokoindrindra's family line.<ref name=\"iarivo\">{{Cite web|last=City of Antananarivo |title=Antananarivo: Histoire de la commune |url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wZeOMH4e?url=http://www.iarivo-town.mg/histoire.php |accessdate=2 August 2010 |archivedate=17 February 2011 |language=French |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe practice of sanctifying deceased Merina sovereigns is believed to have originated with Ralambo.{{Sfn|Ogot|1992|p=876}}\n\nImerina was initially ruled under Andriamanelo from his mother's home village of Alasora. The capital was shifted by his son Ralambo to Ambohidrabiby, location of the former capital of his maternal grandfather King Rabiby.<ref name=Ark2/> Andrianjaka moved his capital from Ambohidrabiby to [[Ambohimanga]] upon ascending to the throne around 1610<ref name=\"iarivo\"/> or 1612.<ref name=\"Ark2\"/> The Besakana, Masoandrotsiroa and Fitomiandalana houses at the Rova of Antananarivo were preserved and maintained over the centuries by successive generations of Merina sovereigns, imbuing the structures with deep symbolic and spiritual meaning. As Andrianjaka's residence, the Besakana was particularly significant: the original building was torn down and reconstructed in the same design by [[Andriamasinavalona]] around 1680, and again by Andrianampoinimerina in 1800, each of whom inhabited the building in turn as their personal residence. King [[Radama I]] likewise inhabited the building for much of his time at the Rova,{{Sfn|Fr\u00e9migacci|1999|p=427}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}} and in 1820 he designated the

was the first in the highlands to transform lowland swamps into irrigated rice paddies through the construction of dikes in the valleys around Alasora.{{Sfn|Rafidinarivo|2009|p=84}} Under Andrianjaka, the plains surrounding Antananarivo were gradually transformed into vast, surplus-producing rice paddies.<ref name=\"Souverains\">Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 238</ref> This feat was accomplished by mobilizing large numbers of his able-bodied subjects to construct dikes that enabled the redirection of rainwater for controlled flooding of planted areas.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|pp=47-48}}\n\nAndrianjaka was reportedly the first Merina leader to receive Europeans around 1620 and traded slaves in exchange for guns and other firearms to aid in the pacification of rival principalities, obtaining 50 guns and three barrels of gunpowder to equip his army.{{Sfn|Chapus|Dandouau|1961|p=47}}\n\n===Technology===\nAndriamanelo is traditionally credited with discovering the technique of silversmithing, iron smithing and the construction and use of [[pirogue]]s.{{Sfn|Piolet|1895|p=206}} While these technologies were not discovered during his

There were no crossovers or crossunders as the control house had separate turnstile banks and token booths for each side. Express trains ran on the innermost two tracks, while local trains ran on the outer pair.\n\n=== Renovation ===\nDuring the 1950s, the [[New York City Transit Authority]] (now the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]], or MTA) considered converting the station to a local station by walling off the express tracks from the platforms. This would have coincided with [[59th Street\u2013Columbus Circle (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|59th Street\u2013Columbus Circle]], which is a major transfer point to the [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]], becoming an express stop.\n\nA substantial renovation was completed on October 29, 2002, providing a new, larger control house on the traffic island between 72nd and 73rd Streets and slightly wider platforms at the north end of the station.<ref name=\"headhouse\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mta.info/press-release/mta-headquarters/new-headhouse-opens-west-72nd-street|title=New Headhouse Opens at West 72nd Street|last=|first=|date=October 29, 2002|website=mta.info|publisher=Metropolitan Transportation Authority|access-date=December 31, 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{-|left}}\n\n==Station layout==\n{{NYCS Platform Layout IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line/express}}\nAt platform level, the station is similar to its original configuration, with two narrow island platforms and four tracks.<ref name=\"tracks\">{{NYCS const|trackref|trackbook3}}</ref>\n\n=== Exits ===\nThere are two station houses, both of which provide entry and exit: the original station house south of 72nd Street, and the new one north of 72nd Street.<ref name=\"MTAMaps-2015\">{{cite web|url=http://web.mta.info/maps/neighborhoods/mn/M13_upper_west_side_2015.pdf|title=MTA Neighborhood Maps: Upper West Side|date=2015|website=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|mta.info]]|publisher=[[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe crossovers and elevator are only in the northernmost station house.

The project was partially funded by a Federal grant, and the work was contracted out to Slattery Construction Company.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/11/29/archives/philharmonic-hall-entrance-to-irt-subway-opens-today.html|title=Philharmonic Hall Entrance To IRT Subway Opens Today|last=|first=|date=November 29, 1962|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 26, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==Station layout==\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{NYCS 4-tracked local station\n|1=72nd Street\n|l1=72 St\n|2=59th Street\u2013Columbus Circle\n|l2=59 St\n|code=IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line\n|color=Seventh\n|textcolor=white\n|dir=N\n}}\n}}\n{{NYCS Platform Layout IRT Broadway-Seventh Avenue Local Stations}}\n{{Multiple image\n|align=left\n|direction=horizontal\n|width=150\n|image1=66th Street Lincoln Center IRT 1.JPG\n|caption1=Name tablet\n|image2=66th Street Lincoln Center IRT 2.JPG\n|caption2=Cartouche\n}}\n\nThis underground station has two [[side platform]]s and four tracks.
