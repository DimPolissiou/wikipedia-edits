Her feet and hands are adorned with claws and her breasts are depicted as hanging flaccid from [[pregnancy]]. Her face is formed by two facing serpents (after her head was cut off and the [[blood spurt]] forth from her neck in the form of two gigantic serpents),<ref>[http://en.allexperts.com/q/Mythology-658/Aztec-gods-2.htm Mythology - Aztec gods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090214211523/http://en.allexperts.com/q/Mythology-658/Aztec-gods-2.htm |date=14 February 2009 }}, Elise Nalbandian, [[AllExperts]], 13 February 2006</ref> referring to the myth that she was sacrificed during the beginning of the present creation.\n\nMost Aztec artistic representations of Coatlicue emphasize her deadly side, because Earth, as well as loving mother, is the insatiable monster that consumes everything that lives. She represents the devouring mother, in whom both the womb and the grave exist.\n\nAccording to Aztec legend, Coatlicue was once magically impregnated by a ball of [[feather]]s that fell on her while she was sweeping a temple, and subsequently gave birth to the god Huitzilopochtli. Her daughter [[Coyolxauhqui]] then rallied Coatlicue's four hundred other children together and goaded them into attacking and decapitating their mother. The instant she was killed, the god [[Huitzilopochtli]] suddenly emerged from her womb fully grown and armed for battle.<ref>Miller Art of Mesoamerica 2012 page 252</ref> He killed many of his brothers and sisters, including Coyolxauhqui, whose head she cut off and threw into the sky to become the [[moon]].

The myth relates that the present Sun began after the gods gathered at Teotihuacan and sacrificed themselves. The best-known version states that Tezzictecatl and Nanahuatzin immolated themselves, becoming the moon and the sun. However, other versions add a group of women to those who sacrificed themselves, including Coatlicue. Afterwards the Aztecs were said to have worshipped the skirts of these women, which came back to life. Coatlicue thus has creative aspects, which may balance the skulls, hearts, hands, and claws that connect her to the earth deity Tlaltecuhtli.

I think he'd do anything. George is going to put himself in some dangerous situations when he should probably wait for back-up. But I think he loves the action and he is so passionate that he rushes in without thinking. George is very exciting as a new character. He's passionate and he loves his job.

George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it.

But I think he loves the action and he is so passionate that he rushes in without thinking. George is very exciting as a new character. He's passionate and he loves his job.

George is the first officer on the scene, but the paramedics are already there. He has to try to understand what's going on very quickly. George takes control of the situation immediately. It's a really nice way to be introduced, showing him as someone who's trustworthy and who can take control of a dangerous situation. I think there'll be a lot of those, over the course of the next year.\nSo far my scenes have been with the teachers at the school. I have shared scenes with Nancy, Sally, John Paul, and then a few of the worried parents as well. I've also been with DS Cohen a few times. She's my boss and she's very good at her job, so George is keen to impress! You'll see that George is a police officer for the right reasons and his heart is in it.

The film was directed by [[Griffin Dunne]] and stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Stockard Channing]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Aidan Quinn]], and [[Goran Visnjic]].\n\nBullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, who have always known they were different from other people - they are witches. Raised by their aunts after their parents' death, the sisters grew up in a household that was anything but normal \u2014 their aunts fed them chocolate cake for breakfast and taught them the uses of practical magic. But being a member of the Owens family carries a curse: The men they fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death. Now adult women with very different personalities, the quiet Sally and the fiery Gillian must use all of their powers to fight the family curse and a swarm of supernatural forces that could take away all the Owenses' lives.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nIn the 1600s, Maria Owens, a young witch, is put on trial for witchcraft and magically saves herself from hanging. She is exiled (with her unborn child) to an island in Massachusetts. When her lover does not rescue her, she casts a spell to stop herself from ever falling in love again. The spell becomes a curse, affecting all future generations of women in the Owens family; any man who falls in love with an Owens woman will die. In the present, Gillian and Sally Owens are taken in by their maternal aunts Frances and Jet (Bridget) after the death of their parents. Gillian's talents lie in charm and persuasion, while Sally is more gifted in witchcraft. After witnessing their aunts cast a spell for a woman obsessed with having a specific man's love, Gillian is titillated at the idea of falling in love and Sally, terrified, casts a true love spell (Amas Veritas) to protect herself, summoning a man who possesses qualities that cannot possibly exist.\n\nYears later, Gillian, about to leave for [[Los Angeles]] with her boyfriend, makes a blood oath to Sally, promising to return and grow old with her. After Gillian's departure, the aunts cast a spell to open Sally's heart to a local produce seller, Michael. Sally marries Michael and they have two daughters, Kylie and Antonia. They plan to open a botanical shop, but Michael dies from the curse after being hit by a truck, despite Sally's efforts to stop it. Devastated, Sally goes to her aunts to beg them to bring Michael back to life, having once seen the spell in their book. The aunts confess to casting a spell so she would be happy, not expecting Sally's love to trigger the curse. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Sally and her daughters return to the Owens home to live. Sally decides that she and her daughters will not perform magic. At the same time, hundreds of miles away, Gillian begins a relationship with the mysterious Jimmy Angelov. She can feel Sally's grief, and realizing that Sally really needs her, she returns to Massachusetts.\n\nAfter Gillian helps her realize that she is neglecting her daughters due to her disabling grief, Sally wakes to find her sister gone. With a new-found resolve, she opens the botanical shop she had planned with Michael and tries to help her daughters navigate living in a town where the citizens openly taunt them for being witches.\n\nOne night, Gillian frantically calls Sally to come and rescue her after Jimmy becomes erratic and abusive, but after Sally arrives, he kidnaps them both. Sally puts [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] into Jimmy's tequila, meaning to put him to sleep, but inadvertently killing him as he tries to strangle Gillian. Gillian decides that they must use magic to resurrect Jimmy so that neither of them will be guilty of murder. They return home, then resurrect him using their aunts' spellbook. Jimmy attempts to kill Gillian again immediately after being revived, and Sally is forced to kill him again to save Gillian. They bury his body in the garden. Soon after, signs begin occurring, indicating that something is wrong, yet they do not confess to their aunts when confronted. Frances and Jet leave after giving Kylie and Antonia protection wards, telling Antonia to give Sally and Gillian the message, \"Clean up your own mess!\".\n\nInvestigator Gary Hallett arrives from Tucson in search of Jimmy, who is revealed to be a serial killer. Gary begins to suspect that Sally and Gillian killed Jimmy, and begins questioning the sisters, as well as townsfolk. Sally increasingly finds herself wanting to tell Gary the truth, so Gillian enlists the help of Kylie and Antonia to create a potion to make Gary leave town. However, Kylie and Antonia realize he is the man described in young Sally's true love spell and dispose of the potion. While watching the girls toss the potion-laced pancake syrup into the sea, Gary (and a horrified Sally and Gillian) watch a frog regurgitate Jimmy's unique ring. Gary takes it as evidence and departs, angry and confused. Later, after fighting with her sister, Sally go to Gary and insists he record her testimony. While in his hotel room, she sees a letter she had written Gillian just before rescuing her from Jimmy. She realizes he read it many times. Unable to deny their feelings for each other, they kiss, but Sally realizes that he was there because of the Amas Veritas spell. Sally bolts, shaken.\n\nReturning home, Sally discovers that Jimmy's spirit has possessed Gillian's body and Gary (following Sally) witnesses Jimmy's spirit emerge. Jimmy's ghost attempts to kill Gary by reaching into his chest, only to be burned by Gary's silver star-shaped badge and disappears. Sally tells Gary that he is there because of her spell and the feelings they have for each other are not real. Gary replies that curses are only true if one believes in them and reveals that he also wished for her, then leaves.\n\nJimmy possesses Gillian again and attempts to assault Sally, who knocks her out just before Frances and Jet return. Sally, realizing she must embrace magic to save her sister, asks the aid of the mothers on the school's emergency phone tree and they form a coven to exorcise Jimmy's spirit. Forming a circle, the women chant a spell to exorcise Jimmy, but Sally makes them stop when she sees that the effort is killing Gillian. Sally, inspired, opens the magic protection circle surrounding the possessed Gillian and uses Jimmy's bottle of tequila to entice him, in control of Gillian's body, to lunge at her. Swiftly, Sally repeats her blood oath with Gillian, again slicing their palms to join their blood in promise. The Owens curse is broken by their sisterly love and Jimmy's spirit is exorcised and permanently banished. Gary sends a letter, showing he cleared the sisters of any suspicion of wrongdoing in Jimmy's death. Sally comes to a decision, encouraged by Gillian, to take a risk on love again. Sally sends out a message via a leaf on the wind and in Arizona, Gary senses her call. He returns to Massachusetts to be with Sally. Halloween is celebrated and all the Owens women, demonstrating their powers by leaping off their roof and landing safely, are lovingly accepted by the townsfolk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Sally Owens, a witch who becomes widowed after the Owens curse kills her husband.\n** [[Camilla Belle]] as young Sally\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Gillian Owens, Sally's sister, who grows restless with her family's estrangement in their small town, leaves, and becomes the victim of an abusive relationship.\n** Lora Anne Criswell as young Gillian\n* [[Goran Visnjic]] as James 'Jimmy' Angelov, Gillian's lover, who becomes abusive and kidnaps the sisters, and is killed by them, twice, in self-defense.\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Aunt Frances Owens, aunt of Sally and Gillian, who tends to be direct, assertive, and salty.\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Aunt Bridget 'Jet' Owens, aunt of Sally and Gillian, who is tenderhearted and gentle.\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Investigator Gary Hallet, from Tucson, Arizona, who investigates Sally and Gillian in the disappearance of Jimmy Angelov and falls in love with Sally.\n* [[Caprice Benedetti]] as Maria Owens, the first witch in the Owens family.\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Kylie Owens, Sally's elder daughter, who lives with her mom and great-aunts after the death of her father, Michael.

Because the film's producers decided the house was a big part of the depiction of the Owens culture, a house to accurately represent that vision was built on [[San Juan Island]] in the state of Washington.<ref>{{cite web|title=Practical Magic: A Victorian House Fit for a Witch|url=http://hookedonhouses.net/2009/10/25/practical-magic-a-victorian-house-fit-for-a-witch/|publisher=Hooked|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=25 October 2009|quote=It looks like a real house that was built in the 1850s, but it\u2019s really just an \u201carchitectural shell\u201d that took 8 months to build and was (sadly) destroyed after filming was over.}}</ref> While much of the set from California was brought to that location and placed inside the house, it took nearly a year to perfect the image of the house and the interior.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design|url=http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|work=Practical Magic|publisher=Amas Veritas|accessdate=31 October 2012|quote=Though this Victorian house looks as if it's been in place for a century, it's actually an architectural shell.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093608/http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|archivedate=6 May 2012}}</ref> The house, actually only a shell with nothing inside, was built only for this filming and was torn down after filming was completed. The small town scenes were filmed in downtown Coupeville, Washington, a Victorian-era seaside port town located on the south side of [[Penn's Cove]] on [[Whidbey Island]].\n\nAccording to Sandra Bullock in the DVD commentary, while filming the scene where the Owens women are drunk and slinging insults, the actresses actually got drunk on very bad [[tequila]] brought by Kidman. The cast further stated in the film's commentary that they felt supernatural elements of the house started to affect them. Both the cast and crew claimed they heard supernatural noises while filming the coven scene at the end of the film. For the final scene with all of the townspeople at the Owens home, the entire population of the town where filming took place was invited to show up in costume and appear as townsfolk.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Practical Magic\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = Practicalmagicalbum.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Photo by Suzanne Tenner\n| released   = October 6, 1998 (original pressing)\n| recorded   = August 15\u201316, 1998,<br />[[Abbey Road Studios]] (Michael Nyman tracks)\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Minimal music|minimalism]], [[orchestra]]l\n| length     = 56:58 (Nyman pressing); 51:46 (Silvestri pressing)\n| language   = English\n| label      = [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| producer   = Danny Bramson, [[Sandra Bullock]]\n| chronology = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| prev_title = [[Strong on Oaks, Strong on the Causes of Oaks]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Ravenous (soundtrack)|Ravenous]]\n| next_year  = 1999\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]\n | prev_year  = 1998\n | title      = Practical Magic\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\n\nComposer [[Michael Nyman]]'s score to the movie was abruptly replaced with music by [[Alan Silvestri]] for the theatrical release.

A 50-track demo (the last two tracks being \"Convening the Coven\" and \"Maria Owens\") of Nyman's score has been circulating among fans as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]].

The film was directed by [[Griffin Dunne]] and stars [[Sandra Bullock]], [[Nicole Kidman]], [[Stockard Channing]], [[Dianne Wiest]], [[Aidan Quinn]], and [[Goran Visnjic]].\n\nBullock and Kidman play sisters Sally and Gillian Owens, who have always known they were different from other people - they are witches. Raised by their aunts after their parents' death, the sisters grew up in a household that was anything but normal \u2014 their aunts fed them chocolate cake for breakfast and taught them the uses of practical magic. But being a member of the Owens family carries a curse: The men they fall in love with are doomed to an untimely death. Now adult women with very different personalities, the quiet Sally and the fiery Gillian must use all of their powers to fight the family curse and a swarm of supernatural forces that could take away all the Owenses' lives.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\n\nIn the 1600s, Maria Owens, a young witch, is put on trial for witchcraft and magically saves herself from hanging. She is exiled (with her unborn child) to an island in Massachusetts. When her lover does not rescue her, she casts a spell to stop herself from ever falling in love again. The spell becomes a curse, affecting all future generations of women in the Owens family; any man who falls in love with an Owens woman will die. In the present, Gillian and Sally Owens are taken in by their maternal aunts Frances and Jet (Bridget) after the death of their parents. Gillian's talents lie in charm and persuasion, while Sally is more gifted in witchcraft. After witnessing their aunts cast a spell for a woman obsessed with having a specific man's love, Gillian is titillated at the idea of falling in love and Sally, terrified, casts a true love spell (Amas Veritas) to protect herself, summoning a man who possesses qualities that cannot possibly exist.\n\nYears later, Gillian, about to leave for [[Los Angeles]] with her boyfriend, makes a blood oath to Sally, promising to return and grow old with her. After Gillian's departure, the aunts cast a spell to open Sally's heart to a local produce seller, Michael. Sally marries Michael and they have two daughters, Kylie and Antonia. They plan to open a botanical shop, but Michael dies from the curse after being hit by a truck, despite Sally's efforts to stop it. Devastated, Sally goes to her aunts to beg them to bring Michael back to life, having once seen the spell in their book. The aunts confess to casting a spell so she would be happy, not expecting Sally's love to trigger the curse. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Sally and her daughters return to the Owens home to live. Sally decides that she and her daughters will not perform magic. At the same time, hundreds of miles away, Gillian begins a relationship with the mysterious Jimmy Angelov. She can feel Sally's grief, and realizing that Sally really needs her, she returns to Massachusetts.\n\nAfter Gillian helps her realize that she is neglecting her daughters due to her disabling grief, Sally wakes to find her sister gone. With a new-found resolve, she opens the botanical shop she had planned with Michael and tries to help her daughters navigate living in a town where the citizens openly taunt them for being witches.\n\nOne night, Gillian frantically calls Sally to come and rescue her after Jimmy becomes erratic and abusive, but after Sally arrives, he kidnaps them both. Sally puts [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] into Jimmy's tequila, meaning to put him to sleep, but inadvertently killing him as he tries to strangle Gillian. Gillian decides that they must use magic to resurrect Jimmy so that neither of them will be guilty of murder. They return home, then resurrect him using their aunts' spellbook. Jimmy attempts to kill Gillian again immediately after being revived, and Sally is forced to kill him again to save Gillian. They bury his body in the garden. Soon after, signs begin occurring, indicating that something is wrong, yet they do not confess to their aunts when confronted. Frances and Jet leave after giving Kylie and Antonia protection wards, telling Antonia to give Sally and Gillian the message, \"Clean up your own mess!\".\n\nInvestigator Gary Hallett arrives from Tucson in search of Jimmy, who is revealed to be a serial killer. Gary begins to suspect that Sally and Gillian killed Jimmy, and begins questioning the sisters, as well as townsfolk. Sally increasingly finds herself wanting to tell Gary the truth, so Gillian enlists the help of Kylie and Antonia to create a potion to make Gary leave town. However, Kylie and Antonia realize he is the man described in young Sally's true love spell and dispose of the potion. While watching the girls toss the potion-laced pancake syrup into the sea, Gary (and a horrified Sally and Gillian) watch a frog regurgitate Jimmy's unique ring. Gary takes it as evidence and departs, angry and confused. Later, after fighting with her sister, Sally go to Gary and insists he record her testimony. While in his hotel room, she sees a letter she had written Gillian just before rescuing her from Jimmy. She realizes he read it many times. Unable to deny their feelings for each other, they kiss, but Sally realizes that he was there because of the Amas Veritas spell. Sally bolts, shaken.\n\nReturning home, Sally discovers that Jimmy's spirit has possessed Gillian's body and Gary (following Sally) witnesses Jimmy's spirit emerge. Jimmy's ghost attempts to kill Gary by reaching into his chest, only to be burned by Gary's silver star-shaped badge and disappears. Sally tells Gary that he is there because of her spell and the feelings they have for each other are not real. Gary replies that curses are only true if one believes in them and reveals that he also wished for her, then leaves.\n\nJimmy possesses Gillian again and attempts to assault Sally, who knocks her out just before Frances and Jet return. Sally, realizing she must embrace magic to save her sister, asks the aid of the mothers on the school's emergency phone tree and they form a coven to exorcise Jimmy's spirit. Forming a circle, the women chant a spell to exorcise Jimmy, but Sally makes them stop when she sees that the effort is killing Gillian. Sally, inspired, opens the magic protection circle surrounding the possessed Gillian and uses Jimmy's bottle of tequila to entice him, in control of Gillian's body, to lunge at her. Swiftly, Sally repeats her blood oath with Gillian, again slicing their palms to join their blood in promise. The Owens curse is broken by their sisterly love and Jimmy's spirit is exorcised and permanently banished. Gary sends a letter, showing he cleared the sisters of any suspicion of wrongdoing in Jimmy's death. Sally comes to a decision, encouraged by Gillian, to take a risk on love again. Sally sends out a message via a leaf on the wind and in Arizona, Gary senses her call. He returns to Massachusetts to be with Sally. Halloween is celebrated and all the Owens women, demonstrating their powers by leaping off their roof and landing safely, are lovingly accepted by the townsfolk.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Sandra Bullock]] as Sally Owens, a witch who becomes widowed after the Owens curse kills her husband.\n** [[Camilla Belle]] as young Sally\n* [[Nicole Kidman]] as Gillian Owens, Sally's sister, who grows restless with her family's estrangement in their small town, leaves, and becomes the victim of an abusive relationship.\n** Lora Anne Criswell as young Gillian\n* [[Goran Visnjic]] as James 'Jimmy' Angelov, Gillian's lover, who becomes abusive and kidnaps the sisters, and is killed by them, twice, in self-defense.\n* [[Stockard Channing]] as Aunt Frances Owens, aunt of Sally and Gillian, who tends to be direct, assertive, and salty.\n* [[Dianne Wiest]] as Aunt Bridget 'Jet' Owens, aunt of Sally and Gillian, who is tenderhearted and gentle.\n* [[Aidan Quinn]] as Investigator Gary Hallet, from Tucson, Arizona, who investigates Sally and Gillian in the disappearance of Jimmy Angelov and falls in love with Sally.\n* [[Caprice Benedetti]] as Maria Owens, the first witch in the Owens family.\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Kylie Owens, Sally's elder daughter, who lives with her mom and great-aunts after the death of her father, Michael.

Because the film's producers decided the house was a big part of the depiction of the Owens culture, a house to accurately represent that vision was built on [[San Juan Island]] in the state of Washington.<ref>{{cite web|title=Practical Magic: A Victorian House Fit for a Witch|url=http://hookedonhouses.net/2009/10/25/practical-magic-a-victorian-house-fit-for-a-witch/|publisher=Hooked|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=25 October 2009|quote=It looks like a real house that was built in the 1850s, but it\u2019s really just an \u201carchitectural shell\u201d that took 8 months to build and was (sadly) destroyed after filming was over.}}</ref> While much of the set from California was brought to that location and placed inside the house, it took nearly a year to perfect the image of the house and the interior.<ref>{{cite web|title=Design|url=http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|work=Practical Magic|publisher=Amas Veritas|accessdate=31 October 2012|quote=Though this Victorian house looks as if it's been in place for a century, it's actually an architectural shell.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506093608/http://www.amasveritas.com/film/setting/design.html|archivedate=6 May 2012}}</ref> The house, actually only a shell with nothing inside, was built only for this filming and was torn down after filming was completed. The small town scenes were filmed in downtown Coupeville, Washington, a Victorian-era seaside port town located on the south side of [[Penn's Cove]] on [[Whidbey Island]].\n\nAccording to Sandra Bullock in the DVD commentary, while filming the scene where the Owens women are drunk and slinging insults, the actresses actually got drunk on very bad [[tequila]] brought by Kidman. The cast further stated in the film's commentary that they felt supernatural elements of the house started to affect them. Both the cast and crew claimed they heard supernatural noises while filming the coven scene at the end of the film. For the final scene with all of the townspeople at the Owens home, the entire population of the town where filming took place was invited to show up in costume and appear as townsfolk.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Practical Magic\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      = Practicalmagicalbum.jpg\n| alt        =\n| caption    = Photo by Suzanne Tenner\n| released   = October 6, 1998 (original pressing)\n| recorded   = August 15\u201316, 1998,<br />[[Abbey Road Studios]] (Michael Nyman tracks)\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Soundtrack]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[Minimal music|minimalism]], [[orchestra]]l\n| length     = 56:58 (Nyman pressing); 51:46 (Silvestri pressing)\n| language   = English\n| label      = [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]/[[Warner Music Group|WEA]]\n| producer   = Danny Bramson, [[Sandra Bullock]]\n| chronology = [[Michael Nyman]]\n| prev_title = [[Strong on Oaks, Strong on the Causes of Oaks]]\n| prev_year  = 1998\n| next_title = [[Ravenous (soundtrack)|Ravenous]]\n| next_year  = 1999\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Alan Silvestri]]\n | type       = soundtrack\n | prev_title = [[The Parent Trap (1998 film)|The Parent Trap]]\n | prev_year  = 1998\n | title      = Practical Magic\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\n\nComposer [[Michael Nyman]]'s score to the movie was abruptly replaced with music by [[Alan Silvestri]] for the theatrical release.

A 50-track demo (the last two tracks being \"Convening the Coven\" and \"Maria Owens\") of Nyman's score has been circulating among fans as a [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]].
