The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\".

The empty streets signify the quietness of the cities in the light of the lockdowns that have been enforced by governments globally to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus among citizens. The video then shows Drake in a [[antechamber]], showcasing his many awards sitting in trophy cases; through the door, a painting of China's [[Mao Zedong|Chairman Mao]] by [[Andy Warhol]] is seen hanging on the wall. Drake then passes by a table covered with the\u00a0basketball jerseys\u00a0he is usually seen wearing courtside, including one emblazoned with the name \"Bryant\", honoring the late American basketball star, Kobe Bryant, who had died earlier the year from a [[Kobe Bryant death|helicopter crash]], on January 26, 2020. The scene then cuts to a foyer, as the rapper passes two sculptures by Japanese [[contemporary artist]] [[Takashi Murakami]]. The rapper is then seen sitting on \"the biggest kitchen island [...]\"\u00a0and the camera pans toward the quarter-mile-long dining room table. Drake continues moving through darkened rooms where portraits of \"lost and distanced\" heroes, including [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Nas]], [[Tupac]] and [[Snoop Dogg]], hang on the wall. He dances through a door to the pool area,\u00a0which features \"waneon lighting and cabana-like d\u00e9cor\". The video concludes with Drake in total darkness, \"only his white sneakers visible against the eerily black [[Toronto]] sky\". Fireworks erupt afterward, and the camera pans back to show the entirety of Drake's 35,000-square-foot, $100 million Toronto estate.\n\nIn the video, Drake is seen wearing a hoodie and a \"super rare\" Fall/Winter 2001 [[Raf Simons]] Riot Riot Riot Camo [[Flight jacket#The bomber jacket|Bomber]], an item [[Kanye West]] wore regularly during 2014 and 2015. A [[B\u00f6sendorfer]] piano is seen, which has a violet cover inscribed with skulls.\u00a0There's also a shot of what appears to be a recording contract,\u00a0ready to be signed on Drake's dining-room table.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"NPR\" /><ref name=\"Missed Video\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9350688/drake-toosie-slide-video-what-you-missed|title=7 Things You Might Have Missed Inside Drake's House in 'Toosie Slide' Video|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|last=Saponara|first=Michael|date=April 3, 2020|accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Rap Up\" />\n\n==Credits and personnel==\nCredits adapted from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/136183311/credits|title=Drake / Toosie Slide / Tidal|website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]]|accessdate=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n{{div col}}\n* [[Drake (rapper)|Aubrey Graham]] \u2013 vocals, songwriter, composer\n* Nick Kobe - songwriter\n* [[OZ (record producer)|Ozan Yildirim]] \u2013 songwriter, composer, production\n* [[40 (record producer)|Noah \"40\" Shebib]] \u2013 mixer\n* Noel Cadastre \u2013 assistant mixer, recording engineer\n* Chris Athens \u2013 mastering engineer\n{{div col end}}\n\n== Charts ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020)\n! scope=\"col\"| Peak<br />position\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Australia ([[ARIA Charts|ARIA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ariacharts.com.au/charts/singles-chart|title=ARIA Australian Top 50 Singles|publisher=[[Australian Recording Industry Association]]|date=April 13, 2020|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}</ref>\n| 3\n|-\n{{single chart|Austria|2|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Flanders|8|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Wallonia|35|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Canada|3|artist=Drake|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 14, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Czechdigital|5|year=2020|week=16|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Denmark ([[Tracklisten]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hitlisten.nu/default.asp?w=14&y=2020&list=t40|title=Track Top-40 Uge 14, 2020|publisher=[[Hitlisten]]|accessdate=April 15, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Estonia ([[Eesti Tipp-40]])<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ekspress.delfi.ee/areen/eesti-tipp-40-muusikas-sel-nadalal-paugutab-tradattack?id=89544845|title=EESTI TIPP-40 MUUSIKAS: Sel n\u00e4dalal paugutab Trad.Attack!|website=[[Eesti Ekspress]]|language=Estonian|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n| 2\n|-\n{{single chart|Finland|4|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 19, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| France ([[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique|SNEP]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://snepmusique.com/les-tops/le-top-de-la-semaine/top-albums/?semaine=16?&annee=2020&categorie=Top%20Singles|title=Top Singles (Week 16, 2020)|publisher=[[Syndicat National de l'\u00c9dition Phonographique]]|language=French|accessdate=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n{{single chart|Germany2|3|songid=1977918|artist=Drake|song=Toosie Slide|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 17, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Greece ([[IFPI Greece|IFPI]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.gr/digital_ien.html|publisher=[[IFPI Greece]]|accessdate=April 14, 2020|title=Official IFPI Charts \u2013 Digital Singles Chart (International) \u2013 Week: 14/2020}}</ref>\n| 9\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarysingle|28|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n{{single chart|Hungarystream|4|year=2020|week=15|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Iceland ([[Music of Iceland|Tonlist]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plotutidindi.is/lagalistinn/|title=T\u00d3NLISTINN \u2013 Vika 15 \u2013 2020; Pl\u00f6tut\u00ed\u00f0indi}}</ref>\n| 13\n|-\n{{single chart|Ireland4|2|date=20200410|rowheader=true|accessdate=April 11, 2020}}\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Italy ([[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fimi.it/top-of-the-music/classifiche.kl#/charts/3/2020/16|title=Top Singoli \u2013 Classifica settimanale WK 16|publisher=[[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana]]|language=Italian|accessdate=April 18, 2020}}</ref>\n| 7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Latvia ([[Latvijas Radio 5|Latvijas Top 40]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pieci.lv/lv/lr5/top40|title=Latvijas Top 40|publisher=[[Latvijas Radio]]|date=April 16, 2020|accessdate=April 16, 2020}}</ref>\n| 23\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania ([[AGATA (organization)|AGATA]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agata.lt/lt/naujienos/savaites-klausomiausi-2020w15/|title=2020 15-os SAVAIT\u0116S (baland\u017eio 3-9 d.)

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma!

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John.

Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.  Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the [[Surrey (carriage)|surrey]] with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").\n\n\n-\n\n==Musical numbers==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Act I\n* Overture \u2013 Orchestra\n* \"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\" \u2013 Curly\n* Laurey's Entrance \u2013 Laurey & Curly\n* \"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\" \u2013 Curly, Laurey, & Aunt Eller\n* \"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\" \u2013 Will Parker, Aunt Eller, Male Ensemble\n* \"[[I Cain't Say No]]\" \u2013 Ado Annie\n* Entrance of Ensemble (\"I Cain't Say No\" and \"Oh What a Beautiful Mornin'\") \u2013 Will, Ado Annie, Curly, Aunt Eller & Ensemble\n* \"[[Many a New Day]]\" \u2013 Laurey and Female Ensemble\n* \"[[It's a Scandal!

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.  Lyrics in the song about a [[burlesque]] stripteaser were slightly changed to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\"/>  In a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. [[Jerome Kern|Kern's]] exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\"<ref>Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak, eds.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/463410|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma!

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John.

Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

The New Haven and [[Boston]] audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping [[Number (music)|musical number]], \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.<ref>[[Helene Hanff|Hanff, Helene]].

He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.  Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon.

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.  Lyrics in the song about a [[burlesque]] stripteaser were slightly changed to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\"/>  In a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/463410|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus. Buescher replied that he was eighteen years old when he joined and did not recall if the Knights had at that time taken any position on those issues with which the Senator now disagreed.<ref name=jud/>\n\nWriting in the [[Los Angeles Times]], Rabbi Mitchell Rocklin said that the senators approach amounted to a \"religious test\" such as is precluded by Article VI of the Constitution. Rabbi Rocklin said: \"The line of questioning Buescher faced about his affiliation with the Knights of Columbus sets a troubling precedent of intolerance\u2014one that is unconscionable in principle and terrible in practice for people of all faiths who seek a role in public service. ...For centuries, many Jews have suffered a similar 'dual loyalty' smear: the anti-Semitic lie that, faced with a choice between country and religion, a Jewish public official will put his faith before his country.\"<ref name=Rocklin>[https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rocklin-brian-buescher-20190116-story.html Rocklin, Mitchell. \"Op-Ed: Keep religious tests out of the Senate\", ''Los Angeles Times'', January 16, 2019]</ref> Micklin noted the anti-Semitism experienced by Justices [[Louis Brandeis]] and [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]], and further state, \"It is even more absurd for senators to imply that a judge, who cannot propose or enact legislation, would be incapable of setting aside his religious beliefs when interpreting our written laws. ...If sitting lawmakers are allowed to make such assumptions of Catholic nominees, religious minorities could very well be next.\"<ref name=Rocklin/>\n==History==\n===War and peace issues===\n====World War I====\n[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]\n\nOn April 14, 1917, soon after the United States entered [[World War I]], the board of directors passed a resolution calling \"for the active cooperation and patriotic zeal of 400,000 members of the order in this country to our Republic and its law, pledge their continued and unconditional support to the President and Congress of the Nation, in their determination to protect its honor and its ideals of humanity and right.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=2}}\n\nThe order also instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million to provide for the welfare of the troops fighting in Europe.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Canadian knights took up the cause earlier, reflecting their earlier entry into the conflict.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}} It was said it was their \"finest hour\" as Catholics and as Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\nIn 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights joined other organizations in raising funds to support the welfare of the troops both in the United States and overseas, which, along with the contribution of the National Catholic War Council, totaled $30 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} Staff and chaplains were sent to all Army camps and [[cantonment]]<nowiki/>s.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The order's motto for this effort was \"Everyone welcome, everything free.\"{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407\u2013408}} The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} The remaining $19 million was used to establish educational programs for returning servicemen.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}\n\n\n\nAccording to Supreme Knight Flaherty, \"The war provided us with an opportunity to put ourselves before the public in a most favorable light,\"{{sfn|Dumenil|1991|p=23}} and in Canada to show that in addition to being Catholic, they were also loyal Canadians.{{sfn|McGowan|1999|p=180}}\n\n===Cristero War===\nFollowing the [[Mexican Revolution]], the new government began persecuting the church. To destroy the church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution of Catholics that resulted in the deaths of thousands, including [[List of Knights of Columbus#Saints|several priests who were also Knights of Columbus]]. Leaders of the order began speaking out against the Mexican government. ''Columbia'', the official magazine of the Knights, published articles critical of the regime. After the November 1926 cover of ''Columbia'' portrayed Knights carrying a banner of liberty and warning of \"The Red Peril of Mexico,\" the Mexican legislature banned both the order and the magazine throughout the country.<ref name=\"Pelowski\" />\n\nIn 1926, the Massachusetts State Council passed a resolution opposing the Mexican government and in defense of human rights.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} Ten days later, State Deputy [[Edmund J. Brandon]] sent a telegram to President [[Calvin Coolidge]] and Secretary of State [[Frank B. Kellogg]] opposing the deportation of a Mexican archbishop.{{sfn|Lapomarda|1992|p=37}} That same year, a delegation of Supreme Council officers met with President Coolidge to share with him their concerns about the persecution of Catholics in Mexico.\n\nThe order subsequently smuggled into Mexico pamphlets in English and Spanish denouncing the anticlerical Mexican government and its policies,<ref name=\"legacy\" /> provoking efforts at the border to stop the flow.{{sfn|Young|2015|pp=108\u2013109}}<ref name=\"king\" /> Twenty-five [[Saints of the Cristero War|martyrs from the conflict]] would eventually be canonized, including six Knights.<ref name=\"martyr\" />{{sfn|Meyer|1976}}\n\nSupreme Treasurer Daniel J.

blue band on top.|Tens of thousands of Knights of Columbus placards are handed out at the [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March For Life]].]]\n'''Political activity of the Knights of Columbus''' concerns any involvement of the [[Knights of Columbus]], a Catholic [[fraternal and service organizations|fraternal service organization]], to try to influence public and government policy.\n\nDuring the 20th century and especially the [[Cold War]], the order had a history of  [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] and anti-socialist crusades.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=364\u2013365}} It also established the Commission on Religious Prejudices and the Knights of Columbus Historical Commission to combat racism.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}} It was supportive of [[trade unionism]] and published the works of men including [[George Ernest Schuster|George Schuster]], [[Samuel Flagg Bemis]], [[Allan Nevins]], and [[W.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B. Du Bois]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=366\u2013367}}\n\nMore recently it has been active on social conservative issues, including [[opposition to same-sex marriage]], [[abortion]], [[divorce]], and [[birth control]], including requiring employers to provide it in violation of their religious beliefs. It has also been critical of the [[Immigration policy of Donald Trump|President Donald Trump's immigration policy]], and supportive of immigrants and refugees. Both in the United States and around the world, it has defended [[religious freedom]]. \n\n==Background==\nThe [[Knights of Columbus]] were active politically from an early date. In the years following the [[Second Vatican Council]], however, according to Christopher Kauffman, the Catholic anti-defamation character of the order began to diminish as Catholics became more accepted, and the leadership attempted to stimulate the membership to a greater awareness of the religious and moral issues confronting the Church. That led to the creation of a \"variety of new programs reflecting the proliferation of the new social ministries of the church\".{{sfn|Kauffman|1982}}\n\nIn December 2018, during the confirmation process of nominee [[Brian C. Buescher]] to the [[United States district court|U.S. District Court]], \"liberal\" Senator Mazie K. Hirono<ref name=\"Mazie Hirono on the Issues\">{{cite web |title=Mazie Hirono on the Issues |publisher=On the Issues |access-date=November 18, 2018 |url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Mazie_Hirono.htm }}]</ref> characterized the position the Knights of Columbus have taken on social issues as \"extreme\" and asked Buescher, \"If confirmed, do you intend to end your membership with this organization to avoid any appearance of bias?\"<ref name=jud>[https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Buescher%20Responses%20to%20QFRs.pdf \"Nomination of Brian Buescher to the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska Questions for the Record December 5, 2018\", Judiciary.senate.gov.]</ref> Senator [[Kamala Harris]] also asked about opinions held by the organization and asked Buescher if he was aware these views when he joined the Knights of Columbus.

He originally asked [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] to be the Philharmonic's first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected [[Walter Henry Rothwell]], former assistant to [[Gustav Mahler]], as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony.

He conducted many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to important new works by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. The orchestra responded well to his leadership, but Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes.\n[[Image:Hollywood bowl and sign.jpg|left|thumb|Hollywood Bowl]]\nThings were further complicated when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created with the goal to stabilize the orchestra's funding, with the association's president, [[Harvey Seeley Mudd|Harvey Mudd]], stepping up to personally guarantee Klemperer's salary. The Philharmonic's concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] also brought in much needed revenue.<ref name=\"swed\"/><ref name=pbs>{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Story| first=Alan| last=Rich| work=The Los Angeles Philharmonic Inaugurates Walt Disney Concert Hall| network=[[PBS]]| accessdate=2008-05-03| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807162206/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| archivedate=2008-08-07}}</ref> With that, the orchestra managed to make it through the worst of the [[Great Depression]] years still intact.\n\nThen, after completing the 1939 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl, Klemperer was visiting Boston and was incorrectly diagnosed with a brain tumor, and the subsequent brain surgery left him partially paralyzed. He went into a depressive state and was institutionalized. When he escaped, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a cover story declaring him missing. After he was found in New Jersey, a picture of him behind bars was printed in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''.

Besides leading efforts to create a performing arts center for the city that would serve as the Philharmonic's new home, and would eventually lead to the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], she and others wanted a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra; after Wallenstein's departure, Chandler led efforts to hire then [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] principal conductor, [[Eduard van Beinum]] as the LAPO music director. The Philharmonic's musicians, management and audience all loved Beinum, but in 1959, he suffered a massive heart attack while on the podium during a rehearsal of the Concertgebouw Orchestra and died.<ref name=pbs/>\n\nIn 1960, the orchestra, led again by Chandler, signed [[Georg Solti]] to a three-year contract to be music director after he had guest conducted the orchestra in winter concerts downtown, at the [[Hollywood Bowl]], and in other Southern California locations including CAMA concerts in Santa Barbara.<ref>{{cite web| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Concert Listings, 1950\u20131960| work=CAMA Archives| url=http://www.camasb.org/archives/1950-60.shtml| publisher=Santa Barbara Community Arts Music Association| accessdate=2008-05-03| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602023727/http://www.camasb.org/archives/1950-60.shtml| archivedate=2008-06-02}}</ref> Solti was to officially begin his tenure in 1962, and the Philharmonic had hoped that he would lead the orchestra when it moved into its new home at the then yet-to-be-completed [[Dorothy Chandler Pavilion]]; he even began to appoint musicians to the orchestra.<ref name=\"Leeds\">{{cite news| first=Jeff| last=Leeds| title=Sir Georg Solti: Led Chicago Symphony to World Renown| work=The Los Angeles Times| date=6 September 1997| accessdate=November 6, 2017| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/158995071/?terms=george%2Bsolti%2Bled%2Bchicago|url-access=subscription }}</ref> However, Solti abruptly resigned the position in 1961 without officially taking the post after learning that the Philharmonic board of directors failed to consult him before naming then 26-year-old [[Zubin Mehta]] to be assistant conductor of the orchestra.<ref name=\"Time writers\">{{cite news| title=Buffie & the Baton| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872266,00.html| work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date=14 April 1961| accessdate=2007-11-08}}</ref> Mehta was subsequently named to replace Solti.\n\n===1969\u20131997: Ernest Fleischmann's tenure===\n<!--[[Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group]] redirects directly here.-->\n\nIn 1969, the orchestra hired [[Ernest Fleischmann]] to be Executive Vice President and General Manager. During his tenure, the Philharmonic instituted a number of then-revolutionary ideas, including the creation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group and its \"Green Umbrella\" concerts; both of these adjunct groups were composed of the orchestra's musicians but offered performance series which were separate and distinct from traditional Philharmonic concerts. They were eventually imitated by other orchestras throughout the world. This concept was ahead of its time, and was an outgrowth of Fleischmann's philosophy, most famously laid out in his 16 May 1987 commencement address at the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]] entitled, \"The Orchestra is Dead. Long Live the Community of Musicians.\"\n\nWhen Zubin Mehta left for the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1978, Fleischmann convinced [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] to take over as Music Director. Giulini's time with the orchestra was well regarded, however, he resigned the position after his wife became ill, and returned to Italy.\n\nIn 1985, Fleischmann turned to [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] with the hopes that his conducting credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including [[Kurt Sanderling]], [[Simon Rattle]], and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as \"Principal Guest Conductor\", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992.<ref name=\"Bernheimer\">{{cite news| title=The Tyrant of Philharmonic| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Martin| last=Bernheimer| date=8 October 1989| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/175265106/?terms=The%2BTyrant%2Bof%2BPhilharmonic|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.\n\nSalonen's tenure with the orchestra first began with a residency at the 1992 [[Salzburg Festival]] in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera ''[[Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise]]'' by [[Olivier Messiaen]]; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the [[Lucerne Festival]] in Switzerland, [[The Proms]] in London, in [[Cologne]] for a festival of Salonen's own works, and in 1996 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris for a [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] festival conducted by Salonen and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It was during the Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were reinvigorated to lead fundraising efforts for the soon-to-be built [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].\n\nUnder Salonen's leadership, the Philharmonic has become an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] of ''The New Yorker'' said:\n\n{{quote|The Salonen era in L.A. may mark a turning point in the recent history of classical music in America. It is a story not of an individual magically imprinting his personality on an institution\u2014what Salonen has called the \"empty hype\" of conductor worship\u2014but of an individual and an institution bringing out unforeseen capabilities in each other, and thereby proving how much life remains in the orchestra itself, at once the most conservative and the most powerful of musical organisms.\n\n... no American orchestra matches the L.A. Philharmonic in its ability to assimilate a huge range of music on a moment's notice. [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s|[Thomas] Ad\u00e8s]], who first conducted his own music in L.A. [in 2005] and has become an annual visitor, told me, \"They always seem to begin by finding exactly the right playing style for each piece of music\u2014the kind of sound, the kind of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], breathing, attacks, colors, the indefinable whole. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is.\" [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] calls the Philharmonic \"the most ''Amurrican'' {{sic}} of orchestras. They don't hold back and they don't put on airs. If you met them in twos or threes, you'd have no idea they were playing in an orchestra, that they were classical-music people.\"<ref name=\"Ross1\"/>}}\n\n===1998\u20132009===\nWhen Fleischmann decided to retire in 1998 after 28 years at the helm, the orchestra named Willem Wijnbergen as its new Executive Director. Wijnbergen, a Dutch pianist and arts administrator, was the managing director of the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam. Initially, his appointment was hailed as a major coup for the orchestra.\n\nOne of his most important decisions was to modify Hollywood Bowl programing:  he increased the number of jazz concerts and appointed [[John Clayton (bassist)|John Clayton]] serving as the orchestra's first Jazz Chair; in addition, he established a new [[World Music]] series with [[Tom Schnabel]] as programming director<ref name=\"Dutka\">{{cite news| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Elaine| last=Dutka| title=Bowl Reveals Tempo Changes| date=November 11, 1998| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/11/entertainment/ca-41419| accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref>  Despite some successes, Wijnbergen left the orchestra in 1999 after only one controversy-filled year, and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired by the Philharmonic's board of directors.<ref>{{cite news| title=Off-the-Podium Intrigue Surrounds Two Leading Jobs| work=The New York Times| first=Bernard| last=Holland| date=22 August 1999| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DC1F39F931A1575BC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2| accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\nLater that same year, [[Deborah Borda]], then the Executive Director of the [[New York Philharmonic]], was hired to take over executive management of the orchestra. She began her tenure in January 2000, and was later given the title of President and Chief Executive Officer. After financial problems experienced during Wijnbergen's short tenure, Borda \u2014 \"a formidable executive who runs the orchestra like a lean company, not like a flabby non-profit\" \u2014 \"put the organization on solid financial footing.\"<ref name=\"Ross1\"/>  She is widely credited (along with Salonen, [[Frank Gehry]], and [[Yasuhisa Toyota]]) for the orchestra's very successful move to [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], and for wholeheartedly supporting and complementing Salonen's artistic vision.  One example cited by [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]:\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps Borda's boldest notion is to give visiting composers such as [[John Adams (composer)|[John] Adams]] and [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] the same royal treatment that is extended to the likes of [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and [[Joshua Bell]]; Borda talks about \"hero composers.\" A recent performance of Adams's monumental California symphony \"Na\u00efve and Sentimental Music\" in the orchestra's Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda's big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra's long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer [[Brett Dean]] recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a double take, saying that it was the largest new-music audience he'd ever seen.<ref name=\"Ross1\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn July 13, 2005, a young Venezuelan conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, made his debut with the LA Phil at the orchestra's summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. In his U.S. debut Tuesday night, a 24-year-old conductor from Venezuela with curly hair, long sideburns and a baby face accomplished something increasingly rare and difficult at the Hollywood Bowl.  He got a normally restive audience's full, immediate and rapt attention.

He originally asked [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]] to be the Philharmonic's first music director; however, Rachmaninoff had only recently moved to New York, and he did not wish to move again. Clark then selected [[Walter Henry Rothwell]], former assistant to [[Gustav Mahler]], as music director, and hired away several principal musicians from East Coast orchestras and others from the competing and soon-to-be defunct Los Angeles Symphony.

He conducted many LA Phil premieres, and introduced Los Angeles audiences to important new works by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Arnold Schoenberg]]. The orchestra responded well to his leadership, but Klemperer had a difficult time adjusting to Southern California, a situation exacerbated by repeated manic-depressive episodes.\n[[Image:Hollywood bowl and sign.jpg|left|thumb|Hollywood Bowl]]\nThings were further complicated when founder William Andrews Clark died without leaving the orchestra an endowment. The newly formed Southern California Symphony Association was created with the goal to stabilize the orchestra's funding, with the association's president, [[Harvey Seeley Mudd|Harvey Mudd]], stepping up to personally guarantee Klemperer's salary. The Philharmonic's concerts at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] also brought in much needed revenue.<ref name=\"swed\"/><ref name=pbs>{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| title=Los Angeles Philharmonic Story| first=Alan| last=Rich| work=The Los Angeles Philharmonic Inaugurates Walt Disney Concert Hall| network=[[PBS]]| accessdate=2008-05-03| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807162206/http://www.pbs.org/wnet/gperf/shows/disneyhall/essay1.html| archivedate=2008-08-07}}</ref> With that, the orchestra managed to make it through the worst of the [[Great Depression]] years still intact.\n\nThen, after completing the 1939 summer season at the Hollywood Bowl, Klemperer was visiting Boston and was incorrectly diagnosed with a brain tumor, and the subsequent brain surgery left him partially paralyzed. He went into a depressive state and was institutionalized. When he escaped, ''[[The New York Times]]'' ran a cover story declaring him missing. After he was found in New Jersey, a picture of him behind bars was printed in the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]''. He subsequently lost the post of Music Director, though he still would occasionally conduct the Philharmonic.

Besides leading efforts to create a performing arts center for the city that would serve as the Philharmonic's new home, and would eventually lead to the [[Los Angeles Music Center]], she and others wanted a more prominent conductor to lead the orchestra; after Wallenstein's departure, Chandler led efforts to hire then [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] principal conductor, [[Eduard van Beinum]] as the LAPO music director.

During his tenure, the Philharmonic instituted a number of then-revolutionary ideas, including the creation of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society and the Los Angeles Philharmonic New Music Group and its \"Green Umbrella\" concerts; both of these adjunct groups were composed of the orchestra's musicians but offered performance series which were separate and distinct from traditional Philharmonic concerts. They were eventually imitated by other orchestras throughout the world. This concept was ahead of its time, and was an outgrowth of Fleischmann's philosophy, most famously laid out in his 16 May 1987 commencement address at the [[Cleveland Institute of Music]] entitled, \"The Orchestra is Dead. Long Live the Community of Musicians.\"\n\nWhen Zubin Mehta left for the [[New York Philharmonic]] in 1978, Fleischmann convinced [[Carlo Maria Giulini]] to take over as Music Director. Giulini's time with the orchestra was well regarded, however, he resigned the position after his wife became ill, and returned to Italy.\n\nIn 1985, Fleischmann turned to [[Andr\u00e9 Previn]] with the hopes that his conducting credentials and time spent at Hollywood Studios would add a local flair and enhance the connection between conductor, orchestra, and city. While Previn's tenure was musically satisfactory, other conductors including [[Kurt Sanderling]], [[Simon Rattle]], and [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], fared better at the box office. Previn clashed frequently with Fleischmann; one such conflict occurred over Fleischmann's failure to consult Previn over the decision to name Salonen as \"Principal Guest Conductor\", a move mirroring the prior Solti/Mehta controversy. Because of Previn's objections, the position and Japan tour offer made to Salonen were withdrawn; however, shortly thereafter in April 1989, Previn resigned, and four months later, Salonen was named Music Director Designate, officially taking the post in October 1992.<ref name=\"Bernheimer\">{{cite news| title=The Tyrant of Philharmonic| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Martin| last=Bernheimer| date=8 October 1989| url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/175265106/?terms=The%2BTyrant%2Bof%2BPhilharmonic|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Salonen's U.S. conducting debut with the orchestra had been in 1984.\n\nSalonen's tenure with the orchestra first began with a residency at the 1992 [[Salzburg Festival]] in concert performances and as the pit orchestra in a production of the opera ''[[Saint Fran\u00e7ois d'Assise]]'' by [[Olivier Messiaen]]; it was the first time an American orchestra was given that opportunity. Salonen later took the orchestra on many other tours of the United States, Europe, and Asia, and residencies at the [[Lucerne Festival]] in Switzerland, [[The Proms]] in London, in [[Cologne]] for a festival of Salonen's own works, and in 1996 at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet]] in Paris for a [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] festival conducted by Salonen and [[Pierre Boulez]]. It was during the Paris residency that key Philharmonic board members heard the orchestra perform in improved acoustics and were reinvigorated to lead fundraising efforts for the soon-to-be built [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].\n\nUnder Salonen's leadership, the Philharmonic has become an extremely progressive and well-regarded orchestra. [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]] of ''The New Yorker'' said:\n\n{{quote|The Salonen era in L.A. may mark a turning point in the recent history of classical music in America. It is a story not of an individual magically imprinting his personality on an institution\u2014what Salonen has called the \"empty hype\" of conductor worship\u2014but of an individual and an institution bringing out unforeseen capabilities in each other, and thereby proving how much life remains in the orchestra itself, at once the most conservative and the most powerful of musical organisms.\n\n... no American orchestra matches the L.A. Philharmonic in its ability to assimilate a huge range of music on a moment's notice. [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s|[Thomas] Ad\u00e8s]], who first conducted his own music in L.A. [in 2005] and has become an annual visitor, told me, \"They always seem to begin by finding exactly the right playing style for each piece of music\u2014the kind of sound, the kind of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], breathing, attacks, colors, the indefinable whole. That shouldn't be unusual, but it is.\" [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] calls the Philharmonic \"the most ''Amurrican'' {{sic}} of orchestras. They don't hold back and they don't put on airs. If you met them in twos or threes, you'd have no idea they were playing in an orchestra, that they were classical-music people.\"<ref name=\"Ross1\"/>}}\n\n===1998\u20132009===\nWhen Fleischmann decided to retire in 1998 after 28 years at the helm, the orchestra named Willem Wijnbergen as its new Executive Director. Wijnbergen, a Dutch pianist and arts administrator, was the managing director of the [[Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam. Initially, his appointment was hailed as a major coup for the orchestra.\n\nOne of his most important decisions was to modify Hollywood Bowl programing:  he increased the number of jazz concerts and appointed [[John Clayton (bassist)|John Clayton]] serving as the orchestra's first Jazz Chair; in addition, he established a new [[World Music]] series with [[Tom Schnabel]] as programming director<ref name=\"Dutka\">{{cite news| work=Los Angeles Times| first=Elaine| last=Dutka| title=Bowl Reveals Tempo Changes| date=November 11, 1998| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/11/entertainment/ca-41419| accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref>  Despite some successes, Wijnbergen left the orchestra in 1999 after only one controversy-filled year, and it is unclear whether he resigned or was fired by the Philharmonic's board of directors.<ref>{{cite news| title=Off-the-Podium Intrigue Surrounds Two Leading Jobs| work=The New York Times| first=Bernard| last=Holland| date=22 August 1999| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E0DC1F39F931A1575BC0A96F958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=2| accessdate=2008-05-03}}</ref>\n\nLater that same year, [[Deborah Borda]], then the Executive Director of the [[New York Philharmonic]], was hired to take over executive management of the orchestra. She began her tenure in January 2000, and was later given the title of President and Chief Executive Officer. After financial problems experienced during Wijnbergen's short tenure, Borda \u2014 \"a formidable executive who runs the orchestra like a lean company, not like a flabby non-profit\" \u2014 \"put the organization on solid financial footing.\"<ref name=\"Ross1\"/>  She is widely credited (along with Salonen, [[Frank Gehry]], and [[Yasuhisa Toyota]]) for the orchestra's very successful move to [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]], and for wholeheartedly supporting and complementing Salonen's artistic vision.  One example cited by [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]:\n\n<blockquote>Perhaps Borda's boldest notion is to give visiting composers such as [[John Adams (composer)|[John] Adams]] and [[Thomas Ad\u00e8s]] the same royal treatment that is extended to the likes of [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and [[Joshua Bell]]; Borda talks about \"hero composers.\" A recent performance of Adams's monumental California symphony \"Na\u00efve and Sentimental Music\" in the orchestra's Casual Fridays series ... drew a nearly full house. Borda's big-guns approach has invigorated the orchestra's long-running new-music series, called Green Umbrella, which Fleischmann established in 1982. In the early days, it drew modest audiences, but in recent years attendance has risen to the point where as many as sixteen hundred people show up for a concert that in other cities might draw thirty or forty. The Australian composer [[Brett Dean]] recently walked onstage for a Green Umbrella concert and did a double take, saying that it was the largest new-music audience he'd ever seen.<ref name=\"Ross1\"/></blockquote>\n\nOn July 13, 2005, a young Venezuelan conductor, Gustavo Dudamel, made his debut with the LA Phil at the orchestra's summer home, the Hollywood Bowl. In his U.S. debut Tuesday night, a 24-year-old conductor from Venezuela with curly hair, long sideburns and a baby face accomplished something increasingly rare and difficult at the Hollywood Bowl.  He got a normally restive audience's full, immediate and rapt attention.

[[Michael Tilson Thomas]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], and Sir [[Simon Rattle]] also made several recordings with the orchestra in the 1980s, adding to their rising international profile. In recent years, Esa-Pekka Salonen has led recording sessions for [[Sony]] and [[Deutsche Grammophon]]. A recording of the ''[[Concerto for Orchestra (Bart\u00f3k)|Concerto for Orchestra]]'' by [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]] released by [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in 2007 was the first recording by [[Gustavo Dudamel]] conducting the LA Phil.\n\nThe Los Angeles Philharmonic performed the music in the pilot film of the television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (1978 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', composed by [[Stu Phillips (composer)|Stu Phillips]] and [[Glen A. Larson]]. The LA Philharmonic also performed the first North American concert for the popular ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' franchise game music, ''[[Final Fantasy concerts|Dear Friends: Music From Final Fantasy]]'' by [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. The orchestra has most recently recorded the sound track for the video game: ''[[BioShock 2]]'' as composed by [[Garry Schyman]].\n\n==World premieres==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Season !!
