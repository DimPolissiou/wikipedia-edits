She was married to the painter [[Ben Nicholson]], and was thus the daughter-in-law of the painter [[William Nicholson (painter)|William Nicholson]] and his wife, the painter [[Mabel Pryde]]. She was the mother of the painter [[Kate Nicholson]].\n\nWinifred Nicholson was a [[Colourist painting|colourist]] who developed a personal [[Impressionism|impressionistic]] style, concentrating on domestic still life objects and landscapes. She often combined the two subjects as seen in her painting ''From Bedroom Window, Bankshead'' showing a landscape viewed through a window, with flowers in a vase in the foreground.\n\n== Life ==\n\nNicholson was born Rosa Winifred Roberts in [[Oxford]] on 21 December 1893.{{r|dnb|grove|benezit}} She was the eldest of the three children of the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] politician [[Charles Henry Roberts]] and Lady Cecilia Maude Howard, daughter of the politician [[George Howard, 9th Earl of Carlisle]], and of the activist [[Rosalind Howard, Countess of Carlisle|Rosalind Howard]].{{r|dnb}} Nicholson started painting as a teenager with her grandfather George Howard, who was a capable amateur painter and a friend of the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], and of the Italian landscape painter [[Nino Costa]], founder of the [[Etruscan School]].{{r|dnb}} Nicholson attended the [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] in London from about 1910{{r|dnb}} or 1912{{r|grove}} until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, and again from 1918\u20131919.{{r|dnb}}\n\nIn 1919 Nicholson travelled with her father, who had been [[Under-Secretary of State for India]], to [[Burma]] (now Myanmar), [[Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka) and India.\n\nOn 4 November 1920 she married the artist [[Ben Nicholson]], the son of the painter [[Sir William Newzam Prior Nicholson]] and his wife, the painter [[Mabel Pryde]].{{r|dnb|dnb2}} The couple bought a villa in Switzerland, the Villa Capriccio near the village of [[Castagnola]] on the north shore of [[Lake Lugano]] in [[Ticino]]. They spent the winters in Switzerland and the summers in Britain, painting [[still-life]]s and landscapes.{{r|grove}} In 1924 Winifred bought Bankshead, a farmhouse built on an [[ancient Roman]] castle forming part of [[Hadrian's Wall]], not far from the town of [[Brampton, Carlisle|Brampton]] in [[Cumbria]],{{r|dnb}} and close to the family seat, [[Naworth Castle]].{{r|grove}}\n\nIn 1924 Nicholson, who believed that she was [[Infertility|unable to conceive]], joined the [[Christian Science]] movement, which was in vogue in Britain at that time.{{r|button|page=16}} She and Ben eventually had three children: Jake was born in 1927,{{r|button|page=17}} [[Kate Nicholson|Kate]] in July 1929, and Andrew in 1931.{{r|button|page=19}} By the time of Kate's birth there were tensions in the marriage, and these were exacerbated by the suicide of their close friend, the painter [[Christopher Wood (painter)|Kit Wood]], in August 1930. In 1931 Ben met [[Barbara Hepworth]] \u2013 whom he later married \u2013 and he and Winifred separated.{{r|dnb2|benezit}} In 1932 Winifred moved with her three children to Paris, and from then until 1936 Ben often visited them there, sometimes with Hepworth. The marriage ended in divorce in 1938, and Ben married Hepworth in November of the same year.{{r|dnb2}}\n\nAlthough it is sometimes said incorrectly that with Ben, Winifred formed part of the artist colony at [[St Ives, Cornwall]], she was never permanently living there. Although she painted less in the abstract style than in the representational, she did experiment with her own form of abstraction in the 1930s. Influences between her and Ben were mutual, Ben often admitting he learnt much about colour from his first wife. After they separated, she lived half of each year during the 1930s in Paris. After her divorce from Ben Nicholson in 1938, she spent most of the rest of her long life in [[Cumberland]], at Boothby where her father lived, and at Bankshead, both near [[Lanercost]].\n\nShe died in [[Cumbria]] on 5 March 1981.{{r|dnb}}\n\n==Work==\nShe painted prolifically throughout her life, largely at home but also on trips to Italy, Greece and Scotland, among other places. Many of her works are still in private collections, but a number are in the [[Kettle's Yard]] art gallery, Cambridge, and several key works belong to Tate. One painting is believed to have hung at [[10 Downing Street]]. She had a lifelong fascination for rainbow and spectrum colours and in the 1970s she made particularly strong, innovative use of such colours in many of her paintings. She left some written accounts of her thoughts on colour.\n\nNicholson supported the Taiwanese artist [[Li Yuan-chia]], who had previously worked in Milan and London. He ran the \"LYC Museum\", close to Bankshead. Significant exhibitions of her works have taken place at the [[Tate]] Gallery (1987), at the [[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery]] in Carlisle, Cumbria, at [[Kettle's Yard]] in Cambridge and at the [[Dean Gallery]] in Edinburgh. Her auction record of \u00a3200,000 was set at Sotheby's auction house in London in November 2016 for her 1928 oil and coloured pencil on panel ''St Ives' Harbour'', from [[David Bowie]]'s collection - the pop star had bought the work at Christie's in 1994.<ref>[http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2016/bowie-collector-part-i-modern-contemporary-art-evening-auction-l16142/lot.2.html Sotheby's: ''Bowie/Collector'', November 2016]</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist | refs=\n{{efn|name = a |Following her separation from her husband she sometimes used the name \"Winifred Dacre\". \"Dacre\" is an old Howard family name; see [[Earl of Carlisle|Lord Carlisle]].}}\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=benezit>[http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/benezit/B00130233 Nicholson, Winifred].

[[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters).

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].\n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A. Sreedhara Menon|title=Political History of Modern Kerala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnAjqjhc1VcC&pg=PA140|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1987|publisher=D C Books|isbn=978-81-264-2156-5|pages=140\u2013}}</ref> Another source states that the ruler of Thekkumkur had sided first with the [[Odanad|Kingdom of Kayamkulam]] and then with the principality of [[Ambalapuzha]] against Travancore. After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India. It was welcomed by the government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy<ref name=\"cms\"/>\n[[File:Gandhi at vaikom satyagraha-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]|115px|left]]\n\nKottayam had a role in all the modern political agitations.

[[Kottayam Port]] is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the [[Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church]], called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam.{{citation needed lead|date=January 2020}}\n\nKottayam is home to one of the first English schools in India, and is a leader in literacy, known as '''Akshara Nagari''' (English: land of letters). Many of the first [[Malayalam]] daily newspapers, like ''[[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]]'', ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'', and ''[[Mangalam Publications|Mangalam]]'', were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as a number of publishing houses.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe royal house of the [[Thekkumkur]] ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta.

Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the [[Venad|Kulashekara Empire]] (800\u20131102&nbsp;AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and [[Vadakkumkur]], and the latter became a vassal of [[Kochi|Cochin]].\n\nThe royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi.\n\nThe [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] and the [[Dutch India|Dutch]] established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of [[Travancore]] in 1742, military operations of [[Marthanda Varma]] progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur.\n\nThough Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore.<ref>{{cite book|author=A. Sreedhara Menon|title=Political History of Modern Kerala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnAjqjhc1VcC&pg=PA140|accessdate=10 August 2012|year=1987|publisher=D C Books|isbn=978-81-264-2156-5|pages=140\u2013}}</ref> Another source states that the ruler of Thekkumkur had sided first with the [[Odanad|Kingdom of Kayamkulam]] and then with the principality of [[Ambalapuzha]] against Travancore. After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by [[Ramayyan Dalawa]], the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753.\n\nKottayam then became a part of the Princely State of Travancore.\n\n===Travancore Rule===\nThere existed no institution in the princely state of [[Travancore]] before the 1800s. In 1817, the [[Church Missionary Society]] of England established [[CMS College Kottayam|CMS College]] as the first college in India. It was welcomed by the government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy<ref name=\"cms\"/>\n[[File:Gandhi at vaikom satyagraha-2.jpg|thumb|[[Mahatma Gandhi]] at [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]|115px|left]]\n\nKottayam had a role in all the modern political agitations. The Malayali Memorial agitation of 1891 may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. This document, presented to the Maharaja Sri Moolam Thirunal, sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the civil service, and was drafted at a public meeting in the Kottayam public library. The event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the state.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/><ref name=\"Malayali Memorial\">[http://kottayam.nic.in/# Malayali Memorial is the movement that is said to be originated in Kottayam]</ref> The people of Kottayam also played a major role during the Abstention Movement in the 1930s, which advocated for the representation of Hindus of the [[Caste system in India|lower castes]] in the Travancore Legislature.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/> The [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924 against [[untouchability]], led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], took place in [[Vaikom]] near Kottayam.<ref name=\"Kurien\"/>\n\n===Post-independence===\nKottayam became a revenue division of Travancore.<ref name=\"Kurien\" /> A fifth division, [[Devikulam]], existed for a short period but was later added to Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the [[Travancore-Cochin|State of Travancore and Cochin]] in 1949, these revenue divisions were redesignated as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to [[district collector]]s, with the Kottayam district established in July&nbsp;1949.<ref>[http://kottayam.nic.in/#]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nKottayam has an average elevation of {{convert|3|m}} above sea level.<ref>[http://www.placesonline.com/asia/india/kerala/kottayam/introduction.asp]</ref> It is situated in the [[Drainage basin|basin]] of the [[Meenachil River]] and in the basin of the [[Vembanad]] backwaters, which are formed from several streams in the [[Western Ghats]] of the [[Idukki district]]. According to the division of places in Kerala based on altitudes, Kottayam is classified as a midland area. The general soil type is [[alluvium|alluvial]] soil. The vegetation is mainly tropical evergreen and moist deciduous.\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in this district is moderate and pleasant. Kottayam's proximity to the [[equator]] results in little seasonal temperature variation, with moderate to high levels of [[humidity]]. Annual temperatures range between {{convert|20|and|35|C|F}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} From June through September, the [[south-west monsoon]] brings in heavy rains, as Kottayam lies on the [[windward and leeward|windward]] side of the [[Western Ghats]]. From October to December, Kottayam receives light rain from the northwest monsoon. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|3200|mm}}.\n\nKottayam district is bordered by [[Pathanamthitta district]] on the south, [[Alappuzha district]] on the west, [[Ernakulam district]] on the north and [[Idukki district]] on the east.\n\n{{Weather box\n| location = Kottayam (1981\u20132010, extremes 1970\u20132012)\n| metric first = Y\n| single line = Y\n| Jan record high C = 36.6\n| Feb record high C = 37.5\n| Mar record high C = 38.5\n| Apr record high C = 38.0\n| May record high C = 36.9\n| Jun record high C = 35.9\n| Jul record high C = 34.7\n| Aug record high C = 33.8\n| Sep record high C = 34.9\n| Oct record high C = 35.0\n| Nov record high C = 36.0\n| Dec record high C = 35.6\n| year record high C = 38.5\n| Jan high C = 32.9\n| Feb high C = 33.6\n| Mar high C = 34.4\n| Apr high C = 34.0\n| May high C = 33.0\n| Jun high C = 30.3\n| Jul high C = 29.6\n| Aug high C = 30.1\n| Sep high C = 30.9\n| Oct high C = 31.2\n| Nov high C = 31.5\n| Dec high C = 32.4\n| year high C = 32.0\n| Jan low C = 22.2\n| Feb low C = 22.8\n| Mar low C = 23.8\n| Apr low C = 24.2\n| May low C = 24.0\n| Jun low C = 22.9\n| Jul low C = 22.7\n| Aug low C = 22.9\n| Sep low C = 23.2\n| Oct low C = 23.1\n| Nov low C = 23.1\n| Dec low C = 22.4\n| year low C = 23.1\n| Jan record low C = 16.9\n| Feb record low C = 16.0\n| Mar record low C = 18.5\n| Apr record low C = 20.2\n| May record low C = 16.9\n| Jun record low C = 18.0\n| Jul record low C = 18.1\n| Aug record low C = 16.9\n| Sep record low C = 20.2\n| Oct record low C = 19.2\n| Nov record low C = 18.1\n| Dec record low C = 16.0\n| year record low C = 16.0\n| rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 9.6\n| Feb rain mm = 22.8\n| Mar rain mm = 56.3\n| Apr rain mm = 147.4\n| May rain mm = 264.2\n| Jun rain mm = 640.0\n| Jul rain mm = 542.3\n| Aug rain mm = 382.8\n| Sep rain mm = 286.0\n| Oct rain mm = 335.8\n| Nov rain mm = 196.0\n| Dec rain mm = 40.9\n| year rain mm = 2924.1\n| Jan rain days = 0.9\n| Feb rain days = 1.4\n| Mar rain days = 3.0\n| Apr rain days = 8.3\n| May rain days = 10.9\n| Jun rain days = 22.3\n| Jul rain days = 22.3\n| Aug rain days = 17.3\n| Sep rain days = 12.8\n| Oct rain days = 14.3\n| Nov rain days = 9.7\n| Dec rain days = 2.7\n| year rain days = 125.8\n|time day = 17:30 [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| Jan humidity = 65\n| Feb humidity = 63\n| Mar humidity = 63\n| Apr humidity = 67\n| May humidity = 71\n| Jun humidity = 80\n| Jul humidity = 81\n| Aug humidity = 79\n| Sep humidity = 76\n| Oct humidity = 76\n| Nov humidity = 75\n| Dec humidity = 67\n|year humidity = 72\n|source 1 = [[India Meteorological Department]]<ref name=IMDnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205040301/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/1981-2010%20CLIM%20NORMALS%20%28STATWISE%29.pdf\n| title = Station: Kottayam Climatological Table 1981\u20132010\n| work = Climatological Normals 1981\u20132010\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = January 2015\n| pages = 433\u2013434\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=IMDextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20200205042509/http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| archivedate = 5 February 2020\n| url = http://imdpune.gov.in/library/public/EXTREMES%20OF%20TEMPERATURE%20and%20RAINFALL%20upto%202012.pdf\n| title = Extremes of Temperature & Rainfall for Indian Stations (Up to 2012)\n| publisher = India Meteorological Department\n| date = December 2016\n| page = M107\n| accessdate = 29 February 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations|type=India\n|align=left\n| 1901|17552\n| 1911|15141\n| 1921|18833\n| 1931|25236\n| 1941|33364\n| 1951|44204\n| 1961|52685\n| 1971|59714\n| 1981|64431\n| 1991|89625\n| 2001|129894\n| 2011|172878\n}}\n\n===Population===\n{{As of|2001}} India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=16 June 2004|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=1 November 2008|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Kottayam [[Urban agglomeration|Urban Agglomeration]] had a population of 172,878<!-- Link removed:<ref>http://www.censusindia.gov.in/towns/ker_towns.pdf</ref> -->, while Kottayam district had a population of 1,974,551.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

November 4, 2008</ref>\n\nHamilton attended the [[Hackley School]] in [[Tarrytown, New York]], graduating in 1957.<ref name=\"PAGESIX\">Burroni, Christine, [https://pagesix.com/20George Hamilton reminisces about his high school days\"], ''pagesix.com'', October 21, 2017</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early appearances===\nHamilton's first roles were in TV. He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]'', ''[[Hart to Hart]]'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor. Subsequently, Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show, ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]''. In August 2008, Hamilton co-starred in ''Coma'', a web series on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Madsen, George Hamilton and Paul Ben-Victor Star in Coma, an Original Web Series Premiering On Crackle.com|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73148|publisher=webwire.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[My One and Only (film)|My One and Only]]'', which is loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother.\n\nHamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009&nbsp;\u2013 his 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |title=Content Marketing Platform - B2B and B2C Content Marketing Technology - NewsCred |publisher=Daylife.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070010/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508121758/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars+dedicated+by+date.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=May 8, 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me out of Here!

For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (film)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the miniseries ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice (film)|Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (1993 film)|Amore!]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.
