Such message inspired me to shed light on an aspect of my private life which I have kept distant from my career in music. I came to fully recognize that I was gay when I was sixteen. I decided not to publicize my sexuality largely due to a matter of privacy, as I was still trying to find comfort and confidence within my own skin. Further, I always found conversations regarding music, politics, art, books \u2013 and the greatness of Nas' catalog \u2013 to be far more interesting than what type of guy I was into. This is still true today. While this message is most definitely overdue, I encourage anyone who is navigating their sexuality to devote as much time as they need to the process of finding self-confidence, self-acceptance, and self-love. Hell, for me, it took years to write this message. Nevertheless, I figured now was the time to let a few more friends know that I am happy, I am here for you, and I am proud of who I am.

On July 19, 2017, Chance [[Coming out|came out]] as gay in an [[Instagram]] post.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BWvYc54Hc51/ |first=Greyson |last=Chance |via=Instagram |date=July 19, 2017 |title=The decision to write this came after I received a message from a brave individual. Such message inspired me to shed light on an aspect of my private life which I have kept distant from my career in music. I came to fully recognize that I was gay when I was sixteen. I decided not to publicize my sexuality largely due to a matter of privacy, as I was still trying to find comfort and confidence within my own skin. Further, I always found conversations regarding music, politics, art, books \u2013 and the greatness of Nas' catalog \u2013 to be far more interesting than what type of guy I was into. This is still true today. While this message is most definitely overdue, I encourage anyone who is navigating their sexuality to devote as much time as they need to the process of finding self-confidence, self-acceptance, and self-love. Hell, for me, it took years to write this message. Nevertheless, I figured now was the time to let a few more friends know that I am happy, I am here for you, and I am proud of who I am.

The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%; margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+ '''Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)'''\n!|Role:\n!|Name:\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Hosts\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n|[[Titus O'Neil]]\n|-\n|rowspan=4|English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Ring announcer]]s\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|rowspan=7|[[Referee (professional wrestling)|Referees]]\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n|rowspan=2|Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, Liv Morgan faced Natalya.
