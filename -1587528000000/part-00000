It is flavoured with [[cardamom]], [[raisin]]s, [[saffron]], [[cashew]]s, [[pistachio]]s, [[almond]]s or other dry fruits and nuts. It is typically served during a meal or as a [[dessert]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word 'Kheer' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word for [[milk]], ''[[Ksheer]]''(\u0915\u094d\u0937\u0940\u0930). Ksheer is also the archaic name for sweet rice pudding.<ref>https://food.manoramaonline.com/food/foodie/2019/07/12/sweet-story-payasam-indian-states.html</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nKheer was a part of the ancient Indian diet and is mentioned in ''[[Ayurveda]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gounesco.com/kheer-the-quintessential-affair-indian-milk/|title=Kheer: The Quintessential Indian Milk Affair|accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the food historian [[K. T. Achaya]], ''payas'' was a popular dish in [[ancient India]], first mentioned in ancient Indian literature, it was a mixture of rice, milk and sugar, a formula that has endured for over two thousand years. Payas was also a staple [[Hindu]] temple food, in particular, it was associated with [[Lord Shiva]] and served as ''[[Pras\u0101da]]'' to his devotees.<ref>https://m.hindustantimes.com/india/a-truly-international-dessert/story-kfaP9BbuLcuyvCr5A03VGL.html</ref>\n\n==Regional variations==\nPayasam was always the main sweet dish at [[Hindu]] temples and part of their celebrations. It was mainly served in [[sadhya]] in marriage functions as well as in [[Nair]] community marriages.  Other terms like ''Payasam''  or ''payesh'' (used in the [[Bengal]] region) are derived from the Sanskrit word ''Payasa'' or ''Payasam'', which also means \"milk\". It is prepared using milk, rice, [[ghee]], sugar/[[jaggery]], and ''[[Khoa|khoya]]'' but is less thick than  original kheer. Some also add a little bit of heavy cream for a richer taste. It is often garnished using almonds, cashews, raisins and pistachios. There is one more popular version of North Indian kheer, prepared during festivals and [[havan]] in [[Varanasi]] by using only milk, rice, ghee, sugar, cardamom, dried fruit, and ''kesar'' (saffron milk). It is an essential dish in many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] feasts and celebrations. While the dish is most often made with rice, it can also be made with other ingredients, such as [[vermicelli]] (''semiya'' in [[South India]], ''seviyan'', ''seviyaan'', ''sayviah'', or other spellings) or [[tapioca]] (locally known as sabudana). In [[Kashmir Valley|Kashmir]], firni is made with [[semolina]] (''suji)'', milk, saffron, sugar, dry fruits, etc.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://daawatesuchi.wordpress.com/2015/03/26/kong-phirin-a-kashmiri-dessert-popularly-known-as-phirni/|title=Kong Phirin \u2014\u2013 A kashmiri dessert popularly known as Phirni}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Gujarat]], a variation of kheer known as ''d\u016bdp\u0101k'', \u0aa6\u0ac2\u0aa7\u0aaa\u0abe\u0a95, is also made.

The Odia version has more fruits and is little less thicker. Payas are cooked to this day within the temple precincts there wheres as Kheer is available in restaurants mostly during [[Ramadan]]. Every single day, hundreds of temple cooks work around 752 hearths in what is supposed to be the world's largest kitchen to cook over 100 different dishes, including kheer, enough to feed at least 10,000 people.\n\nPayas is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with [[annaprashana]] (weaning ritual of an infant), as well as other festivals and birthday celebrations in an Odia household.\n\nAlthough white sugar is commonly used, adding [[Jaggery|''Gurh'']] (jaggery) as a sweetener, is an interesting and extremely delicious variation prepared in Bengal and Odisha, especially during winter and spring when fresh gurh is available.\n\nIn [[Bengal]], it is called ''payas'' or ''payesh''. A traditional Bengali meal can be traced 2000 years old {{citation needed|date=December 2018}} and it is one of important sweet dishes payas followed by other sweets.\n\nPayesh is also regarded as an auspicious food and generally associated with [[annaprashana]] (weaning ritual of an infant) and Janmatithi (birthday) in a Bengali household. Payesh is made with rice (preferably [[gobindobhog]] rice), milk, and \"guur\" (jaggery/molasses) or sugar, often with raisins, cashew nuts, and cardamom as well. The people of [[West Bengal]]  and [[Bangladesh]] prepare ''payesh'' variously with ''gurh'', [[Pandanus amaryllifolius|ketaki]], [[glutinous rice]] (usually [[gobindobhog]] rice), [[vermicelli]], [[semolina]] and [[coconut milk]], and the result is a stickier and creamier dessert. Bengali ''kheer'' (which is different to payesh and is not to be confused with the Hindi word \"kheer\") does not have rice, and is made by prolonged boiling of milk with either sugar or ''gurh'' till the milk fat solidifies as thick flakes (heating it even longer would make [[rabri]]).\n\nIn [[Assam]], it is called ''payoxh'' and in addition to other dried fruits, cherries are added to give it a light delicate pink colour.

It is not exactly Kheer, since most of the process is same it is generalised as Kheer. Payasam is less thicker and it contains semiya/vermicelli which is not a content of original Kheer.\n\nIn a South Indian meal, payasam or payasa, is served first at any formal or auspicious occasion.

T. Achaya]], ''payas'' was a popular dish in [[ancient India]], first mentioned in ancient Indian literature, it was a mixture of rice, milk and sugar, a formula that has endured for over two thousand years. Payas was also a staple [[Hindu]] temple food, in particular, it was associated with [[Lord Shiva]] and served as ''[[Pras\u0101da]]'' to his devotees.<ref>https://m.hindustantimes.com/india/a-truly-international-dessert/story-kfaP9BbuLcuyvCr5A03VGL.html</ref>\n\n==Regional variations==\nPayasam was always the main sweet dish at [[Hindu]] temples and part of their celebrations. It was mainly served in [[sadhya]] in marriage functions as well as in [[Nair]] community marriages.  Other terms like ''Payasam''  or ''payesh'' (used in the [[Bengal]] region) are derived from the Sanskrit word ''Payasa'' or ''Payasam'', which also means \"milk\". It is prepared using milk, rice, [[ghee]], sugar/[[jaggery]], and ''[[Khoa|khoya]]'' but is less thick than  original kheer. Some also add a little bit of heavy cream for a richer taste. It is often garnished using almonds, cashews, raisins and pistachios. There is one more popular version of North Indian kheer, prepared during festivals and [[havan]] in [[Varanasi]] by using only milk, rice, ghee, sugar, cardamom, dried fruit, and ''kesar'' (saffron milk). It is an essential dish in many [[Hinduism|Hindu]] feasts and celebrations. While the dish is most often made with rice, it can also be made with other ingredients, such as [[vermicelli]] (''semiya'' in [[South India]], ''seviyan'', ''seviyaan'', ''sayviah'', or other spellings) or [[tapioca]] (locally known as sabudana).

It is offered to Hindu deities as a ''[[bhog]]'' or ''[[prasadam]]''. Since it is watery and contains vermicelli, it is tight to call it Payasam/Paisam but not Kheer.\n\nAmong the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent, the dish is mainly consumed during [[Ramadan]] and prepared for the feasts of Muslim weddings and festivals, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]].\n\nA similar dessert, known as ''firni'', is eaten in \n[[Iran]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Afghanistan]] and among the Muslim communities of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Pakistan]]. Today, restaurants offer ''firni'' in a wide range of flavours, similar to kheer.
