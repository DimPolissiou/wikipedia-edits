The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself vary. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.</ref> He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\" />\n\nAlternatively, music can be assessed on the three dimensions of \"arousal\", \"valence\", and \"depth\".<ref name=\"ECON\">{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Musical-genres-are-out-of-date-%E2%80%93-but-this-new-system-explains-why-you-might-like-both-jazz-and-hip-hop-244941|title=Musical genres are out of date \u2013 but this new system explains why you might like both jazz and hip hop|date=3 August 2016|publisher=Econotimes|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref> Arousal reflects physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).<ref name=ECON/> These help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<ref name=ECON/>\n\n==Art music==\n{{Main|Art music}}\n{{See also|List of art music traditions}}\n\nArt music primarily includes classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

The artistic nature of music means that these classifications are often subjective and controversial, and some genres may overlap. Academic definitions of the term ''genre ''itself vary. In his book ''Form in Tonal Music'', Douglass M. Green distinguishes between genre and [[Musical form|form]]. He lists [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]], [[motet]], [[canzona]], [[ricercar]], and dance as examples of genres from the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] period. To further clarify the meaning of ''genre'', Green writes, \"Beethoven's Op. 61 and Mendelssohn's Op. 64 are identical in genre\u2014both are violin concertos\u2014but different in form. However, Mozart's Rondo for Piano, K. 511, and the ''Agnus Dei'' from his Mass, K. 317, are quite different in genre but happen to be similar in form.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Form in Tonal Music|last=Green|first=Douglass M.|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, Inc|isbn=978-0-03-020286-5|page=1}}</ref> Some, like [[Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|Peter van der Merwe]], treat the terms ''genre'' and ''style'' as the same, saying that ''genre'' should be defined as pieces of music that share a certain style or \"basic musical language.\"<ref name=Pete>{{cite book|title=Origins of the Popular Style: The Antecedents of Twentieth-Century Popular Music|last=van der Merwe|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter van der Merwe (musicologist)|year=1989|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-316121-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3 3]|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofpopular0000vand/page/3}}</ref> Others, such as Allan F.

Geographical origin is sometimes used to identify a music genre, though a single geographical category will often include a wide variety of subgenres. Timothy Laurie argues that, since the early 1980s, \"genre has graduated from being a subset of popular music studies to being an almost ubiquitous framework for constituting and evaluating musical research objects\".<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.5130/csr.v20i2.4149 | url= https://www.academia.edu/9087511| title= Music Genre as Method| year= 2014| last1= Laurie| first1= Timothy| journal= Cultural Studies Review| volume= 20| issue= 2}}</ref>\n\nMusicologists have sometimes classified music according to a trichotomous distinction such as Philip Tagg's \"axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics\".<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\">Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 41.</ref> He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\" />\n\nAlternatively, music can be assessed on the three dimensions of \"arousal\", \"valence\", and \"depth\".<ref name=\"ECON\">{{cite web|url=http://www.econotimes.com/Musical-genres-are-out-of-date-%E2%80%93-but-this-new-system-explains-why-you-might-like-both-jazz-and-hip-hop-244941|title=Musical genres are out of date \u2013 but this new system explains why you might like both jazz and hip hop|date=3 August 2016|publisher=Econotimes|accessdate=8 August 2016}}</ref> Arousal reflects physiological processes such as stimulation and relaxation (intense, forceful, abrasive, thrilling vs. gentle, calming, mellow), valence reflects emotion and mood processes (fun, happy, lively, enthusiastic, joyful vs. depressing, sad), and depth reflects cognitive processes (intelligent, sophisticated, inspiring, complex, poetic, deep, emotional, thoughtful vs. party music, danceable).<ref name=ECON/> These help explain why many people like similar songs from different traditionally segregated genres.<ref name=ECON/>\n\n==Art music==\n{{Main|Art music}}\n{{See also|List of art music traditions}}\n\nArt music primarily includes classical traditions, including both [[contemporary classical music|contemporary]] and historical classical music forms. Art music exists in many parts of the world. It emphasizes formal styles that invite technical and detailed deconstruction<ref>Siron, Jacques. \"Musique Savante (Serious Music)\". ''Dictionnaire des mots de la musique'' (Paris: Outre Mesure): 242.</ref> and criticism, and demand focused attention from the listener. In Western practice, art music is considered primarily a written musical tradition,<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\">Arnold, Denis: \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'' (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111.</ref> preserved in some form of [[musical notation|music notation]] rather than being transmitted orally, by rote, or in recordings, as [[popular music|popular]] and [[traditional music]] usually are.<ref name=\"Arnold, Denis\"/><ref>Tagg, Philip. \"Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice\". ''Popular Music'' 2 (1982): 37\u201367, here 41\u201342.</ref> Historically, most western art music has been written down using the standard forms of music notation that evolved in Europe, beginning well before the Renaissance and reaching its maturity in the [[Romantic music|Romantic]] period. The identity of a \"work\" or \"piece\" of art music is usually defined by the notated version rather than by a particular performance and is primarily associated with the composer rather than the performer (though composers may leave performers with some opportunity for interpretation or improvisation). This is so particularly in the case of western classical music. Art music may include certain forms of [[jazz]], though some feel that jazz is primarily a form of popular music. The 1960s saw a wave of avant-garde experimentation in free [[jazz]], represented by artists such as [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Sun Ra]], [[Albert Ayler]], [[Archie Shepp]] and Don Cherry.<ref>Anon. [http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/avant-garde-jazz-ma0000002438 Avant-Garde Jazz].

Musicologist and popular music specialist Philip Tagg defined the notion in the light of sociocultural and economical aspects:\n\n<blockquote>Popular music, unlike art music, is (1) conceived for mass distribution to large and often socioculturally heterogeneous groups of listeners, (2) stored and distributed in non-written form, (3) only possible in an industrial monetary economy where it becomes a commodity and (4) in capitalist societies, subject to the laws of 'free' enterprise&nbsp;... it should ideally sell as much as possible.<ref name=\"Analysing Popular Music 1982, p. 41\"/></blockquote>\n\nPopular music is found on most commercial and [[public service]] radio stations, in most commercial music retailers and department stores, and movie and television soundtracks. It is noted on the [[Billboard charts|'' Billboard'' charts]] and, in addition to singer-songwriters and composers, it involves music producers more than other genres do.\n\nThe distinction between classical and popular music has sometimes been blurred in marginal areas<ref>Arnold, Denis (1983): \"Art Music, Art Song\", in ''The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J'', Oxford University Press, p. 111, {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}.</ref> such as [[minimalist music]] and light classics.

The college was founded in 1882 by the Selwyn Memorial Committee in memory of [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|George Augustus Selwyn]] (1809\u20131878), the first [[Bishop of New Zealand]] (1841\u20131868), and subsequently [[Bishop of Lichfield]] (1868\u20131878). It consists of three main courts built of stone and brick (Old Court, Ann's Court, and Cripps Court) along with several secondary buildings, including adjacent townhouses and lodges serving as student hostels on [[Grange Road, Cambridge|Grange Road]], [[West Road, Cambridge|West Road]] and [[Sidgwick Avenue]]. The college has some 60 Fellows and 110 non-academic staff.\n\nIn 2019, Selwyn was ranked eighth on the [[Tompkins Table]] of Cambridge colleges in order of undergraduates' performances in examinations,<ref>https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/17736</ref> but was first in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Garner |title='Poorer' college tops Cambridge degree table |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/poorer-college-tops-cambridge-degree-table-878699.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2008}}</ref> The college was ranked 16th out of 30 in an assessment of college wealth conducted by the student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' in November 2006.<ref name=finance>[http://www.varsity.co.uk/archive/647.pdf Varsity issue 647, page 6].

Selwyn was a scholar of [[St John's College, Cambridge]] and a member of the Cambridge crew which competed in the inaugural [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1829. He came out second in the Classical Tripos in 1831, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) 1831, Master of Arts (MA Cantab) 1834, and Doctor of Divinity (DD) per lit. reg. 1842, and was a fellow of St John's College from 1833 to 1840.<ref name=\"Short History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Selwyn-1882-1973.pdf|title=SELWYN COLLEGE 1882 \u2013 1973: A Short History|website=Sel.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating, Selwyn first taught at [[Eton College]]. In 1833, he was ordained deacon, and, in 1834, a priest. Selwyn displayed leadership talent and, in 1841, after an episcopal council held at Lambeth had recommended the appointment of a bishop for New Zealand, Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, offered the post to Selwyn.\n\nHe returned to England in 1867, and accepted the post of [[Bishop of Lichfield]], which he held until his death on 11 April 1878, aged 69.\n\n=== Foundation of the College ===\n\nAfter Selwyn's death in 1878, a number of scholars from Cambridge launched plans to establish a college to honour his life.<ref name=\"Short History\" /> The Selwyn Memorial Committee was founded with [[Charles Abraham (bishop of Wellington)|Charles Abraham]] as secretary, and it proposed that a Cambridge college should be established as a memorial. The college's first Master, [[Arthur Lyttelton]], was formally elected on 10 March 1879, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Archibald Tait]] was invited to become [[Visitor]] on 28 June 1878 and building of Old Court, as it is now known, began in 1880. \n[[File:Arthur lyttelton.jpg|thumb|upright|First Master of Selwyn College, [[Arthur Lyttelton]]]]\n\nThe foundation stone of the College was laid by [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis]] in a ceremony on 1 June 1881, following a lunch in [[King's College, Cambridge]]. A Charter of Incorporation was granted by [[Queen Victoria]] on 13 September 1882, and the west range of Old Court was ready for use by the college's official opening (with the Master's installation) on 10 October 1882, in time for [[Michaelmas term]]. Selwyn's first 28 undergraduates, joined the original Master and twelve other Fellows at the then Public Hostel of the university in 1882.\n\nThe first Master of the College was [[Arthur Lyttelton]], who sought to establish the college on a firm academic and financial foundation. Lyttelton had the benefit of experience as a senior tutor at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. He came from a well-established family with strong connections in both the Church and State, his mother being the sister-in-law of the Prime Minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who was to become a major benefactor of the College. Lyttelton was himself a life-long supporter of the Liberal party and was familiar with many politicians in Westminster, his wife [[Kathleen Lyttelton|Kathleen]], a women's activist, being the daughter of the Liberal MP [[George Clive (Liberal politician)|George Clive]]. Lyttelton persuaded Gladstone to make a personal gift to the College of the louder of the two Chapel bells. Gladstone reportedly believed that Cambridge students needed to be well woken if they were to get up at a productive time in the morning. Today, the Chapel Bell is affectionately known as 'Gladstone's Bell' by students.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n[[File:Selwyn College Cambridge (Hall Clock).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Selwyn College Clock Tower]]\nThe college was founded by donations and subscriptions, with a distinctly religious character. The royal charter for the college, reproducing the terms of the charter of Keble College, was sealed on 13 September 1882. The charter declared that the college was \"founded and constituted with the especial object and intent of providing persons desirous of academic education and willing to live economically with a College wherein sober living and high culture of the mind may be combined with Christian training based upon the principles of the [[Church of England]]\". Initially, only baptised Christians were accepted as students or scholars. The original foundation charter specified that the college should \"make provision for those who intend to serve as missionaries overseas and ... educate the sons of clergymen\".\n\nSelwyn was not yet a full college of the university, but a \"Public Hostel\", with its undergraduates regarded as non-collegiate and marked with the designation \"H. Selw.\" on Senate House lists.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n=== Later development ===\n\nIn 1926 the \"Public Hostel\" status was abolished, replaced with that of \"Approved Foundation\", granting more security to the college.  The distinction of the college as \"H. Selw.\" on Senate House lists had also ceased from June 1924.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nOn 14 March 1958, Selwyn was granted full collegiate status.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nSelwyn, in common with most other Oxford and Cambridge colleges, originally admitted only men, but was one of the first colleges to become mixed when women were admitted from 1976. In that year, women lived only on E and H Staircases, but in subsequent years could live anywhere in College. In 1999, Selwyn appointed the first female Director of Music in an Oxbridge College, [[Sarah MacDonald (musician)|Sarah MacDonald]], and in 2009, Selwyn became the first Cambridge college to appoint a female head porter, Helen Stephens.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cambridge College first as Helen is appointed|publisher=This is South Wales|date=9 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\nThe college founders purchased from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] {{convert|6|acre|hectare}} of land which lay between [[Grange Road, Cambridge|Grange Road]], [[West Road, Cambridge|West Road]] and [[Sidgwick Avenue]] on 3 November 1879 at a cost of \u00a36,111 9s 7d. This parcel of land is still owned by the college and is home to Selwyn's Old Court and Ann's Court. The site was originally considered somewhat remote from the centre of the university, however, Selwyn now neighbours the [[Sidgwick Site]], affording easy access to the arts faculty buildings there.  An alternative site on [[Lensfield Road]], where [[Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church]] now stands, was considered but rejected as being too small.\n\nThe chapel was built in 1895 before the dining hall (in 1909), as it was deemed to be more important, and chapel attendance was compulsory for students from the College's foundation until 1935. There were originally plans to build a permanent Library between F Staircase and the Chapel to complete Old Court, on land that now forms part of the College Gardens, but this never materialised. The [[Selwyn College Library|War Memorial Library]] was opened in 1929, funded by subscriptions in honour of College members who had died in the [[First World War]]. In 1894 and 1896, respectively, the Old Library in the tower, received two extensive benefactions of history, politics and theological texts, from Canon William Cooke and Edward Wheatley-Balme. These large literary bequests gave Selwyn College an excellent working library.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nThe Jacobean-style Dining Hall was constructed under the tenure of the fourth Master of Selwyn College, [[Richard Appleton (academic)|Richard Appleton]], who had previously been a senior fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. His appointment as Master continued the close relationship between Selwyn and Trinity which had been supportive of the younger college. Appleton only served for two years (1907\u20131909) before he died of influenza.<ref name=\"Short History\"/> Despite his brief mastership, Appleton had managed to secure funding for the Dining Hall. Appleton's initials and [[rebus]] (three apples and a tun) appear on the north wall of the Hall entrance, and his posthumously painted portrait hangs in the college. Construction on the dining hall began in 1909, but Appleton did not live to see the project come to completion.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nThe dining hall was always intended to be panelled, however, this vision could not be realised until the woodwork for the west side of the hall was presented in 1913 by the Magdalene fellow, [[A. C. Benson]] in memory of his father [[Edward White Benson|Archbishop Benson]]. This panelling came from the [[St Mary's Church, Rotterdam|English Church in Rotterdam]] which was designed by the office of Sir Christopher Wren between 1699 and 1708.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{better source|date=April 2019}}\n\nUniversity education was expensive at the time of Selwyn's foundation, and given that Selwyn College was intended to be a place for young students who could not otherwise afford an Oxbridge education, the college charges were initially kept low. Undergraduates initially paid \u00a327 per term for food, lodgings, lectures and tuition, with a small surcharge for medics, scientists and engineers. This was only raised to \u00a328 in 1916, and \u00a333 in 1918, as the number of scholars studying at Oxford and Cambridge drastically decreased due to the First World War.\n[[File:Selwyn College Gatehouse Tower, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Selwyn College Tower]]\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n\nOld Court, whose construction began in 1880 and is built in [[Ketton stone]] and local red brick in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Late Perpendicular Gothic Revival]] style, was largely designed by Sir [[Arthur Blomfield]] and comprises seven staircases (A to G), together with a tower and gateway, Master's Lodge, Chapel, Hall, Kitchens, Music Practice Room and Archives. [[Selwyn College Library]] is located adjacent to Old Court; it was designed by T. H. Lyons in 1929 to serve as a First World War memorial.\n\nCripps Court, named after the [[Humphrey Cripps|Cripps Foundation]] that donated most of the funds to build it (and which also funded developments at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]]) was built and formally opened on 17 May 1969 on land on the opposite side of Grange Road which was originally owned by [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. Selwyn's Cripps Court features a tricolon design with ensuite rooms for students. Cripps Court comprises a further seven staircases (H to N) and is home to all of Selwyn's first-year undergraduates, a few second-year undergraduates and postgraduates including their common room, the Middle Combination Room (MCR).\n\n[[File:Selwyn College Chapel 2, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The chapel facing west towards the entrance and organ]]\n[[File:Selwyn2.jpg|thumb|right|Selwyn College, Ann's Court]]\nAnn's Court, built on the land to the north of Old Court and south of West Road, is the most recent court. Its exterior reflects the atmosphere of the rest of the college with Ketton limestone and brick-work fixtures. Ann's Court was designed by the traditionalist architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]] who has completed similar new projects at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], which also utilised hand-carved Ketton stone in its exteriors, and at [[Princeton University]] ([[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]]) in the United States. The golden-yellow Ketton stone used in Anne's Court (and the rest of Selwyn College) has been used in the construction of Oxford and Cambridge colleges for several hundred years, and can be see in the exterior of the [[Wren Library]]. The interior of Ann's Court is contemporary and equipped with wooden staircases. As a proponent of [[New Classical Architecture]], Porphyrios designed new buildings which fit the existing limestone and brick materials of Selwyn College. The Porphyrios Associates design involved a three-winged building which created the space for a large new court to be formed in the middle of the college, named Centre Court. Ann's Court features hand-carved details and a series of limestone cloisters and chimneys arranged in the traditional Cambridge University fashion. Ann's Court was named after Ann Dobson, who with her husband Christopher Dobson (who matriculated at Selwyn in 1957) formed the Ann Dobson Foundation, which is one of the principal donors towards the construction costs of Phases I and II. Phase I was completed in July 2005 and consists of 43 ensuite rooms and 15 administrative offices, forming two staircases (O and P) at a cost of \u00a37.5 million. The second phase, including 40 en-suite bedrooms forming staircases Q and R and a new [[Common Room (university)|Junior Combination Room]] (JCR) at a cost of \u00a32.5 million, was completed in Summer 2009.<ref>{{cite book |title=Selwyn College Cambridge \u2013 Ann's Court: The story so far |first=Heather |last=Kilpatrick |publisher=Selwyn College Cambridge |date=June 2009}}</ref> The College bar was refurbished in 2002, and redecorated in 2011.\n\nThe College has [[planning permission]] to develop further three phases of building, planned to be built as funding permits, which will extend the college's distinctive limestone and red-brick fa\u00e7ade along Grange Road to the corner of West Road. The plans consist of a new library and archives (Phase 3) behind Staircase E of Old Court, and two further accommodation blocks (Phase 4) to form a new court (tentatively named Library Court) between Old Court and Ann's Court, and an auditorium, debate chamber, and conference facilities (Phase 5) to complete the west side of Ann's Court.\n[[File:Map of Cambridge, England (1886).png|thumb|right|Map of Selwyn College (1886)]]\nPlans are currently underway to build a new library and auditorium located near Ann's Court and the College Gardens. The college plan calls for all future expansions to adhere to the same architectural style of limestone and brick demonstrated in the Ann's Court development. The Master Plan, also designed by Porphyrios Architects, calls for a new wing of student housing alongside Grange Road, located between Old Court and Anne's Court. This new wing of accommodation would enclose the western edge of Centre Court and would allow the College to increase graduate student numbers. In 2018, the college assured concerned alumni and students that the original library would be preserved and converted into lecture and auditorium rooms (although the small 1970s annex will likely be removed).<ref name=\"Annual Report 2017-18\">{{cite web |title=Selwyn College Annual Report 2017-18 |url=https://www.selwynalumni.com/publications |website=www.selwynalumni.com |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref> The building of a new library is a priority for Selwyn College and would complete the perimeter of a fourth collegiate court.\n\n==Coat of arms and motto==\n[[File:Selwyn College Heraldic Coat of Arms, Main Gate.jpg|thumb|upright|The arms used by George Augustus Selwyn as Bishop of Lichfield, above the college's Main Gate to Old Court]]\n[[File:Selwyn College Cambridge Main Gate.jpg|thumb|upright| Main Gate with the Greek quotation which contains the College motto]]\nThe Selwyn College [[coat of arms]] incorporates the arms of the Selwyn family impaled with an adaptation of the arms of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]]. The arms were granted in the 1960s and are emblazoned as follows;\n\n:''Per pale Gules and Argent a Cross potent quadrate Argent and Or between four crosses paty those to the dexter Argent those to the sinister Or For the See of Lichfield impaling Argent on a Bend cotised Sable three Annulets Or for Selwyn all within a Bordure Sable And for Crest On a Wreath Or & Purpure In front of a Book erect bound Gules edged clasped and garnished Or a representation of the Pastoral Staff of Bishop Selwyn.''\n\nThe dexter half of the arms adapted from those of the See of Lichfield, are unusual, with ''or'' (gold) countercharged on ''argent'' (silver), violating the [[rule of tincture]], which prohibits a metal to be charged with another metal. This is thought to refer to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#Arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which also violates this rule. Selwyn's pastoral staff or [[crozier]] is based on a hardwood [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] staff which is held in the College Chapel. The College was also granted an official badge, ''A Mitre Or within an Annulet Purpure''.\n\nBefore an official grant by the [[College of Arms]], Selwyn College used [[heraldry|arms]] believed to be those borne by George Augustus Selwyn as Bishop of Lichfield;<ref>{{cite web|title=Selwyn College Arms|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/college-arms/|website=Selwyn College|accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref> they are displayed above the main gateway, built in 1881, and on the Common Seal, first used in 1882.\n\nThe College [[motto]] is a [[Bible|biblical]] quotation from [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], [[1 Corinthians 16|chapter 16]], verse 13, in [[Koine Greek|Greek]], ''\u0391\u039d\u0394\u03a1\u0399\u0396\u0395\u03a3\u0398\u0395'',<ref>[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/cgi-bin/gnt?id=0716 1 Corinthians 16].

Formal hall meals are three- or four-course meals which are fully catered and served \u00e0 la carte by college staff. During formal hall, the Fellows and the Master of the college are entitled to sit at the [[High Table]] near the front of the hall, while students sit on benches or chairs at the long table.\n\n====Latin grace====\nThe College [[Grace (prayer)|Grace]] is recited in Latin by a Fellow or Scholar (a student who achieved a First Class mark overall in the previous year) at the beginning of Formal Hall, and is as follows:\n<blockquote>''Benedic, Domine, nobis et donis Tuis, quae de Tua largitate sumus sumpturi; et concede ut iis muneribus Tuis ad laudem Tuam utamur, gratisque animis fruamur, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.''</blockquote>\n\nTranslation:\n<blockquote>Bless us, O Lord, and all thy gifts, which of thy goodness we are about to enjoy; grant that we may use these generosities to thy glory, and enjoy them with thankful hearts, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</blockquote>\n\nWhen the High Table rises, the following concluding Grace is said ''Benedicamus Domino'' (Let us bless the Lord), with the response being ''Laus Deo'' (Praise be to God). This response was changed in the 1990s, from the previous response ''Deo gratias'' (Thanks be to God).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Loyal toast====\nSelwyn has a tradition in which senior fellows and members of the college commonly remain seated for the College's [[loyal toast]] during formal hall. This tradition is not done out of any disrespect or irreverence for the sovereign, but rather, out of courtesy and remembrance to the former Master of the College, [[John Selwyn (bishop)|John Selwyn]], who could not easily stand for the loyal toast owing to the limited use of his legs in later life. John Selwyn (son of George Augustus Selwyn) served as the second Master of Selwyn College (1893\u20131898).<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n===Lecture series===\nSelwyn College hosts an annual lecture named in honour of the late Lt Col Ramsay Murray, an alumnus of the College during the 1930s. The Ramsay Murray Lecture Series was established in 1994 following a significant bequest from the Murray estate.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\">https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/ramsay-murray-lecture-2009</ref> Lecturers have included many high-profile politicians, academics, and journalists including Baroness [[Onora O\u2019Neill]] of Bengarve, [[Niall Ferguson]], Sir [[Michael Howard]], Professor Sir [[Ian Kershaw]], Professor [[Roy Porter]], Professor [[Ian Clark (political scientist)|Ian Clark]], Professor Lawrence Freedman, Professor David Cannadine, Sir [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], Professor Jonathan Riley-Smith and Professor [[Quentin Skinner]], former Regius Professor of Modern History.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\"/> The 2018 Ramsay Murray lecture features the journalist [[Frank Gardner (journalist)|Frank Gardner]] OBE.<ref>https://www.selwynalumni.com/main-website-pages/ramsay-murray-lecture</ref> The lectures are free and open to the public.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Selwyn College, Cambridge Porters Lodge.jpg|thumb|Porter's Lodge]]\nSelwyn has a reputation as one of the most traditional but friendliest Oxbridge colleges.<ref name=\"Short History\" /> The college is visited by many members of the university who come from the neighbouring Sidgwick Site in-between lectures and supervisions to take advantage of Selwyn's Servery and Dining Hall. Similarly, Formal Swaps are regularly arranged by the student councils to allow students from other Oxford and Cambridge colleges to dine at Selwyn during Formal Hall. Students of Selwyn College are required to wear their gowns to all formal halls, ceremonies and college functions. The Selwyn gown is made of a thick black cloth with dark navy blue inline lapels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ryderamies.co.uk/shop/selwyn-college-undergraduate-gown/|title=Selwyn College Undergraduate Gown \u2013 Ryder & Amies|website=Ryderamies.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\n===Common rooms===\nSelwyn College [[Common Room (university)|Junior Combination Room Society]] (JCRS) is the students' union for undergraduates students. Elected in Michaelmas term, it organises social and welfare events, negotiates with the College on the students' behalf, and represents Selwyn on [[Cambridge University Students' Union]] (CUSU) Council. JCRS is affiliated to CUSU and by extension to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. In recent years, four presidents of Selwyn College JCRS have become CUSU president, one of whom, [[Wes Streeting]] MP, went on to become president of the National Union of Students and a Labour [[Member of Parliament]]. Another JCRS President, [[Simon Hughes]] went on to become a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP and candidate for [[Mayor of London]].\n\nThe Middle Combination Room (MCR) comprises the graduate students of Selwyn College, and is similarly represented by the MCR Committee (MCRc). The MCR is located in Cripps Court. The presidents and treasurers of the JCRc and MCRc have sat on College Council, the main decision-making body of the College, since it was reformed in 1989.\n[[File:DSC 9798-selwyn-m1-div2-sat.JPG|thumb|Selwyn College Boat Club (SCBC)]]\n\n===Student societies===\nThe College is host to a number of student organisations, including the Hermes Club, Selwyn College Music Society and Selwyn Jazz, and on the stage by amateur dramatics society The Mighty Players.<ref>https://mightyplayers.soc.srcf.net/</ref> [[Selwyn College Boat Club]] is the official rowing club.

Some of these societies function as ''de facto'' discussion and debate clubs while others are better known as drinking societies and for raucous parties. In recent years, several of the secret societies at Selwyn have been accused of elitism, and have been involved in sexism and hazing scandals. In 2014, members of the Selwyn Templars were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent out to members of the society.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/03/cambridge-university-drinking-society-selwyn-templars_n_6262248.html|title=Another Cambridge Drinking Society Is Under Fire|first1=Keumars Afifi-Sabet Freelance|last1=journalist|last2=satirist|date=4 December 2014|website=HuffPost UK|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"varsity.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/7950|title=Misogynist messages leak from Selwyn|website=Varsity.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:SelwynCollegeSociety0187.png|thumb|Programme for a 1914 [[smoking concert]] of the Controversialists]]\n\n====The Controversialists====\nThe Controversialists are the oldest secret society at the college and one of the oldest at the university, being founded by a group of all-male students during the Lent Term in 1893. The society's name is believed to pay homage to both their leftist political leanings and their discussion and debate of poetry and literature. The purpose of the Society, according to rules printed in 1909, was \"the reading and discussion of English poetry and drama\". The Society membership is made up of both undergraduate and graduate students at Selwyn College. Female students have been able to join the society since women were admitted to the College. The total number of Controversialist members is not allowed to exceed twelve. Meetings have traditionally been held on Sundays in the Michaelmas and Lent terms, as well as in May if a quorum of five members can be arranged. The badge and symbol of the Controversialists is a purple lyre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZAE-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=Selwyn+Controversialists+Cambridge#v=onepage&q=Selwyn+Controversialists+Cambridge&f=false|title=The Cambridge Review|date=26 August 1896|accessdate=26 August 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe Controversialists commonly organise [[smoking concert]]s where poetry and verse is recited by members before the political discussions begin. The Controversialists are said to drink only Port during their meetings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n====The Templars====\nThe Selwyn College Templars are the second oldest secret society and the largest at the college. The society was initially only open to wealthy, upper-class Anglican students. The membership of the Templars Society are often involved with campus politics and are often members of the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]]. Membership is decided by nomination from two current members and election at the society's Michaelmas meeting. New members of the Templars are reportedly 'knighted' with a ceremonial sword in a bizarre initiation ceremony that takes place on the Autumn equinox each year.<ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\nIn 2014, British newspapers reported that the Selwyn Templars Society were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent to members of the society. The college took disciplinary action against all students involved in the incident.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"varsity.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Hermes Club===\nThe Hermes Club, founded in 1920, exists to encourage, fund and improve sport at Selwyn College \u2013 a task it accomplishes by offering financial grants to individual sportsmen/women and college teams, through the lobbying of College, and by generally raising the profile of sport in Selwyn. Members of Selwyn are eligible for invitation to the club if they have been awarded a Full [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] or Half Blue by the University, if they have captained a Selwyn College team in a 'First Class sport', or if they have competed on behalf of Selwyn in two 'First Class' [[Cuppers]] competitions.<ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\nAlumni of the club fund two major sports grant schemes which award thousands of pounds in grants every year \u2013 the Hermes Fund and the Vickerstaff Sports Bursary Scheme. Many members{{who|date=August 2017}} of the Hermes Club have gone on to become prominent in public life, particularly as politicians, actors and authors.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/GivingtoSelwyn/sportsbursaryscheme.html|title=Sports Bursary Scheme|website=Selcam.ac.uk|accessdate=2017-08-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927015038/http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/GivingtoSelwyn/sportsbursaryscheme.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Winter and May balls===\n[[File:Selwyn College May Ball 1948 Survivors Shot.jpg|thumb|left|Selwyn College May Ball Survivors (1948)]]\nSelwyn is unique among Oxbridge colleges in that it holds an annual Winter [[May Ball|Ball]] known as the Selwyn Snowball, which traditionally takes place on the night of the last Friday of Michaelmas term. In recent years the Snowball has developed into a larger event than it had been in the mid-nineties and now runs three full stages, with recent headliners including [[Mumford & Sons]] and [[Tinchy Stryder]], and caters for around 850 guests. The Selwyn Snowball has often become bigger and more subscribed than its May Ball which is usually held in June of each year once students have finished their examinations.\n\nThe [[May Ball]] tradition at Selwyn began on 14 June 1948, as hundreds of students dressed in [[black tie]] to attend the all-night celebration. May Balls continued to be held at the college throughout the second half of the 20th century with a highlight being the performance of [[The Who]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge-University-ball-season-kicks-tomorrow-scenes-Week/story-22514993-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200208/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge-University-ball-season-kicks-tomorrow-scenes-Week/story-22514993-detail/story.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In recent years, May Balls have been replaced by the Snowball with notable exceptions: 2008, to celebrate the college's 125th anniversary; 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selwynball.com/|title=Selwyn May Ball|website=Selwynball.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Selwyn College Boat Club===\n\nThe [[Selwyn College Boat Club]] (SCBC) is the rowing club for members of the college. The boat club was founded in 1882, during the Michaelmas term. During this early period, the Selwyn Boat Club trained several rowers who would go on to become Olympic Rowers and University Blues in the annual boat race against Oxford. The SCBC also achieved intercollegiate success during its early days, winning a second in the [[Lent Bumps]] of 1934 and third in the [[May Bumps]] 1931. The dedication and work of the early Selwyn rowers was all the more fitting given that George Augustus Selwyn had rowed for Cambridge  in the first Boat Race at [[Henley-on-Thames]] in 1829. The SCBC still has one of the highest participation rates of novice rowers of any Oxbridge college.  Notable alumni of the Selwyn College Boat Club include [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Tom Hollander]] and [[Richard Budgett]].\n\nIn 2014, Selwyn, King's and Churchill colleges announced plans for a new, state-of-the-art combined boathouse located on the River Cam. The boathouse features double-length beams and extensive gym and training facilities for all Selwyn College rowers and student athletes. This facility was completed in 2015\u201316 and now provides world-class rowing and training facilities for SCBC rowers and students across the University of Cambridge. The project was largely funded by donations and contributions from alumni and the Hermes Club. The two-storey combined boathouse is larger than its 1968 predecessor and provides facilities for socialising, training and boat maintenance in addition to an observation deck. The combined boathouse was designed by RHP Architects at a cost of approximately \u00a32.20 million and was the winner of the 2017 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] East Award for Outstanding Architecture.<ref name=\"Short History\"/><ref>http://www.rhpartnership.co.uk/projects/combined-colleges-boathouse</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n*In [[Tom Sharpe]]'s ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]'' novel, Selwyn College is satirically described as a college founded by 'social justice' devotees.

The college was founded in 1882 by the Selwyn Memorial Committee in memory of [[George Selwyn (bishop of Lichfield)|George Augustus Selwyn]] (1809\u20131878), the first [[Bishop of New Zealand]] (1841\u20131868), and subsequently [[Bishop of Lichfield]] (1868\u20131878). It consists of three main courts built of stone and brick (Old Court, Ann's Court, and Cripps Court) along with several secondary buildings, including adjacent townhouses and lodges serving as student hostels on [[Grange Road, Cambridge|Grange Road]], [[West Road, Cambridge|West Road]] and [[Sidgwick Avenue]]. The college has some 60 Fellows and 110 non-academic staff.\n\nIn 2019, Selwyn was ranked eighth on the [[Tompkins Table]] of Cambridge colleges in order of undergraduates' performances in examinations,<ref>https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/17736</ref> but was first in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |first=Richard |last=Garner |title='Poorer' college tops Cambridge degree table |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/poorer-college-tops-cambridge-degree-table-878699.html |work=[[The Independent]] |date=28 July 2008 |accessdate=31 July 2008}}</ref> The college was ranked 16th out of 30 in an assessment of college wealth conducted by the student newspaper ''[[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]]'' in November 2006.<ref name=finance>[http://www.varsity.co.uk/archive/647.pdf Varsity issue 647, page 6].

Selwyn was a scholar of [[St John's College, Cambridge]] and a member of the Cambridge crew which competed in the inaugural [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1829. He came out second in the Classical Tripos in 1831, graduating Bachelor of Arts (BA) 1831, Master of Arts (MA Cantab) 1834, and Doctor of Divinity (DD) per lit. reg. 1842, and was a fellow of St John's College from 1833 to 1840.<ref name=\"Short History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/Selwyn-1882-1973.pdf|title=SELWYN COLLEGE 1882 \u2013 1973: A Short History|website=Sel.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating, Selwyn first taught at [[Eton College]]. In 1833, he was ordained deacon, and, in 1834, a priest. Selwyn displayed leadership talent and, in 1841, after an episcopal council held at Lambeth had recommended the appointment of a bishop for New Zealand, Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, offered the post to Selwyn.\n\nHe returned to England in 1867, and accepted the post of [[Bishop of Lichfield]], which he held until his death on 11 April 1878, aged 69.\n\n=== Foundation of the College ===\n\nAfter Selwyn's death in 1878, a number of scholars from Cambridge launched plans to establish a college to honour his life.<ref name=\"Short History\" /> The Selwyn Memorial Committee was founded with [[Charles Abraham (bishop of Wellington)|Charles Abraham]] as secretary, and it proposed that a Cambridge college should be established as a memorial. The college's first Master, [[Arthur Lyttelton]], was formally elected on 10 March 1879, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Archibald Tait]] was invited to become [[Visitor]] on 28 June 1878 and building of Old Court, as it is now known, began in 1880. \n[[File:Arthur lyttelton.jpg|thumb|upright|First Master of Selwyn College, [[Arthur Lyttelton]]]]\n\nThe foundation stone of the College was laid by [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Earl of Powis]] in a ceremony on 1 June 1881, following a lunch in [[King's College, Cambridge]]. A Charter of Incorporation was granted by [[Queen Victoria]] on 13 September 1882, and the west range of Old Court was ready for use by the college's official opening (with the Master's installation) on 10 October 1882, in time for [[Michaelmas term]]. Selwyn's first 28 undergraduates, joined the original Master and twelve other Fellows at the then Public Hostel of the university in 1882.\n\nThe first Master of the College was [[Arthur Lyttelton]], who sought to establish the college on a firm academic and financial foundation. Lyttelton had the benefit of experience as a senior tutor at [[Keble College, Oxford]]. He came from a well-established family with strong connections in both the Church and State, his mother being the sister-in-law of the Prime Minister, [[William Ewart Gladstone|William Gladstone]], who was to become a major benefactor of the College. Lyttelton was himself a life-long supporter of the Liberal party and was familiar with many politicians in Westminster, his wife [[Kathleen Lyttelton|Kathleen]], a women's activist, being the daughter of the Liberal MP [[George Clive (Liberal politician)|George Clive]]. Lyttelton persuaded Gladstone to make a personal gift to the College of the louder of the two Chapel bells. Gladstone reportedly believed that Cambridge students needed to be well woken if they were to get up at a productive time in the morning. Today, the Chapel Bell is affectionately known as 'Gladstone's Bell' by students.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n[[File:Selwyn College Cambridge (Hall Clock).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Selwyn College Clock Tower]]\nThe college was founded by donations and subscriptions, with a distinctly religious character. The royal charter for the college, reproducing the terms of the charter of Keble College, was sealed on 13 September 1882. The charter declared that the college was \"founded and constituted with the especial object and intent of providing persons desirous of academic education and willing to live economically with a College wherein sober living and high culture of the mind may be combined with Christian training based upon the principles of the [[Church of England]]\". Initially, only baptised Christians were accepted as students or scholars. The original foundation charter specified that the college should \"make provision for those who intend to serve as missionaries overseas and ... educate the sons of clergymen\".\n\nSelwyn was not yet a full college of the university, but a \"Public Hostel\", with its undergraduates regarded as non-collegiate and marked with the designation \"H. Selw.\" on Senate House lists.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n=== Later development ===\n\nIn 1926 the \"Public Hostel\" status was abolished, replaced with that of \"Approved Foundation\", granting more security to the college.  The distinction of the college as \"H. Selw.\" on Senate House lists had also ceased from June 1924.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nOn 14 March 1958, Selwyn was granted full collegiate status.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nSelwyn, in common with most other Oxford and Cambridge colleges, originally admitted only men, but was one of the first colleges to become mixed when women were admitted from 1976. In that year, women lived only on E and H Staircases, but in subsequent years could live anywhere in College. In 1999, Selwyn appointed the first female Director of Music in an Oxbridge College, [[Sarah MacDonald (musician)|Sarah MacDonald]], and in 2009, Selwyn became the first Cambridge college to appoint a female head porter, Helen Stephens.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cambridge College first as Helen is appointed|publisher=This is South Wales|date=9 September 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\n\nThe college founders purchased from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] {{convert|6|acre|hectare}} of land which lay between [[Grange Road, Cambridge|Grange Road]], [[West Road, Cambridge|West Road]] and [[Sidgwick Avenue]] on 3 November 1879 at a cost of \u00a36,111 9s 7d. This parcel of land is still owned by the college and is home to Selwyn's Old Court and Ann's Court. The site was originally considered somewhat remote from the centre of the university, however, Selwyn now neighbours the [[Sidgwick Site]], affording easy access to the arts faculty buildings there.  An alternative site on [[Lensfield Road]], where [[Our Lady and the English Martyrs Church]] now stands, was considered but rejected as being too small.\n\nThe chapel was built in 1895 before the dining hall (in 1909), as it was deemed to be more important, and chapel attendance was compulsory for students from the College's foundation until 1935. There were originally plans to build a permanent Library between F Staircase and the Chapel to complete Old Court, on land that now forms part of the College Gardens, but this never materialised. The [[Selwyn College Library|War Memorial Library]] was opened in 1929, funded by subscriptions in honour of College members who had died in the [[First World War]]. In 1894 and 1896, respectively, the Old Library in the tower, received two extensive benefactions of history, politics and theological texts, from Canon William Cooke and Edward Wheatley-Balme. These large literary bequests gave Selwyn College an excellent working library.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nThe Jacobean-style Dining Hall was constructed under the tenure of the fourth Master of Selwyn College, [[Richard Appleton (academic)|Richard Appleton]], who had previously been a senior fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. His appointment as Master continued the close relationship between Selwyn and Trinity which had been supportive of the younger college. Appleton only served for two years (1907\u20131909) before he died of influenza.<ref name=\"Short History\"/> Despite his brief mastership, Appleton had managed to secure funding for the Dining Hall. Appleton's initials and [[rebus]] (three apples and a tun) appear on the north wall of the Hall entrance, and his posthumously painted portrait hangs in the college. Construction on the dining hall began in 1909, but Appleton did not live to see the project come to completion.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\nThe dining hall was always intended to be panelled, however, this vision could not be realised until the woodwork for the west side of the hall was presented in 1913 by the Magdalene fellow, [[A. C. Benson]] in memory of his father [[Edward White Benson|Archbishop Benson]]. This panelling came from the [[St Mary's Church, Rotterdam|English Church in Rotterdam]] which was designed by the office of Sir Christopher Wren between 1699 and 1708.<ref name=\"Short History\"/>{{better source|date=April 2019}}\n\nUniversity education was expensive at the time of Selwyn's foundation, and given that Selwyn College was intended to be a place for young students who could not otherwise afford an Oxbridge education, the college charges were initially kept low. Undergraduates initially paid \u00a327 per term for food, lodgings, lectures and tuition, with a small surcharge for medics, scientists and engineers. This was only raised to \u00a328 in 1916, and \u00a333 in 1918, as the number of scholars studying at Oxford and Cambridge drastically decreased due to the First World War.\n[[File:Selwyn College Gatehouse Tower, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Selwyn College Tower]]\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n\nOld Court, whose construction began in 1880 and is built in [[Ketton stone]] and local red brick in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Victorian Late Perpendicular Gothic Revival]] style, was largely designed by Sir [[Arthur Blomfield]] and comprises seven staircases (A to G), together with a tower and gateway, Master's Lodge, Chapel, Hall, Kitchens, Music Practice Room and Archives. [[Selwyn College Library]] is located adjacent to Old Court; it was designed by T. H. Lyons in 1929 to serve as a First World War memorial.\n\nCripps Court, named after the [[Humphrey Cripps|Cripps Foundation]] that donated most of the funds to build it (and which also funded developments at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]] and [[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]]) was built and formally opened on 17 May 1969 on land on the opposite side of Grange Road which was originally owned by [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus College]]. Selwyn's Cripps Court features a tricolon design with ensuite rooms for students. Cripps Court comprises a further seven staircases (H to N) and is home to all of Selwyn's first-year undergraduates, a few second-year undergraduates and postgraduates including their common room, the Middle Combination Room (MCR).\n\n[[File:Selwyn College Chapel 2, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|The chapel facing west towards the entrance and organ]]\n[[File:Selwyn2.jpg|thumb|right|Selwyn College, Ann's Court]]\nAnn's Court, built on the land to the north of Old Court and south of West Road, is the most recent court. Its exterior reflects the atmosphere of the rest of the college with Ketton limestone and brick-work fixtures. Ann's Court was designed by the traditionalist architect [[Demetri Porphyrios]] who has completed similar new projects at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], which also utilised hand-carved Ketton stone in its exteriors, and at [[Princeton University]] ([[Whitman College, Princeton University|Whitman College]]) in the United States. The golden-yellow Ketton stone used in Anne's Court (and the rest of Selwyn College) has been used in the construction of Oxford and Cambridge colleges for several hundred years, and can be see in the exterior of the [[Wren Library]]. The interior of Ann's Court is contemporary and equipped with wooden staircases. As a proponent of [[New Classical Architecture]], Porphyrios designed new buildings which fit the existing limestone and brick materials of Selwyn College. The Porphyrios Associates design involved a three-winged building which created the space for a large new court to be formed in the middle of the college, named Centre Court. Ann's Court features hand-carved details and a series of limestone cloisters and chimneys arranged in the traditional Cambridge University fashion. Ann's Court was named after Ann Dobson, who with her husband Christopher Dobson (who matriculated at Selwyn in 1957) formed the Ann Dobson Foundation, which is one of the principal donors towards the construction costs of Phases I and II. Phase I was completed in July 2005 and consists of 43 ensuite rooms and 15 administrative offices, forming two staircases (O and P) at a cost of \u00a37.5 million. The second phase, including 40 en-suite bedrooms forming staircases Q and R and a new [[Common Room (university)|Junior Combination Room]] (JCR) at a cost of \u00a32.5 million, was completed in Summer 2009.<ref>{{cite book |title=Selwyn College Cambridge \u2013 Ann's Court: The story so far |first=Heather |last=Kilpatrick |publisher=Selwyn College Cambridge |date=June 2009}}</ref> The College bar was refurbished in 2002, and redecorated in 2011.\n\nThe College has [[planning permission]] to develop further three phases of building, planned to be built as funding permits, which will extend the college's distinctive limestone and red-brick fa\u00e7ade along Grange Road to the corner of West Road. The plans consist of a new library and archives (Phase 3) behind Staircase E of Old Court, and two further accommodation blocks (Phase 4) to form a new court (tentatively named Library Court) between Old Court and Ann's Court, and an auditorium, debate chamber, and conference facilities (Phase 5) to complete the west side of Ann's Court.\n[[File:Map of Cambridge, England (1886).png|thumb|right|Map of Selwyn College (1886)]]\nPlans are currently underway to build a new library and auditorium located near Ann's Court and the College Gardens. The college plan calls for all future expansions to adhere to the same architectural style of limestone and brick demonstrated in the Ann's Court development. The Master Plan, also designed by Porphyrios Architects, calls for a new wing of student housing alongside Grange Road, located between Old Court and Anne's Court. This new wing of accommodation would enclose the western edge of Centre Court and would allow the College to increase graduate student numbers. In 2018, the college assured concerned alumni and students that the original library would be preserved and converted into lecture and auditorium rooms (although the small 1970s annex will likely be removed).<ref name=\"Annual Report 2017-18\">{{cite web |title=Selwyn College Annual Report 2017-18 |url=https://www.selwynalumni.com/publications |website=www.selwynalumni.com |accessdate=5 June 2018}}</ref> The building of a new library is a priority for Selwyn College and would complete the perimeter of a fourth collegiate court.\n\n==Coat of arms and motto==\n[[File:Selwyn College Heraldic Coat of Arms, Main Gate.jpg|thumb|upright|The arms used by George Augustus Selwyn as Bishop of Lichfield, above the college's Main Gate to Old Court]]\n[[File:Selwyn College Cambridge Main Gate.jpg|thumb|upright| Main Gate with the Greek quotation which contains the College motto]]\nThe Selwyn College [[coat of arms]] incorporates the arms of the Selwyn family impaled with an adaptation of the arms of the [[Diocese of Lichfield]]. The arms were granted in the 1960s and are emblazoned as follows;\n\n:''Per pale Gules and Argent a Cross potent quadrate Argent and Or between four crosses paty those to the dexter Argent those to the sinister Or For the See of Lichfield impaling Argent on a Bend cotised Sable three Annulets Or for Selwyn all within a Bordure Sable And for Crest On a Wreath Or & Purpure In front of a Book erect bound Gules edged clasped and garnished Or a representation of the Pastoral Staff of Bishop Selwyn.''\n\nThe dexter half of the arms adapted from those of the See of Lichfield, are unusual, with ''or'' (gold) countercharged on ''argent'' (silver), violating the [[rule of tincture]], which prohibits a metal to be charged with another metal. This is thought to refer to the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#Arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem|arms of the Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which also violates this rule. Selwyn's pastoral staff or [[crozier]] is based on a hardwood [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]] staff which is held in the College Chapel. The College was also granted an official badge, ''A Mitre Or within an Annulet Purpure''.\n\nBefore an official grant by the [[College of Arms]], Selwyn College used [[heraldry|arms]] believed to be those borne by George Augustus Selwyn as Bishop of Lichfield;<ref>{{cite web|title=Selwyn College Arms|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/college-arms/|website=Selwyn College|accessdate=7 September 2017}}</ref> they are displayed above the main gateway, built in 1881, and on the Common Seal, first used in 1882.\n\nThe College [[motto]] is a [[Bible|biblical]] quotation from [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], [[1 Corinthians 16|chapter 16]], verse 13, in [[Koine Greek|Greek]], ''\u0391\u039d\u0394\u03a1\u0399\u0396\u0395\u03a3\u0398\u0395'',<ref>[http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/~fisher/cgi-bin/gnt?id=0716 1 Corinthians 16].

An additional Formal Hall was held on Sunday evenings at least until the early 1990s.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/talks/graces/|title=The Cambridge University Heraldic & Genealogical Society|website=societies.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref> Wine and Port may be enjoyed during formal, however any alcohol purchased outside of the college must be inspected and corked by kitchen staff. There is also a special, extra Halfway Hall Formal for second-year students to mark the middle of their time as an undergraduate student at the College, and a Christmas Formal for all students at the end of every Michaelmas Term. Selwyn holds several JCR Dinners and MCR Dinners specifically for undergraduate and graduate students each term.\n\nFormal Halls are for students, fellows and the master of the college, however, members of other Oxbridge colleges may attend as well as a limited number of guests from outside the university. Formal hall meals are three- or four-course meals which are fully catered and served \u00e0 la carte by college staff. During formal hall, the Fellows and the Master of the college are entitled to sit at the [[High Table]] near the front of the hall, while students sit on benches or chairs at the long table.\n\n====Latin grace====\nThe College [[Grace (prayer)|Grace]] is recited in Latin by a Fellow or Scholar (a student who achieved a First Class mark overall in the previous year) at the beginning of Formal Hall, and is as follows:\n<blockquote>''Benedic, Domine, nobis et donis Tuis, quae de Tua largitate sumus sumpturi; et concede ut iis muneribus Tuis ad laudem Tuam utamur, gratisque animis fruamur, per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. Amen.''</blockquote>\n\nTranslation:\n<blockquote>Bless us, O Lord, and all thy gifts, which of thy goodness we are about to enjoy; grant that we may use these generosities to thy glory, and enjoy them with thankful hearts, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.</blockquote>\n\nWhen the High Table rises, the following concluding Grace is said ''Benedicamus Domino'' (Let us bless the Lord), with the response being ''Laus Deo'' (Praise be to God). This response was changed in the 1990s, from the previous response ''Deo gratias'' (Thanks be to God).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n====Loyal toast====\nSelwyn has a tradition in which senior fellows and members of the college commonly remain seated for the College's [[loyal toast]] during formal hall. This tradition is not done out of any disrespect or irreverence for the sovereign, but rather, out of courtesy and remembrance to the former Master of the College, [[John Selwyn (bishop)|John Selwyn]], who could not easily stand for the loyal toast owing to the limited use of his legs in later life. John Selwyn (son of George Augustus Selwyn) served as the second Master of Selwyn College (1893\u20131898).<ref name=\"Short History\"/>\n\n===Lecture series===\nSelwyn College hosts an annual lecture named in honour of the late Lt Col Ramsay Murray, an alumnus of the College during the 1930s. The Ramsay Murray Lecture Series was established in 1994 following a significant bequest from the Murray estate.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\">https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/ramsay-murray-lecture-2009</ref> Lecturers have included many high-profile politicians, academics, and journalists including Baroness [[Onora O\u2019Neill]] of Bengarve, [[Niall Ferguson]], Sir [[Michael Howard]], Professor Sir [[Ian Kershaw]], Professor [[Roy Porter]], Professor [[Ian Clark (political scientist)|Ian Clark]], Professor Lawrence Freedman, Professor David Cannadine, Sir [[Keith Thomas (historian)|Keith Thomas]], Professor Jonathan Riley-Smith and Professor [[Quentin Skinner]], former Regius Professor of Modern History.<ref name=\"cam.ac.uk\"/> The 2018 Ramsay Murray lecture features the journalist [[Frank Gardner (journalist)|Frank Gardner]] OBE.<ref>https://www.selwynalumni.com/main-website-pages/ramsay-murray-lecture</ref> The lectures are free and open to the public.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Selwyn College, Cambridge Porters Lodge.jpg|thumb|Porter's Lodge]]\nSelwyn has a reputation as one of the most traditional but friendliest Oxbridge colleges.<ref name=\"Short History\" /> The college is visited by many members of the university who come from the neighbouring Sidgwick Site in-between lectures and supervisions to take advantage of Selwyn's Servery and Dining Hall. Similarly, Formal Swaps are regularly arranged by the student councils to allow students from other Oxford and Cambridge colleges to dine at Selwyn during Formal Hall. Students of Selwyn College are required to wear their gowns to all formal halls, ceremonies and college functions. The Selwyn gown is made of a thick black cloth with dark navy blue inline lapels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ryderamies.co.uk/shop/selwyn-college-undergraduate-gown/|title=Selwyn College Undergraduate Gown \u2013 Ryder & Amies|website=Ryderamies.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\n===Common rooms===\nSelwyn College [[Common Room (university)|Junior Combination Room Society]] (JCRS) is the students' union for undergraduates students. Elected in Michaelmas term, it organises social and welfare events, negotiates with the College on the students' behalf, and represents Selwyn on [[Cambridge University Students' Union]] (CUSU) Council. JCRS is affiliated to CUSU and by extension to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|National Union of Students]]. In recent years, four presidents of Selwyn College JCRS have become CUSU president, one of whom, [[Wes Streeting]] MP, went on to become president of the National Union of Students and a Labour [[Member of Parliament]]. Another JCRS President, [[Simon Hughes]] went on to become a [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP and candidate for [[Mayor of London]].\n\nThe Middle Combination Room (MCR) comprises the graduate students of Selwyn College, and is similarly represented by the MCR Committee (MCRc). The MCR is located in Cripps Court. The presidents and treasurers of the JCRc and MCRc have sat on College Council, the main decision-making body of the College, since it was reformed in 1989.\n[[File:DSC 9798-selwyn-m1-div2-sat.JPG|thumb|Selwyn College Boat Club (SCBC)]]\n\n===Student societies===\nThe College is host to a number of student organisations, including the Hermes Club, Selwyn College Music Society and Selwyn Jazz, and on the stage by amateur dramatics society The Mighty Players.<ref>https://mightyplayers.soc.srcf.net/</ref> [[Selwyn College Boat Club]] is the official rowing club.

Some of these societies function as ''de facto'' discussion and debate clubs while others are better known as drinking societies and for raucous parties. In recent years, several of the secret societies at Selwyn have been accused of elitism, and have been involved in sexism and hazing scandals. In 2014, members of the Selwyn Templars were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent out to members of the society.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/12/03/cambridge-university-drinking-society-selwyn-templars_n_6262248.html|title=Another Cambridge Drinking Society Is Under Fire|first1=Keumars Afifi-Sabet Freelance|last1=journalist|last2=satirist|date=4 December 2014|website=HuffPost UK|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"varsity.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/7950|title=Misogynist messages leak from Selwyn|website=Varsity.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n[[File:SelwynCollegeSociety0187.png|thumb|Programme for a 1914 [[smoking concert]] of the Controversialists]]\n\n====The Controversialists====\nThe Controversialists are the oldest secret society at the college and one of the oldest at the university, being founded by a group of all-male students during the Lent Term in 1893. The society's name is believed to pay homage to both their leftist political leanings and their discussion and debate of poetry and literature. The purpose of the Society, according to rules printed in 1909, was \"the reading and discussion of English poetry and drama\". The Society membership is made up of both undergraduate and graduate students at Selwyn College. Female students have been able to join the society since women were admitted to the College. The total number of Controversialist members is not allowed to exceed twelve. Meetings have traditionally been held on Sundays in the Michaelmas and Lent terms, as well as in May if a quorum of five members can be arranged. The badge and symbol of the Controversialists is a purple lyre.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZAE-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA206&lpg=PA206&dq=Selwyn+Controversialists+Cambridge#v=onepage&q=Selwyn+Controversialists+Cambridge&f=false|title=The Cambridge Review|date=26 August 1896|accessdate=26 August 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe Controversialists commonly organise [[smoking concert]]s where poetry and verse is recited by members before the political discussions begin. The Controversialists are said to drink only Port during their meetings.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n====The Templars====\nThe Selwyn College Templars are the second oldest secret society and the largest at the college. The society was initially only open to wealthy, upper-class Anglican students. The membership of the Templars Society are often involved with campus politics and are often members of the [[Cambridge University Conservative Association]]. Membership is decided by nomination from two current members and election at the society's Michaelmas meeting. New members of the Templars are reportedly 'knighted' with a ceremonial sword in a bizarre initiation ceremony that takes place on the Autumn equinox each year.<ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\nIn 2014, British newspapers reported that the Selwyn Templars Society were involved in a scandal where sexist and misogynistic messages were sent to members of the society. The college took disciplinary action against all students involved in the incident.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"varsity.co.uk\"/>\n\n===Hermes Club===\nThe Hermes Club, founded in 1920, exists to encourage, fund and improve sport at Selwyn College \u2013 a task it accomplishes by offering financial grants to individual sportsmen/women and college teams, through the lobbying of College, and by generally raising the profile of sport in Selwyn. Members of Selwyn are eligible for invitation to the club if they have been awarded a Full [[Blue (university sport)|Blue]] or Half Blue by the University, if they have captained a Selwyn College team in a 'First Class sport', or if they have competed on behalf of Selwyn in two 'First Class' [[Cuppers]] competitions.<ref name=\"Short History\" />\n\nAlumni of the club fund two major sports grant schemes which award thousands of pounds in grants every year \u2013 the Hermes Fund and the Vickerstaff Sports Bursary Scheme. Many members{{who|date=August 2017}} of the Hermes Club have gone on to become prominent in public life, particularly as politicians, actors and authors.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/GivingtoSelwyn/sportsbursaryscheme.html|title=Sports Bursary Scheme|website=Selcam.ac.uk|accessdate=2017-08-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927015038/http://www.sel.cam.ac.uk/alumni/GivingtoSelwyn/sportsbursaryscheme.html|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Winter and May balls===\n[[File:Selwyn College May Ball 1948 Survivors Shot.jpg|thumb|left|Selwyn College May Ball Survivors (1948)]]\nSelwyn is unique among Oxbridge colleges in that it holds an annual Winter [[May Ball|Ball]] known as the Selwyn Snowball, which traditionally takes place on the night of the last Friday of Michaelmas term. In recent years the Snowball has developed into a larger event than it had been in the mid-nineties and now runs three full stages, with recent headliners including [[Mumford & Sons]] and [[Tinchy Stryder]], and caters for around 850 guests. The Selwyn Snowball has often become bigger and more subscribed than its May Ball which is usually held in June of each year once students have finished their examinations.\n\nThe [[May Ball]] tradition at Selwyn began on 14 June 1948, as hundreds of students dressed in [[black tie]] to attend the all-night celebration. May Balls continued to be held at the college throughout the second half of the 20th century with a highlight being the performance of [[The Who]] in 1967.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge-University-ball-season-kicks-tomorrow-scenes-Week/story-22514993-detail/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923200208/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge-University-ball-season-kicks-tomorrow-scenes-Week/story-22514993-detail/story.html |archivedate=23 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In recent years, May Balls have been replaced by the Snowball with notable exceptions: 2008, to celebrate the college's 125th anniversary; 2015 and 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.selwynball.com/|title=Selwyn May Ball|website=Selwynball.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Selwyn College Boat Club===\n\nThe [[Selwyn College Boat Club]] (SCBC) is the rowing club for members of the college. The boat club was founded in 1882, during the Michaelmas term. During this early period, the Selwyn Boat Club trained several rowers who would go on to become Olympic Rowers and University Blues in the annual boat race against Oxford. The SCBC also achieved intercollegiate success during its early days, winning a second in the [[Lent Bumps]] of 1934 and third in the [[May Bumps]] 1931. The dedication and work of the early Selwyn rowers was all the more fitting given that George Augustus Selwyn had rowed for Cambridge  in the first Boat Race at [[Henley-on-Thames]] in 1829. The SCBC still has one of the highest participation rates of novice rowers of any Oxbridge college.  Notable alumni of the Selwyn College Boat Club include [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Tom Hollander]] and [[Richard Budgett]].\n\nIn 2014, Selwyn, King's and Churchill colleges announced plans for a new, state-of-the-art combined boathouse located on the River Cam. The boathouse features double-length beams and extensive gym and training facilities for all Selwyn College rowers and student athletes. This facility was completed in 2015\u201316 and now provides world-class rowing and training facilities for SCBC rowers and students across the University of Cambridge. The project was largely funded by donations and contributions from alumni and the Hermes Club. The two-storey combined boathouse is larger than its 1968 predecessor and provides facilities for socialising, training and boat maintenance in addition to an observation deck. The combined boathouse was designed by RHP Architects at a cost of approximately \u00a32.20 million and was the winner of the 2017 [[Royal Institute of British Architects|RIBA]] East Award for Outstanding Architecture.<ref name=\"Short History\"/><ref>http://www.rhpartnership.co.uk/projects/combined-colleges-boathouse</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n*In [[Tom Sharpe]]'s ''[[Porterhouse Blue]]'' novel, Selwyn College is satirically described as a college founded by 'social justice' devotees.
