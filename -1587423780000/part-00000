Yoder Jr., [http://www.newsobserver.com/opinion/op-ed/article116581273.html \"Government tasks will test Trump's skill\"]</ref> Emblematic of Clifford's influence in postwar Democratic presidential administrations was the fact that after Jimmy Carter won the [[1976 United States presidential election|1976 presidential election]], his transition team was adamant that Clifford, as a symbol of the DC establishment, should not have any influence whatsoever, declaring that \"if you ever see us relying on Clark Clifford, you'll know we have failed\", yet Carter eventually came to rely on him nonetheless.<ref name=\"yoder\"/>\n\nIn his later years, Clifford became involved in several controversies. He was a key figure in the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] scandal, which led to a grand jury indictment.\n\n==Background==\n\nClark McAdams Clifford was born on December 25, 1906, in [[Fort Scott, Kansas]].  His parents were Frank Andrew Clifford and Georgia McAdams. He attended college and law school at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Missouri.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Career==\n\nClifford built a solid reputation practicing law in St. Louis between 1928 and 1943.  He served as an officer in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] from 1944 to 1946. \n\n===Presidential adviser===\n[[File:Photograph of White House staff members during President Truman's vacation at Key West, Florida, (left to right)... - NARA - 200493.jpg|thumb|right|Close associates of President [[Harry S.

Hassett (White House Correspondence Secretary), [[John R. Steelman|John Steelman]] (Assistant to the President) and [[Matthew J. Connelly|Matthew Connelly]] (White House Appointments Secretary).]]\nIn 1945 he was assigned to the White House and quickly promoted to [[Captain (United States O-6)|captain]] while serving as assistant naval aide and then naval aide to President Harry S Truman. He became a trusted personal adviser and friend of Truman.<ref>John Acacia, ''Clark Clifford: The Wise Man of Washington'' (2009), pp 1-16. </ref>\n\nClifford went to Washington,  first to serve as assistant to the President's Naval Adviser, after the naming of a personal friend from Missouri as the President's Naval Adviser.  Following his discharge from the Navy, he remained at Truman's side as [[White House Counsel]] from 1946 to 1950, as Truman came rapidly to trust and rely upon Clifford.\n\nClifford was a key architect of Truman's campaign in 1948, when Truman pulled off a stunning upset victory over Republican nominee [[Thomas Dewey]]. Clifford encouraged Truman to embrace a left-wing [[Populism|populist]] image in hope of undermining the impact on the race of third-party [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had served as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Vice-President from 1941 to 1945. Clifford also believed that a strong pro-civil rights stance, while sure to alienate traditional [[Southern Democrat]]s, would not result in a serious challenge to the party's supremacy in that region. This prediction was foiled by [[Strom Thurmond]]'s candidacy as a splinter [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democrat]], but Clifford's strategy nonetheless helped win Truman election in his own right and establish the Democratic Party's position in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref>Acacia, ''Clark Clifford''  (2009), ch 1-5. </ref>\n\nIn his role as presidential adviser, one of his most significant contributions was his successful advocacy, along with [[David Niles]], of prompt 1948 recognition of the new Jewish state of [[Israel]], over the strong objections of Secretary of State General [[George Marshall]].<ref>[[David McCullough|McCullough, David G.]] (1992) ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0591/9105017.htm Truman Adviser Recalls May 14, 1948 Decision to Recognize Israel], Richard H.

Kennan]] and [[Charles Bohlen]], was his preparation, along with [[George Elsey]], of the top secret [https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025127/http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/coldwar/documents/sectioned.php?documentid=4-1&pagenumber=1&groupid=1 Clifford-Elsey Report] for President Truman in 1946.  That report, solicited by the President, which detailed the numerous ways in which the Soviet Union had gone back on its various treaties and understandings with the Western powers, along with Kennan's [[X Article]] in ''Foreign Affairs'', was instrumental in turning U.S. relations toward the Soviet Union in the direction of a harder line.<ref name=Memoir>\n{{cite book\n| first1 = Clark M. \n| last1 = Clifford \n| authorlink1 = Clark Clifford\n| first2 = Richard C. \n| last2 = Holbrooke\n| authorlink2 = Richard C.

Gifford\"/>\n\nAfter leaving the government in 1950, Clifford practiced law in Washington, D.C., but continued to advise [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] leaders. One of his law clients was John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. Senator, and Clifford tried to assuage Truman's suspicion of Kennedy and his father, [[Joseph P. Kennedy]].<ref>Acacia, ''Clark Clifford'' pp 207-22. </ref>\n\nIn 1960, Clifford was a member of [[President-elect]] Kennedy's [[Committee on the Defense Establishment]], headed by [[Stuart Symington]]. In May 1961, Kennedy appointed Clifford to the [[President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board]], which he chaired beginning in April 1963 and ending in January 1968.<ref>[http://www.kansas.com/2010/06/14/1359182/4-presidents-heard-advice-of-fort.html 4 presidents heard advice of Fort Scott man]</ref>\n\nAfter Johnson became president in November 1963 following [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy's assassination]], Clifford served frequently as an unofficial White House Counsel and sometimes undertook short-term official duties, including a trip with General [[Maxwell Taylor]] in 1967 to [[South Vietnam]] and other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific.\n\n===Secretary of Defense===\n[[File:Advisors, Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford and Secretary of State Dean Rusk - NARA - 192534.tif|thumb|right|Secretary of Defense Clifford with the Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] in 1968.]]\nOn January 19, 1968, Johnson announced his selection of Clifford to succeed [[Robert McNamara]] as the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Clifford estimated that, in the year just prior to his appointment, he had spent about half of his time advising the President and the other half working for his law firm.<ref>\"Historical Office.\" Clark M. Clifford > Historical Office > Article View. N.p., n.d. Web. 13 Jan. 2017.</ref>\nWidely known and respected in Washington and knowledgeable on defense matters, Clifford was generally hailed as a worthy successor to McNamara. Many regarded the new secretary as more of a [[war hawk|hawk]] on Vietnam than McNamara, and thought his selection might presage an escalation of the U.S. military effort there. Clifford attempted to allay such fears when, responding to a query about whether he was a hawk (favoring aggressive military action) or a dove (favoring a peaceful resolution to the [[Vietnam War]]), he remarked, \"I am not conscious of falling under any of those ornithological divisions.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger R. Trask|title=The Secretaries of Defense: A Brief History, 1947-1985|url=https://archive.org/details/secretariesofdef00wash|year=1985|publisher=Historical Office, Office of the Secretary of Defense|page=[https://archive.org/details/secretariesofdef00wash/page/34 34]}}</ref>\n\nThe new Secretary did not change the management system McNamara had installed at [[The Pentagon]], and for the most part assigned internal administration to [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul H. Nitze]]. Clifford made no effort to depart from McNamara's policies and programs on such matters as nuclear strategy, [[NATO]], and military assistance, but he favored the [[Anti-ballistic missile#Nike-X, Sentinel and Safeguard|Sentinel]] [[anti-ballistic missile]] system, to which McNamara had given only lukewarm backing. Clifford wanted to deploy the system, and supported congressional appropriations for it. One important effect of Sentinel construction, he thought, would be to encourage the [[Soviet Union]] to enter arms control talks with the U.S. Indeed, before Clifford left office, the Johnson administration made arrangements for negotiations that eventually led to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] of 1972.\n\nClifford continued McNamara's highly publicized Cost Reduction Program, announcing that over $1.2 billion had been saved in [[fiscal year]] (FY) 1968 as a result of the effort. Faced with a congressionally mandated reduction of expenditures in FY 1969, Clifford suspended the planned activation of an infantry division and deactivated 50 small ships, 9 naval air squadrons, and 23 [[Nike-Hercules]] missile launch sites.\n\nBy the time Clifford became secretary, Defense Department work on the fiscal year 1969 budget was complete. It amounted in total obligational authority to $77.7 billion, almost $3 billion more than in FY 1968. The final FY 1970 budget, which Clifford and his staff worked on before they left office after the election of [[Richard Nixon]] to the presidency, amounted to $75.5 billion TOA (Total Obligational Authority).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120417090338/http://comptroller.defense.gov/defbudget/fy2013/FY13_Green_Book.pdf National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 2013]. Department of Defense. March 2012. p. 1</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{Location map-line|lat=20}}\n\nClifford took office committed to rethinking Johnson's Vietnam policies, and Vietnam policy consumed most of his time.   He had argued against escalation in 1965 in private counsel with the president, but then provided public support for the president's position once the decision was made.  At his confirmation hearing, he told the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] of the U.S. Senate that the limited objective of the U.S. was to guarantee to the people of South Vietnam the right of self-determination. He opposed ending the U.S. bombing of [[North Vietnam]] at the time, but acknowledged that the situation could change.<ref>Acacia, ''Clark Clifford'' pp 236-328. </ref>\n\nIn fact, on March 31, 1968, just a month after Clifford arrived at The Pentagon, Johnson, in an effort to get peace talks started, ordered the cessation of bombing north of the [[20th parallel north|20th parallel]], an area comprising almost 80 percent of North Vietnam's land area and 90 percent of its population. In the same address, Johnson announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection in 1968, surprising everyone, Clifford included. Soon the North Vietnamese agreed to negotiations, which began in Paris in mid-May 1968. Later, on October 31, 1968, to encourage the success of these talks, the President, with Clifford's strong support, ordered an end to all bombing in North Vietnam.\n\nClifford, like McNamara, had to deal with frequent requests for additional troops from military commanders in Vietnam. When he became secretary, the authorized force in Vietnam was 525,000. Soon after moving into his Pentagon office, Clifford persuaded Johnson to deny General [[William Westmoreland]]'s request for an additional 206,000 American troops in Vietnam.\n\nAt the end of March 1968, however, Johnson agreed to send 24,500 more troops on an emergency basis, raising authorized strength to 549,500, a figure never reached. Even as he oversaw a continued buildup, Clifford preferred to emphasize the points Johnson had made in his March 31, 1968 address: that the South Vietnamese army could take over a greater share of the fighting, that the administration would place an absolute limit on the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam, and that it would take steps, including the bombing restrictions, to reduce the combat level.\n\nEventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to the views McNamara held on Vietnam just before he left office\u2014no further increases in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], who believed, according to ''[[The Washington Post]],'' \"that the war was being won by the allies\" and that it \"would be won if America had the will to win it.\"  He later recalled how he turned against the war: \"I found out that we couldn't win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all we were going to do was just waste the lives of our men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam.\"<ref>[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:348bd4b1ae559bcd90abab7b114328312a4bf800 \u201cInterview with Clark M.

Moreover&nbsp;... we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force, and the time has come to begin to disengage. That was my final conclusion as I left the Pentagon&nbsp;...\".<ref>Clark M.

He got along well with the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and this helped him to secure approval of at least some of his proposals. He settled into his duties quickly and efficiently, and capably managed the initial de-escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; indeed, he apparently strongly influenced Johnson in favor of a de-escalation strategy. As he left office to return to his law practice in Washington, Clifford expressed the hope and expectation that international tensions would abate, citing the shift in the Vietnam confrontation from the battlefield to the conference table, and the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to discuss limitations on strategic [[nuclear weapons]].\n\n===Special presidential emissary to India===\n\nClifford's legal practice and lobbying work made him wealthy, and he was considered one of Washington's \"superlawyers\" due to the reach of his influence and seemingly limitless connections.  Clifford's office overlooked the [[White House]], emphasizing his long experience in the capital.  Clifford was renowned for his seemingly effortless charm, style, tact and discretion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 1980, President Carter appointed him as special [[diplomat|presidential emissary]] to [[India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nClifford made waves by threatening the newly established [[regime]] of [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] of [[Iran]] with war for its intransigence in negotiating the release of the hostages seized from the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nHe also referred to President [[Ronald Reagan]] as an \"amiable dunce\" at a Washington dinner party.<ref name=ac/>\n\n===Bank of Credit and Commerce International: the BCCI Scandal===\n{{Main|Bank of Credit and Commerce International}}\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?19811-1/counsel-president-memoir ''Booknotes'' interview with Clifford on ''Counsel to the President: A Memoir'', July 28, 1991], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n[[File:Zayed-bin-Sultan-Al-Nahyan.jpg|thumb|right|BCCI's founder [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] started [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] in 1972 with 25% capital from [[Bank of America]] and the remaining 75% from Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] (pictured), the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]].]]\nThe [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) scandal focused on the criminal conduct of the international bank and its control of financial institutions nationwide. The bank was found by regulators in the U.S. and the United Kingdom to be involved in [[money laundering]], bribery, support of terrorism, [[arms trafficking]], the sale of nuclear technologies, the commission and facilitation of [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]], [[smuggling]], illegal immigration, and the illicit purchases of banks and real estate. The bank was found to have at least $13 billion in unaccounted funds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, Clifford served as chairman of First American Bankshares, which grew to become the largest bank in Washington, D.C.  The bank was nominally owned by a group of Arab investors, but in order to assuage fears from the [[Federal Reserve]], Clifford had assembled a board of distinguished American citizens to exercise day-to-day control.  In 1991, [[Robert M. Morgenthau]], the District Attorney for [[New York County]] (coterminous with the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]), disclosed that his office had found evidence that BCCI secretly owned First American. Morgenthau convened a [[grand jury]] to determine whether Clifford and his partner, [[Robert A. Altman]], had deliberately misled federal regulators when the two men assured them that BCCI would have no outside control.<ref name=\"FalseProfits\">Peter Truell, Larry Gurwin (1992) ''False Profits: The Inside Story of BCCI, the World's Most Corrupt Financial Empire''. Houghton, Mifflin Company, Boston, New York. {{ISBN|0-395-62339-1}}.</ref>\n\nAn audit by [[Price Waterhouse]] revealed that contrary to agreements between First American's nominal investors and the Federal Reserve, many of the investors had borrowed heavily from BCCI. Even more seriously, they had pledged their First American stock as collateral.  When they missed interest payments, BCCI took control of the shares. It was later estimated that in this manner, BCCI had ended up with 60 percent or more of First American's stock.  There had long been suspicions that First American's investors were actually nominees for BCCI.  However, the audit was solid confirmation that BCCI secretly\u2014and illegally\u2014owned First American.<ref name=\"FalseProfits\"/>\n\nClifford's predicament worsened when it was disclosed he had made about $6 million in [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] from bank stock that he had bought with an [[unsecured loan]] from BCCI. The grand jury handed up indictments, and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] opened its own investigation. Clifford's assets in New York City, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen.<ref name=ac/>\n\nClifford insisted that he had no knowledge of illegal activity at First American, and insisted that he himself had been deceived about the extent of BCCI's involvement.<ref name=ac/>\n\nA \"Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate\", prepared by U.S. Senators [[John Kerry]] and [[Hank Brown]], noted that a key strategy of \"BCCI's successful secret acquisitions of U.S. banks in the face of regulatory suspicion was its aggressive use of a series of prominent Americans\", Clifford among them.<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/ The BCCI Affair].

These charges were dropped in 1993 because of Clifford\u2019s ill health.

His success came from hard work, a good mind, poker skills to match those of his boss, the ability to stroke the press, the knack to immediately seize on serendipitous opportunities, and the ability to identify, reshape and promote good ideas first proposed by others, such as George Kennan. He thus gained fame for papers that he presented forcefully, but did not actually write, including his 1947 proposal on Truman's reelection strategy and the Clifford-Elsey papers on Cold War strategy. He became a trusted advisor to presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in 1960, assuring his access by indicating he wanted no public office. His reputation \u2013 and his law practice \u2013 continued to soar until finally Lyndon Johnson forced him to become Defense Secretary to lead the nation out of the Vietnam trap.<ref>John Acacia, ''Clark Clifford: The Wise Man of Washington'' (2009), passim and p. 122.</ref>  Historian [[Walter Isaacson]]  argues that in many ways Clifford resembled the fout wise men who shaped American foreign policy in the 1940s and early 1950s \u2013 [[Dean Acheson]], [[Averell Harriman]], [[Robert A.

However, Isaacson argues,  \"Clifford remained a Wise Man wannabe because he could never quite shake his reputation as a partisan Wheeler-dealer and manipulator.\"<ref> Walter Isaacson,  ''American Sketches: Great Leaders, Creative Thinkers, and Heroes of a Hurricane'' (2009) pp 66-67</ref>\n\nIn 1995, [[Tony Goldwyn]] portrayed Clifford in the [[HBO]] [[television movie|television film]] ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]''.

Following his discharge from the Navy, he remained at Truman's side as [[White House Counsel]] from 1946 to 1950, as Truman came rapidly to trust and rely upon Clifford.\n\nClifford was a key architect of Truman's campaign in 1948, when Truman pulled off a stunning upset victory over Republican nominee [[Thomas Dewey]]. Clifford encouraged Truman to embrace a left-wing [[Populism|populist]] image in hope of undermining the impact on the race of third-party [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive]] candidate [[Henry A. Wallace]], who had served as President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s Vice-President from 1941 to 1945. Clifford also believed that a strong pro-civil rights stance, while sure to alienate traditional [[Southern Democrat]]s, would not result in a serious challenge to the party's supremacy in that region. This prediction was foiled by [[Strom Thurmond]]'s candidacy as a splinter [[Dixiecrat|States' Rights Democrat]], but Clifford's strategy nonetheless helped win Truman election in his own right and establish the Democratic Party's position in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].<ref>Acacia, ''Clark Clifford''  (2009), ch 1-5. </ref>\n\nIn his role as presidential adviser, one of his most significant contributions was his successful advocacy, along with [[David Niles]], of prompt 1948 recognition of the new Jewish state of [[Israel]], over the strong objections of Secretary of State General [[George Marshall]].<ref>[[David McCullough|McCullough, David G.]] (1992) ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0591/9105017.htm Truman Adviser Recalls May 14, 1948 Decision to Recognize Israel], Richard H.

Web. 13 Jan. 2017.</ref>\nWidely known and respected in Washington and knowledgeable on defense matters, Clifford was generally hailed as a worthy successor to McNamara. Many regarded the new secretary as more of a [[war hawk|hawk]] on Vietnam than McNamara, and thought his selection might presage an escalation of the U.S. military effort there. Clifford attempted to allay such fears when, responding to a query about whether he was a hawk (favoring aggressive military action) or a dove (favoring a peaceful resolution to the [[Vietnam War]]), he remarked, \"I am not conscious of falling under any of those ornithological divisions.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Roger R. Trask|title=The Secretaries of Defense: A Brief History, 1947-1985|url=https://archive.org/details/secretariesofdef00wash|year=1985|publisher=Historical Office, Office of the Secretary of Defense|page=[https://archive.org/details/secretariesofdef00wash/page/34 34]}}</ref>\n\nThe new Secretary did not change the management system McNamara had installed at [[The Pentagon]], and for the most part assigned internal administration to [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Paul H. Nitze]]. Clifford made no effort to depart from McNamara's policies and programs on such matters as nuclear strategy, [[NATO]], and military assistance, but he favored the [[Anti-ballistic missile#Nike-X, Sentinel and Safeguard|Sentinel]] [[anti-ballistic missile]] system, to which McNamara had given only lukewarm backing. Clifford wanted to deploy the system, and supported congressional appropriations for it. One important effect of Sentinel construction, he thought, would be to encourage the [[Soviet Union]] to enter arms control talks with the U.S. Indeed, before Clifford left office, the Johnson administration made arrangements for negotiations that eventually led to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] of 1972.\n\nClifford continued McNamara's highly publicized Cost Reduction Program, announcing that over $1.2 billion had been saved in [[fiscal year]] (FY) 1968 as a result of the effort. Faced with a congressionally mandated reduction of expenditures in FY 1969, Clifford suspended the planned activation of an infantry division and deactivated 50 small ships, 9 naval air squadrons, and 23 [[Nike-Hercules]] missile launch sites.\n\nBy the time Clifford became secretary, Defense Department work on the fiscal year 1969 budget was complete. It amounted in total obligational authority to $77.7 billion, almost $3 billion more than in FY 1968. The final FY 1970 budget, which Clifford and his staff worked on before they left office after the election of [[Richard Nixon]] to the presidency, amounted to $75.5 billion TOA (Total Obligational Authority).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120417090338/http://comptroller.defense.gov/defbudget/fy2013/FY13_Green_Book.pdf National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 2013]. Department of Defense. March 2012. p. 1</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{Location map-line|lat=20}}\n\nClifford took office committed to rethinking Johnson's Vietnam policies, and Vietnam policy consumed most of his time.   He had argued against escalation in 1965 in private counsel with the president, but then provided public support for the president's position once the decision was made.  At his confirmation hearing, he told the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] of the U.S. Senate that the limited objective of the U.S. was to guarantee to the people of South Vietnam the right of self-determination. He opposed ending the U.S. bombing of [[North Vietnam]] at the time, but acknowledged that the situation could change.<ref>Acacia, ''Clark Clifford'' pp 236-328. </ref>\n\nIn fact, on March 31, 1968, just a month after Clifford arrived at The Pentagon, Johnson, in an effort to get peace talks started, ordered the cessation of bombing north of the [[20th parallel north|20th parallel]], an area comprising almost 80 percent of North Vietnam's land area and 90 percent of its population. In the same address, Johnson announced that he would not be a candidate for reelection in 1968, surprising everyone, Clifford included. Soon the North Vietnamese agreed to negotiations, which began in Paris in mid-May 1968. Later, on October 31, 1968, to encourage the success of these talks, the President, with Clifford's strong support, ordered an end to all bombing in North Vietnam.\n\nClifford, like McNamara, had to deal with frequent requests for additional troops from military commanders in Vietnam. When he became secretary, the authorized force in Vietnam was 525,000. Soon after moving into his Pentagon office, Clifford persuaded Johnson to deny General [[William Westmoreland]]'s request for an additional 206,000 American troops in Vietnam.\n\nAt the end of March 1968, however, Johnson agreed to send 24,500 more troops on an emergency basis, raising authorized strength to 549,500, a figure never reached. Even as he oversaw a continued buildup, Clifford preferred to emphasize the points Johnson had made in his March 31, 1968 address: that the South Vietnamese army could take over a greater share of the fighting, that the administration would place an absolute limit on the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam, and that it would take steps, including the bombing restrictions, to reduce the combat level.\n\nEventually Clifford moved very close, with Johnson's tacit support, to the views McNamara held on Vietnam just before he left office\u2014no further increases in U.S. troop levels, support for the bombing halt, and gradual disengagement from the conflict. By this time Clifford clearly disagreed with Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]], who believed, according to ''[[The Washington Post]],'' \"that the war was being won by the allies\" and that it \"would be won if America had the will to win it.\"  He later recalled how he turned against the war: \"I found out that we couldn't win the war with the limitations that we had, which I thought were correct limitations, and I thought all we were going to do was just waste the lives of our men and our treasure out in the jungles of North and South Vietnam.\"<ref>[http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/org.wgbh.mla:348bd4b1ae559bcd90abab7b114328312a4bf800 \u201cInterview with Clark M.

WGBH Media Library & Archives.

Moreover&nbsp;... we cannot realistically expect to achieve anything more through our military force, and the time has come to begin to disengage. That was my final conclusion as I left the Pentagon&nbsp;...\".<ref>Clark M. Clifford, \"A Viet Nam Reappraisal: The Personal History of One Man's View and How It Evolved.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 47.4 (1969): 601-622.</ref>\n\nAlthough the Johnson Administration ended under the cloud of the Vietnam War, Clifford concluded his short term as Secretary of Defense with his reputation actually enhanced. He got along well with the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], and this helped him to secure approval of at least some of his proposals. He settled into his duties quickly and efficiently, and capably managed the initial de-escalation of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; indeed, he apparently strongly influenced Johnson in favor of a de-escalation strategy. As he left office to return to his law practice in Washington, Clifford expressed the hope and expectation that international tensions would abate, citing the shift in the Vietnam confrontation from the battlefield to the conference table, and the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to discuss limitations on strategic [[nuclear weapons]].\n\n===Special presidential emissary to India===\n\nClifford's legal practice and lobbying work made him wealthy, and he was considered one of Washington's \"superlawyers\" due to the reach of his influence and seemingly limitless connections.  Clifford's office overlooked the [[White House]], emphasizing his long experience in the capital.  Clifford was renowned for his seemingly effortless charm, style, tact and discretion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn 1980, President Carter appointed him as special [[diplomat|presidential emissary]] to [[India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nClifford made waves by threatening the newly established [[regime]] of [[Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] of [[Iran]] with war for its intransigence in negotiating the release of the hostages seized from the U.S. embassy in [[Tehran]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nHe also referred to President [[Ronald Reagan]] as an \"amiable dunce\" at a Washington dinner party.<ref name=ac/>\n\n===Bank of Credit and Commerce International: the BCCI Scandal===\n{{Main|Bank of Credit and Commerce International}}\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?19811-1/counsel-president-memoir ''Booknotes'' interview with Clifford on ''Counsel to the President: A Memoir'', July 28, 1991], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n[[File:Zayed-bin-Sultan-Al-Nahyan.jpg|thumb|right|BCCI's founder [[Agha Hasan Abedi]] started [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]] in 1972 with 25% capital from [[Bank of America]] and the remaining 75% from Sheikh [[Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]] (pictured), the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]] in the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]].]]\nThe [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI) scandal focused on the criminal conduct of the international bank and its control of financial institutions nationwide. The bank was found by regulators in the U.S. and the United Kingdom to be involved in [[money laundering]], bribery, support of terrorism, [[arms trafficking]], the sale of nuclear technologies, the commission and facilitation of [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]], [[smuggling]], illegal immigration, and the illicit purchases of banks and real estate. The bank was found to have at least $13 billion in unaccounted funds.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nFrom 1982 to 1991, Clifford served as chairman of First American Bankshares, which grew to become the largest bank in Washington, D.C.  The bank was nominally owned by a group of Arab investors, but in order to assuage fears from the [[Federal Reserve]], Clifford had assembled a board of distinguished American citizens to exercise day-to-day control.  In 1991, [[Robert M. Morgenthau]], the District Attorney for [[New York County]] (coterminous with the [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]), disclosed that his office had found evidence that BCCI secretly owned First American. Morgenthau convened a [[grand jury]] to determine whether Clifford and his partner, [[Robert A. Altman]], had deliberately misled federal regulators when the two men assured them that BCCI would have no outside control.<ref name=\"FalseProfits\">Peter Truell, Larry Gurwin (1992) ''False Profits: The Inside Story of BCCI, the World's Most Corrupt Financial Empire''. Houghton, Mifflin Company, Boston, New York. {{ISBN|0-395-62339-1}}.</ref>\n\nAn audit by [[Price Waterhouse]] revealed that contrary to agreements between First American's nominal investors and the Federal Reserve, many of the investors had borrowed heavily from BCCI. Even more seriously, they had pledged their First American stock as collateral.  When they missed interest payments, BCCI took control of the shares. It was later estimated that in this manner, BCCI had ended up with 60 percent or more of First American's stock.  There had long been suspicions that First American's investors were actually nominees for BCCI.  However, the audit was solid confirmation that BCCI secretly\u2014and illegally\u2014owned First American.<ref name=\"FalseProfits\"/>\n\nClifford's predicament worsened when it was disclosed he had made about $6 million in [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] from bank stock that he had bought with an [[unsecured loan]] from BCCI. The grand jury handed up indictments, and the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] opened its own investigation. Clifford's assets in New York City, where he kept most of his investments, were frozen.<ref name=ac/>\n\nClifford insisted that he had no knowledge of illegal activity at First American, and insisted that he himself had been deceived about the extent of BCCI's involvement.<ref name=ac/>\n\nA \"Report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the United States Senate\", prepared by U.S. Senators [[John Kerry]] and [[Hank Brown]], noted that a key strategy of \"BCCI's successful secret acquisitions of U.S. banks in the face of regulatory suspicion was its aggressive use of a series of prominent Americans\", Clifford among them.<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/ The BCCI Affair].

These charges were dropped in 1993 because of Clifford\u2019s ill health. In 1998, the year of his death, he and Altman reached a $5 million settlement with the [[Federal Reserve]] and settled the last of several civil lawsuits against them.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/11/us/clark-clifford-a-major-adviser-to-four-presidents-is-dead-at-91.html]</ref>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nOn October 3, 1931, Clifford married Margery Pepperell \"Marny\" Kimball (April 20, 1908 \u2013 April 14, 2000).

His success came from hard work, a good mind, poker skills to match those of his boss, the ability to stroke the press, the knack to immediately seize on serendipitous opportunities, and the ability to identify, reshape and promote good ideas first proposed by others, such as George Kennan. He thus gained fame for papers that he presented forcefully, but did not actually write, including his 1947 proposal on Truman's reelection strategy and the Clifford-Elsey papers on Cold War strategy. He became a trusted advisor to presidential candidate John F. Kennedy in 1960, assuring his access by indicating he wanted no public office. His reputation \u2013 and his law practice \u2013 continued to soar until finally Lyndon Johnson forced him to become Defense Secretary to lead the nation out of the Vietnam trap.<ref>John Acacia, ''Clark Clifford: The Wise Man of Washington'' (2009), passim and p. 122.</ref>  Historian [[Walter Isaacson]]  argues that in many ways Clifford resembled the fout wise men who shaped American foreign policy in the 1940s and early 1950s \u2013 [[Dean Acheson]], [[Averell Harriman]], [[Robert A. Lovett]], and [[John J. McCloy]]. However, Isaacson argues,  \"Clifford remained a Wise Man wannabe because he could never quite shake his reputation as a partisan Wheeler-dealer and manipulator.\"<ref> Walter Isaacson,  ''American Sketches: Great Leaders, Creative Thinkers, and Heroes of a Hurricane'' (2009) pp 66-67</ref>\n\nIn 1995, [[Tony Goldwyn]] portrayed Clifford in the [[HBO]] [[television movie|television film]] ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]''.
