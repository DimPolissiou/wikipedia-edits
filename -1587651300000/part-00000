Swan, Duke University Press, 1969</ref> His novels include ''[[Godaan]]'', ''[[Karmabhoomi]]'', ''[[Gaban (novel)|Gaban]]'', ''[[Mansarovar]]'', ''[[Idgah (short story)|Idgah]]''. He published his first collection of five short stories in 1907 in a book called ''Soz-e Watan''.\n\nHe began writing under the pen name \"Nawab Rai\", but subsequently switched to \"Premchand\", [[Munshi]] being an honorary prefix. A novel writer, story writer and dramatist, he has been referred to as the \"''Upanyas Samrat''\" (\"Emperor among Novelists\") by writers. His works include more than a dozen novels, around 300 short stories, several essays and translations of a number of foreign literary works into Hindi.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMunshi Premchand was born on 31 July 1880 in [[Lamhi]], a village located near [[Varanasi]] (Benares) and was named Dhanpat Rai (\"master of wealth\"). His ancestors came from a large [[Kayastha]] family, which owned eight to nine [[bigha]]s of land.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gupta|1998|p=7}}</ref> His grandfather, Guru Sahai Rai was a [[patwari]] (village land record-keeper), and his father Ajaib Rai was a post office clerk. His mother was Anandi Devi of Karauni village, who  probably was also his inspiration for the character Anandi in his ''Bade Ghar Ki Beti''.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 7 }}</ref> Dhanpat Rai was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the first two were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named Suggi.<ref name=\"Sigi 2006 15\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 15}}</ref> His uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him \"[[Nawab]]\" (\"Prince\"). \"Nawab Rai\" was the first pen name chosen by Dhanpat Rai.<ref name=amrit>''Premchand: A Life'', Amrit Rai (Harish Tirvedi, translator), People's Publishing House, New Delhi, 1982.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lamhi, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|right|Munshi Premchand Memorial Gate, Lamhi, Varanasi]]\n\nWhen he was 7 years old, Dhanpat Rai began his education at a [[madrasa]] in Lalpur, located near Lamahi.<ref name=\"Sigi 2006 15\"/> He learnt Urdu and [[Persian language|Persian]] from a [[maulvi]] in the madrasa. When he was 8, his mother died after a long illness. His grandmother, who took the responsibility of raising him, died soon after.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\">{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2001/fjul2001/f190720011.html | title = Munshi Premchand: The Great Novelist | accessdate = 13 January 2012 | publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India }}</ref> Premchand felt isolated, as his elder sister had already been married, and his father was always busy with work. His father, who was now posted at Gorakhpur, remarried, but Premchand received little affection from his stepmother. The [[stepmother]] later became a recurring theme in Premchand's works.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 10 }}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Dhanpat Rai sought solace in fiction, and developed a fascination for books. He heard the stories from the Persian-language fantasy epic ''Tilism-e-Hoshruba'' at a [[tobacconist]]'s shop. He took the job of selling books for a book wholesaler, thus getting the opportunity to read a lot of books.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 16}}</ref> He learnt English at a missionary school, and studied several works of fiction including [[George W. M. Reynolds]]'s eight-volume ''[[The Mysteries of the Court of London]]''.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\"/> He composed his first literary work at [[Gorakhpur]], which was never published and is now lost. It was a farce on a bachelor, who falls in love with a [[Indian caste system|low-caste]] woman. The character was based on Premchand's uncle, who used to scold him for being obsessed with reading fiction; the farce was probably written as a revenge for this.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\"/>\n\nAfter his father was posted to Jamniya in the mid-1890s, Dhanpat Rai enrolled at the Queen's College at Benares as a [[day scholar]].<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_11\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 11 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sigi_2006_17\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 17}}</ref> In 1895, he was married at the age of 15, while still studying in the ninth grade. The match was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by his maternal step-grandfather. The girl was from a rich landlord family and was older than Premchand, who found her quarrelsome and not good-looking.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_11\"/><ref name=\"Sigi_2006_17\"/>\n\nHis father died in 1897 after a long illness. He managed to pass the [[matriculation exam]] with second division (below 60% marks). However, only the students with first division were given fee concession at the Queen's College. He then sought admission at the [[Central Hindu College]], but was unsuccessful because of his poor arithmetic skills.<ref name = \"Gupta_1998_12\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 12 }}</ref> Thus, he had to discontinue his studies. He then obtained an assignment to coach an advocate's son in Benares at a monthly salary of five rupees. He used to reside in a mud-cell over the advocate's stables, and used to send 60% of his salary back home.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_12\"/> Premchand read a lot during these days. After racking up several debts, in 1899, he once went to a book shop to sell one of his collected books. There, he met the headmaster of a missionary school at [[Chunar]], who offered him a job as a teacher, at a monthly salary of {{INR}} 18.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_12\"/> He also took up the job of tutoring a student at a monthly fees of {{INR}} 5.\n\nIn 1900, Premchand secured a job as an assistant teacher at the Government District School, [[Bahraich]], at a monthly salary of {{INR}} 20. Three months later, he was transferred to the District School in [[Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh]], where he stayed in an administrator's bungalow and tutored his son.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 20 }}</ref>\n\nDhanpat Rai first wrote under the pseudonym \"Nawab Rai\". His first short novel was ''Asrar e Ma'abid'' (\"Secrets of God's Abode\", ''Devasthan Rahasya'' in Hindi), which explores corruption among the [[mahant|temple priests]] and their sexual exploitation of poor women. The novel was published in a series in the Benares-based Urdu weekly ''Awaz-e-Khalk'' from 8 October 1903 to February 1905.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 13 }}</ref> Literary critic Siegfried Schulz states that \"his inexperience is quite evident in his first novel\", which is not well-organized, lacks a good plot and features stereotyped characters.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 16}}</ref> [[P. C. Gupta|Prakash Chandra Gupta]] calls it an \"immature work\", which shows a tendency to \"see life only white or black\".<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\n=== Stay at Kanpur ===\nFrom Pratapgarh, Dhanpat Rai was relocated to [[Allahabad]] for training, and subsequently posted at Kanpur in 1905. He stayed in Kanpur for around four years, from May 1905 to June 1909. There he met Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine ''Zamana'', in which he later published several articles and stories.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\nPremchand visited his village Lamahi during the summer vacation, but did not find the stay enjoyable because of a number of reasons. He did not find the weather or the atmosphere conducive for writing. Plus, he faced domestic trouble due to quarrels between his wife and his step-mother. Premchand angrily scolded his wife, after she unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide by hanging. Dismayed, she went to her father's house, and Premchand displayed no interest in bringing her back.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 14 }}</ref> In 1906, Premchand married a child widow, Shivarani Devi, who was the daughter of a landlord from a village near [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]].<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2UnQES-79gC|accessdate=17 May 2019|year=1984|publisher=Published for the proprietors, Bennett, Coleman & Company, Limited, at the Times of India Press|pages=68\u201369}}</ref> The step was considered to be revolutionary at that time, and Premchand faced a lot of social opposition. After his death, Shivarani Devi wrote a book on him, titled ''Premchand Ghar Mein'' (\"Premchand in House\").\n\nIn 1905, inspired by the [[Indian independence movement|nationalist activism]], Premchand published an article on the Indian National Congress leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] in ''Zamana''. He criticised Gokhale's methods for achieving political freedom, and instead recommended adoption of more extremist measures adopted by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 24 }}</ref> Premchand's first published story was ''Duniya Ka Sabse Anmol Ratan'' (\"The Most Precious Jewel in the World\"), which appeared in ''Zamana'' in 1907.<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\">{{cite book | author=Dr. Girirajsharan Agarwal | title=Premchand : Karam Bhoomi (Abhyas Pustika) | year = 2001 | publisher=Diamond | isbn=978-81-7182-328-4 | language = Hindi | pages = 5\u20139 }}</ref> According to this story, the most precious 'jewel' was the last drop of blood necessary to attain independence.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_25\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 25 }}</ref> Many of Premchand's early short stories had patriotic overtones, influenced by the Indian independence movement.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/>\n\nPremchand's second short novel ''Hamkhurma-o-Hamsavab'' (''Prema'' in [[Hindi]]), published in 1907, was penned under the name \"Babu Nawab Rai Banarsi\". It explores the issue of [[widow remarriage]] in the contemporary conservative society: the protagonist Amrit Rai overcomes social opposition to marry the young widow Poorna, giving up his rich and beautiful fianc\u00e9e Prema. According to Prakash Chandra Gupta, \"while containing seeds of his future greatness in many ways, the novel is still youthful and lacks the discipline which full maturity brings\".<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\nIn 1907, another of Premchand's short novels, ''Kishna'' was published by the Medical Hall Press of Benares. This 142-page work, which satirises women's fondness for jewellery, is now lost.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/> Literary critic Nobat Rai criticised the work in ''Zamana'', calling it a mockery of the women's conditions.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_26\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 26 }}</ref>\n\nDuring April\u2013August 1907, Premchand's story ''Roothi Rani'' was published in [[serial (literature)|serial form]] in ''Zamana''.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_26\"/> Also in 1907, the publishers of ''Zamana'' published Premchand's first short story collection, titled ''Soz-e-Watan''. The collection, which was later banned, contained four stories which sought to inspire the Indians in their struggle for political freedom.<ref name=\"Mohan2006\">{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal | title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Five: Sasay To Zorgot) | year = 2006 | publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] | isbn=978-81-260-1221-3 | page=4149}}</ref>\n\n==== Adoption of the name Premchand ====\nIn 1909, Premchand was transferred to [[Mahoba]], and later posted to [[Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh|Hamirpur]] as the Sub-deputy Inspector of Schools.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 27 }}</ref> Around this time, ''Soz-e-Watan'' was noticed by the British Government officials, who banned it as a seditious work. The British collector of the Hamirpur District ordered a raid on Premchand's house, where around five hundred copies of ''Soz-e-Watan'' were burnt.<ref name=\"SahniPaliwal1980\">{{cite book | author1=Bhisham Sahni | author2=Om Prakash Paliwal | title=Premchand: a tribute | year=1980 | publisher=Premchand Centenary Celebrations Committee }}</ref> After this, Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine ''Zamana'', who had published Dhanpat Rai's first story \"Duniya Ka Anmol Ratan\" advised the pseudonym \"Premchand\". Dhanpat Rai stopped using the name \"Nawab Rai\" and became Premchand.\n\nIn 1914, Munshi Premchand started writing in Hindi ([[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] are considered different [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of a single language [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], with Hindi drawing much of its vocabulary from Sanskrit and Urdu being more influenced by Persian). By this time, he was already reputed as a fiction writer in Urdu.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> [[Sumit Sarkar]] notes that the switch was prompted by the difficulty of finding publishers in Urdu.<ref name=\"Sarkar1983\">{{cite book|author=Sumit Sarkar|title=Modern India, 1885\u20131947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1uBQgAACAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-90425-1|pages=85\u201386}}</ref> His first Hindi story ''Saut'' was published in the magazine ''[[Saraswati (magazine)|Saraswati]]'' in December 1915, and his first short story collection ''Sapta Saroj'' was published in June 1917.\n\n=== Gorakhpur ===\n[[File:Shilalekh.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorating Munshi Premchand at the hut where he resided in Gorakhpur from 1916 to 1921.]]\nIn August 1916, Premchand was transferred to Gorakhpur on a promotion.

In 1919, Premchand's first major novel ''[[Bazaar-e-Husn|Seva Sadan]]'' was published in [[Hindi]]. The novel was originally written in Urdu under the title ''Bazaar-e-Husn'', but was published in Hindi first by a [[Calcutta]]-based publisher, who offered Premchand {{INR}} 450 for his work. The Urdu Publisher of [[Lahore]] published the novel later in 1924, paying Premchand {{INR}} 250.<ref>{{cite news | title = The power of Premchand (Literary Review of The Oxford India Premchand) | author = Harish Trivedi | newspaper = [[The Hindu]] | date = 2 May 2004 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2004/05/02/stories/2004050200280400.htm }}</ref> The novel tells the story of an unhappy housewife, who first becomes a courtesan, and then manages an orphanage for the young daughters of the courtesans. It was well received by the critics, and helped Premchand gain wider recognition.\n\nIn 1919, Premchand obtained a BA degree from Allahabad.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> By 1921, he had been promoted to Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February 1921, he attended a meeting in Gorakhpur, where [[Mahatma Gandhi]] asked people to resign from government jobs as part of the [[non-cooperation movement]]. Premchand, although physically unwell and with two kids and a pregnant wife to support, thought about it for 5 days and decided, with the consent of his wife, to resign from his government job.\n\n=== Back to Benares ===\nAfter quitting his job, Premchand left Gorakhpur for Benares on 18 March 1921, and decided to focus on his literary career. Till his death in 1936, he faced severe financial difficulties and chronic ill health.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/>\n\nIn 1923, he established a printing press and publishing house in Benares, christened \"Saraswati Press\".<ref name=\"MichaelArbolina2008\"/> The year 1924 saw the publication of Premchand's ''Rangabhumi'', which has a blind beggar called Surdas as its tragic hero. Schulz mentions that in ''Rangabhumi'', Premchand comes across as a \"superb social chronicler\", and although the novel contains some \"structural flaws\" and \"too many authorial explanations\", it shows a \"marked progress\" in Premchand's writing style.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 17}}</ref> According to Schulz, it was in ''Nirmala'' (1925) and ''Pratigya'' (1927) that Premchand found his way to \"a balanced, realistic level\" that surpasses his earlier works and manages to \"hold his readers in tutelage\".<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 18}}</ref> ''Nirmala'', a novel dealing with the [[dowry system in India]], was first serialised in the magazine ''Chand'' between November 1925 and November 1926, before being published as a novel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prakash Chandra Gupta|title=Makers Of Indian Literature Prem Chand|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|date=1998|page=35|isbn=8126004282|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bTUt0PwnCaYC&pg=PA35&dq=Nirmala+Premchand#v=onepage&q=Nirmala%20Premchand&f=false}}</ref> ''Pratigya'' (\"The Vow\") dealt with the subject of widow remarriage.\n\nIn 1928, Premchand's novel ''[[Gaban (novel)|Gaban]]'' (\"Embezzlement\"), focusing on the middle class' greed, was published. In March 1930, Premchand launched a literary-political weekly magazine titled ''Hans'', aimed at inspiring the Indians to mobilise against the British rule.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 50 }}</ref> The magazine, noted for its politically provocative views, failed to make a profit. Premchand then took over and edited another magazine called ''Jagaran'', which too ran at a loss.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 75 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Premchand moved to Kanpur as a teacher in the Marwari College, but had to leave because of difference with the college administration.<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\"/> He then returned to Benares, and became the editor of the ''Maryada'' magazine. In 1932, he published another novel titled ''Karmabhumi''. He briefly served as the headmaster of the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a local school. After the school's closure, he became the editor of the ''Madhuri'' magazine in [[Lucknow]].<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\"/>\n\n=== Bombay ===\nPremchand arrived in [[Bombay]] on 31 May 1934 to try his luck in the [[Hindi film industry]]. He had accepted a script writing job for the production house Ajanta Cinetone, hoping that the yearly salary of {{INR}} 8000 would help him overcome his financial troubles. He stayed in [[Dadar]], and wrote the script for the film ''Mazdoor'' (\"The Labourer\"). The film, directed by Mohan Bhawnani, depicted the poor conditions on the labour class. Premchand himself did a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as the leader of labourers in the film. Some influential businessmen managed to get a stay on its release in Bombay. The film was released in Lahore and Delhi, but was banned again after it inspired the mill workers to stand up against the owners.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\"/>\n\nIronically, the film inspired the workers of his own loss-making press in Benares to launch a strike, after they were not paid their salaries.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\"/> By 1934\u201335, Premchand's Saraswati Press was under a heavy debt of {{INR}} 4000, and Premchand was forced to discontinue the publication of ''Jagaran''. Meanwhile, Premchand was beginning to dislike the non-literary commercial environment of the Bombay film industry, and wanted to return to Benares. However, he had signed a one-year contract with the production house. He ultimately left Bombay on 4 April 1935, before the completion of one year.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 77 }}</ref> [[Himanshu Rai|Himanshu Roy]], the founder of [[Bombay Talkies]], tried to convince Premchand to stay back, but did not succeed.\n\n=== Last days ===\nAfter leaving Bombay, Premchand wanted to settle in [[Allahabad]], where his sons Sripat Rai and [[Amrit kumar Rai]] were studying. He also planned to publish ''Hans'' from there. However, owing to his financial situation and ill-health, he had to hand over ''Hans'' to the Indian Literary Counsel and move to Benares.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 76 }}</ref>\n\nPremchand was elected as the first President of the [[Progressive Writers' Association]] in Lucknow, in 1936.<ref name=\"MichaelArbolina2008\"/><ref name=FLDEC2011>{{cite news|last=MAHAPRASHASTA|first=AJOY ASHIRWAD|title=Writers for change|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2826/stories/20111230282608900.htm|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Frontline|date=30 December 2011}}</ref> He died on 8 October 1936, after several days of sickness and while still in office.\n\n''Godaan upanyas'' (''The Gift of a Cow'', 1936), Premchand's last completed work, is generally accepted as his best novel, and is considered as one of the finest Hindi novels.<ref>[http://www.kalpana.it/eng/writer/indian_writers/phanishwarnath_renu.htm Finest Hindi Novel]</ref> The protagonist, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. According to Schulz, \"Godan is a well-structured and well-balanced novel which amply fulfills the literary requirements postulated by the Western literary standards.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 40}}</ref> Unlike other contemporary renowned authors such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]], Premchand was not appreciated much outside India. Siegfried Schulz believes that the reason for this was absence of good translations of his work. Also, unlike Tagore and [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]], Premchand never travelled outside India, studied abroad or mingled with the renowned foreign literary figures.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 41}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Premchand also published ''Kafaan'' (\"[[Shroud]]\"), in which a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink. Premchand's last published story was ''Cricket Matching'', which appeared in ''Zamana'' in 1938, after his death.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 87 }}</ref>\n\n== Style and influences ==\n[[File:Munshi Premchand half bust statue.jpg|thumb|Bust of Premchand in [[Lamhi]]]]\nPremchand is considered the first [[Hindi]] author whose writings prominently featured [[literary realism|realism]].<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> His novels describe the problems of the poor and the urban middle-class.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> His works depict a rationalistic outlook, which views religious values as something that allows the powerful hypocrites to exploit the weak.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> He used literature for the purpose of arousing public awareness about national and social issues and often wrote about topics related to corruption, child widowhood, prostitution, feudal system, poverty, colonialism and on the Indian freedom movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=India Heritage, Creative Arts, Literature|url=http://indiaheritage.org/creative/litra/p_chand.htm|work=India Heritage, A living portrait of India|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nPremchand started taking an interest in political affairs while at Kanpur during the late 1900s, and this is reflected in his early works, which have patriotic overtones. His political thoughts were initially influenced by the moderate Indian National Congress leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], but later, he moved towards the more extremist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]].<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\"/> He considered the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]] and the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] as inadequate, and supported greater political freedom.<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\"/> Several of his early works, such as ''A Little Trick'' and ''A Moral Victory'', satirised the Indians who cooperated with the British Government. He did not specifically mention the British in some of his stories, because of strong government censorship, but disguised his opposition in settings from the medieval era and the foreign history.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> He was also influenced by the teachings of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_25\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, he was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's non-co-operation movement and the accompanying struggle for social reform. During this period, his works dealt with the social issues such as poverty, zamindari exploitation (''Premashram'', 1922), dowry system (''Nirmala'', 1925), educational reform and political oppression (''Karmabhumi'', 1931).<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> Premchand was focused on the economic liberalisation of the peasantry and the working class, and was opposed to the rapid industrialisation, which he felt would hurt the interests of the peasants and lead to oppression of the workers.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 6 }}</ref> This can be seen in works like ''Rangabhumi'' (1924).\n\nPremchand's influence on Indian literature cannot be overstated. As the late scholar [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]] wrote in ''The World of Premchand'' (Oxford, 2001), \"To Premchand belongs the distinction of creating the genre of the serious short story\u2014and the serious novel as well\u2014in both Hindi and Urdu. Virtually single-handed he lifted fiction in these languages from a quagmire of aimless romantic chronicles to a high level of realistic narrative comparable to European fiction of the time; and in both languages, he has, in addition, remained an unsurpassed master.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rubin|first=David|title=The World of Premchand|publisher=Oxford University Press (India)|date=2001|isbn= 0195657721}}</ref>\n\nIn his last days, he focused on village life as a stage for complex drama, as seen in the novel ''Godan'' (1936) and the short-story collection ''Kafan'' (1936).<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> Premchand believed that [[social realism]] was the way for Hindi literature, as opposed to the \"feminine quality\", tenderness and emotion of the contemporary [[Bengali literature]].<ref name=\"Sheldon2003\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn 31 July 2016, Google showed a Google doodle in honouring 136th birthday of Premchand.<ref name=\"Desk 2016\">{{cite news | last=Desk | first=Internet | title=Google doodle celebrates Munshi Premchand's Birth anniversary | newspaper=The Hindu | date=31 July 2016 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/Google-doodle-celebrates-Munshi-Premchand%E2%80%99s-Birth-anniversary/article14518405.ece | access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== List of works ==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2012}}\nPremchand wrote over three hundred short stories and fourteen novels, many essays and letters, plays and translations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lal|first=Anupa|title=THE PREMCHAND READER Selected Stories 1}}</ref> Many of Premchand's works were translated into English and Russian after his death.\n\n=== Novels ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

''Sadgati'' (\"Salvation\" or \"Deliverance\") is a short story revolving around poor Dukhi, who dies of exhaustion while hewing wood for a paltry favour. ''Shatranj ke Khiladi'' (The [[Chess]] Players) revolved around the decadence of [[nawab]]i [[Lucknow]], where the obsession with a game consumes the players, making them oblivious of their responsibilities in the midst of a crisis.\n\n[[Sevasadanam]] (first published in 1918) was made into a film with [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] in the lead role. The novel is set in [[Varanasi]], the holy city of [[Hindu]]s. ''Sevasadan'' (\"House of Service\") is an institute built for the daughters of courtesans. The lead of the novel is a beautiful, intelligent and talented girl called Suman. She belongs to a high [[caste]]. She is married to a much older, tyrannical man. She realises that a loveless marriage is just like prostitution except that there is only one client. Bholi, a courtesan, lives opposite Suman. Suman realises that Bholi is \"outside [[purdah]]\", while she is \"inside it\". Suman leaves her husband and becomes a successful entertainer of gentlemen. But after a brief period of success, she ends up as a victim of a political drama played out by self-righteous Hindu social reformers and moralists.\n\n''The Actor Factor Theatre Company'', a young Delhi based theatre group, staged ''Kafan'' in 2010 in New Delhi. It is an original stage adaptation of Premchand's short story. Kafan is a dark comedy. In the play, puppetry is explored to depict the tussle between two classes and the plight of Budhia, who is caught in the crossfire. Bleakness of hope in the story and awfulness of the father-son duo find a delicate balance. At times the situations break into morbid humour. In the end a wine-house becomes the stage for Ghisu (father) and Madhav's (son) rebellious dance, defying not only the laws of the land but also that of the Gods.\n\n''Oka Oori Katha'' (English title: A Story of a village; Telugu: \u0c12\u0c15 \u0c0a\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c25) is a 1977 [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film directed by [[Mrinal Sen]]. It is based on the story Kafan by Munshi Premchand. It is one of the few Art films made in Telugu language.\n\nDramatech, a 28-year-old amateur theatre group in Delhi, staged Premchand: Three Comedies for Families and Children, at Sri Ram Centre, Delhi in August, September and October 2012. The stories by Premchand included Do bailon ki katha; Shatranj ke khiladi; Nimantran. The stories were dramatised and directed by Ravi Raj Sagar.\n\nA film version of Premchand's novel, [[Gaban (1966 film)|Gaban]], was released in 1966.  [[Sunil Dutt]], [[Sadhana Shivdasani]], [[Kanhaiyalal (actor)|Kanhaiyalal]] and [[Leela Mishra]] acted in the film and the music was scored by musician duo [[Shankar Jaikishan]].\n\nThere are Several

Swan, Duke University Press, 1969</ref> His novels include ''[[Godaan]]'', ''[[Karmabhoomi]]'', ''[[Gaban (novel)|Gaban]]'', ''[[Mansarovar]]'', ''[[Idgah (short story)|Idgah]]''. He published his first collection of five short stories in 1907 in a book called ''Soz-e Watan''.\n\nHe began writing under the pen name \"Nawab Rai\", but subsequently switched to \"Premchand\", [[Munshi]] being an honorary prefix. A novel writer, story writer and dramatist, he has been referred to as the \"''Upanyas Samrat''\" (\"Emperor among Novelists\") by writers. His works include more than a dozen novels, around 300 short stories, several essays and translations of a number of foreign literary works into Hindi.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nMunshi Premchand was born on 31 July 1880 in [[Lamhi]], a village located near [[Varanasi]] (Benares) and was named Dhanpat Rai (\"master of wealth\"). His ancestors came from a large [[Kayastha]] family, which owned eight to nine [[bigha]]s of land.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gupta|1998|p=7}}</ref> His grandfather, Guru Sahai Rai was a [[patwari]] (village land record-keeper), and his father Ajaib Rai was a post office clerk. His mother was Anandi Devi of Karauni village, who  probably was also his inspiration for the character Anandi in his ''Bade Ghar Ki Beti''.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 7 }}</ref> Dhanpat Rai was the fourth child of Ajaib Lal and Anandi; the first two were girls who died as infants, and the third one was a girl named Suggi.<ref name=\"Sigi 2006 15\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 15}}</ref> His uncle, Mahabir, a rich landowner, nicknamed him \"[[Nawab]]\" (\"Prince\"). \"Nawab Rai\" was the first pen name chosen by Dhanpat Rai.<ref name=amrit>''Premchand: A Life'', Amrit Rai (Harish Tirvedi, translator), People's Publishing House, New Delhi, 1982.</ref>\n\n[[File:Lamhi, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|right|Munshi Premchand Memorial Gate, Lamhi, Varanasi]]\n\nWhen he was 7 years old, Dhanpat Rai began his education at a [[madrasa]] in Lalpur, located near Lamahi.<ref name=\"Sigi 2006 15\"/> He learnt Urdu and [[Persian language|Persian]] from a [[maulvi]] in the madrasa. When he was 8, his mother died after a long illness. His grandmother, who took the responsibility of raising him, died soon after.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\">{{cite web |url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2001/fjul2001/f190720011.html | title = Munshi Premchand: The Great Novelist | accessdate = 13 January 2012 | publisher = Press Information Bureau, Government of India }}</ref> Premchand felt isolated, as his elder sister had already been married, and his father was always busy with work. His father, who was now posted at Gorakhpur, remarried, but Premchand received little affection from his stepmother. The [[stepmother]] later became a recurring theme in Premchand's works.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 10 }}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Dhanpat Rai sought solace in fiction, and developed a fascination for books. He heard the stories from the Persian-language fantasy epic ''Tilism-e-Hoshruba'' at a [[tobacconist]]'s shop. He took the job of selling books for a book wholesaler, thus getting the opportunity to read a lot of books.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 16}}</ref> He learnt English at a missionary school, and studied several works of fiction including [[George W. M. Reynolds]]'s eight-volume ''[[The Mysteries of the Court of London]]''.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\"/> He composed his first literary work at [[Gorakhpur]], which was never published and is now lost. It was a farce on a bachelor, who falls in love with a [[Indian caste system|low-caste]] woman. The character was based on Premchand's uncle, who used to scold him for being obsessed with reading fiction; the farce was probably written as a revenge for this.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\"/>\n\nAfter his father was posted to Jamniya in the mid-1890s, Dhanpat Rai enrolled at the Queen's College at Benares as a [[day scholar]].<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_11\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 11 }}</ref><ref name=\"Sigi_2006_17\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 17}}</ref> In 1895, he was married at the age of 15, while still studying in the ninth grade. The match was [[arranged marriage|arranged]] by his maternal step-grandfather. The girl was from a rich landlord family and was older than Premchand, who found her quarrelsome and not good-looking.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_11\"/><ref name=\"Sigi_2006_17\"/>\n\nHis father died in 1897 after a long illness. He managed to pass the [[matriculation exam]] with second division (below 60% marks). However, only the students with first division were given fee concession at the Queen's College. He then sought admission at the [[Central Hindu College]], but was unsuccessful because of his poor arithmetic skills.<ref name = \"Gupta_1998_12\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 12 }}</ref> Thus, he had to discontinue his studies. He then obtained an assignment to coach an advocate's son in Benares at a monthly salary of five rupees. He used to reside in a mud-cell over the advocate's stables, and used to send 60% of his salary back home.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_12\"/> Premchand read a lot during these days. After racking up several debts, in 1899, he once went to a book shop to sell one of his collected books. There, he met the headmaster of a missionary school at [[Chunar]], who offered him a job as a teacher, at a monthly salary of {{INR}} 18.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_12\"/> He also took up the job of tutoring a student at a monthly fees of {{INR}} 5.\n\nIn 1900, Premchand secured a job as an assistant teacher at the Government District School, [[Bahraich]], at a monthly salary of {{INR}} 20. Three months later, he was transferred to the District School in [[Pratapgarh, Uttar Pradesh|Pratapgarh]], where he stayed in an administrator's bungalow and tutored his son.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 20 }}</ref>\n\nDhanpat Rai first wrote under the pseudonym \"Nawab Rai\". His first short novel was ''Asrar e Ma'abid'' (\"Secrets of God's Abode\", ''Devasthan Rahasya'' in Hindi), which explores corruption among the [[mahant|temple priests]] and their sexual exploitation of poor women. The novel was published in a series in the Benares-based Urdu weekly ''Awaz-e-Khalk'' from 8 October 1903 to February 1905.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 13 }}</ref> Literary critic Siegfried Schulz states that \"his inexperience is quite evident in his first novel\", which is not well-organized, lacks a good plot and features stereotyped characters.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 16}}</ref> [[P. C. Gupta|Prakash Chandra Gupta]] calls it an \"immature work\", which shows a tendency to \"see life only white or black\".<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\n=== Stay at Kanpur ===\nFrom Pratapgarh, Dhanpat Rai was relocated to [[Allahabad]] for training, and subsequently posted at Kanpur in 1905. He stayed in Kanpur for around four years, from May 1905 to June 1909. There he met Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine ''Zamana'', in which he later published several articles and stories.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\nPremchand visited his village Lamahi during the summer vacation, but did not find the stay enjoyable because of a number of reasons. He did not find the weather or the atmosphere conducive for writing. Plus, he faced domestic trouble due to quarrels between his wife and his step-mother. Premchand angrily scolded his wife, after she unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide by hanging. Dismayed, she went to her father's house, and Premchand displayed no interest in bringing her back.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 14 }}</ref> In 1906, Premchand married a child widow, Shivarani Devi, who was the daughter of a landlord from a village near [[Fatehpur, Uttar Pradesh|Fatehpur]].<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\">{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Illustrated Weekly of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2UnQES-79gC|accessdate=17 May 2019|year=1984|publisher=Published for the proprietors, Bennett, Coleman & Company, Limited, at the Times of India Press|pages=68\u201369}}</ref> The step was considered to be revolutionary at that time, and Premchand faced a lot of social opposition. After his death, Shivarani Devi wrote a book on him, titled ''Premchand Ghar Mein'' (\"Premchand in House\").\n\nIn 1905, inspired by the [[Indian independence movement|nationalist activism]], Premchand published an article on the Indian National Congress leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]] in ''Zamana''. He criticised Gokhale's methods for achieving political freedom, and instead recommended adoption of more extremist measures adopted by [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]].<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 24 }}</ref> Premchand's first published story was ''Duniya Ka Sabse Anmol Ratan'' (\"The Most Precious Jewel in the World\"), which appeared in ''Zamana'' in 1907.<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\">{{cite book | author=Dr. Girirajsharan Agarwal | title=Premchand : Karam Bhoomi (Abhyas Pustika) | year = 2001 | publisher=Diamond | isbn=978-81-7182-328-4 | language = Hindi | pages = 5\u20139 }}</ref> According to this story, the most precious 'jewel' was the last drop of blood necessary to attain independence.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_25\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 25 }}</ref> Many of Premchand's early short stories had patriotic overtones, influenced by the Indian independence movement.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/>\n\nPremchand's second short novel ''Hamkhurma-o-Hamsavab'' (''Prema'' in [[Hindi]]), published in 1907, was penned under the name \"Babu Nawab Rai Banarsi\". It explores the issue of [[widow remarriage]] in the contemporary conservative society: the protagonist Amrit Rai overcomes social opposition to marry the young widow Poorna, giving up his rich and beautiful fianc\u00e9e Prema. According to Prakash Chandra Gupta, \"while containing seeds of his future greatness in many ways, the novel is still youthful and lacks the discipline which full maturity brings\".<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/>\n\nIn 1907, another of Premchand's short novels, ''Kishna'' was published by the Medical Hall Press of Benares. This 142-page work, which satirises women's fondness for jewellery, is now lost.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_13\"/> Literary critic Nobat Rai criticised the work in ''Zamana'', calling it a mockery of the women's conditions.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_26\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 26 }}</ref>\n\nDuring April\u2013August 1907, Premchand's story ''Roothi Rani'' was published in [[serial (literature)|serial form]] in ''Zamana''.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_26\"/> Also in 1907, the publishers of ''Zamana'' published Premchand's first short story collection, titled ''Soz-e-Watan''. The collection, which was later banned, contained four stories which sought to inspire the Indians in their struggle for political freedom.<ref name=\"Mohan2006\">{{cite book|author=Mohan Lal | title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Five: Sasay To Zorgot) | year = 2006 | publisher=[[Sahitya Akademi]] | isbn=978-81-260-1221-3 | page=4149}}</ref>\n\n==== Adoption of the name Premchand ====\nIn 1909, Premchand was transferred to [[Mahoba]], and later posted to [[Hamirpur district, Uttar Pradesh|Hamirpur]] as the Sub-deputy Inspector of Schools.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 27 }}</ref> Around this time, ''Soz-e-Watan'' was noticed by the British Government officials, who banned it as a seditious work. The British collector of the Hamirpur District ordered a raid on Premchand's house, where around five hundred copies of ''Soz-e-Watan'' were burnt.<ref name=\"SahniPaliwal1980\">{{cite book | author1=Bhisham Sahni | author2=Om Prakash Paliwal | title=Premchand: a tribute | year=1980 | publisher=Premchand Centenary Celebrations Committee }}</ref> After this, Munshi Daya Narain Nigam, the editor of the Urdu magazine ''Zamana'', who had published Dhanpat Rai's first story \"Duniya Ka Anmol Ratan\" advised the pseudonym \"Premchand\". Dhanpat Rai stopped using the name \"Nawab Rai\" and became Premchand.\n\nIn 1914, Munshi Premchand started writing in Hindi ([[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]] are considered different [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] of a single language [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], with Hindi drawing much of its vocabulary from Sanskrit and Urdu being more influenced by Persian). By this time, he was already reputed as a fiction writer in Urdu.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> [[Sumit Sarkar]] notes that the switch was prompted by the difficulty of finding publishers in Urdu.<ref name=\"Sarkar1983\">{{cite book|author=Sumit Sarkar|title=Modern India, 1885\u20131947|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1uBQgAACAAJ|year=1983|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-333-90425-1|pages=85\u201386}}</ref> His first Hindi story ''Saut'' was published in the magazine ''[[Saraswati (magazine)|Saraswati]]'' in December 1915, and his first short story collection ''Sapta Saroj'' was published in June 1917.\n\n=== Gorakhpur ===\n[[File:Shilalekh.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorating Munshi Premchand at the hut where he resided in Gorakhpur from 1916 to 1921.]]\nIn August 1916, Premchand was transferred to Gorakhpur on a promotion. He became the Assistant Master at the Normal High School, [[Gorakhpur]].<ref name=\"Madan1964\">{{cite book | author=Madan Gopal | title=Munshi Premchand: a literary biography | year=1964 | publisher=Asia Pub. House | pages = 114\u2013117 }}</ref>\n\nAt Gorakhpur, he developed a friendship with the bookseller Buddhi Lal, who allowed him to borrow novels for reading, in exchange for selling exam cram books at the school.<ref name=\"Gupta_1998_10\"/> Premchand was an enthusiastic reader of classics in other languages, and translated several of these works in Hindi.\n\nBy 1919, Premchand had published four novels, of about a hundred pages each. In 1919, Premchand's first major novel ''[[Bazaar-e-Husn|Seva Sadan]]'' was published in [[Hindi]]. The novel was originally written in Urdu under the title ''Bazaar-e-Husn'', but was published in Hindi first by a [[Calcutta]]-based publisher, who offered Premchand {{INR}} 450 for his work. The Urdu Publisher of [[Lahore]] published the novel later in 1924, paying Premchand {{INR}} 250.<ref>{{cite news | title = The power of Premchand (Literary Review of The Oxford India Premchand) | author = Harish Trivedi | newspaper = [[The Hindu]] | date = 2 May 2004 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/lr/2004/05/02/stories/2004050200280400.htm }}</ref> The novel tells the story of an unhappy housewife, who first becomes a courtesan, and then manages an orphanage for the young daughters of the courtesans. It was well received by the critics, and helped Premchand gain wider recognition.\n\nIn 1919, Premchand obtained a BA degree from Allahabad.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> By 1921, he had been promoted to Deputy Inspectors of Schools. On 8 February 1921, he attended a meeting in Gorakhpur, where [[Mahatma Gandhi]] asked people to resign from government jobs as part of the [[non-cooperation movement]]. Premchand, although physically unwell and with two kids and a pregnant wife to support, thought about it for 5 days and decided, with the consent of his wife, to resign from his government job.\n\n=== Back to Benares ===\nAfter quitting his job, Premchand left Gorakhpur for Benares on 18 March 1921, and decided to focus on his literary career. Till his death in 1936, he faced severe financial difficulties and chronic ill health.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/>\n\nIn 1923, he established a printing press and publishing house in Benares, christened \"Saraswati Press\".<ref name=\"MichaelArbolina2008\"/> The year 1924 saw the publication of Premchand's ''Rangabhumi'', which has a blind beggar called Surdas as its tragic hero. Schulz mentions that in ''Rangabhumi'', Premchand comes across as a \"superb social chronicler\", and although the novel contains some \"structural flaws\" and \"too many authorial explanations\", it shows a \"marked progress\" in Premchand's writing style.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 17}}</ref> According to Schulz, it was in ''Nirmala'' (1925) and ''Pratigya'' (1927) that Premchand found his way to \"a balanced, realistic level\" that surpasses his earlier works and manages to \"hold his readers in tutelage\".<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 18}}</ref> ''Nirmala'', a novel dealing with the [[dowry system in India]], was first serialised in the magazine ''Chand'' between November 1925 and November 1926, before being published as a novel.<ref>{{cite book|last=Prakash Chandra Gupta|title=Makers Of Indian Literature Prem Chand|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|date=1998|page=35|isbn=8126004282|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bTUt0PwnCaYC&pg=PA35&dq=Nirmala+Premchand#v=onepage&q=Nirmala%20Premchand&f=false}}</ref> ''Pratigya'' (\"The Vow\") dealt with the subject of widow remarriage.\n\nIn 1928, Premchand's novel ''[[Gaban (novel)|Gaban]]'' (\"Embezzlement\"), focusing on the middle class' greed, was published. In March 1930, Premchand launched a literary-political weekly magazine titled ''Hans'', aimed at inspiring the Indians to mobilise against the British rule.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 50 }}</ref> The magazine, noted for its politically provocative views, failed to make a profit. Premchand then took over and edited another magazine called ''Jagaran'', which too ran at a loss.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\">{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 75 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1931, Premchand moved to Kanpur as a teacher in the Marwari College, but had to leave because of difference with the college administration.<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\"/> He then returned to Benares, and became the editor of the ''Maryada'' magazine. In 1932, he published another novel titled ''Karmabhumi''. He briefly served as the headmaster of the Kashi Vidyapeeth, a local school. After the school's closure, he became the editor of the ''Madhuri'' magazine in [[Lucknow]].<ref name=\"Giriraj2001\"/>\n\n=== Bombay ===\nPremchand arrived in [[Bombay]] on 31 May 1934 to try his luck in the [[Hindi film industry]]. He had accepted a script writing job for the production house Ajanta Cinetone, hoping that the yearly salary of {{INR}} 8000 would help him overcome his financial troubles. He stayed in [[Dadar]], and wrote the script for the film ''Mazdoor'' (\"The Labourer\"). The film, directed by Mohan Bhawnani, depicted the poor conditions on the labour class. Premchand himself did a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] as the leader of labourers in the film. Some influential businessmen managed to get a stay on its release in Bombay. The film was released in Lahore and Delhi, but was banned again after it inspired the mill workers to stand up against the owners.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\"/>\n\nIronically, the film inspired the workers of his own loss-making press in Benares to launch a strike, after they were not paid their salaries.<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_75\"/> By 1934\u201335, Premchand's Saraswati Press was under a heavy debt of {{INR}} 4000, and Premchand was forced to discontinue the publication of ''Jagaran''. Meanwhile, Premchand was beginning to dislike the non-literary commercial environment of the Bombay film industry, and wanted to return to Benares. However, he had signed a one-year contract with the production house. He ultimately left Bombay on 4 April 1935, before the completion of one year.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 77 }}</ref> [[Himanshu Rai|Himanshu Roy]], the founder of [[Bombay Talkies]], tried to convince Premchand to stay back, but did not succeed.\n\n=== Last days ===\nAfter leaving Bombay, Premchand wanted to settle in [[Allahabad]], where his sons Sripat Rai and [[Amrit kumar Rai]] were studying. He also planned to publish ''Hans'' from there. However, owing to his financial situation and ill-health, he had to hand over ''Hans'' to the Indian Literary Counsel and move to Benares.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 76 }}</ref>\n\nPremchand was elected as the first President of the [[Progressive Writers' Association]] in Lucknow, in 1936.<ref name=\"MichaelArbolina2008\"/><ref name=FLDEC2011>{{cite news|last=MAHAPRASHASTA|first=AJOY ASHIRWAD|title=Writers for change|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2826/stories/20111230282608900.htm|accessdate=8 January 2013|newspaper=Frontline|date=30 December 2011}}</ref> He died on 8 October 1936, after several days of sickness and while still in office.\n\n''Godaan upanyas'' (''The Gift of a Cow'', 1936), Premchand's last completed work, is generally accepted as his best novel, and is considered as one of the finest Hindi novels.<ref>[http://www.kalpana.it/eng/writer/indian_writers/phanishwarnath_renu.htm Finest Hindi Novel]</ref> The protagonist, Hori, a poor peasant, desperately longs for a cow, a symbol of wealth and prestige in rural India. According to Schulz, \"Godan is a well-structured and well-balanced novel which amply fulfills the literary requirements postulated by the Western literary standards.\"<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 40}}</ref> Unlike other contemporary renowned authors such as [[Rabindranath Tagore]], Premchand was not appreciated much outside India. Siegfried Schulz believes that the reason for this was absence of good translations of his work. Also, unlike Tagore and [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]], Premchand never travelled outside India, studied abroad or mingled with the renowned foreign literary figures.<ref>{{Harvnb | Schulz | 1981 | p = 41}}</ref>\n\nIn 1936, Premchand also published ''Kafaan'' (\"[[Shroud]]\"), in which a poor man collects money for the funeral rites of his dead wife, but spends it on food and drink. Premchand's last published story was ''Cricket Matching'', which appeared in ''Zamana'' in 1938, after his death.<ref>{{Harvnb | Sigi | 2006 | p = 87 }}</ref>\n\n== Style and influences ==\n[[File:Munshi Premchand half bust statue.jpg|thumb|Bust of Premchand in [[Lamhi]]]]\nPremchand is considered the first [[Hindi]] author whose writings prominently featured [[literary realism|realism]].<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> His novels describe the problems of the poor and the urban middle-class.<ref name=\"pib_2001_great\"/> His works depict a rationalistic outlook, which views religious values as something that allows the powerful hypocrites to exploit the weak.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> He used literature for the purpose of arousing public awareness about national and social issues and often wrote about topics related to corruption, child widowhood, prostitution, feudal system, poverty, colonialism and on the Indian freedom movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=India Heritage, Creative Arts, Literature|url=http://indiaheritage.org/creative/litra/p_chand.htm|work=India Heritage, A living portrait of India|accessdate=8 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nPremchand started taking an interest in political affairs while at Kanpur during the late 1900s, and this is reflected in his early works, which have patriotic overtones. His political thoughts were initially influenced by the moderate Indian National Congress leader [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], but later, he moved towards the more extremist [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]].<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\"/> He considered the [[Minto-Morley Reforms]] and the [[Montagu\u2013Chelmsford Reforms]] as inadequate, and supported greater political freedom.<ref name=\"Gupta 1998 17\"/> Several of his early works, such as ''A Little Trick'' and ''A Moral Victory'', satirised the Indians who cooperated with the British Government. He did not specifically mention the British in some of his stories, because of strong government censorship, but disguised his opposition in settings from the medieval era and the foreign history.<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> He was also influenced by the teachings of [[Swami Vivekananda]].<ref name=\"Sigi_2006_25\"/>\n\nIn the 1920s, he was influenced by Mahatma Gandhi's non-co-operation movement and the accompanying struggle for social reform. During this period, his works dealt with the social issues such as poverty, zamindari exploitation (''Premashram'', 1922), dowry system (''Nirmala'', 1925), educational reform and political oppression (''Karmabhumi'', 1931).<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> Premchand was focused on the economic liberalisation of the peasantry and the working class, and was opposed to the rapid industrialisation, which he felt would hurt the interests of the peasants and lead to oppression of the workers.<ref>{{Harvnb | Gupta | 1998 | p = 6 }}</ref> This can be seen in works like ''Rangabhumi'' (1924).\n\nPremchand's influence on Indian literature cannot be overstated. As the late scholar [[David Rubin (author)|David Rubin]] wrote in ''The World of Premchand'' (Oxford, 2001), \"To Premchand belongs the distinction of creating the genre of the serious short story\u2014and the serious novel as well\u2014in both Hindi and Urdu. Virtually single-handed he lifted fiction in these languages from a quagmire of aimless romantic chronicles to a high level of realistic narrative comparable to European fiction of the time; and in both languages, he has, in addition, remained an unsurpassed master.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Rubin|first=David|title=The World of Premchand|publisher=Oxford University Press (India)|date=2001|isbn= 0195657721}}</ref>\n\nIn his last days, he focused on village life as a stage for complex drama, as seen in the novel ''Godan'' (1936) and the short-story collection ''Kafan'' (1936).<ref name=\"DavidRubin1994\"/> Premchand believed that [[social realism]] was the way for Hindi literature, as opposed to the \"feminine quality\", tenderness and emotion of the contemporary [[Bengali literature]].<ref name=\"Sheldon2003\"/>\n\n== Legacy ==\nOn 31 July 2016, Google showed a Google doodle in honouring 136th birthday of Premchand.<ref name=\"Desk 2016\">{{cite news | last=Desk | first=Internet | title=Google doodle celebrates Munshi Premchand's Birth anniversary | newspaper=The Hindu | date=31 July 2016 | url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/technology/internet/Google-doodle-celebrates-Munshi-Premchand%E2%80%99s-Birth-anniversary/article14518405.ece | access-date=3 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n== List of works ==\n{{Expand list|date=February 2012}}\nPremchand wrote over three hundred short stories and fourteen novels, many essays and letters, plays and translations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lal|first=Anupa|title=THE PREMCHAND READER Selected Stories 1}}</ref> Many of Premchand's works were translated into English and Russian after his death.\n\n=== Novels ===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n!

''Sadgati'' (\"Salvation\" or \"Deliverance\") is a short story revolving around poor Dukhi, who dies of exhaustion while hewing wood for a paltry favour. ''Shatranj ke Khiladi'' (The [[Chess]] Players) revolved around the decadence of [[nawab]]i [[Lucknow]], where the obsession with a game consumes the players, making them oblivious of their responsibilities in the midst of a crisis.\n\n[[Sevasadanam]] (first published in 1918) was made into a film with [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]] in the lead role. The novel is set in [[Varanasi]], the holy city of [[Hindu]]s. ''Sevasadan'' (\"House of Service\") is an institute built for the daughters of courtesans. The lead of the novel is a beautiful, intelligent and talented girl called Suman. She belongs to a high [[caste]]. She is married to a much older, tyrannical man. She realises that a loveless marriage is just like prostitution except that there is only one client. Bholi, a courtesan, lives opposite Suman. Suman realises that Bholi is \"outside [[purdah]]\", while she is \"inside it\". Suman leaves her husband and becomes a successful entertainer of gentlemen. But after a brief period of success, she ends up as a victim of a political drama played out by self-righteous Hindu social reformers and moralists.\n\n''The Actor Factor Theatre Company'', a young Delhi based theatre group, staged ''Kafan'' in 2010 in New Delhi. It is an original stage adaptation of Premchand's short story. Kafan is a dark comedy. In the play, puppetry is explored to depict the tussle between two classes and the plight of Budhia, who is caught in the crossfire. Bleakness of hope in the story and awfulness of the father-son duo find a delicate balance. At times the situations break into morbid humour. In the end a wine-house becomes the stage for Ghisu (father) and Madhav's (son) rebellious dance, defying not only the laws of the land but also that of the Gods.\n\n''Oka Oori Katha'' (English title: A Story of a village; Telugu: \u0c12\u0c15 \u0c0a\u0c30\u0c3f \u0c15\u0c25) is a 1977 [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film directed by [[Mrinal Sen]]. It is based on the story Kafan by Munshi Premchand. It is one of the few Art films made in Telugu language.\n\nDramatech, a 28-year-old amateur theatre group in Delhi, staged Premchand: Three Comedies for Families and Children, at Sri Ram Centre, Delhi in August, September and October 2012.

At the age of two, he contracted [[pertussis|whooping cough]]. A black doctor, Jackson, came to his parents' farm, and told his parents he didn't expect David to live, but nonetheless spent the day with him, and told his parents how to give him the best chance he could. Satcher said that he grew up hearing that story, and that inspired him to be a doctor.<ref>{{cite interview | subject=David Satcher | interviewer=Tavis Smiley | title= | url=http://www.tavissmileyradio.com/ | work=The Tavis Smiley Show | date=16 March 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nSatcher graduated from [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta]] in 1963 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He received his [[M.D.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in Cell Biology from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1970 with election to [[Alpha Omega Alpha]] Honor Society. He completed residency/fellowship training at the [[Strong Memorial Hospital]], [[University of Rochester]], [[UCLA School of Medicine]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital]]. He is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American College of Preventive Medicine]], and the [[American College of Physicians]], and is Board Certified in Preventive Medicine. Satcher pledged [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity and is an initiate at the Psi chapter of [[Morehouse College]].\n\n===Career===\n\nSatcher served as professor and Chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] from 1979 to 1982. He is a former faculty member of the [[UCLA School of Medicine]], the [[UCLA School of Public Health]], and the [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital|King-Drew Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], where he developed and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. From 1975 to 1979, he served as the interim Dean of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital|Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School]], during which time, he negotiated the agreement with UCLA School of Medicine and the Board of Regents that led to a medical education program at King-Drew. He also directed the King-Drew [[Sickle cell|Sickle Cell]] Research Center for six years. Satcher served as President of [[Meharry Medical College]] in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1982 to 1993. He also held the posts of Director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 1993 to 1998.\n\n====Surgeon General ====\n[[Image:VADM David Satcher.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Vice Admiral David Satcher, USPHS]]\nSatcher served simultaneously in the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 through January 2001 at the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]].  As such, he is the first Surgeon General to be appointed as a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] in the [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|PHSCC]], to reflect his dual offices.\n\nIn his first year as Surgeon General, Satcher released the 1998 Surgeon General's report, \"Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups.\"  In it he reported that tobacco use was on the rise among youth in each of the country's major racial and ethnic groups threatening their long-term health prospects.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Surgeon General's Report Warns of HEalth Reversals as Minority Teen Smoking Increases | url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1998pres/980427.html | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=27 April 1998 | accessdate=2008-01-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923025212/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1998pres/980427.html | archivedate=September 23, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSatcher was appointed by [[Bill Clinton]], and remained Surgeon General until 2002, contemporaneously with the first half of the first term of President [[George W. Bush]]'s administration. Eve Slater would later replace him as Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. Because he no longer held his dual office, Satcher was reverted and downgraded to the grade of [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in the regular corps for the remainder of his term as Surgeon General. In 2001, his office released the report, ''The Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior''. The report was hailed by the chairman of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] as an overdue paradigm shift\u2014\"The only way we're going to change approaches to sexual behavior and sexual activity is through school. In school, not only at the doctor's office.\" However, conservative political groups denounced the report as being too permissive towards [[homosexuality]] and condom distribution in schools. When Satcher left office, he retired with the rank of vice admiral.\n\n==== Post\u2013Surgeon General ====\nUpon his departure from the post, Satcher became a fellow at the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]. In the fall of 2002, he assumed the post of Director of the National Center for Primary Care at the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]].\n\nOn December 20, 2004, Satcher was named interim president at [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] until [[John E. Maupin, Jr.]], former president of [[Meharry Medical College]] assumed the current position on February 26, 2006. In June 2006, Satcher established the Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) at Morehouse School of Medicine as a natural extension of his experiences improving public health policy for all Americans and his commitment to eliminating health disparities for minorities, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups.\n\nIn 2013, he co-founded the advocacy group [[African American]] Network Against [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]].\n\nHe now{{when|date=May 2017}} sits on the boards of [[Johnson & Johnson]] and [[MetLife]].\n\n==== Criticisms of health inequality ====\nWhile acknowledging progress, Satcher has criticized health disparities. He asked the question, \u201cWhat if we had eliminated disparities in health in the last century?\u201d and calculated that there would have been 83,500 fewer black deaths in the year 2000. That would have included 24,000 fewer black deaths from cardiovascular disease. If infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer black infants would have died in their first year of life.\n\nWithout disparities, there would have been 22,000 fewer black deaths from diabetes and almost 2,000 fewer black women would have died from breast cancer; 250,000 fewer blacks would have been infected with HIV/AIDS and 7,000 fewer blacks would have died from complications due to AIDS in 2000. As many as 2.5 million additional blacks, including 650,000 children, would have had health insurance in that year. He called on people to work for solutions at the individual, community, and policy level.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Satcher | first=David | title=Ethnic Disparities in Health: The Public's Role in Working for Equality | journal=PLoS Med | volume=3 | issue=10 | pages=e405 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030405 | date=October 24, 2006 | url=http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/socialmedicine-2006.php | accessdate=January 17, 2008 | pmid=17076554 | pmc=1621093 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125152816/http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/socialmedicine-2006.php | archivedate=January 25, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSatcher supports a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]-for-all style [[single payer health care|single payer health plan]], in which insurance companies would be eliminated and the government would pay health care costs directly to doctors, hospitals and other providers through the tax system.<ref>{{cite press release | title= Physicians Propose Solution to Rising Health Care Costs and Uninsured | url=http://www.pnhp.org/news/2003/february/physicians_propose_s.php | publisher=Physicians for a National Health Program | date=February 12, 2003| accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, while President of Meharry Medical College, Satcher founded a quarterly [[academic journal]] entitled the ''[[Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved]]''.

He was a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] in the [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] and served as the 10th [[Assistant Secretary for Health]], and the 16th [[Surgeon General of the United States]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n=== Early years===\nSatcher was born in [[Anniston, Alabama]]. At the age of two, he contracted [[pertussis|whooping cough]]. A black doctor, Jackson, came to his parents' farm, and told his parents he didn't expect David to live, but nonetheless spent the day with him, and told his parents how to give him the best chance he could. Satcher said that he grew up hearing that story, and that inspired him to be a doctor.<ref>{{cite interview | subject=David Satcher | interviewer=Tavis Smiley | title= | url=http://www.tavissmileyradio.com/ | work=The Tavis Smiley Show | date=16 March 2008 | accessdate=2008-01-17}}</ref>\n\nSatcher graduated from [[Morehouse College]] in [[Atlanta]] in 1963 and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. He received his [[M.D.]] and [[Ph.D.]] in Cell Biology from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1970 with election to [[Alpha Omega Alpha]] Honor Society. He completed residency/fellowship training at the [[Strong Memorial Hospital]], [[University of Rochester]], [[UCLA School of Medicine]], and [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital]]. He is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American College of Preventive Medicine]], and the [[American College of Physicians]], and is Board Certified in Preventive Medicine. Satcher pledged [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity and is an initiate at the Psi chapter of [[Morehouse College]].\n\n===Career===\n\nSatcher served as professor and Chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] from 1979 to 1982. He is a former faculty member of the [[UCLA School of Medicine]], the [[UCLA School of Public Health]], and the [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital|King-Drew Medical Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], where he developed and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. From 1975 to 1979, he served as the interim Dean of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.-Harbor Hospital|Charles R. Drew Postgraduate Medical School]], during which time, he negotiated the agreement with UCLA School of Medicine and the Board of Regents that led to a medical education program at King-Drew. He also directed the King-Drew [[Sickle cell|Sickle Cell]] Research Center for six years. Satcher served as President of [[Meharry Medical College]] in Nashville, Tennessee, from 1982 to 1993. He also held the posts of Director of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and Administrator of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry from 1993 to 1998.\n\n====Surgeon General ====\n[[Image:VADM David Satcher.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Vice Admiral David Satcher, USPHS]]\nSatcher served simultaneously in the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health from February 1998 through January 2001 at the [[US Department of Health and Human Services]].  As such, he is the first Surgeon General to be appointed as a four-star [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] in the [[Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|PHSCC]], to reflect his dual offices.\n\nIn his first year as Surgeon General, Satcher released the 1998 Surgeon General's report, \"Tobacco Use Among U.S. Racial/Ethnic Minority Groups.\"  In it he reported that tobacco use was on the rise among youth in each of the country's major racial and ethnic groups threatening their long-term health prospects.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Surgeon General's Report Warns of HEalth Reversals as Minority Teen Smoking Increases | url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1998pres/980427.html | publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services | date=27 April 1998 | accessdate=2008-01-17 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923025212/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/1998pres/980427.html | archivedate=September 23, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSatcher was appointed by [[Bill Clinton]], and remained Surgeon General until 2002, contemporaneously with the first half of the first term of President [[George W. Bush]]'s administration. Eve Slater would later replace him as Assistant Secretary for Health in 2001. Because he no longer held his dual office, Satcher was reverted and downgraded to the grade of [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] in the regular corps for the remainder of his term as Surgeon General. In 2001, his office released the report, ''The Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health and Responsible Sexual Behavior''. The report was hailed by the chairman of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] as an overdue paradigm shift\u2014\"The only way we're going to change approaches to sexual behavior and sexual activity is through school. In school, not only at the doctor's office.\" However, conservative political groups denounced the report as being too permissive towards [[homosexuality]] and condom distribution in schools. When Satcher left office, he retired with the rank of vice admiral.\n\n==== Post\u2013Surgeon General ====\nUpon his departure from the post, Satcher became a fellow at the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]. In the fall of 2002, he assumed the post of Director of the National Center for Primary Care at the [[Morehouse School of Medicine]].\n\nOn December 20, 2004, Satcher was named interim president at [[Morehouse School of Medicine]] until [[John E. Maupin, Jr.]], former president of [[Meharry Medical College]] assumed the current position on February 26, 2006. In June 2006, Satcher established the Satcher Health Leadership Institute (SHLI) at Morehouse School of Medicine as a natural extension of his experiences improving public health policy for all Americans and his commitment to eliminating health disparities for minorities, the poor, and other disadvantaged groups.\n\nIn 2013, he co-founded the advocacy group [[African American]] Network Against [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]].\n\nHe now{{when|date=May 2017}} sits on the boards of [[Johnson & Johnson]] and [[MetLife]].\n\n==== Criticisms of health inequality ====\nWhile acknowledging progress, Satcher has criticized health disparities. He asked the question, \u201cWhat if we had eliminated disparities in health in the last century?\u201d and calculated that there would have been 83,500 fewer black deaths in the year 2000. That would have included 24,000 fewer black deaths from cardiovascular disease. If infant mortality had been equal across racial and ethnic groups in 2000, 4,700 fewer black infants would have died in their first year of life.\n\nWithout disparities, there would have been 22,000 fewer black deaths from diabetes and almost 2,000 fewer black women would have died from breast cancer; 250,000 fewer blacks would have been infected with HIV/AIDS and 7,000 fewer blacks would have died from complications due to AIDS in 2000. As many as 2.5 million additional blacks, including 650,000 children, would have had health insurance in that year. He called on people to work for solutions at the individual, community, and policy level.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Satcher | first=David | title=Ethnic Disparities in Health: The Public's Role in Working for Equality | journal=PLoS Med | volume=3 | issue=10 | pages=e405 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030405 | date=October 24, 2006 | url=http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/socialmedicine-2006.php | accessdate=January 17, 2008 | pmid=17076554 | pmc=1621093 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125152816/http://collections.plos.org/plosmedicine/socialmedicine-2006.php | archivedate=January 25, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSatcher supports a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]-for-all style [[single payer health care|single payer health plan]], in which insurance companies would be eliminated and the government would pay health care costs directly to doctors, hospitals and other providers through the tax system.<ref>{{cite press release | title= Physicians Propose Solution to Rising Health Care Costs and Uninsured | url=http://www.pnhp.org/news/2003/february/physicians_propose_s.php | publisher=Physicians for a National Health Program | date=February 12, 2003| accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, while President of Meharry Medical College, Satcher founded a quarterly [[academic journal]] entitled the ''[[Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved]]''.

All [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]] were killed in the operation, with no fatalities amongst the passengers and crew.\n\n* 31 October 2000 \u2013 [[Singapore Airlines Flight 006]], a [[Boeing 747-400]], attempted to take off on the wrong runway at [[Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport]] (previously Chiang Kai-shek International Airport) while departing for [[Los Angeles International Airport]]. It collided with the construction equipment that was parked on a closed runway, killing 83 of the 179 onboard and injuring a further 71 people. This was the first and only fatal accident of a Singapore Airlines aircraft to date. The aircraft 9V-SPK was painted in a \"Tropical\" promotional livery at the time of the accident. The only other aircraft painted with the promotional [[livery]], another 747-400 registered 9V-SPL, was immediately removed from service and repainted with standard Singapore Airlines livery.\n\n* 12 March 2003 - A [[Boeing 747-400]] operating as Singapore Airlines Flight 286 from [[Auckland International Airport]] to [[Changi Airport]] was involved in a tailstrike while taking off from Auckland's Runway 23L, causing severe damage to the aircraft's tail and damaging the APU (Auxiliary Power Unit), causing in-flight APU fire warnings. The flight returned to Auckland with no fatalities or injuries onboard. The cause was later determined to be an error in the pilots' calculations of the aircraft's takeoff weight and reference speeds, which caused the pilots to [[Rotation (aeronautics)|rotate]] the aircraft prematurely.\n\n* 27 June 2016 \u2013 [[Singapore Airlines Flight 368]], a [[Boeing 777-300ER]], with 222 passengers and 19 crew onboard, suffered an engine oil-leak during a flight from Singapore to Milan.

In Australian sport, this even beats the 11 consecutive premierships won by the St George Dragons in rugby league between 1956 and 1966, long considered to be a world record for consecutive championships.\n\nEach season the best players across the league are selected to represent [[New South Wales]] at the [[Australian Gridiron League National Championships]] in representative teams known as the [[NSW Wolfpack]] (Men), the [[Coyotes]] (Women) and the [[Wolverines]] (Colts) respectively.\n\n==League members==\n\n===Current members===\n\n*[[UNSW Raiders]]\n*Central Coast Sharks\n*Newcastle Kings\n*Northern Sydney Rebels\n*[http://www.nwgridiron.org Northwestern American Football Club]\n*[http://nepeangridiron.com.au/index.html Nepean Ducks]\n*[http://seahawksgridiron.com.au Sutherland Seahawks]\n*[http://www.sydneyunigridiron.com Sydney University Lions]\n*[https://www.revolutionise.com.au/utsgridiron/ UTS Gridiron]\n*[http://www.wsgridiron.com West Sydney Pirates]\n*Wollongong Mustangs\n\n===Former members (senior teams)===\n*Army\n*[[Astros (gridiron team)|Astros]]\n*Blacktown Vikings\n*Canberra Sabretooths\n*Canterbury Cougars\n*Concord Jaguars\n*Eastern Suburbs Buccaneers\n*Fairfield Argonauts\n*Hills District Eagles\n*Manly Redbacks\n*Newcastle Uni Thunder\n*North Western Rebels\n*Parramatta Bears\n*Parramatta Saxons\n*Penrith Outlaws\n*Ryde Spartans\n*St George Fireballs\n*Tempe Jets/Mascot Jets\n*Western Wolverines\n*Newcastle Cobras\n\n===Former members (junior teams)===\n\n*Blacktown Starrs \n*Caringbah Chargers\n*Eastside Colts\n*Lansvale Trojans\n*North Shore Falcons\n*[[Penrith City Chiefs]]\n*Penrith Wolverines\n\n==Division One Championship Game history==\n{|\n|-\n!
