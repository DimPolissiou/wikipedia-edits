Twenty years later in the United States the Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals were first authorized in an Act (18 Stat 125, 43rd Congress) that furthered the [[United States Life-Saving Service]]. The Secretary of the Treasury was directed, among other provisions of the act, to create \"medals of honor\", to be distinguished as life-saving medals of the first and second class, and bestow them upon any persons who endanger their own lives in saving, or endeavoring to save lives from perils of the sea, within the United States, or upon any American vessel.\n\nThe Lifesaving Medals have had three designs in their history. The original design in 1874 was \"non-portable\" and could not be worn by the recipient, but rather displayed much like a trophy. In 1882 the design was changed so that the medal was suspended from a two inch wide ribbon. The ribbon was red for the Gold Lifesaving Medal and light blue for the Silver Lifesaving medal. Finally on 4 August 1949 the medals and ribbons were reduced in size so that they were more proportionate to medals awarded by the U.S. Armed Forces. The ribbons were also redesigned to have multiple colors.\n\nThe laws governing the awarding of medal were amended over the years, and is currently awarded by the Coast Guard. The [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] makes the final determination in authorizing the award.\n\n\"The Gold Lifesaving Medal or the Silver Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to any person who rescues or endeavors to rescue any other person from drowning, shipwreck, or other perils of the water. The rescue or attempted rescue must either take place in waters within the U.S. or subject to the jurisdiction thereof, or one or the other of the parties must be a citizen of the U.S. or from a vessel or aircraft owned or operated by citizens of the U.S.\"<ref name=manual/>\n\nThe Lifesaving Medal is issued in two grades, being silver and gold. \"The Gold Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to an individual who performed a rescue or attempted rescue at the risk of his or her own life, and demonstrates extreme and heroic daring. The Silver Lifesaving Medal may be awarded to an individual who performed a rescue or attempted rescue where the circumstances do not sufficiently distinguish the individual to deserve the medal of gold, but demonstrate such extraordinary effort as to merit recognition. If neither the Gold nor Silver Lifesaving Medal is appropriate, then a Certificate of Valor or an appropriate Coast Guard Public Service Award may be considered.\"<ref name=manual/>\n\nUntil the mid-20th century, the Lifesaving Medal was often bestowed upon members of the military; however in recent times the decoration has become somewhat rare. This is due primarily to the creation of a variety of additional military decorations that supplant the Lifesaving Medal. The [[United States Navy]] often issues the [[Navy and Marine Corps Medal]], instead of the Lifesaving Medal, for sea rescues involving risk of life. \"Military personnel serving on active duty would normally not be recommended for Gold and Silver Lifesaving Medals; however, military personnel may be recommended for a Lifesaving Medal if the act of heroism was performed while the individual was in a leave or liberty status.

There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]].

[[Logarithmic distribution]]s are common in nature and\nconsidering the order of magnitude of values sampled from such a distribution can be more intuitive. When the reference value is ten, the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the value. Similarly, if the reference value is one of certain powers of two, the magnitude can be understood as the amount of computer memory needed to store the exact integer value.\n\n[[Difference (mathematics)|Differences]] in order of magnitude can be [[measured]] on a base-10 [[logarithmic scale]] in \u201c[[Decade (log scale)|decades]]\u201d (i.e., factors of ten).<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/orders.html\n |title      = Orders of Magnitude\n |last       = Brians \n |first      = Paus\n |accessdate = 9 May 2013\n}}</ref> Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]].\n\n==Definition==\nGenerally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of Magnitude|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderofMagnitude.html|website=Wolfram MathWorld|accessdate=3 January 2017|quote=Physicists and engineers use the phrase \"order of magnitude\" to refer to the smallest power of ten needed to represent a quantity.}}</ref> To work out the order of magnitude of a number <math>N</math>, the number is first expressed in the following form:\n:<math>N =a\\times10^b</math>\nwhere <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\leq a<\\sqrt{10}</math>. Then, <math>b</math> represents the order of magnitude of the number. The order of magnitude can be any [[integer]].

If numbers differ by one order of magnitude, ''x'' is ''about'' ten times different in quantity than ''y''.  If values differ by two orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100.

Order&nbsp;of<br />magnitude\n|}\n\n===Calculating the order of magnitude===\nThe order of magnitude of a number is, intuitively speaking, the number of powers of 10 contained in the number.  More precisely, the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the [[common logarithm]], usually as the [[integer]] part of the logarithm, obtained by [[truncation]].  For example, the number {{val|4000000}} has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6.  When truncating, a number of this order of magnitude is between 10<sup>6</sup> and 10<sup>7</sup>. In a similar example, with the phrase \"He had a seven-figure income\", the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a [[logarithmic scale]].\n\n===Order-of-magnitude estimate===\nAn order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable, whose precise value is unknown, is an estimate [[Rounding|rounded]] to the nearest power of ten.  For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the [[human]] [[population]] of the [[Earth]]) is 10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]. To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer.  Thus {{val|4000000}}, which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because \"nearest\" implies rounding rather than truncation.  For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|1.7|e=8}} is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for {{val|3.7|e=8}} is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a [[zeroth order approximation]].\n\n===Order of magnitude difference===\nAn order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10.  For example, the mass of the planet [[Saturn]] is 95 times that of [[Earth]], so Saturn is ''two orders of magnitude'' more massive than Earth.  Order-of-magnitude differences are called '''[[decade (log scale)|decades]]''' when measured on a [[logarithmic scale]].\n\n==Non-decimal orders of magnitude==\n{{see also|Logarithmic scale}}\nOther orders of magnitude may be calculated using [[Radix|bases]] other than 10. The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker [[Magnitude (astronomy)|level of brightness]], and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100<sup>1/5</sup>)<sup>5</sup> or a '''factor''' of 100 times brighter.\n\nThe different [[decimal]] [[numeral systems]] of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows  what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base {{val|1000000}}. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is {{val|1000000}}. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with [[Long and short scales|other meaning]] than in the first chapter) are not names of the ''orders of'' magnitudes, they are names of \"magnitudes\", that is the ''numbers'' {{val|1000000000000}} etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|The IEC standard prefixes]] with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.\n\nThe ancient [[apparent magnitude]]s for the brightness of stars uses the base <math>\\sqrt[5]{100} \\approx 2.512</math> and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.\n\n===Extremely large numbers===\nFor extremely [[large numbers]], a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their [[Logarithm#Inverses of other exponential functions|double logarithm]] or [[super-logarithm]]. Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very \"round numbers\", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the \"nearest\" round number.\n\nThe double logarithm yields the categories:\n: ..., 1.0023\u20131.023, 1.023\u20131.26, 1.26\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>100</sup>, 10<sup>100</sup>\u201310<sup>{{val|1000|fmt=none}}</sup>, ...\n(the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).\n\nThe super-logarithm yields the categories:<!-- 0-1 doesn't seem right -->\n:0\u20131, 1\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>, 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup></sup>, ...

(see [[Large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|notation of extremely large numbers]])\n\nFor extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] can be considered.\n\nSimilar to the [[logarithmic scale#Graphic representation|logarithmic scale]] one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death|here]]) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the \"midpoints\" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the [[generalised f-mean|generalised ''f''-mean]] with ''f''(''x'') the corresponding function log log ''x'' or slog ''x''. In the case of log log ''x'', this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log ''x'' ([[geometric mean]], 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log ''x'' (4 and {{val|65536}} giving 16 if the base is 2, but not otherwise).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Big O notation]]\n* [[Decibel]]\n* [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode]]\n* [[Names of large numbers]]\n* [[Names of small numbers]]\n* [[Number sense]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (energy)]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]]\n* [[Scientific notation]]\n* [[CJK Compatibility|Unicode symbols for CJK Compatibility]] includes [[International System of Units|SI]] Unit symbols\n* [[Valuation (algebra)]], an algebraic generalization of \"order of magnitude\"\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov, Isaac]] ''The Measure of the Universe'' (1983)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://htwins.net/scale2/ The Scale of the Universe 2 ] Interactive tool from [[Planck length]] 10<sup>\u221235</sup> meters to universe size 10<sup>27</sup>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html Cosmos &ndash; an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos] &ndash; from Digital Nature Agency\n* [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index.html Powers of 10], a graphic animated illustration that starts with a view of the [[Milky Way]] at 10<sup>23</sup> meters and ends with [[subatomic particle]]s at 10<sup>\u221216</sup> meters.\n* [http://www.vendian.org/envelope/TemporaryURL/what_is_oom.html What is Order of Magnitude?]\n\n{{orders of magnitude wide}}\n\n[[Category:Orders of magnitude| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Scale of numbers with a fixed ratio}}\n[[File:Orders of magnitude (english annotations).png|thumb|The scale of everything.

[[Logarithmic distribution]]s are common in nature and\nconsidering the order of magnitude of values sampled from such a distribution can be more intuitive. When the reference value is ten, the order of magnitude can be understood as the number of digits in the base-10 representation of the value. Similarly, if the reference value is one of certain powers of two, the magnitude can be understood as the amount of computer memory needed to store the exact integer value.\n\n[[Difference (mathematics)|Differences]] in order of magnitude can be [[measured]] on a base-10 [[logarithmic scale]] in \u201c[[Decade (log scale)|decades]]\u201d (i.e., factors of ten).<ref>{{cite web\n |url        = http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/orders.html\n |title      = Orders of Magnitude\n |last       = Brians \n |first      = Paus\n |accessdate = 9 May 2013\n}}</ref> Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]].\n\n==Definition==\nGenerally, the order of magnitude of a number is the smallest power of 10 used to represent that number.<ref>{{cite web|title=Order of Magnitude|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/OrderofMagnitude.html|website=Wolfram MathWorld|accessdate=3 January 2017|quote=Physicists and engineers use the phrase \"order of magnitude\" to refer to the smallest power of ten needed to represent a quantity.}}</ref> To work out the order of magnitude of a number <math>N</math>, the number is first expressed in the following form:\n:<math>N =a\\times10^b</math>\nwhere <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}\\leq a<\\sqrt{10}</math>.

The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker [[Magnitude (astronomy)|level of brightness]], and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100<sup>1/5</sup>)<sup>5</sup> or a '''factor''' of 100 times brighter.\n\nThe different [[decimal]] [[numeral systems]] of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows  what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base {{val|1000000}}. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is {{val|1000000}}. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with [[Long and short scales|other meaning]] than in the first chapter) are not names of the ''orders of'' magnitudes, they are names of \"magnitudes\", that is the ''numbers'' {{val|1000000000000}} etc.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Binary prefix#IEC standard prefixes|The IEC standard prefixes]] with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.\n\nThe ancient [[apparent magnitude]]s for the brightness of stars uses the base <math>\\sqrt[5]{100} \\approx 2.512</math> and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.\n\n===Extremely large numbers===\nFor extremely [[large numbers]], a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their [[Logarithm#Inverses of other exponential functions|double logarithm]] or [[super-logarithm]]. Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very \"round numbers\", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the \"nearest\" round number.\n\nThe double logarithm yields the categories:\n: ..., 1.0023\u20131.023, 1.023\u20131.26, 1.26\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>100</sup>, 10<sup>100</sup>\u201310<sup>{{val|1000|fmt=none}}</sup>, ...\n(the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).\n\nThe super-logarithm yields the categories:<!-- 0-1 doesn't seem right -->\n:0\u20131, 1\u201310, 10\u201310<sup>10</sup>, 10<sup>10</sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>, 10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup>\u201310<sup>10<sup>10<sup>10</sup></sup></sup>, ... [[tetration|or]]\n\n:0\u2013<sup>0</sup>10, <sup>0</sup>10\u2013<sup>1</sup>10, <sup>1</sup>10\u2013<sup>2</sup>10, <sup>2</sup>10\u2013<sup>3</sup>10, <sup>3</sup>10\u2013<sup>4</sup>10, ...\n\nThe \"midpoints\" which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case:\n:1.076, 2.071, 1453, {{val|4.20|e=31}}, {{val|1.69|e=316}},...\nand, depending on the interpolation method, in the second case\n:\u22120.301, 0.5, 3.162, {{val|1453|fmt=none}}, {{val|1|e=1453|fmt=none}}, <math>(10 \\uparrow)^1 10^{1453}</math>, <math>(10 \\uparrow)^2 10^{1453}</math>,... (see [[Large numbers#Standardized system of writing very large numbers|notation of extremely large numbers]])\n\nFor extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] can be considered.\n\nSimilar to the [[logarithmic scale#Graphic representation|logarithmic scale]] one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided [[Graphical timeline from Big Bang to Heat Death|here]]) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the \"midpoints\" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the [[generalised f-mean|generalised ''f''-mean]] with ''f''(''x'') the corresponding function log log ''x'' or slog ''x''. In the case of log log ''x'', this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log ''x'' ([[geometric mean]], 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log ''x'' (4 and {{val|65536}} giving 16 if the base is 2, but not otherwise).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Big O notation]]\n* [[Decibel]]\n* [[Mathematical operators and symbols in Unicode]]\n* [[Names of large numbers]]\n* [[Names of small numbers]]\n* [[Number sense]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (energy)]]\n* [[Orders of magnitude (numbers)]]\n* [[Scientific notation]]\n* [[CJK Compatibility|Unicode symbols for CJK Compatibility]] includes [[International System of Units|SI]] Unit symbols\n* [[Valuation (algebra)]], an algebraic generalization of \"order of magnitude\"\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Isaac Asimov|Asimov, Isaac]] ''The Measure of the Universe'' (1983)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://htwins.net/scale2/ The Scale of the Universe 2 ] Interactive tool from [[Planck length]] 10<sup>\u221235</sup> meters to universe size 10<sup>27</sup>\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094332/http://www.shekpvar.net/~dna/Publications/Cosmos/cosmos.html Cosmos &ndash; an Illustrated Dimensional Journey from microcosmos to macrocosmos] &ndash; from Digital Nature Agency\n* [http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/scienceopticsu/powersof10/index.html Powers of 10], a graphic animated illustration that starts with a view of the [[Milky Way]] at 10<sup>23</sup> meters and ends with [[subatomic particle]]s at 10<sup>\u221216</sup> meters.\n* [http://www.vendian.org/envelope/TemporaryURL/what_is_oom.html What is Order of Magnitude?]\n\n{{orders of magnitude wide}}\n\n[[Category:Orders of magnitude| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary mathematics]]\n", "name_user": "Juancalahiton", "label": "safe", "comment": "size changed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_magnitude"}

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic.

The tournament was inspired by [[Premier League Darts]], which is organized by the professional darts organisation, [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The idea to play this tournament was created during the world-wide pandemic of [[COVID-19|Covid-19]]. The meaning of the competition is, apart from the fight against the coronavirus, also an introduction of more Czech players to the general public. For players it is a great opportunity to practice and compete during this hard time and to gain much needed experience for future years of their careers.<ref>https://isport.blesk.cz/clanek/ostatni-dalsi-sporty-sipky/377640/sipky-i-v-dobe-koronaviru-startuje-ceska-obdoba-premier-league.html</ref>\n\n== Format ==\nThe format of the tournament is very similar to Premier League Darts, which is organised by the [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]]. The main difference is the absence of a draw, each match has a winner and a loser. Each match starts with a [[bullseye (target)|bulls-eye]] shootout, which decides who will start the match. The first player to throw on the bulls-eye is the one that is listed as the first in the schedule. Values of the shootout are: 50 - the red middle; 25 - the green middle; outside. If both players score the same value, the shootout continues in the reversed order until the decision.\n\n'''Phase 1:'''  In the first phase of the competition (9 rounds), ten players play each other. Phase 1 matches have a maximum of eleven legs, allowing for the winner being first to six. At the end of Phase 1, the two bottom players are eliminated from the competition.\n\n'''Phase 2:''' In the second phase of the competition (7 rounds), eight remaining players play again each other. Phase 2 matches have a maximum of thirteen legs, allowing for the winner being first to seven. At the end of Phase 2, the bottom four players in the league table are eliminated from the competition. The first four players in the league table qualify for the Play-off.\n\n'''Play-off:''' The top four players in the league table contest the two knockout semi-finals with 1st playing 4th and 2nd playing 3rd. The semi-finals are first to 10 legs (best of 19). The two winning semi-finalists meet in the final which is also best of 19.\n\n== Venues ==\nDue to the [[coronavirus outbreak]] and regulations from the government of the [[Czech Republic]], all players will play from their home. All players have a [[webcam]] prepared in their home environment, through which it is possible to watch every thrown dart. After each throw, players announce their score. Viewers see both [[dartboard]]s at the same time, along with the scoreboard which is powered by [[DartConnect]].\n\n{{Location map+ | Czechia\n| width=700\n| caption=Map of player's locations\n| float=left\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Fulnek\n    | lat_deg = 49.71\n    | lon_deg = 17.90 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Zderaz\n    | position=bottom\n    | lat_deg = 49.82\n    | lon_deg = 16.10 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00davaly\n    | lat_deg = 50.07\n    | lon_deg = 14.73 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Prague\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 50.08\n    | lon_deg = 14.41 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9\n    | lat_deg = 50.21\n    | lon_deg = 15.83 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = \u00dasobrno\n    | lat_deg = 49.59\n    | lon_deg = 16.78 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Bouzov\n    | position=left\n    | lat_deg = 49.70\n    | lon_deg = 16.89 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Po\u0159\u00ed\u010d\u00ed u Litomy\u0161le\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.80\n    | lon_deg = 16.19 }}\n{{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = Uni\u010dov\n    | position=top\n    | lat_deg = 49.77\n    | lon_deg = 17.12 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Czechia\n    | label = N\u00e1vs\u00ed\n    | lat_deg = 49.58\n    | lon_deg = 18.76 }}\n}}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\n== Prize money ==\nThe first edition of the tournament does not include any prize money for players. On the contrary, the tournament has a charity meaning. For every thrown \"180\", the official partner of 2020 Tipsport Premier League, the company [[Tipsport]], donates 500 [[CZK]] for purchase of medical equipment (face masks, ventilators etc.) for the fight against the [[coronavirus]].<ref>https://www.irozhlas.cz/sport/ostatni-sporty/sipky-virtualni-serie-ceska-premier-league-pres-internet_2004030830_wei</ref>\n\n== Players==\nFor the first edition of Tipsport Premier League, 10 players have been chosen in advance including the former [[PDC World Youth Championship]] runner-up and [[JDC]]{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}} World Darts Championship runner-up, [[Adam Gawlas]] and the former [[PDC World Cup of Darts]] national team member, [[Pavel Jirkal]]. Other players have experience from international tournaments and are the best players in Czech Republic. The current Czech number one, [[Karel Sedl\u00e1\u010dek]], though invited, could not compete due to the contract obligations to [[Professional Darts Corporation|PDC]].<ref>https://sport.tn.nova.cz/clanek/ceske-sipky-spousti-svou-premier-league-zacina-se-uz-pristi-tyden.html</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Player\n|-\n|[[File:Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Daniel Barbo\u0159\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Adam Gawlas.jpg|100px|alt=Adam Gawlas|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Adam Gawlas]]\n|-\n|[[File:Pavel Jirkal.jpg|100px|alt=Pavel Jirkal|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Pavel Jirkal]]\n|-\n|[[File:Ond\u0159ej Kysilka.jpg|100px|alt=Ond\u0159ej Kysilka|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Ond\u0159ej Kysilka]]\n|-\n|[[File:Alexander Ma\u0161ek.jpg|100px|alt=Alexander Ma\u0161ek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Alexander Ma\u0161ek]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal Ondo.jpg|100px|alt=Michal Ondo|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal Ondo]]\n|-\n|[[File:David P\u00edsek.jpg|100px|alt=David P\u00edsek|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David P\u00edsek]]\n|-\n|[[File:David Ros\u00ed.jpg|100px|alt=David Ros\u00ed|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[David Ros\u00ed]]\n|-\n|[[File:V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k.jpg|100px|alt=V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Sedl\u00e1k]]\n|-\n|[[File:Michal \u0160mejda.jpg|100px|alt=Michal \u0160mejda|frameless]]{{flagicon|CZE}} [[Michal \u0160mejda]]\n|}\n\n== League stage ==\n\n=== 7.

The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America.  Ruled out were hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas.<ref name=\"Rasmussen2014\"/> After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.\n\nSimilarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named '[[Naia (skeleton)|Naia]]' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called ''[[sistema Sac Actun]]'' in [[Mexico]]'s eastern [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]].

Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of European colonization. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists brought from Europe.\n\nThe spread of infectious diseases was slow initially,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [[human trafficking]] of massive numbers of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Western and Central African people]] to the Americas. Like the Native Americans, these African people, newly exposed to the European diseases, lacked any inherited resistances to the diseases of Europe. In 1520 an African who had been infected with smallpox had arrived in Yucat\u00e1n. By 1558, the disease had spread throughout South America and had arrived at the Plata basin.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|date=1993|title=Disease Exchange Across the Tropical Atlantic|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|volume=15|issue=3|pages=329\u2013356|jstor=23331729}}</ref> Colonist violence towards Indigenous peoples accelerated the loss of lives.

Many European diseases, like cow pox, are acquired from domesticated animals that are not indigenous to the Americas. European populations had adapted to these diseases, and built up resistance, over many generations. Many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult. Children could often survive the disease, resulting in immunity to the disease for the rest of their life.

An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Indigenous languages of the Americas}}\nThe languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area.\nOf equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the [[Ojibwe language|Chippewas]] and [[Lenape|Delawares]].<ref>Hammerton, J.A., Peoples Of All Nations, Volume 7, London: Educational Book Co., Limited, 17, New Bridge Street, E.C</ref>\n\n===Writing systems===\n{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]\nThe development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1\u20134|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Maya script|Maya writing system]] was a combination of [[phonetic]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s\u2014that is, it was a [[logosyllabic]] writing system.

In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D. |authorlink=Michael D.

There are only a few extant inscriptions, making study of this writing system difficult.\n\n[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, \"Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico\". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices contain not only [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), Spanish, and occasionally [[Latin]].\n\nSpanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Nahuatl Literacy\", in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395\u2013417.</ref> The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].\n\nAboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American music}}\n\n[[File:Apache violin, made by Chesley Wilson, 1989 - National Museum of American History - DSC00053.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Apache fiddle]] made by [[Chesley Goseyun Wilson]] ([[San Carlos Apache]])]]\n[[File:JuPi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Textile art by Julia Pingushat ([[Inuk]], [[Arviat]], Nunavut, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995]]\n[[File:Gorget, Peru, north coast, Chimu style, c. 1350-1450 AD, feathers, reeds, copper bars, silver, metal overlaid with skin - Textile Museum, George Washington University - DSC09898.JPG|thumb|[[Chimu culture]] feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350\u20131450 CE]]\n\n[[Native American music]] can vary between cultures, however there are significant commonalities. Traditional music often centers around [[drum]]ming and singing. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, [[clapper stick]]s, and rasps are also popular percussive instruments, both historically and in contemporary cultures. [[Flute]]s are made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The [[Apache]] have a type of [[Apache fiddle|fiddle]], and [[fiddle]]s are also found among a number of [[First Nations]] and [[M\u00e9tis]] cultures.\n\nThe music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America, like that of the North American cultures, tend to be spiritual ceremonies. It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets) and \"rain\" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600\u2013900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420123834/http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|date=2004-04-17|archivedate=2015-04-20|accessdate=2016-06-22|title=Music from the Land of the Jaguar|publisher=The Princeton Art Museum}} (Includes sound sample.) {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas]] comprise a major category in the world [[Collection (museum)|art collection]].

The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably [[Cuzcatlan]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala.

The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.\n\nThe 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.\n\n=== Other parts of the Americas ===\n[[File:Kulusuk, Inuit couple (6822265499).jpg|thumb|[[Tunumiit]] [[Inuit]] couple from [[Kulusuk]], [[Greenland]]]]\nIndigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charr\u00faa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name=\"enha_asc\"/> Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].\n\n==Native American name controversy==\n{{Main|Native American name controversy}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe Native American name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.\n\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"[[Native American name controversy|Native American]],\" to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. They prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations.\n\n==Rise of indigenous movements==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\nThere has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.\n\nIn Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal prerogative===\n[[File:Presidentes del Per\u00fa y Bolivia inauguran Encuentro Presidencial y III Gabinete Binacional Per\u00fa-Bolivia (36962597345) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), former [[President of Bolivia]]]]\n\nThe first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]] and the first in South America.

His election encouraged the indigenous movement across Latin America.\n\nRepresentatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European \"foreign [[power elite]]\" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. It questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"plenglish\">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409050852/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D%29&language=EN |date=9 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called \"Crescent departments\" in Bolivia to impose autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency.

Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America.\"<ref name=Kashani>{{cite journal |last1=Kashani |first1=Baharak Hooshiar |last2=Perego |first2=Ugo A. |last3=Olivieri |first3=Anna |last4=Angerhofer |first4=Norman |last5=Gandini |first5=Francesca |last6=Carossa |first6=Valeria |last7=Lancioni |first7=Hovirag |last8=Semino |first8=Ornella |last9=Woodward |first9=Scott R. |last10=Achilli |first10=Alessandro |last11=Torroni |first11=Antonio |title=Mitochondrial haplogroup C4c: A rare lineage entering America through the ice-free corridor? |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201339 |year=2012 |pmid=22024980 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21614 }}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Main list|List of indigenous people of the Americas}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{div col |colwidth = 30em }}\n* [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Chunkey]]\n* [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Demographic history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[First Nations]]\n* [[Fully feathered basket]]\n* [[Origins of Paleoindians]]\n* [[History of the west coast of North America]]\n* [[Indian Mass]]\n* [[Indigenous Movements in the Americas]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of South America]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]\n* [[List of American Inuit]]\n* [[List of Greenlandic Inuit]]\n* [[List of indigenous artists of the Americas]]\n* [[List of indigenous peoples#The Americas]]\n* [[List of Mayan languages]]\n* [[List of traditional territories of the indigenous peoples of North America]]\n* [[List of writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas]]\n* [[Native Americans in the United States]]\n* [[Native American Languages Act of 1990]]\n* [[Native American weaponry]]\n* [[Native Americans in German popular culture]]\n* [[Pacific Islander]]\n* [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Pow wow]]\n* [[Redskin]]\n* [[Republic of Lakotah]]\n* [[Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system|Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas]]\n* [[Zambo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Journal articles\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Gaskins | first = S. | year = 1999 | title = Children's daily lives in a Mayan village: A case study of culturally constructed roles and activities | url = | journal = Children's Engagement in the World: Sociocultural Perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 25\u201361 }}\n* {{cite journal | last = Nimmo | first = J. | year = 2008 | title = Young children's access to real life: An examination of the growing boundaries between children in child care and adults in the community | url = | journal = Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3\u201313 | doi = 10.2304/ciec.2008.9.1.3 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Morelli | first1 = G. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Angelillo | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialised child-focused activities | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 264\u2013274 | doi=10.1080/01650250244000335 }}\n* Woodhead, M.

In some regions the indigenous peoples created monumental architecture, large-scale organized cities, city-states, [[chiefdom]]s, [[State (polity)|states]], [[Realm|kingdoms]] and [[empire]]s. Among these are the [[Aztec civilization|Aztec]], [[Inca civilization|Inca]] and [[Maya civilization|Maya]] states that until the 16th century were among the most politically and socially advanced nations in the world. They had a vast knowledge of engineering, architecture, mathematics, astronomy, writing, physics, medicine, planting and irrigation, geology, mining, sculpture and goldsmithing.\n\nMany parts of the Americas are still populated by indigenous peoples; some countries have sizable populations, especially [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Greenland]], [[Guatemala]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], and the [[United States]].

Some, such as the [[Quechuan languages]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], [[Guarani language|Guaran\u00ed]], [[Mayan languages]] and [[Nahuatl]], count their speakers in millions. Many also maintain aspects of indigenous cultural practices to varying degrees, including religion, [[social organization]] and [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] practices.

Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of European colonization. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists brought from Europe.\n\nThe spread of infectious diseases was slow initially,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [[human trafficking]] of massive numbers of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Western and Central African people]] to the Americas. Like the Native Americans, these African people, newly exposed to the European diseases, lacked any inherited resistances to the diseases of Europe. In 1520 an African who had been infected with smallpox had arrived in Yucat\u00e1n.

Many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult.

It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets) and \"rain\" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600\u2013900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced.

The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people.

[[Mapuche conflict|Conflict over Mapuche land rights]] continues to the present.\n\nOther groups include the [[Aymara people|Aymara]], the majority of whom live in Bolivia and Peru, with smaller numbers in the [[Arica-Parinacota Region|Arica-Parinacota]] and [[Tarapac\u00e1 Region|Tarapac\u00e1]] regions, and the [[Atacama people]] (''Atacame\u00f1os''), who reside mainly in [[El Loa]].\n\n==== Colombia ====\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Colombia}}\n[[File:Guambia, Colombia.jpg|thumb|[[Guamb\u00eda people]] relaxing in [[Colombia]]]]\nA minority today within [[Colombia]]'s overwhelmingly [[Mestizo]] and [[White Colombian]] population, Colombia's indigenous peoples consist of around 85 distinct cultures and more than 1,378,884 people.<ref>DANE 2005 national census</ref><ref>[http://www.who.int/social_determinants/resources/isa_etnic_minorities_col.pdf \"Health equity and ethnic minorities in emergency situations\"], Pier Paolo Balladelli, Jos\u00e9 Milton Guzm\u00e1n, Marcelo Korc, Paula Moreno, Gabriel Rivera, The Commission on Social Health Determinants, [[Pan American Health Organization]], [[World Health Organization]], [[Bogot\u00e1|Bogot\u00e1, Colombia]], 2007</ref> A variety of [[collective rights]] for indigenous peoples are recognized in the 1991 Constitution.\n\nOne of the influences is the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] culture, a subset of the larger [[Chibcha]] [[ethnic group]], famous for their use of [[gold]], which led to the legend of ''[[El Dorado]]''.

An early sedentary culture, known as the [[Valdivia culture]], developed in the coastal region, while the [[Caras (tribe)|Caras]] and the [[Quitu]]s unified to form an elaborate civilization that ended at the birth of the Capital Quito. The [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s near [[Cuenca, Ecuador|Cuenca]] were the most advanced, and most feared by the [[Inca]], due to their fierce resistance to the Incan expansion. Their architecture remains were later destroyed by Spaniards and the Incas.\n\n[[File:EquateurOtavalo 0606.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|[[Otavalo people|Otavalo]] girl from Ecuador]]\nApproximately 96.4% of Ecuador's Indigenous population are Highland Quichuas living in the valleys of the Sierra region. Primarily consisting of the descendants of peoples conquered by the Incas, they are [[Kichwa]] speakers and include the [[Inca-Caranqui|Caranqui]], the [[Otavalo people|Otavalo]]s, the Cayambe, the Quitu-Caras, the [[Panzaleo]], the Chimbuelo, the Salasacan, the Tugua, the Puruh\u00e1, the [[Ca\u00f1ari]], and the [[Saraguro people|Saraguro]]. Linguistic evidence suggests that the Salascan and the Saraguro may have been the descendants of Bolivian ethnic groups transplanted to Ecuador as ''mitimaes''.\n\nCoastal groups, including the [[Aw\u00e1 (kwaiker)|Aw\u00e1]], [[Ecuador|Chachi]], and the [[Ts\u00e1chila]], make up 0.24% percent of the indigenous population, while the remaining 3.35 percent live in the Oriente and consist of the Oriente Kichwa (the Canelo and the Quijos), the [[Shuar people|Shuar]], the [[Huaorani]], the Siona-Secoya, the [[Cof\u00e1n]], and the [[Achuar people|Achuar]].\n\nIn 1986, indigenous people formed the first \"truly\" national [[Political organisation|political organization]]. [[CONAIE|The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[CONAIE]]) has been the primary political institution of the Indigenous since then and is now the second largest political party in the nation. It has been influential in national politics, contributing to the ouster of presidents [[Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram]] in 1997 and [[Jamil Mahuad]] in 2000.\n\n==== Peru ====<!-- This section is linked from [[Bartolom\u00e9 de Las Casas]] -->\n[[File:Qichwa conchucos 01.jpg|thumb|right|A group of [[Quechuas]] in the [[Conchucos District]], [[Ancash Region]], [[Peru]]]]\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Peru}}\nIndigenous population in Peru make up around 25% approximately.<ref name=\"census2017\"/> Native Peruvian traditions and customs have shaped the way Peruvians live and see themselves today. Cultural citizenship\u2014or what Renato Rosaldo has called, \"the right to be different and to belong, in a democratic, participatory sense\" (1996:243)\u2014is not yet very well developed in Peru. This is perhaps no more apparent than in the country's Amazonian regions where indigenous societies continue to struggle against state-sponsored economic abuses, cultural discrimination, and pervasive violence.<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}}, [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 UPF.com]</ref>\n\n==== Suriname ====\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples in Suriname}}\n\n==== Venezuela ====\n{{main|Indigenous peoples in Venezuela}}\n[[File:A Warao family in their canoe.jpg|thumb|right|A Venezuelan [[Warao people|Warao family]] traveling in their canoe]]\nMost [[Venezuela]]ns have some indigenous heritage and are [[pardo]], even if they identify as white. But those who identify as indigenous, from being raised in those cultures, make up only around 2% of the total population. The indigenous peoples speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects. As some of the ethnic groups are very small, their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.\n\nThe 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.\n\n=== Other parts of the Americas ===\n[[File:Kulusuk, Inuit couple (6822265499).jpg|thumb|[[Tunumiit]] [[Inuit]] couple from [[Kulusuk]], [[Greenland]]]]\nIndigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charr\u00faa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name=\"enha_asc\"/> Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].\n\n==Native American name controversy==\n{{Main|Native American name controversy}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe Native American name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.\n\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"[[Native American name controversy|Native American]],\" to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. They prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations.\n\n==Rise of indigenous movements==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\nThere has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.\n\nIn Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal prerogative===\n[[File:Presidentes del Per\u00fa y Bolivia inauguran Encuentro Presidencial y III Gabinete Binacional Per\u00fa-Bolivia (36962597345) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), former [[President of Bolivia]]]]\n\nThe first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]] and the first in South America.

His election encouraged the indigenous movement across Latin America.\n\nRepresentatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European \"foreign [[power elite]]\" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. It questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"plenglish\">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409050852/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D%29&language=EN |date=9 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called \"Crescent departments\" in Bolivia to impose autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency.

Professor Kelly Graf said,\n<blockquote>Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. Second, Paleoindian skeletons like Buhl Woman with phenotypic traits atypical of modern-day indigenous Americans can be explained as having a direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia.</blockquote>\n\nA route through Beringia is seen as more likely than the [[Solutrean hypothesis]].<ref name=Raghavan/> Kashani et al. 2012 state that \"The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians. Taking into account that C4c is deeply rooted in the Asian portion of the mtDNA phylogeny and is indubitably of Asian origin, the finding that C4c and X2a are characterized by parallel genetic histories definitively dismisses the controversial hypothesis of an Atlantic glacial entry route into North America.\"<ref name=Kashani>{{cite journal |last1=Kashani |first1=Baharak Hooshiar |last2=Perego |first2=Ugo A. |last3=Olivieri |first3=Anna |last4=Angerhofer |first4=Norman |last5=Gandini |first5=Francesca |last6=Carossa |first6=Valeria |last7=Lancioni |first7=Hovirag |last8=Semino |first8=Ornella |last9=Woodward |first9=Scott R. |last10=Achilli |first10=Alessandro |last11=Torroni |first11=Antonio |title=Mitochondrial haplogroup C4c: A rare lineage entering America through the ice-free corridor? |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=147 |issue=1 |pages=35\u201339 |year=2012 |pmid=22024980 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21614 }}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{Main list|List of indigenous people of the Americas}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{div col |colwidth = 30em }}\n* [[Ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Chunkey]]\n* [[Classification of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Demographic history of the indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[First Nations]]\n* [[Fully feathered basket]]\n* [[Origins of Paleoindians]]\n* [[History of the west coast of North America]]\n* [[Indian Mass]]\n* [[Indigenous Movements in the Americas]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples in Canada]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of South America]]\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]]\n* [[List of American Inuit]]\n* [[List of Greenlandic Inuit]]\n* [[List of indigenous artists of the Americas]]\n* [[List of indigenous peoples#The Americas]]\n* [[List of Mayan languages]]\n* [[List of traditional territories of the indigenous peoples of North America]]\n* [[List of writers from peoples indigenous to the Americas]]\n* [[Native Americans in the United States]]\n* [[Native American Languages Act of 1990]]\n* [[Native American weaponry]]\n* [[Native Americans in German popular culture]]\n* [[Pacific Islander]]\n* [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]]\n* [[Pow wow]]\n* [[Redskin]]\n* [[Republic of Lakotah]]\n* [[Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system|Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas]]\n* [[Zambo]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Journal articles\n{{refbegin|35em}}\n* {{cite journal | last = Gaskins | first = S. | year = 1999 | title = Children's daily lives in a Mayan village: A case study of culturally constructed roles and activities | url = | journal = Children's Engagement in the World: Sociocultural Perspectives | volume = | issue = | pages = 25\u201361 }}\n* {{cite journal | last = Nimmo | first = J. | year = 2008 | title = Young children's access to real life: An examination of the growing boundaries between children in child care and adults in the community | url = | journal = Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3\u201313 | doi = 10.2304/ciec.2008.9.1.3 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Morelli | first1 = G. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Angelillo | first3 = C. | year = 2003 | title = Cultural variation in young children's access to work or involvement in specialised child-focused activities | url = | journal = International Journal of Behavioral Development | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 264\u2013274 | doi=10.1080/01650250244000335 }}\n* Woodhead, M.

Home games are played at the CenturyLink Sports Complex in [[Hammond Stadium]], which has a capacity of 7,500, and opened in {{Baseball year|1991}}. The park is also used as the Minnesota Twins' [[spring training]] facility. Prior to Twins Spring training and the 2014 Florida State League season, Phase I of a two-part renovation was completed with the addition of an outfield boardwalk. The second phase of the renovation, which includes new sky suites, concessions, wider concourses and new offices for the Miracle staff, was completed before Spring training in 2015. Due to the start of construction on Phase II in August 2014, the Miracle played the final 10 home dates, including playoffs, at [[JetBlue Park at Fenway South|JetBlue Park]].\n\nThe majority owner is Kaufy Baseball, LLC, a privately held company managed by Andrew Kaufmann, who purchased a controlling interest in the club from Jason Hochberg of SJS Beacon Baseball, LLC in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/01/08/fort-myers-miracle-undergo-ownership-change/|title=Fort Myers Miracle Undergo Ownership Change|website=Ballpark Digest|date=January 8, 2019|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> Musician [[Jimmy Buffett]] and actor [[Bill Murray]] were minority owners of the team.\n\n==History==\nThe Mighty Mussels franchise was founded in {{Baseball year|1926}}, as the '''Fort Myers Palms'''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} One year later, the team moved to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and were renamed the '''Miami Hustlers'''. The team became temporarily inactive, with the rest of the [[Florida State League]], midway through the {{Baseball year|1928}} season. Even though the Florida State League resumed play in {{Baseball year|1936}}, the Hustlers remained inactive until they were reactivated by the FSL during the {{Baseball year|1961}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1962}} offseason to serve as the Class D affiliate of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The team was renamed the '''Miami Marlins''' in honor of the original Marlins of the Triple-A [[International League]] who had moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] (and subsequently [[Charleston, South Carolina]]), following the {{Baseball year|1960}} season.\n\n{{stack|[[File:Cal Ripken Jr. in 1993.jpg|thumb|Before embarking on his Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Orioles, [[Cal Ripken, Jr]] was a member of the Miami Orioles]]}}\nIn {{Baseball year|1963}}, there was a restructuring of the classification system of all [[Minor League Baseball]], which resulted in the FSL changing from Class D to its current status of Class A-Advanced. They became a [[Baltimore Orioles]] affiliate in {{Baseball year|1966}}, and were renamed the '''Miami Orioles''' after their MLB parent club from {{Baseball year|1971}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1981}}.\n\nUpon the Baltimore Orioles' severing of their affiliation with the Miami Orioles following the 1981 season, the franchise reverted to the Marlins name and participated in the {{Baseball year|1982}} FSL season as an independent entry. Without a Major League affiliate, this team was composed of undrafted players from the area, free agents from various organizations and players on loan from the Baltimore Orioles, [[San Diego Padres]], and [[Oakland A's]] organizations.\n\nThe following season the Miami Marlins became a San Diego Padres affiliate. This partnership lasted two years and the Marlins were without a parent club for the {{Baseball year|1985}} season.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They filled their roster with ten former major leaguers looking to rejuvenate their careers, including Derrel Thomas, who made it back to MLB later that season with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Marlins continued this practice through the 1988 season. One of their signees in 1987, Dennis Mart\u00ednez, also returned to MLB, signing with the Montreal Expos later that season. In 1987, the team started receiving some players on loan from the Tokyo Giants.

As the Miracle, the club won the FSL West Division first half in {{Baseball year|2003}} and {{Baseball year|2008}} and the FSL West second half in {{Baseball year|1995}}, {{Baseball year|2000}} and {{Baseball year|2006}}. In {{baseball year|2009}}, the Florida State League adopted a North\u2013South setup of divisions. In that year, the Miracle won both the FSL South first and second half under manager [[Jeff Smith (baseball)|Jeff Smith]]. Despite a regular season record of 80\u201358 and winning game one of a best-of-three series on the road, the [[Charlotte Stone Crabs]] defeated the Miracle in games two and three.\n\nAfter a three-season hiatus, the Miracle returned to the FSL Playoffs under first-year manager Doug Mientkiewicz. Guiding a star-studded team of Twins prospects such as [[Miguel Sano]], [[Kennys Vargas]] and [[Eddie Rosario]], the Miracle won the first half in the FSL South with a 45\u201322 record. The 45 wins tied the franchise record for the most in a single half and the winning percentage of .672 marked the best for a half in team history. Posting the best overall record in the Florida State League at 79\u201356 during the regular season, the Miracle again fell to the Stone Crabs in the FSL South Divisional Playoff. Charlotte held the league-best Fort Myers offense, that included the consensus top prospect in baseball [[Byron Buxton]], to just one run in a two-game sweep.\n\n==2014 Championship Season==\nEntering the {{Baseball year|2014}} season, the Miracle had appeared in the Florida State League Championship series twice; losing to the [[Daytona Cubs]] in 1995 and 2008. For a second consecutive season, Mientkiewicz led the Miracle to a first half title in the FSL South, narrowly edging the [[St. Lucie Mets]] by one game in the standings with a final day win, 4\u20130, over the [[Bradenton Marauders]]. Fort Myers finished with a first half record of 41\u201328 with a roster featuring top prospects [[Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos]], [[Jorge Polanco]] and Adam Brett Walker. During the 2014 campaign, Walker broke the Miracle franchise record for home runs in a season with 25; previously held by [[Brock Peterson]] with 21 in 2006. Walker was also a 2014 FSL All-Star Game MVP and Home Run Derby Champion at the 2014 FSL All-Star Game in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], at [[McKechnie Field]]. In the second half, the Miracle posted a record of 41\u201329 for an overall mark of 82\u201357, second-best in team history.\n\nIn the FSL South Divisional Playoff, the Miracle faced Bradenton. Trailing 7\u20133 in the top of the fourth inning, Jason Kanzler hit an opposite field grand slam to tie the game in the first of a best-of-three series. After the fifth inning, play was halted for 58 minutes due to rain. When the game resumed in the top of the sixth, Dalton Hicks drove in the eventual game-winning run with a single. The Miracle won game one, 8\u20137, and Kanzler had six runs batted in. In game two, the Miracle scored six runs in the bottom of the third inning to take 6\u20131 lead. Miracle starter [[D. J. Baxendale]] earned the win with six innings allowing just one unearned run and five strikeouts. After a two-game sweep of the Marauders, the Miracle advanced to the FSL Championship series for the third time in team history.\n\nFacing the Cubs again, the Miracle hosted the first two games of the best-of-five series at [[JetBlue Park at Fenway South|JetBlue Park]]. The Miracle pitching staff allowed just one run in a pair of wins. Fort Myers took game one, 5\u20131, and game two, 5\u20130. With a 2\u20130 series lead for the Miracle, the Cubs staved off elimination in game three at [[Jackie Robinson Ballpark]] in Daytona, Florida After a two-hour, seven-minute delay, the Cubs and Miracle engaged in a back-and-forth battle with Daytona eventually going on to win, 8\u20137. The Cubs trailed 6\u20135 in the bottom of the eighth inning, but took the lead on a three-run homer by Wilson Contreras. After the Cubs' win, the two teams had to wait a day after heavy storms made the field in Daytona unplayable. On Monday, September 8, the Miracle and Cubs played game four. Fort Myers built a 2\u20130 lead midway through the fourth inning. Daytona tied the game in the sixth. Going into extra innings, Kanzler gave the Miracle a 4\u20132 lead with a two-run homer in the top of the eleventh. Zack Jones recorded a perfect ninth inning, striking out Contreras for the save. The FSL Championship was the first in team history since moving to Fort Myers in 1992. The series win also marked the first time the Daytona Cubs had lost a FSL Playoff series.\n\n==Season-by-season==\nThese statistics are current through the 2019 season, and include only seasons dating back to when the team was first called the Miracle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|<small>'''League champions''' \u2020</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#DDFFDD\"|<small>'''Finals appearance''' *</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|<small>'''Division winner''' ^</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#96CDCD\"|<small>'''Wild card berth''' \u00a4</small>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

The park is also used as the Minnesota Twins' [[spring training]] facility. Prior to Twins Spring training and the 2014 Florida State League season, Phase I of a two-part renovation was completed with the addition of an outfield boardwalk. The second phase of the renovation, which includes new sky suites, concessions, wider concourses and new offices for the Miracle staff, was completed before Spring training in 2015. Due to the start of construction on Phase II in August 2014, the Miracle played the final 10 home dates, including playoffs, at [[JetBlue Park at Fenway South|JetBlue Park]].\n\nThe majority owner is Kaufy Baseball, LLC, a privately held company managed by Andrew Kaufmann, who purchased a controlling interest in the club from Jason Hochberg of SJS Beacon Baseball, LLC in January 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2019/01/08/fort-myers-miracle-undergo-ownership-change/|title=Fort Myers Miracle Undergo Ownership Change|website=Ballpark Digest|date=January 8, 2019|access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref> Musician [[Jimmy Buffett]] and actor [[Bill Murray]] were minority owners of the team.\n\n==History==\nThe Mighty Mussels franchise was founded in {{Baseball year|1926}}, as the '''Fort Myers Palms'''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} One year later, the team moved to [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], and were renamed the '''Miami Hustlers'''.

The team was renamed the '''Miami Marlins''' in honor of the original Marlins of the Triple-A [[International League]] who had moved to [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]] (and subsequently [[Charleston, South Carolina]]), following the {{Baseball year|1960}} season.\n\n{{stack|[[File:Cal Ripken Jr. in 1993.jpg|thumb|Before embarking on his Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Orioles, [[Cal Ripken, Jr]] was a member of the Miami Orioles]]}}\nIn {{Baseball year|1963}}, there was a restructuring of the classification system of all [[Minor League Baseball]], which resulted in the FSL changing from Class D to its current status of Class A-Advanced. They became a [[Baltimore Orioles]] affiliate in {{Baseball year|1966}}, and were renamed the '''Miami Orioles''' after their MLB parent club from {{Baseball year|1971}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1981}}.\n\nUpon the Baltimore Orioles' severing of their affiliation with the Miami Orioles following the 1981 season, the franchise reverted to the Marlins name and participated in the {{Baseball year|1982}} FSL season as an independent entry. Without a Major League affiliate, this team was composed of undrafted players from the area, free agents from various organizations and players on loan from the Baltimore Orioles, [[San Diego Padres]], and [[Oakland A's]] organizations.\n\nThe following season the Miami Marlins became a San Diego Padres affiliate. This partnership lasted two years and the Marlins were without a parent club for the {{Baseball year|1985}} season.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} They filled their roster with ten former major leaguers looking to rejuvenate their careers, including Derrel Thomas, who made it back to MLB later that season with the Philadelphia Phillies. The Marlins continued this practice though the 1988 season. One of their signees in 1987, Dennis Mart\u00ednez, also returned to MLB, signing with the Montreal Expos later that season. In 1987, the team started receiving some players on loan from the Tokyo Giants. This lasted though the 1988 season.<ref name=sst0>{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Bob|title=New Nickname, New Owners, New Field \u2013 Same Finish?|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-04-06/sports/8901180216_1_marlins-two-new-teams-baseball-team|accessdate=July 18, 2015|work=Sun Sentinel|date=April 6, 1989}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the team began the season at Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium, but moved later in the season to the Miami-Hialeah Lakes High School field.<ref name=sst>{{cite news |last1=Kugiya |first1=Hugo |title=Marlins Sold |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1989-03-01/sports/8901110956_1_miracle-stuart-revo-marlins |accessdate=July 18, 2015|work=Sun Sentinel|date=March 1, 1989}}</ref> The Marlins had per-game attendance totals of approximately 100 fans.<ref name=sst0/>\n\nOn {{dts|1989|2|22}}, the South Florida Baseball Club Limited Partnership purchased the Marlins and were renamed the '''Miami Miracle'''.

While having a partial affiliation with the Cleveland Indians and the Tokyo Giants of the Japanese league, the Miracle were considered an independent entry in the FSL.<ref name=sst/>\n\nThe team received only nine players from the Indians for the 1989 season and had to scramble to find players like pitcher Longo Garcia who was released by the [[San Francisco Giants]] organization having been a tenth round draft pick.

Mike Veeck (son of Hall of Fame inductee [[Bill Veeck]], and author of the book, ''Fun is Good'') also became part owner of the organization while Murray and Buffett still maintained their shares as well.\n\nIn 1990, the team moved again, playing its home games at [[Pompano Beach Municipal Stadium]]. The team spent two seasons in Pompano Beach with future big league skipper [[Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez]] at the helm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=gonzal003fre|title=Fredi Gonz\u00e1lez  Minor League Statistics &amp; History \u2013 Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|date=December 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1992}}, with the impending arrival of MLB's [[Florida Marlins]], the Goldklang Group returned the Miracle to Fort Myers. The Miracle operated as a co-op club with the Minnesota Twins that season, and became a full Twins affiliate a year later. The current Player Development Contract runs through 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20140911&content_id=94184038&fext=.jsp&vkey=news_t509&sid=t509/|title=Miracle, Twins extend Player Development Contract through 2018|website=www.miraclebaseball.com|date=September 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, the franchise announced that it would be rebrand ahead of the 2020 season and become known as the '''Fort Myers Mighty Mussels'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/miracle-no-more-twins-team-in-fort-myers-takes-a-new-nickname/565737252/|title=Miracle no more: Twins team in Fort Myers is now the Mighty Mussels|website=startribune.com|date=December 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Mighty Mussels in Fort Myers==\n[[File:MiraclevsBlueJays.JPG|thumb|The 2008 1st & 2nd half Western Division champions take the field in game 2 of the playoffs at Hammond Stadium]]\nSince moving to Fort Myers for the 1992 season, the Mighty Mussels have qualified for the Florida State League Playoffs eight times. As the Miracle, the club won the FSL West Division first half in {{Baseball year|2003}} and {{Baseball year|2008}} and the FSL West second half in {{Baseball year|1995}}, {{Baseball year|2000}} and {{Baseball year|2006}}. In {{baseball year|2009}}, the Florida State League adopted a North\u2013South setup of divisions. In that year, the Miracle won both the FSL South first and second half under manager [[Jeff Smith (baseball)|Jeff Smith]]. Despite a regular season record of 80\u201358 and winning game one of a best-of-three series on the road, the [[Charlotte Stone Crabs]] defeated the Miracle in games two and three.\n\nAfter a three-season hiatus, the Miracle returned to the FSL Playoffs under first-year manager Doug Mientkiewicz. Guiding a star-studded team of Twins prospects such as [[Miguel Sano]], [[Kennys Vargas]] and [[Eddie Rosario]], the Miracle won the first half in the FSL South with a 45\u201322 record. The 45 wins tied the franchise record for the most in a single half and the winning percentage of .672 marked the best for a half in team history. Posting the best overall record in the Florida State League at 79\u201356 during the regular season, the Miracle again fell to the Stone Crabs in the FSL South Divisional Playoff. Charlotte held the league-best Fort Myers offense, that included the consensus top prospect in baseball [[Byron Buxton]], to just one run in a two-game sweep.\n\n==2014 Championship Season==\nEntering the {{Baseball year|2014}} season, the Miracle had appeared in the Florida State League Championship series twice; losing to the [[Daytona Cubs]] in 1995 and 2008. For a second consecutive season, Mientkiewicz led the Miracle to a first half title in the FSL South, narrowly edging the [[St. Lucie Mets]] by one game in the standings with a final day win, 4\u20130, over the [[Bradenton Marauders]]. Fort Myers finished with a first half record of 41\u201328 with a roster featuring top prospects [[Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos]], [[Jorge Polanco]] and Adam Brett Walker. During the 2014 campaign, Walker broke the Miracle franchise record for home runs in a season with 25; previously held by [[Brock Peterson]] with 21 in 2006. Walker was also a 2014 FSL All-Star Game MVP and Home Run Derby Champion at the 2014 FSL All-Star Game in [[Bradenton, Florida|Bradenton]], at [[McKechnie Field]]. In the second half, the Miracle posted a record of 41\u201329 for an overall mark of 82\u201357, second-best in team history.\n\nIn the FSL South Divisional Playoff, the Miracle faced Bradenton. Trailing 7\u20133 in the top of the fourth inning, Jason Kanzler hit an opposite field grand slam to tie the game in the first of a best-of-three series. After the fifth inning, play was halted for 58 minutes due to rain. When the game resumed in the top of the sixth, Dalton Hicks drove in the eventual game-winning run with a single. The Miracle won game one, 8\u20137, and Kanzler had six runs batted in. In game two, the Miracle scored six runs in the bottom of the third inning to take 6\u20131 lead. Miracle starter [[D. J. Baxendale]] earned the win with six innings allowing just one unearned run and five strikeouts. After a two-game sweep of the Marauders, the Miracle advanced to the FSL Championship series for the third time in team history.\n\nFacing the Cubs again, the Miracle hosted the first two games of the best-of-five series at [[JetBlue Park at Fenway South|JetBlue Park]]. The Miracle pitching staff allowed just one run in a pair of wins. Fort Myers took game one, 5\u20131, and game two, 5\u20130. With a 2\u20130 series lead for the Miracle, the Cubs staved off elimination in game three at [[Jackie Robinson Ballpark]] in Daytona, Florida After a two-hour, seven-minute delay, the Cubs and Miracle engaged in a back-and-forth battle with Daytona eventually going on to win, 8\u20137. The Cubs trailed 6\u20135 in the bottom of the eighth inning, but took the lead on a three-run homer by Wilson Contreras. After the Cubs' win, the two teams had to wait a day after heavy storms made the field in Daytona unplayable. On Monday, September 8, the Miracle and Cubs played game four. Fort Myers built a 2\u20130 lead midway through the fourth inning. Daytona tied the game in the sixth. Going into extra innings, Kanzler gave the Miracle a 4\u20132 lead with a two-run homer in the top of the eleventh. Zack Jones recorded a perfect ninth inning, striking out Contreras for the save. The FSL Championship was the first in team history since moving to Fort Myers in 1992. The series win also marked the first time the Daytona Cubs had lost a FSL Playoff series.\n\n==Season-by-season==\nThese statistics are current through the 2019 season, and include only seasons dating back to when the team was first called the Miracle.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\"|<small>'''League champions''' \u2020</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#DDFFDD\"|<small>'''Finals appearance''' *</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#D0E7FF\"|<small>'''Division winner''' ^</small>\n|bgcolor=\"#96CDCD\"|<small>'''Wild card berth''' \u00a4</small>\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;

About 5% are of [[Hispanic]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] descent.\n\nOf the 484 households, over 375 of them held families and of those families 185, or 38.2% of the total households with children under the age of 18. 61.2% of households were of married couples, 4.5% were only male householders, 11.8% were only female householders, and 22.5% of households were nonfamily residences. The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 3.05 people.\n\nElgin's population age is fairly evenly spread, leaning only slightly toward the younger generations. 29.9% of people are under the age of 20, 26.1% are between the age of 20 and 40, 28.3% are between the age of 40 and 60, 15.7% are over the age of 60.

The small community that the post office served adopted the name Jeffers after its first postmaster, William T. Jeffers.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> The community did not see much growth until the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] began expansion in the area in 1900. Development occurred near the railroad depot and post office. Seaboard agents, in an effort to increase use of the rail line, promoted business all along its route, including Jeffers. The town, and post office, was eventually renamed Blaney in honor of a New York banker who helped fund the railroad expansion in the region.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /><ref name=\"AE\">{{cite web|title=About Elgin, South Carolina|url=http://townofelginsc.com/about|work=Town of Elgin, South Carolina}}</ref> The town of Blaney was officially chartered and incorporated on January 23, 1907.\n\nBlaney's first postmaster, Jesse T. Ross (who served for forty-seven years), was the first man to open a business, together with D. D. Evans. The village erected a brick schoolhouse was erected in 1912. Very little growth was seen in the town during the next 15 years; the ''Camden Chronicle'' said in 1927: \"I don't think there were fifty people in [Blaney], in fact you wouldn't know it was a town.\" However, by 1930, Blaney had built its own high school. In 1931 [[U.S. Highway 1]] was completed. A fully paved road extending along the length of the eastern seaboard, it ran parallel to the already established rail line as it cut through Blaney. This offered a new route to bring in tourism and business to the area. It is still the main route into the town today.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" />\n\nIn the late 1950s, postwar industrial development took place throughout the West Wateree Area along U.S. Highway 1. In 1958 a deal was closed with the Whitehead Brothers Sand Company, which opened up a $300,000 sand foundry between Lugoff and Blaney.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> State Senator John West recruited the [[Elgin National Watch Company]] in 1962 to relocate to the area. The company was attracted to the unused land and potential labor market to be recruited from nearby Columbia.<ref name=\"AE\" /> Residents voted to change the town's name from Blaney to Elgin in a landslide 61-16 vote. In September 1962, plans were confirmed to build a $1 million assembly plant in the town. The plant offered 240 jobs and received over a thousand applications when the hiring process started.\n\nDue to the new plant, the town upgraded the area's water supply system. By 1963, Elgin was drilling wells as part of a new $150,000 water system, and the plant had begun production.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> In 1967, officials from the Elgin National Watch Company announced that the plant would be sold to [[B. F. Goodrich]], a manufacturer of tennis shoes, due to the company's inability to compete with foreign-made products. That year, the Hardwicke Chemical Company broke ground at a 15-acre site near Elgin.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" />\n\nElgin's growth has continued in recent years. In 2005, a new sewer system was completed for the town and a new municipal complex was finished to house the town hall, police department, and fire station.<ref name=\"COC\">{{cite web|title=Elgin|url=http://www.kershawcountychamber.org/pages/Elgin/|work=Kershaw County Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Center|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> The town grew by over 50% between the 2000 and 2010 census, going from 806 to 1311 residents with continued growth expected in the future.

About 5% are of [[Hispanic]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] descent.\n\nOf the 484 households, over 375 of them held families and of those families 185, or 38.2% of the total households with children under the age of 18. 61.2% of households were of married couples, 4.5% were only male householders, 11.8% were only female householders, and 22.5% of households were nonfamily residences. The average household size was 2.71 and the average family size was 3.05 people.\n\nElgin's population age is fairly evenly spread, leaning only slightly toward the younger generations. 29.9% of people are under the age of 20, 26.1% are between the age of 20 and 40, 28.3% are between the age of 40 and 60, 15.7% are over the age of 60. The median for the town is 36.8 years of age.\n\nAs of the 2010 census, most of the population, 89.1%, of Elgin is a high school graduate or higher. The median income for a single household was $58,500, with the median family income being $66,350.

The small community that the post office served adopted the name Jeffers after its first postmaster, William T. Jeffers.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> The community did not see much growth until the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] began expansion in the area in 1900. Development occurred near the railroad depot and post office. Seaboard agents, in an effort to increase use of the rail line, promoted business all along its route, including Jeffers. The town, and post office, was eventually renamed Blaney in honor of a New York banker who helped fund the railroad expansion in the region.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /><ref name=\"AE\">{{cite web|title=About Elgin, South Carolina|url=http://townofelginsc.com/about|work=Town of Elgin, South Carolina}}</ref> The town of Blaney was officially chartered and incorporated on January 23, 1907.\n\nBlaney's first postmaster, Jesse T. Ross (who served for forty-seven years), was the first man to open a business, together with D. D. Evans. The village erected a brick schoolhouse was erected in 1912. Very little growth was seen in the town during the next 15 years; the ''Camden Chronicle'' said in 1927: \"I don't think there were fifty people in [Blaney], in fact you wouldn't know it was a town.\" However, by 1930, Blaney had built its own high school. In 1931 [[U.S. Highway 1]] was completed. A fully paved road extending along the length of the eastern seaboard, it ran parallel to the already established rail line as it cut through Blaney. This offered a new route to bring in tourism and business to the area. It is still the main route into the town today.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" />\n\nIn the late 1950s, postwar industrial development took place throughout the West Wateree Area along U.S. Highway 1. In 1958 a deal was closed with the Whitehead Brothers Sand Company, which opened up a $300,000 sand foundry between Lugoff and Blaney.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> State Senator John West recruited the [[Elgin National Watch Company]] in 1962 to relocate to the area. The company was attracted to the unused land and potential labor market to be recruited from nearby Columbia.<ref name=\"AE\" /> Residents voted to change the town's name from Blaney to Elgin in a landslide 61-16 vote. In September 1962, plans were confirmed to build a $1 million assembly plant in the town. The plant offered 240 jobs and received over a thousand applications when the hiring process started.\n\nDue to the new plant, the town upgraded the area's water supply system. By 1963, Elgin was drilling wells as part of a new $150,000 water system, and the plant had begun production.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" /> In 1967, officials from the Elgin National Watch Company announced that the plant would be sold to [[B. F. Goodrich]], a manufacturer of tennis shoes, due to the company's inability to compete with foreign-made products. That year, the Hardwicke Chemical Company broke ground at a 15-acre site near Elgin.<ref name=\"AHKCSC\" />\n\nElgin's growth has continued in recent years. In 2005, a new sewer system was completed for the town and a new municipal complex was finished to house the town hall, police department, and fire station.<ref name=\"COC\">{{cite web|title=Elgin|url=http://www.kershawcountychamber.org/pages/Elgin/|work=Kershaw County Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Center|accessdate=7 June 2013}}</ref> The town grew by over 50% between the 2000 and 2010 census, going from 806 to 1311 residents with continued growth expected in the future.
