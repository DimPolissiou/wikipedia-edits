His work was later extended by writers such as [[L\u00e9on Denis]], [[Gabriel Delanne]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Ernesto Bozzano]], [[Gustav Geley]], [[Chico Xavier]], [[Divaldo Pereira Franco]], Em\u00eddio Brasileiro, [[Alexandr Aksakov]], [[William Crookes]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert de Rochas]], and [[Amalia Domingo Soler]]. Kardec's research was influenced by the [[Fox sisters]] and the use of [[ouija|talking boards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Interest in [[Mesmerism]] also contributed to early Spiritism.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Swedenborg===\n{{Main|Emanuel Swedenborg}}\n[[File:Emanuel Swedenborg, 1688-1772, \u00e4mbetsman (Per Krafft d.\u00e4.) - Nationalmuseum - 15710.tif|thumb|[[Emanuel Swedenborg]], 75, holding the manuscript of ''Apocalypsis Revelata'' (1766).]]\nEmanuel Swedenborg (January 29, 1688 \u2013 March 29, 1772) was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[scientist]], [[philosopher]], [[clairvoyance|seer]], and [[theologian]]. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\n\nSwedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work ''Apocalypse Explained,'' #1182.4, he wrote, \"Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/apocalypsis-explicata/contents/11820 | title=Apocalypse Explained #1182 (Tansley (1952)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref> See also ''Heaven and Hell'' #249<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/de-coelo-et-de-inferno/contents/2490 | title=Heaven and Hell #249 (Dole (2000)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Fox sisters===\n{{Main|Fox sisters}}\n[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|thumb|[[Fox sisters]], ''left to right:'' Margaret, Kate, Leah]]\n\nSisters Leah (1814\u201390), Margaretta (1836\u201393), and Catherine (1838\u201392) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or [[psychography]], and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSkeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Talking boards===\n{{Main|Ouija}}\n{{See also|Table-turning}}\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Planchette]], the precursor of the pencil-less [[Ouija]] boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.<ref name=\"sargent\">[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Sargent, Epes]], [https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich ''Planchette or, The Despair of Science''], Roberts Brothers, Boston, 1869</ref>\n\n===Franz Mesmer===\n{{Main|Franz Mesmer}}\n[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Anton Mesmer]]]]\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 \u2013 March 5, 1815) discovered what he called ''magn\u00e9tisme animal'' ([[animal magnetism]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which became known as ''mesmerism''. The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795\u20131860) to develop [[hypnotism]] in 1841.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSpiritism incorporated various concepts from [[Mesmerism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} among them [[faith healing]] and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Difference from spiritualism==\nSpiritism differs from Spiritualism primarily in that it believes in reincarnation.  Spiritism was not accepted by UK and US Spiritualists of the day as they were undecided whether or not to agree with the Spiritist view on reincarnation.<ref>[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co</ref>\n\nIn ''[[What Is Spiritism?]]'', Kardec calls Spiritism a science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and human beings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Thus, some Spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral grounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAnother author in the Spiritualist movement, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] included a chapter<ref>[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co</ref> about Spiritism in his book ''History of Spiritualism'', in which he states that Spiritism is Spiritualist, but not vice versa.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Many Spiritualist works are widely accepted in Spiritism, particularly the works of 19th-century physicists [[William Crookes]]<ref>[[William Crookes]].

His essays and articles were posthumously collected into the ''Posthumous Works''.\n\n===Fundamental principles===\nAs defined in ''[[The Spirits' Book]]'', the main principles of spiritism are:\n* \"God is the Supreme Intelligence-[[Primum movens|First Cause]] of all things.\"<ref name=Kardec63>Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 63.</ref>\n* \"God is eternal, immutable, immaterial, unique, all powerful, sovereignly just and good.\"<ref name=Kardec32>Allan Kardec: ''The Spirits' Book'', page 32.</ref>\n* \"A spirit is not an abstract, undefined being, only to be conceived of by our thought; it is a real, circumscribed being, which, in certain cases, is appreciable by the senses of sight, hearing, and touch.\"<ref name=Kardec32 />\n* \"All Spirits are destined to attain perfection by passing through the different degrees of the spirit-hierarchy.

In contrast, they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as [[psychography]] or [[automatic writing]]).<ref>(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)</ref>\n\n==Spiritist practice==\n{{Main|Spiritist practice}}\nKardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices. Instead, the doctrine suggests that followers adhere to some principles common to all religions. The religious experience within spiritism is, therefore, largely informal.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Meetings===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nThe most important types of practices within Spiritism are:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n* Regular meetings&mdash;with a regular schedule, usually on evenings, two or three times a week.

These meetings are open to anyone;\n* [[Spiritist s\u00e9ance|Medium meetings]]&mdash;usually held after a regular meeting, only those deemed prepared or \"in need\" are expected to attend;\n* Youth and children's meetings&mdash;once a week, usually on Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings; the Spiritist equivalent to Protestant Christian Sunday schools;\n* [[Spiritist healing|Healing]];\n* Lectures&mdash;longer, in-depth lectures to a broader audience on subjects thought to be \"of general interest\", sometimes at theatres or ballrooms, often given by guest speakers;\n* Special meetings&mdash;s\u00e9ances held discretely, intended to conduct some worthy work;\n* Spiritist week and book fairs.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Main|Spiritist centre}}\n\nSpiritist associations have various degrees of formality, with some groups having local, regional, national or international scope.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Local organizations are usually called ''[[Spiritist centre]]s'' or ''Spiritist societies''.

Kardec's own introductory book on Spiritism, ''[[What is Spiritism?]]'', published only two years after ''[[The Spirits' Book]]'', includes a hypothetical discussion between him and three idealized critics, \"The Critic\", \"The Skeptic\", and \"The Priest\", summing up much of the criticism Spiritism has received. The broad areas of criticism relate to [[charlatan]]ism, [[pseudoscience]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[witchcraft]], and [[Satanism]]. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the ''Revue Spirite''.\n\nLater, a new source of criticism came from [[Occult]]ist movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], a competing new religion,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even na\u00efve.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/corson/cors-lt1.htm |title= Letter to Prof. Hiram Corson |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Blavatsky |first= H.

His work was later extended by writers such as [[L\u00e9on Denis]], [[Gabriel Delanne]], [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], [[Ernesto Bozzano]], [[Gustav Geley]], [[Chico Xavier]], [[Divaldo Pereira Franco]], Em\u00eddio Brasileiro, [[Alexandr Aksakov]], [[William Crookes]], [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Albert de Rochas]], and [[Amalia Domingo Soler]]. Kardec's research was influenced by the [[Fox sisters]] and the use of [[ouija|talking boards]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Interest in [[Mesmerism]] also contributed to early Spiritism.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Swedenborg===\n{{Main|Emanuel Swedenborg}}\n[[File:Emanuel Swedenborg, 1688-1772, \u00e4mbetsman (Per Krafft d.\u00e4.) - Nationalmuseum - 15710.tif|thumb|[[Emanuel Swedenborg]], 75, holding the manuscript of ''Apocalypsis Revelata'' (1766).]]\nEmanuel Swedenborg (January 29, 1688 \u2013 March 29, 1772) was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[scientist]], [[philosopher]], [[clairvoyance|seer]], and [[theologian]]. Swedenborg had a prolific career as an inventor and scientist. At 56, he claimed to have experienced visions of the spiritual world and talked with angels, devils, and spirits by visiting [[heaven]] and [[hell]]. He claimed he was directed by the Lord Jesus Christ to reveal the doctrines of his second coming.\n\nSwedenborg, however, warned against seeking contact with spirits. In his work ''Apocalypse Explained,'' #1182.4, he wrote, \"Many persons believe that man can be taught by the Lord by means of spirits speaking with him. But those who believe this, and desire to do so, are not aware that it is associated with danger to their souls.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/apocalypsis-explicata/contents/11820 | title=Apocalypse Explained #1182 (Tansley (1952)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref> See also ''Heaven and Hell'' #249<ref>{{cite web | url=http://newchristianbiblestudy.org/exposition/work/de-coelo-et-de-inferno/contents/2490 | title=Heaven and Hell #249 (Dole (2000)) - New Christian Bible Study}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Swedenborg is often cited by Spiritists as a major precursor for their beliefs.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Fox sisters===\n{{Main|Fox sisters}}\n[[File:Fox sisters.jpeg|thumb|[[Fox sisters]], ''left to right:'' Margaret, Kate, Leah]]\n\nSisters Leah (1814\u201390), Margaretta (1836\u201393), and Catherine (1838\u201392) Fox played an important role in the development of Modern Spiritualism. The daughters of John and Margaret Fox, they were residents of Hydesville, New York. In 1848, the family began to hear unexplained rapping sounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Kate and Maggie conducted channeling sessions in an attempt to contact the presumed spiritual entity creating the sounds, and claimed contact with the spirit of a peddler who was allegedly murdered and buried beneath the house. A skeleton later found in the basement seemed to confirm this. The Fox girls became instant celebrities. They demonstrated their communication with the spirit by using taps and knocks, automatic writing or [[psychography]], and later even voice communication, as the spirit took control of one of the girls.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSkeptics suspected this was deception and fraud, and sister Margaretta eventually confessed to using her toe-joints to produce the sound. Although she later recanted this confession, she and her sister Catherine were widely considered discredited, and died in poverty. Nonetheless, belief in the ability to communicate with the dead grew rapidly, becoming a religious movement called Spiritualism, which contributed significantly to Kardec's ideas.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Talking boards===\n{{Main|Ouija}}\n{{See also|Table-turning}}\nAfter the news of the Fox sisters came to France, people became more interested in what was sometimes termed the \"Spiritual Telegraph\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} [[Planchette]], the precursor of the pencil-less [[Ouija]] boards, simplified the writing process which achieved widespread popularity in America and Europe.<ref name=\"sargent\">[[Epes Sargent (poet)|Sargent, Epes]], [https://archive.org/details/despairofscience00sargrich ''Planchette or, The Despair of Science''], Roberts Brothers, Boston, 1869</ref>\n\n===Franz Mesmer===\n{{Main|Franz Mesmer}}\n[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|[[Franz Anton Mesmer]]]]\n\nFranz Anton Mesmer (May 23, 1734 \u2013 March 5, 1815) discovered what he called ''magn\u00e9tisme animal'' ([[animal magnetism]]),{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which became known as ''mesmerism''. The evolution of Mesmer's ideas and practices led Scottish surgeon [[James Braid (surgeon)|James Braid]] (1795\u20131860) to develop [[hypnotism]] in 1841.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nSpiritism incorporated various concepts from [[Mesmerism]],{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} among them [[faith healing]] and the energization of water to be used as a medicine.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Difference from spiritualism==\nSpiritism differs from Spiritualism primarily in that it believes in reincarnation.  Spiritism was not accepted by UK and US Spiritualists of the day as they were undecided whether or not to agree with the Spiritist view on reincarnation.<ref>[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co</ref>\n\nIn ''[[What Is Spiritism?]]'', Kardec calls Spiritism a science dedicated to the relationship between incorporeal beings (spirits) and human beings.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Thus, some Spiritists see themselves as not adhering to a religion, but to a philosophical doctrine with a scientific fulcrum and moral grounds.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAnother author in the Spiritualist movement, [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] included a chapter<ref>[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. (1926). ''The History of Spiritualism''. New York: G.H. Doran, Co</ref> about Spiritism in his book ''History of Spiritualism'', in which he states that Spiritism is Spiritualist, but not vice versa.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Many Spiritualist works are widely accepted in Spiritism, particularly the works of 19th-century physicists [[William Crookes]]<ref>[[William Crookes]].

In contrast, they believe that mediums have these natural abilities highly developed, and are able to communicate with spirits and interact with them visually or audibly, or through writing (known by Kardecists as [[psychography]] or [[automatic writing]]).<ref>(See The Book of Mediums by Allan Kardec Chapters X to XIII)</ref>\n\n==Spiritist practice==\n{{Main|Spiritist practice}}\nKardec's works do not establish any rituals or formal practices. Instead, the doctrine suggests that followers adhere to some principles common to all religions. The religious experience within spiritism is, therefore, largely informal.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Meetings===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}\nThe most important types of practices within Spiritism are:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n* Regular meetings&mdash;with a regular schedule, usually on evenings, two or three times a week.

These meetings are open to anyone;\n* [[Spiritist s\u00e9ance|Medium meetings]]&mdash;usually held after a regular meeting, only those deemed prepared or \"in need\" are expected to attend;\n* Youth and children's meetings&mdash;once a week, usually on Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings; the Spiritist equivalent to Protestant Christian Sunday schools;\n* [[Spiritist healing|Healing]];\n* Lectures&mdash;longer, in-depth lectures to a broader audience on subjects thought to be \"of general interest\", sometimes at theatres or ballrooms, often given by guest speakers;\n* Special meetings&mdash;s\u00e9ances held discretely, intended to conduct some worthy work;\n* Spiritist week and book fairs.\n\n===Organization===\n{{Main|Spiritist centre}}\n\nSpiritist associations have various degrees of formality, with some groups having local, regional, national or international scope.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Local organizations are usually called ''[[Spiritist centre]]s'' or ''Spiritist societies''.

The broad areas of criticism relate to [[charlatan]]ism, [[pseudoscience]], [[Christian heresy|heresy]], [[witchcraft]], and [[Satanism]]. Until his death, Kardec continued to address these issues in various books and in his periodical, the ''Revue Spirite''.\n\nLater, a new source of criticism came from [[Occult]]ist movements such as the [[Theosophical Society]], a competing new religion,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} which saw the Spiritist explanations as too simple or even na\u00efve.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/corson/cors-lt1.htm |title= Letter to Prof. Hiram Corson |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |last= Blavatsky |first= H.

In 1991, during the [[Gulf War]], she was fitted with an extensive and fully functional hospital to assume the additional role of Primary Casualty Receiving Ship.

Having been initially designed as a [[container ship]], she would have been too unstable when unloaded, making her motion at sea \"very stiff\" which resulted in a very short roll period which is not appropriate for operating helicopters. Therefore, her superstructure is deliberately heavily built (weighing some 800 tons), and she has 1,800 tons of [[concrete]] [[Sailing ballast|ballast]] carried in former hatch covers, which have been inverted to form tray-like structures.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rebuilding the Royal Navy : Warship Design Since 1945 |first1= D.

The ship has a small secondary superstructure approximately two-thirds of the way down the flight deck, containing the ship's exhaust funnel. This is used by small helicopters to simulate landing on the flight deck of a destroyer or frigate.\n\nFor the 1991 [[Gulf War]] ''Argus'' was fitted with a fully functional hospital, which has since been modified and extensively augmented with specialist equipment, providing 70 beds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/our-organisation/the-fighting-arms/royal-fleet-auxiliary/casualty-ship/rfa-argus |title=Casualty Ship (RFA Argus) |work=Royal Navy |accessdate=26 September 2015}}</ref> The ship is equipped with an [[intensive-care unit]], and can provide [[X-ray#Medical uses|medical x-ray]] and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT-scan]] services. Casualties can be quickly transferred from the deck directly into the [[Triage|assessment]] area. In recent years the ship's role as a Primary Casualty Receiving Ship, rather than her aviation training duties, has been considered her primary role.\n\nIn 2007 the ship was refitted with upgraded hospital facilities (replacing the forward aircraft lift with a ramp for emergency exit for hospital trollies and patients as well as two 50-man passenger lifts that lead to a new structure erected on the flight deck), generators and aviation systems (the ship is due to receive an upgrade to its night-vision capabilities enabling the use of [[WAH-64 Apache]] helicopters) to give an operational life until 2020.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/6649989.stm |title=Refit of navy ship RFA Argus ends |work=[[BBC News]] |date=12 May 2007 |publisher= [[British Broadcasting Corporation |BBC]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |accessdate=14 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n\n===1990s===\n''Argus'' entered service with the RFA in 1988, replacing {{Ship|RFA|Engadine}} in the aviation training role.

During this period, ''Argus'' operated in part as a [[Landing Platform, Helicopter|LPH]]. Her unsuitability for this role was a major factor in the commissioning of {{HMS|Ocean|L12|6}}.\n\n===2000s===\nDuring times of war RFA ''Argus'' acts as a floating hospital with two fully equipped wards and mortuary.  The hospital was utilised in this way off the coast of Freetown in 2000\u201301, in support of British operations against the rebel [[West Side Boys]].\n\nA programme to replace ''Argus'' called the Joint Casualty Treatment Ship (JCTS) was put on hold in December 2001 after passing initial approval.  The Integrated Project Team (IPT) managing the project was subsequently disbanded in 2005. ''Argus'' was most recently stationed at her home port of [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] in [[Cornwall]], England, though being an RFA ship means that she also uses the former naval dockyard on [[Portland, Dorset|Portland]] in [[Dorset]], England.\n\nIn 2003 ''Argus'' was deployed again to the Gulf as a Primary Casualty Reception Ship during [[Operation Telic]].

It is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film. ''Raja Harishchandra'' features [[D. D. Dabke|Dattatraya Damodar Dabke]], [[Anna Salunke]], Bhalchandra Phalke, and Gajanan Vasudev Sane and is based on the legend of [[Harishchandra]], with Dabke portraying the title character. The film, being silent, had English, [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Hindi]]-language [[intertitle]]s.\n\nPhalke decided to make a feature film after watching ''The Life of Christ'' (1906) at a theatre in Bombay, now known as [[Mumbai]]. He went to London for two weeks to learn filmmaking techniques and founded Phalke Films Company. He imported the hardware required for the filmmaking and [[Film distribution|exhibition]] from England, France, Germany, and the United States. Phalke shot a short film ''Ankurachi Wadh'' (''Growth of a Pea Plant'') to attract investors for his venture. He published advertisements in various newspapers calling for the cast and crew. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Phalke was in charge of [[scriptment]], direction, [[Production designer|production design]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], film editing, along with [[Photographic processing|film processing]]. [[Trymbak B. Telang]] handled the camera. Phalke completed filming in six months and 27 days producing a film of {{Convert|3700|ft}}, about four reels.\n\nThe film [[premiere]]d at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay, on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on 3 May 1913 at the [[Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall]], [[Girgaon]]. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the [[Cinema of India|film industry in the country]]. The film is [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost]]; only the first and last reels of the film are preserved at the [[National Film Archive of India]]. Some film historians believe these belong to a 1917 remake of the film by Phalke titled ''[[Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra]]''.\n\nThe status of ''Raja Harishchandra'' as the first full-length Indian feature film has been debated. Some film historians consider [[Dadasaheb Torne]]'s silent film ''[[Shree Pundalik]]'', released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The [[Government of India]], however, recognises ''Raja Harischandra'' as the first Indian feature film.\n\n== Plot ==\nKing [[Harishchandra]] ([[D. D. Dabke]]) is shown teaching his son, Rohitashva (Bhalchandra Phalke), how to shoot with a bow and arrow in the presence of Queen Taramati ([[Anna Salunke]]). His citizens ask him to go on a hunting expedition. While on the hunt, Harishchandra hears the cries of some women. He reaches a place where the sage [[Vishvamitra]] (Gajanan Sane) is performing a ''[[yajna]]'' to get help from ''[[Gu\u1e47a|Triguna]]'' ''[[Shakti]]'' (''three powers'') against their will.{{efn|As per the [[Samkhya]] [[hindu philosophy]], [[Prak\u1e5bti]] is one of two eternal principles.

To appease Vishvamitra's wrath, Harishchandra offers his kingdom. Returning to the royal palace, he informs Taramati of the happenings. Vishvamitra sends Harishchandra, Taramati, and Rohitashva in exile and asks them to arrange for ''[[dakshina]]''.

An advertisement for the film published in ''[[The Bombay Chronicle]]'' had a note added at the end that the ticket rates would be double the usual rates.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=48}} The film had a houseful run for a week, and it was extended for twelve more days. A special show was scheduled on 17 May for women and children only at half rates.

As there were no film distributors in those days, Phalke had to move the film, the projector, an operator, and some assistants from place to place. When the film was screened for a week at the Nawabi Theatre in [[Surat]], Phalke signed a temporary agreement for 50% partnership with the theatre owner. Despite advertising the film, at its first showing the film met with a lukewarm response. Disappointed by the earnings of only {{INR}}3, the owner asked Phalke either to cancel the show, increase its length, or reduce ticket prices. Phalke politely rejected these suggestions.{{sfn|Watve|2012|p=50}} He issued an advertisement in the [[Gujarati language]] calling on people to see \"57,000 photographs of three-quarters of an inch width and two miles length\", for just one [[Indian anna]].

It is often considered the first full-length Indian feature film. ''Raja Harishchandra'' features [[D. D. Dabke|Dattatraya Damodar Dabke]], [[Anna Salunke]], Bhalchandra Phalke, and Gajanan Vasudev Sane and is based on the legend of [[Harishchandra]], with Dabke portraying the title character. The film, being silent, had English, [[Marathi language|Marathi]], and [[Hindi]]-language [[intertitle]]s.\n\nPhalke decided to make a feature film after watching ''The Life of Christ'' (1906) at a theatre in Bombay, now known as [[Mumbai]]. He went to London for two weeks to learn filmmaking techniques and founded Phalke Films Company. He imported the hardware required for the filmmaking and [[Film distribution|exhibition]] from England, France, Germany, and the United States. Phalke shot a short film ''Ankurachi Wadh'' (''Growth of a Pea Plant'') to attract investors for his venture. He published advertisements in various newspapers calling for the cast and crew. As no women were available to play female leads, male actors performed the female roles. Phalke was in charge of [[scriptment]], direction, [[Production designer|production design]], [[Theatrical makeup|make-up]], film editing, along with [[Photographic processing|film processing]]. [[Trymbak B. Telang]] handled the camera. Phalke completed filming in six months and 27 days producing a film of {{Convert|3700|ft}}, about four reels.\n\nThe film [[premiere]]d at the Olympia Theatre, Bombay, on 21 April 1913, and had its theatrical release on 3 May 1913 at the [[Coronation Cinematograph and Variety Hall]], [[Girgaon]]. It was a commercial success and laid the foundation for the [[Cinema of India|film industry in the country]]. The film is [[List of incomplete or partially lost films|partially lost]]; only the first and last reels of the film are preserved at the [[National Film Archive of India]]. Some film historians believe these belong to a 1917 remake of the film by Phalke titled ''[[Satyavadi Raja Harishchandra]]''.\n\nThe status of ''Raja Harishchandra'' as the first full-length Indian feature film has been debated. Some film historians consider [[Dadasaheb Torne]]'s silent film ''[[Shree Pundalik]]'', released on 18 May 1912, the maiden Indian film. The [[Government of India]], however, recognises ''Raja Harischandra'' as the first Indian feature film.\n\n== Plot ==\nKing [[Harishchandra]] ([[D. D. Dabke]]) is shown teaching his son, Rohitashva (Bhalchandra Phalke), how to shoot with a bow and arrow in the presence of Queen Taramati ([[Anna Salunke]]). His citizens ask him to go on a hunting expedition. While on the hunt, Harishchandra hears the cries of some women. He reaches a place where the sage [[Vishvamitra]] (Gajanan Sane) is performing a ''[[yajna]]'' to get help from ''[[Gu\u1e47a|Triguna]]'' ''[[Shakti]]'' (''three powers'') against their will.{{efn|As per the [[Samkhya]] [[hindu philosophy]], [[Prak\u1e5bti]] is one of two eternal principles.

To appease Vishvamitra's wrath, Harishchandra offers his kingdom. Returning to the royal palace, he informs Taramati of the happenings. Vishvamitra sends Harishchandra, Taramati, and Rohitashva in exile and asks them to arrange for ''[[dakshina]]''. While in exile, Rohitashva dies and Harishchandra sends Taramati to ask the [[Doms|Dom]] king for arranging a free cremation. While Taramati is on her way to meet the Dom king, Vishvamitra frames her for the murder of the prince of [[Varanasi|Kashi]]. Taramati faces trial, pleads guilty and is ordered to be beheaded by Harishchandra. When he raises his sword to complete his task, a pleased Lord [[Shiva]] appears. Vishvamitra reveals that he was examining Harishchandra's integrity, returns the crown to him and brings Rohitashva back to life.{{sfn|Raheja|Kothari|2004|p=17}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rajadhyaksha |first=Ashish |title=Interrogating Modernity: Culture and Colonialism in India |publisher=Seagull Books |year=1993 |isbn=978-81-7046-109-8 |editor-last=Niranjana |editor-first=Tejaswini |editor-link=Tejaswini Niranjana |pages=76\u201380 |chapter=The Phalke Era: Conflict of Traditional Form and Modern Technology |ref=harv |editor-last2=Dhareshwar |editor-first2=Vivek |editor-last3=Sudhir |editor-first3=P. |chapter-url=http://cscs.res.in/dataarchive/textfiles/textfile.2008-02-06.6750403959/file |chapter-format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119041010/http://cscs.res.in/dataarchive/textfiles/textfile.2008-02-06.6750403959/file |archive-date=19 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[D.

On the evening of October&nbsp;20, discrete [[supercell]] thunderstorms developed across the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], contributing to several tornadoes. One of those tornadoes caused EF3 damage in the Dallas suburbs, becoming the costliest tornado event in Texas history, at $1.55&nbsp;billion.

This was the only EF3 damage found along the path.]]\nAt 8:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT on October 20, a tornado began in [[Dallas County, Texas]], near the interaction of State Highway 348 and Luna Road, snapping large tree limbs. The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] reaching high-end EF2 strength. A strip mall was severely damaged, sustaining roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls. Several other retail businesses were also damaged in this area. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a commercial building had their roofs ripped off, and also sustained loss of some exterior walls. Numerous homes, along with churches and gas station also sustained heavy damage in this area. Maintaining EF2 strength, the tornado moved across Marsh Lane and through areas east, heavily damaging [[List of Dallas ISD schools|Cary Middle School]] and [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]. The tornado produced a mixture of EF1 and EF2 damage as it moved through residential neighborhoods to the northeast of this area, downing numerous trees, and causing moderate to significant damage to many houses. Dozens of homes along this portion of the path had their roofs torn off, several of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. The most intense pocket of damage occurred along Northhaven Road, where one well-built brick home had its roof torn off, and sustained collapse of most exterior walls. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado then moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a more northeasterly course, causing mainly EF1 damage. [[Walnut Hill Elementary School (Dallas)|Walnut Hill Elementary School]] was also moderately damaged. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building had numerous windows blown out. Many north of [[Richland College]] also suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. A few homes had their roofs blown off at high-end EF1 intensity. The weakening tornado then curved sharply to the north, continuing into the Huffhines Park area. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of minor damage to homes, along with numerous trees and tree limbs downed. Weakening further to EF0 strength, the tornado decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.

A later [[squall line]] contributed to additional tornadoes and a widespread swath of damaging winds as the system tracked eastward.\n\n==Meteorological synopsis==\nThe first signs of organized severe weather across the [[South Central United States]] came on October&nbsp;16, when the [[Storm Prediction Center]] (SPC) first delineated a risk area across portions of northern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, and adjacent portions of Kansas, Missouri, and Arkansas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Elizabeth Leitman|title=Day 4-8 Severe Weather Outlook Issued on Oct 16, 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/exper/day4-8/archive/2019/day4-8_20191016.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In their day&nbsp;3 outlook on October&nbsp;18, the organization introduced a broad Marginal risk for much of the same areas.<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 18, 2019 0730 UTC Day 3 Severe Thunderstorm Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day3otlk_20191018_0730.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A small Slight risk was added across northeastern Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, and western Arkansas on October&nbsp;19,<ref>{{cite web|author=Brynn Kerr|title=Oct 19, 2019 0600 UTC Day 2 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day2otlk_20191019_0600.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 19, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> but as confidence in a higher-end event increased, these same areas were raised to an Enhanced risk.<ref name=\"d1\">{{cite web|author=Roger Edwards|author2=Andy Dean|title=Oct 20, 2019 1300 UTC Day 1 Convective Outlook|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/outlook/archive/2019/day1otlk_20191020_1300.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> In advance of the outbreak, the SPC monitored several weather features of interest. In the upper levels of the atmosphere, an upper-level [[Trough (meteorology)|trough]] was expected to amplify as it progressed eastward into the U.S. Plains, providing increasing wind shear throughout the region. Simultaneously, a [[low-pressure area]] and associated [[cold front]] were anticipated to shift eastward across an unstable environment, leading to the formation of severe thunderstorms. Forecasters noted that while the overall environment supported the potential for significant ([[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF2+]]) tornadoes, questions about whether storms would be supercellular or instead evolve into a [[quasi-linear convective system]] prevented the addition a significant risk area.<ref name=\"d1\" /> By the late afternoon hours of October&nbsp;20, thunderstorms began to develop across eastern Oklahoma within a rapidly-moistening environment.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|author2=Jeremy Grams|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2089|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2089.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> At 7:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT, the first [[tornado watch]] was issued across the [[Ark-La-Tex]] region;<ref>{{cite web|title=Tornado Watch 676|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/watch/2019/ww0676.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> several more watches were introduced over subsequent hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Severe Weather Event Review for Sunday October 20 2019|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/archive/event.php?date=20191020|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> A pair of long-tracked supercells developed across [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] and [[Johnson County, Texas|Johnson]] counties, intersecting a very unstable regime and producing significant tornadoes as a result.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt Mosier|title=Mesoscale Discussion 2090|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/products/md/2019/md2090.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=January 23, 2020}}</ref> A squall line formed along the cold front farther west, producing a wide swath of damaging winds and additional tornadoes as it tracked across the South-Central United States.<ref name=\"dallas\">{{cite report|agency=National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Fort Worth, Texas|title=Texas Event Report: EF3 Tornado|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/stormevents/eventdetails.jsp?id=856409|publisher=National Centers for Environmental Information|year=2019|accessdate=January 21, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=SPC Storm Reports for 10/20/19|url=https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/191020_rpts.html|publisher=Storm Prediction Center|date=October 20, 2019|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Confirmed tornadoes==\n{{Tornado Chart\n|Total = 36\n|FU = 0\n|F0 = 13\n|F1 = 20\n|F2 = 2\n|F3 = 1\n|F4 = 0\n|F5 = 0\n|Enhanced=yes\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|+ Confirmed tornadoes during the tornado outbreak of October 20\u201322, 2019{{efn|All dates are based on the local [[time zone]] where the tornado touched down; however, all times are in [[Coordinated Universal Time]] for consistency.|group=note|name=Date/Time}}\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|[[Enhanced Fujita scale|EF#]]\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:7%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Location\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\" class=\"unsortable\"|County / Parish\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:5%; text-align:center;\"|State\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Start Coord.\n! scope=\"col\" width=\"7%\" align=\"center\"|Date\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Time ([[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]])\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Path length\n! scope=\"col\"  style=\"width:6%; text-align:center;\"|Max width\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:48%; text-align:center;\"|Summary\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" style=\"width:3%; text-align:center;\"|Refs\n|-\n|bgcolor={{storm colour|storm}} | EF0\n|SW of [[Beckville, Texas|Beckville]]\n|[[Panola County, Texas|Panola]]\n|[[Texas|TX]]\n|{{Coord|32.1470|-94.5443|name=Beckville (Oct. 20, EF0)}}\n|{{Sort|001|October&nbsp;20}}\n|00:36\u201300:38\n|{{convert|0.8|mi|km|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|{{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on|sortable=on}}\n|Several trees were snapped or uprooted.

This was the only EF3 damage found along the path.]]\nAt 8:58&nbsp;p.m. CDT on October 20, a tornado began in [[Dallas County, Texas]], near the interaction of State Highway 348 and Luna Road, snapping large tree limbs. The tornado moved east-northeast across [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|Interstate 35E]] reaching high-end EF2 strength. A strip mall was severely damaged, sustaining roof loss and collapse of multiple exterior walls. Several other retail businesses were also damaged in this area. Along Walnut Hill Lane, a multi-story apartment complex and a commercial building had their roofs ripped off, and also sustained loss of some exterior walls. Numerous homes, along with churches and gas station also sustained heavy damage in this area. Maintaining EF2 strength, the tornado moved across Marsh Lane and through areas east, heavily damaging [[List of Dallas ISD schools|Cary Middle School]] and [[Thomas Jefferson High School (Dallas)|Thomas Jefferson High School]]. The tornado produced a mixture of EF1 and EF2 damage as it moved through residential neighborhoods to the northeast of this area, downing numerous trees, and causing moderate to significant damage to many houses. Dozens of homes along this portion of the path had their roofs torn off, several of which sustained some failure of exterior walls. The most intense pocket of damage occurred along Northhaven Road, where one well-built brick home had its roof torn off, and sustained collapse of most exterior walls. Given the degree of damage, damage surveyors assigned low-end EF3 damage to that home, the only EF3 damage point assigned along the path of the tornado. The tornado then moved into southern [[Richardson, Texas|Richardson]], where several businesses, including a car dealership, a Home Depot, and office low-rise buildings, suffered EF2 damage. It crossed the [[Texas Instruments]] campus, now on a more northeasterly course, causing mainly EF1 damage. [[Walnut Hill Elementary School (Dallas)|Walnut Hill Elementary School]] was also moderately damaged. At an apartment complex near Walnut Street and Greenville Avenue, dozens of units had sections of roof missing. The nearby Cutters Point apartment complex was also affected, with significant roof loss consistent with EF2 damage. A low-rise office building had numerous windows blown out. Many north of [[Richland College]] also suffered EF2 damage before the tornado began to weaken. Widespread tree and roof damage consistent with an EF1 tornado was observed across the Richland Park, Lakes of Buckingham, Richland Meadows, and College Park subdivisions. A few homes had their roofs blown off at high-end EF1 intensity. The weakening tornado then curved sharply to the north, continuing into the Huffhines Park area. Damage along this portion of the path consisted of minor damage to homes, along with numerous trees and tree limbs downed. Weakening further to EF0 strength, the tornado decreased in width and finally dissipated while crossing Jupiter Road. In total, the tornado was on the ground for {{convert|15.76|mi|km|abbr=on}}, reached a maximum width of {{convert|1300|yd|m|abbr=on}}, and remained on the ground for 32&nbsp;minutes.<ref>{{cite web|title=NWS Damage Assessment Toolkit|url=https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/|publisher=National Weather Service|accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref> Additionally, the tornado caused about $1.55&nbsp;billion in damage, making it the costliest tornado event in Texas history.<ref name=\"dallas\" />\n\nAround 8:00 a.m. the next morning, approximately 242,000 people were without power.

These include religious approaches such as [[Creationism]] when identified as \"creation science\" that applies to the archaeology of historic periods such as those that would have included the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Noah's Ark]], and the supposed worldwide [[flood myth]]. Some pseudoarchaeological theories revolve around the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]], an idea propagated by those such as Italian author [[Peter Kolosimo]], French authors [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]] in ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1963), and Swiss author [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]] in ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' (1968). Others instead hold that there were human societies in the ancient period that were significantly technologically advanced, such as [[Atlantis]], and this idea has been propagated by figures like [[Graham Hancock]] in his ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995). Pseudoarchaeology has also been manifest in [[Mayanism]] and the [[2012 phenomenon]].\n\nMany alternative archaeologies have been adopted by religious groups. Fringe archaeological ideas such as [[archaeocryptography]] and [[pyramidology]] have been embraced by religions ranging from the [[British Israelites]] to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]. Other alternative archaeologies include those that have been adopted by members of [[New Age]] and [[Neopaganism|contemporary pagan]] belief systems.\n\nAcademic archaeologists have heavily criticised pseudoarchaeology, with one of the most vocal critics, John R. Cole, characterising it as relying on \"sensationalism, misuse of logic and evidence, misunderstanding of scientific method, and internal contradictions in their arguments\".<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\">[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 2.</ref> The relationship between alternative and academic archaeologies has been compared to the relationship between [[intelligent design]] theories and [[evolutionary biology]] by some archaeologists.<ref name=\"fagan721\">[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nVarious different terms have been employed to refer to these non-academic interpretations of archaeology. During the 1980s, the term \"cult archaeology\" was used by figures like John R. Cole (1980)<ref>[[#Col80|Cole 1980]].</ref> and William H. Stiebing Jr. (1987).<ref>[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]].</ref> \"Fantastic archaeology\" was used in the 1980s as the name of an undergraduate course at [[Harvard University]] taught by Stephen Williams, who published a book with the same title.<ref>[[#Wil91|Wiliams 1991]]</ref> In the 2000s, the term \"alternative archaeology\" began to be instead applied by academics like Tim Sebastion (2001),<ref>[[#Seb01|Sebastion 2001]].</ref> Robert J. Wallis (2003),<ref>[[#Wal03|Wallis 2003]].</ref> Cornelius Holtorf (2006),<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]].</ref> and Gabriel Moshenka (2008).<ref>[[#Mos08|Moshenka 2008]].</ref> Garrett F. Fagan and [[Kenneth Feder]] (2006) however claimed this term was only chosen because it \"imparts a warmer, fuzzier feel\" that \"appeals to our higher ideals and progressive inclinations\".<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> They argued that the term \"pseudoarchaeology\" was far more appropriate,<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> a term also used by other prominent academic and professional archaeologists such as [[Colin Renfrew]] (2006).<ref>[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]].</ref>\n\nOther academic archaeologists have chosen to use other terms to refer to these interpretations. [[Glyn Daniel]], the editor of ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', used the derogative \"bullshit archaeology\",<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> and similarly the academic William H. Stiebing Jr. noted that there were certain terms used for pseudoarchaeology that were heard \"in the privacy of professional archaeologists' homes and offices but which cannot be mentioned in polite society\".<ref>[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr 1987]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nWilliam H. Stiebing Jr. argued that despite their many differences, there were a set of core characteristics that almost all pseudoarchaeological interpretations shared. He believed that because of this, pseudoarchaeology could be categorised as a \"single phenomenon\". He went on to identify three core commonalities of pseudeoarchaeological theories: the unscientific nature of its method and evidence, its history of providing \"simple, compact answers to complex, difficult issues\", and its tendency to present itself as being persecuted by the archaeological establishment, accompanied by an ambivalent attitude towards the scientific ethos of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 2.</ref> This idea that there are core characteristics of pseudoarchaeologies is shared by other academics.<ref>Such as [[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 5.</ref>\n\n===Lack of scientific method===\nAcademic critics have pointed out that pseudoarchaeologists typically neglect to use the [[scientific method]]. Instead of testing the evidence to see what hypotheses it fits, pseudoarchaeologists \"press-gang\" the archaeological data to fit a \"favored conclusion\" that is often arrived at through hunches, intuition, or religious or nationalist dogma.<ref>[[#Fag06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.</ref><ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 27.</ref> Different pseudoarchaeological groups hold a variety of basic assumptions which are typically unscientific: the [[Nazi]] pseudoarchaeologists for instance took the cultural superiority of the ancient [[Aryan]] race as a basic assumption, whilst Christian [[fundamentalist]] pseudoarchaeologists conceive of the Earth as being less than 10,000 years old and Hindu fundamentalist pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' species is much older than the 200,000 years old it has been shown to be by archaeologists.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 28.</ref> Despite this, many of pseudoarchaeology's proponents claim that they reached their conclusions using scientific techniques and methods, even when it is demonstrable that they have not.<ref>[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. pp. 721\u201328.</ref><ref>[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. x.</ref>\n\nAcademic archaeologist John R. Cole believed that most pseudoarchaeologists do not understand how scientific investigation works, and that they instead believe it to be a \"simple, catastrophic right versus wrong battle\" between contesting theories.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 03\">[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 3.</ref> It was because of this failure to understand the scientific method, he argued, that the entire pseudoarchaeological approach to their arguments was faulty. He went on to argue that most pseudoarchaeologists do not consider alternative explanations to that which they want to propagate, and that their \"theories\" were typically just \"notions\", not having sufficient supporting evidence to allow them to be considered \"theories\" in the scientific, academic meaning of the word.<ref>[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nCommonly lacking scientific evidence, pseudoarchaeologists typically use other forms of evidence to support their arguments. For instance, they often make use of \"generalized cultural comparisons\", taking various artefacts and monuments from one society, and highlighting similarities with those of another to support a conclusion that both had a common source\u2014typically an ancient lost civilisation like [[Atlantis]], [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], or an extraterrestrial influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This takes the different artefacts or monuments entirely out of their original contexts, something which is anathema to academic archaeologists, for whom context is of the utmost importance.<ref name=\"fagan26\">[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 26.</ref>\n\nAnother form of evidence used by a number of pseudoarchaeologists is the interpretation of various [[mythology|myths]] as reflecting historical events, but in doing so these myths are often taken out of their cultural contexts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 3.</ref> For instance, pseudoarchaeologist [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] claimed that the myths of migrations and war gods in the Central American [[Aztec]] civilisation represented a cosmic catastrophe that occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.<ref>[[#Vel50|Velikovsky 1950]]. pp. 253\u2013254, 269.</ref> This was criticised by academic archaeologist William H. Stiebing Jr., who noted that such myths only developed in the 12th to the 14th centuries CE, over a millennium after Velikovsky claimed that the events had occurred, and that the Aztec society itself had not even developed by the 7th century BCE.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Opposition to the archaeological establishment===\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#F0F0F0|align=right|quote=[Academics] have formed a massive and global network through universities, museums, institutes, societies and foundations. And this immense powerhouse and clearing-house of knowledge has presented their dogma of history to the general public totally unhindered and unchallenged from the outside.&nbsp;... On a more sinister note: now this \"church of science\" has formed a network of watchdog organisations such as [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] and [[The Skeptics Society|The Skeptical Society]] {{sic}} (to name but a few) in order to act as the gatekeepers of the truth (as they see it), ready to come down like the proverbial ton of bricks on all those whom they perceive as \"frauds\", \"charlatans\", and \"pseudo-scientists\" \u2013 in short, heretics.|source=Pseudoarchaeologist Robert Bauval on his views of academia (2000)<ref>Quoted in [[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.</ref>}}\n\nPseudoarchaeologists typically present themselves as being underdogs facing the much larger archaeological establishment.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/><ref name=\"fagan721\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They often use language which disparages academics and dismisses them as being unadventurous, spending all their time in dusty libraries and refusing to challenge the orthodoxies of the establishment lest they lose their jobs. In some more extreme examples, pseudoarchaeologists have accused academic archaeologists of being members of a widespread [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to hide the truth about history from the public.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. pp. 31\u201332.</ref> When academics challenge pseudoarchaeologists and criticise their theories, many pseudoarchaeologists see it as further evidence that their own ideas are right, and that they are simply being suppressed by members of this academic conspiracy.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.</ref>\n\nThe prominent English archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] admitted that the archaeological establishment was often \"set in its ways and resistant to radical new ideas\" but that this was not the reason why pseudoarchaeological theories were outright rejected by academics.<ref name=\"Renfrew 2006. p. xii\">[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]]. p. xii.</ref> [[Garrett G. Fagan]] expanded on this, noting how in the academic archaeological community, \"New evidence or arguments have to be thoroughly scrutinised to secure their validity&nbsp;... and longstanding, well-entrenched positions will take considerable effort and particularly compelling data to overturn.\" Fagan noted that pseudoarchaeological theories simply do not have sufficient evidence to back them up and allow them to be accepted by professional archaeologists.<ref name=\"fagan26\"/>\n\nConversely, many pseudoarchaeologists, whilst criticising the academic archaeological establishment, also attempt to get support from people with academic credentials and affiliations.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 33.</ref> At times, they quote historical, and in most cases dead academics to back up their arguments; for instance prominent pseudoarchaeologist [[Graham Hancock]], in his seminal ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995), repeatedly notes that the eminent physicist [[Albert Einstein]] once commented positively on the [[pole shift hypothesis]], a theory that has been abandoned by the academic community but which Hancock supports.<ref>[[#Han95|Hancock 1995]]. pp. 9\u201311, 468, 471.</ref> As Fagan noted however, the fact that Einstein was a physicist and not a geologist is not even mentioned by Hancock, nor is the fact that the understanding of [[plate tectonics]] (which came to disprove earth crustal displacement) only came to light following Einstein's death.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Nationalist motivations===\n\nPseudoarchaeology can be motivated by [[nationalism]] (''[[cf.]]'' [[Nazi archaeology]], using cultural superiority of the ancient Aryan race as a basic assumption to establish the Germanic people as the descendants of the original Aryan 'master race') or a desire to prove a particular [[Religion|religious]] (''cf.'' [[intelligent design]]), [[Pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]], [[politics|political]], or [[anthropology|anthropological]] theory. In many cases, an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conclusion is established, and fieldwork is undertaken explicitly to corroborate the theory in detail. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://facweb.northseattle.edu/ccummings/Archaeology/NSC/the%20past%20as%20propoganda.pdf|title=The Past as Propaganda|last=Arnold|first=Bettina|date=1992|website=northseattle.edu|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologists distinguish their research from pseudoarchaeology by pointing to differences in research methodology, including recursive methods, falsifiable theories, peer review, and a generally systematic approach to collecting data. Though there is overwhelming evidence of cultural connections informing folk traditions about the past,<ref name=LOWENTHAL1985>{{cite book|author=D. Lowenthal|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1985}}</ref> objective analysis of folk archaeology\u2014in [[anthropology|anthropological]] terms of their cultural contexts and the cultural needs they respond to\u2014have been comparatively few. However, in this vein, [[Robert Silverberg]] located the [[Mormon]]'s use of [[Mound Builders|Mound Builder culture]] within a larger cultural nexus<ref name=SILVERBERG1968>{{cite book|author=Silverberg, Robert|authorlink=Robert Silverberg|title=Moundbuilders of Ancient America|location=Greenwich|publisher=New York Graphics Society|year=1968}}</ref> and the voyage of [[Madoc]] and \"Welsh Indians\" was set in its changing and evolving sociohistorical contexts by Gwyn Williams.<ref name=GWYNWILLIAMS1987>{{cite book|author=Williams, Gwyn A. |authorlink=Gwyn A. Williams|title=Madoc: The Making of a Myth|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1987}}</ref>\n\n===Religious motivations===\n\nReligiously motivated pseudoarchaeological theories include the [[Young Earth creationism|young earth]] theory of some Judeo-Christian fundamentalists. They argue that the Earth is 4,000-10,000 years old, with figures varying, depending on the source. Some Hindu pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''Homo sapiens'' species is much older than the 200,000 years it is generally believed to have existed. Archaeologist John R. Cole refers to such beliefs as \"cult archaeology\" and believes them to be pseudoarchaeological. He went on to say that this \"pseudoarchaeology\" had \"many of the attributes, causes, and effects of religion\".<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 03\"/>\n\nA more specific example of religious pseudoarcheology is the claim of [[Ron Wyatt]] to have discovered [[Noah's ark]], the graves of [[Noah]] and his wife, the location of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the [[Tower of Babel]], and numerous other important sites. However, he has not presented evidence sufficient to impress Bible scholars, scientists, and historians. [[Answers in Genesis]] propagates many pseudoscientific notions as part of its [[creationist]] ministry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ohehir|first1=Andrew|title=Archaeology from the dark side|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/08/31/archaeology/|work=Salon|date=31 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Trollinger|first1=Susan L.|last2=Trollinger, Jr.|first2=William Vance|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|pages=223\u2013225|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:The Bible and Creationism}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nPseudoarchaeology can be practised intentionally or unintentionally. [[Archaeological forgery|Archaeological frauds]] and [[hoax]]es are considered ''intentional pseudoarchaeology''. Genuine archaeological finds may be unintentionally converted to pseudoarchaeology through unscientific interpretation. (''cf.'' [[confirmation bias]])\n\nEspecially in the past, but also in the present, pseudoarchaeology has been motivated by [[racism]], especially when the basic intent was to discount or deny the abilities of [[person of color|non-white]] peoples to make significant accomplishments in astronomy, architecture, sophisticated technology, ancient writing, seafaring, and other accomplishments generally identified as evidence of \"[[civilization]]\".  Racism can be implied by attempts to attribute ancient sites and artefacts to [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes]], [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]], or even [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] rather than to the intelligence and ingenuity of [[indigenous peoples]].\n\nPractitioners of pseudoarchaeology often rail against academic archaeologists and established scientific methods, claiming that conventional science has overlooked critical evidence. [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] may be invoked, in which \"the Establishment\" colludes in suppressing evidence.\n\nCountering the misleading \"discoveries\" of pseudoarchaeology binds academic archaeologists in a quandary, described by Cornelius Holtorf<ref>{{cite journal|author=Holtorf, Cornelius|title=Beyond Crusades: How (Not) to Engage with Alternative Archaeologies|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4| postscript =Debates in \"World Archaeology\" |date=December 2005|pages=544\u2013551|doi=10.1080/00438240500395813}}</ref> as whether to strive to disprove alternative approaches in a \"crusading\" approach or to concentrate on better public understanding of the sciences involved; Holtorf suggested a third, relativist and contextualised<ref>\"We might want to remind ourselves of the truism that every past is the construct of a particular present-day context\" (p. 548.</ref> approach, in identifying the social and cultural needs that both scientific and alternative archaeologies address and in identifying the engagement with the [[Material culture|material remains]] of the past in the present in terms of critical understanding and dialogue with \"multiple pasts\", such as [[Barbara Bender]] explored for [[Stonehenge]].<ref>Bender, ''Stonehenge'', vol. 1 ''Making Space (Materializing Culture) '', 1998.</ref> In presenting the quest for truths as process rather than results, Holtorf quoted [[Gotthold Lessing]] (''Eine Duplik'', 1778):\n<blockquote>If God were to hold in his right hand all the truth and in his left the unique ever-active spur for truth, although with the corollary to err forever, asking me to choose, I would humbly take his left and say \"Father, give; for the pure truth is for you alone!\"</blockquote>\n\n\"Archaeological readings of the landscape enrich the experience of inhabiting or visiting a place,\" Holtorf asserted. \"Those readings may well be based on science but even non-scientific research contributes to enriching our landscapes.\"<ref>Holtorf 2005:548.</ref> The question for opponents of folk archaeology is whether such enrichment is delusional.\n\nParticipatory [[community archaeology|\"public\" or \"community\" archaeology]] offers guided engagement.\n\n==In history==\n\nIn the mid-2nd century, those exposed by [[Lucian]]'s sarcastic essay [[Alexander of Abonoteichus|\"Alexander the false prophet\"]] prepared an archaeological \"find\" in [[Chalcedon]] to prepare a public for the supposed oracle they planned to establish at [[Abonoteichus]] in [[Paphlagonia]] (Pearse, 2001<ref>Translated and notes by A.M. Harmon, 1936, Published in Loeb Classical Library, 9 volumes, Greek texts and facing English translation: Harvard University Press.

Cole,<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/> [[Garrett G. Fagan]] and Kenneth L. Feder<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> have argued that pseudoarchaeological interpretations of the past were based upon sensationalism, self-contradiction, fallacious logic, manufactured or misinterpreted evidence, quotes taken out of context and incorrect information. Fagan and Feder characterised such interpretations of the past as being \"anti-reason and anti-science\" with some being \"hyper-nationalistic, racist and hateful\".<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> In turn, many pseudoarchaeologists have dismissed academics as being close minded and not willing to consider theories other than their own.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/>\n\nMany academic archaeologists have argued that the spread of alternative archaeological theories is a threat to the general public's understanding of the past. Fagan was particularly scathing of television shows that presented pseudoarchaeological theories to the general public, believing that they did so because of the difficulties in making academic archaeological ideas comprehensible and interesting to the average viewer.<ref>[[#Fag03|Fagan 2003]].</ref> Renfrew however believed that those television executives commissioning these documentaries knew that they were erroneous, and that they had allowed them to be made and broadcast simply in the hope of \"short-term financial gain\".<ref name=\"Renfrew 2006. p. xii\"/>\n\nFagan and Feder believed that it was not possible for academic archaeologists to successfully engage with pseudoarchaeologists, remarking that \"you cannot reason with unreason\". Speaking from their own experiences, they thought that attempted dialogues just became \"slanging matches in which the expertise and motives of the critic become the main focus of attention.\"<ref name=\"fagan721\"/> Fagan has maintained this idea elsewhere, remarking that arguing with supporters of pseudoarchaeological theories was \"pointless\" because they denied logic. He noted that they included those \"who openly admitted to not having read a word written by a trained Egyptologist\" but who at the same time \"were pronouncing how academic Egyptology was all wrong, even sinister.\"<ref name=\"Fagan 2006a. p. xvii\">[[#Fag06a|Fagan 2006a]]. p. xvii.</ref>\n\n===Conferences and anthologies===\n\nAt the 1986 meeting of the [[Society for American Archaeology]], its organizers, [[Kenneth Feder]], Luanne Hudson and Francis Harrold decided to hold a symposium to examine pseudoarchaeological beliefs from a variety of academic standpoints, including archaeology, physical anthropology, sociology, history and psychology.<ref>[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. xi.</ref> From this symposium, an anthology was produced, entitled ''Cult Archaeology & Creationism: Understanding Pseudoarchaeological Beliefs about the Past'' (1987).\n\nAt the 2002 annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], a workshop was held on the topic of pseudoarchaeology. It subsequently led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misinterprets the Past and Misleads the Public'' (2006), which was edited by [[Garrett G. Fagan]].<ref name=\"Fagan 2006a. p. xvii\"/>\n\nOn 23 and 24 April 2009, The [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] and the [[Duke University]] Center for Jewish Studies, along with the Duke Department of Religion, the Duke Graduate Program in Religion, the [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]] Committee on Faculty Research, and the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]], sponsored a conference entitled \"Archaeology, Politics, and the Media,\" which addressed the abuse of archaeology in the [[Holy Land]] for political, religious, and ideological purposes. Emphasis was placed on the media's reporting of sensational and politically motivated archaeological claims and the academy's responsibility in responding to it.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://fds.duke.edu/db?attachment-110--0-view-790|title=The Duke Symposium on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media:Re-visioning the Middle East|date=April 23\u201324, 2009|publisher=[[Duke University]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite podcast|url=http://asorblog.org/?p=252|title=Audio of Duke Conference on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=ASOR Blog|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013191654/http://asorblog.org/?p=252 |archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite podcast|url=https://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/center-for-jewish-studies/id420501356#ls=1|title=Center for Jewish Studies \u2013 Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=Duke Center for Jewish Studies iTunesU page}}</ref>\n\n===Inclusive attitudes===\nAcademic archaeologist Cornelius Holtorf believed however that critics of alternative archaeologies like Fagan were \"opinionated and patronizing\" towards alternative theories, and that purporting their views in such a manner was damaging to the public's perception of archaeologists.<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 545.</ref> Holtorf highlighted that there were similarities between academic and alternative archaeological interpretations, with the former taking some influence from the latter. As evidence, he highlighted [[archaeoastronomy]], which was once seen as a core component of fringe archaeological interpretations before being adopted by mainstream academics.<ref name=\"Holtorf 2005. p. 547\">[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 547.</ref> He also noted that certain archaeological scholars, like [[William Stukeley]] (1687\u20131765), [[Margaret Murray]] (1863\u20131963) and [[Marija Gimbutas]] (1921\u20131994) were seen as significant figures to both academic and alternative archaeologists.<ref name=\"Holtorf 2005. p. 547\"/> He came to the conclusion that a constructive dialogue should be opened up between academic and alternative archaeologists.<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 550.</ref> Fagan and Feder have responded to Holtorf's views in detail, asserting that such a dialogue is no more possible than is one between evolutionary biologists and creationists or between astronomers and astrologers: one approach is scientific, the other is anti-scientific.<ref>[Fagan and Feder 2006]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kenneth Feder conducted a survey of his archaeology students. On the 50-question survey, 10 questions had to do with archaeology and/or pseudoscience. Some of the claims were more rational; the world is 5 billion years old, and human beings came about through evolution. However, questions also included issues such as, [[King Tut]]\u2019s tomb actually killed people upon discovery, and there is solid evidence for the existence of Atlantis. As it turned out, some of the students Feder was teaching put some stake in the pseudoscience claims. 12% actually believed people on [[Howard Carter]]\u2019s expedition were killed by [[Curse of the pharaohs|an ancient Egyptian curse]].<ref>Feder, Kenneth L.

These include religious approaches such as [[Creationism]] when identified as \"creation science\" that applies to the archaeology of historic periods such as those that would have included the [[Tower of Babel]], [[Noah's Ark]], and the supposed worldwide [[flood myth]]. Some pseudoarchaeological theories revolve around the idea that prehistoric and ancient human societies were aided in their development by intelligent [[extraterrestrial life]], an idea propagated by those such as Italian author [[Peter Kolosimo]], French authors [[Louis Pauwels]] and [[Jacques Bergier]] in ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'' (1963), and Swiss author [[Erich von D\u00e4niken]] in ''[[Chariots of the Gods?]]'' (1968). Others instead hold that there were human societies in the ancient period that were significantly technologically advanced, such as [[Atlantis]], and this idea has been propagated by figures like [[Graham Hancock]] in his ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995). Pseudoarchaeology has also been manifest in [[Mayanism]] and the [[2012 phenomenon]].\n\nMany alternative archaeologies have been adopted by religious groups. Fringe archaeological ideas such as [[archaeocryptography]] and [[pyramidology]] have been embraced by religions ranging from the [[British Israelites]] to the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]]. Other alternative archaeologies include those that have been adopted by members of [[New Age]] and [[Neopaganism|contemporary pagan]] belief systems.\n\nAcademic archaeologists have heavily criticised pseudoarchaeology, with one of the most vocal critics, John R. Cole, characterising it as relying on \"sensationalism, misuse of logic and evidence, misunderstanding of scientific method, and internal contradictions in their arguments\".<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\">[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 2.</ref> The relationship between alternative and academic archaeologies has been compared to the relationship between [[intelligent design]] theories and [[evolutionary biology]] by some archaeologists.<ref name=\"fagan721\">[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nVarious different terms have been employed to refer to these non-academic interpretations of archaeology. During the 1980s, the term \"cult archaeology\" was used by figures like John R. Cole (1980)<ref>[[#Col80|Cole 1980]].</ref> and William H. Stiebing Jr. (1987).<ref>[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]].</ref> \"Fantastic archaeology\" was used in the 1980s as the name of an undergraduate course at [[Harvard University]] taught by Stephen Williams, who published a book with the same title.<ref>[[#Wil91|Wiliams 1991]]</ref> In the 2000s, the term \"alternative archaeology\" began to be instead applied by academics like Tim Sebastion (2001),<ref>[[#Seb01|Sebastion 2001]].</ref> Robert J. Wallis (2003),<ref>[[#Wal03|Wallis 2003]].</ref> Cornelius Holtorf (2006),<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]].</ref> and Gabriel Moshenka (2008).<ref>[[#Mos08|Moshenka 2008]].</ref> Garrett F. Fagan and [[Kenneth Feder]] (2006) however claimed this term was only chosen because it \"imparts a warmer, fuzzier feel\" that \"appeals to our higher ideals and progressive inclinations\".<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> They argued that the term \"pseudoarchaeology\" was far more appropriate,<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> a term also used by other prominent academic and professional archaeologists such as [[Colin Renfrew]] (2006).<ref>[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]].</ref>\n\nOther academic archaeologists have chosen to use other terms to refer to these interpretations. [[Glyn Daniel]], the editor of ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]'', used the derogative \"bullshit archaeology\",<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> and similarly the academic William H. Stiebing Jr. noted that there were certain terms used for pseudoarchaeology that were heard \"in the privacy of professional archaeologists' homes and offices but which cannot be mentioned in polite society\".<ref>[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr 1987]]. p. 1.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nWilliam H. Stiebing Jr. argued that despite their many differences, there were a set of core characteristics that almost all pseudoarchaeological interpretations shared. He believed that because of this, pseudoarchaeology could be categorised as a \"single phenomenon\". He went on to identify three core commonalities of pseudeoarchaeological theories: the unscientific nature of its method and evidence, its history of providing \"simple, compact answers to complex, difficult issues\", and its tendency to present itself as being persecuted by the archaeological establishment, accompanied by an ambivalent attitude towards the scientific ethos of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 2.</ref> This idea that there are core characteristics of pseudoarchaeologies is shared by other academics.<ref>Such as [[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 5.</ref>\n\n===Lack of scientific method===\nAcademic critics have pointed out that pseudoarchaeologists typically neglect to use the [[scientific method]]. Instead of testing the evidence to see what hypotheses it fits, pseudoarchaeologists \"press-gang\" the archaeological data to fit a \"favored conclusion\" that is often arrived at through hunches, intuition, or religious or nationalist dogma.<ref>[[#Fag06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. p. 721.</ref><ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 27.</ref> Different pseudoarchaeological groups hold a variety of basic assumptions which are typically unscientific: the [[Nazi]] pseudoarchaeologists for instance took the cultural superiority of the ancient [[Aryan]] race as a basic assumption, whilst Christian [[fundamentalist]] pseudoarchaeologists conceive of the Earth as being less than 10,000 years old and Hindu fundamentalist pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' species is much older than the 200,000 years old it has been shown to be by archaeologists.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 28.</ref> Despite this, many of pseudoarchaeology's proponents claim that they reached their conclusions using scientific techniques and methods, even when it is demonstrable that they have not.<ref>[[#FagFed06|Fagan and Feder 2006]]. pp. 721\u201328.</ref><ref>[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. x.</ref>\n\nAcademic archaeologist John R. Cole believed that most pseudoarchaeologists do not understand how scientific investigation works, and that they instead believe it to be a \"simple, catastrophic right versus wrong battle\" between contesting theories.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 03\">[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. p. 3.</ref> It was because of this failure to understand the scientific method, he argued, that the entire pseudoarchaeological approach to their arguments was faulty. He went on to argue that most pseudoarchaeologists do not consider alternative explanations to that which they want to propagate, and that their \"theories\" were typically just \"notions\", not having sufficient supporting evidence to allow them to be considered \"theories\" in the scientific, academic meaning of the word.<ref>[[#Col80|Cole 1980]]. pp. 5\u20136.</ref>\n\nCommonly lacking scientific evidence, pseudoarchaeologists typically use other forms of evidence to support their arguments. For instance, they often make use of \"generalized cultural comparisons\", taking various artefacts and monuments from one society, and highlighting similarities with those of another to support a conclusion that both had a common source\u2014typically an ancient lost civilisation like [[Atlantis]], [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], or an extraterrestrial influence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This takes the different artefacts or monuments entirely out of their original contexts, something which is anathema to academic archaeologists, for whom context is of the utmost importance.<ref name=\"fagan26\">[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 26.</ref>\n\nAnother form of evidence used by a number of pseudoarchaeologists is the interpretation of various [[mythology|myths]] as reflecting historical events, but in doing so these myths are often taken out of their cultural contexts.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">[[#Sti87|Stiebing Jr. 1987]] p. 3.</ref> For instance, pseudoarchaeologist [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] claimed that the myths of migrations and war gods in the Central American [[Aztec]] civilisation represented a cosmic catastrophe that occurred in the 7th and 8th centuries BCE.<ref>[[#Vel50|Velikovsky 1950]]. pp. 253\u2013254, 269.</ref> This was criticised by academic archaeologist William H. Stiebing Jr., who noted that such myths only developed in the 12th to the 14th centuries CE, over a millennium after Velikovsky claimed that the events had occurred, and that the Aztec society itself had not even developed by the 7th century BCE.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n===Opposition to the archaeological establishment===\n\n{{Quote box|width=246px|bgcolor=#F0F0F0|align=right|quote=[Academics] have formed a massive and global network through universities, museums, institutes, societies and foundations. And this immense powerhouse and clearing-house of knowledge has presented their dogma of history to the general public totally unhindered and unchallenged from the outside.&nbsp;... On a more sinister note: now this \"church of science\" has formed a network of watchdog organisations such as [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|CSICOP]] and [[The Skeptics Society|The Skeptical Society]] {{sic}} (to name but a few) in order to act as the gatekeepers of the truth (as they see it), ready to come down like the proverbial ton of bricks on all those whom they perceive as \"frauds\", \"charlatans\", and \"pseudo-scientists\" \u2013 in short, heretics.|source=Pseudoarchaeologist Robert Bauval on his views of academia (2000)<ref>Quoted in [[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.</ref>}}\n\nPseudoarchaeologists typically present themselves as being underdogs facing the much larger archaeological establishment.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/><ref name=\"fagan721\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They often use language which disparages academics and dismisses them as being unadventurous, spending all their time in dusty libraries and refusing to challenge the orthodoxies of the establishment lest they lose their jobs. In some more extreme examples, pseudoarchaeologists have accused academic archaeologists of being members of a widespread [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] to hide the truth about history from the public.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. pp. 31\u201332.</ref> When academics challenge pseudoarchaeologists and criticise their theories, many pseudoarchaeologists see it as further evidence that their own ideas are right, and that they are simply being suppressed by members of this academic conspiracy.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 32.</ref>\n\nThe prominent English archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] admitted that the archaeological establishment was often \"set in its ways and resistant to radical new ideas\" but that this was not the reason why pseudoarchaeological theories were outright rejected by academics.<ref name=\"Renfrew 2006. p. xii\">[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]]. p. xii.</ref> [[Garrett G. Fagan]] expanded on this, noting how in the academic archaeological community, \"New evidence or arguments have to be thoroughly scrutinised to secure their validity&nbsp;... and longstanding, well-entrenched positions will take considerable effort and particularly compelling data to overturn.\" Fagan noted that pseudoarchaeological theories simply do not have sufficient evidence to back them up and allow them to be accepted by professional archaeologists.<ref name=\"fagan26\"/>\n\nConversely, many pseudoarchaeologists, whilst criticising the academic archaeological establishment, also attempt to get support from people with academic credentials and affiliations.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 33.</ref> At times, they quote historical, and in most cases dead academics to back up their arguments; for instance prominent pseudoarchaeologist [[Graham Hancock]], in his seminal ''[[Fingerprints of the Gods]]'' (1995), repeatedly notes that the eminent physicist [[Albert Einstein]] once commented positively on the [[pole shift hypothesis]], a theory that has been abandoned by the academic community but which Hancock supports.<ref>[[#Han95|Hancock 1995]]. pp. 9\u201311, 468, 471.</ref> As Fagan noted however, the fact that Einstein was a physicist and not a geologist is not even mentioned by Hancock, nor is the fact that the understanding of [[plate tectonics]] (which came to disprove earth crustal displacement) only came to light following Einstein's death.<ref>[[#Fag06b|Fagan 2006b]]. p. 34.</ref>\n\n===Nationalist motivations===\n\nPseudoarchaeology can be motivated by [[nationalism]] (''[[cf.]]'' [[Nazi archaeology]], using cultural superiority of the ancient Aryan race as a basic assumption to establish the Germanic people as the descendants of the original Aryan 'master race') or a desire to prove a particular [[Religion|religious]] (''cf.'' [[intelligent design]]), [[Pseudohistory|pseudohistorical]], [[politics|political]], or [[anthropology|anthropological]] theory. In many cases, an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' conclusion is established, and fieldwork is undertaken explicitly to corroborate the theory in detail. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://facweb.northseattle.edu/ccummings/Archaeology/NSC/the%20past%20as%20propoganda.pdf|title=The Past as Propaganda|last=Arnold|first=Bettina|date=1992|website=northseattle.edu|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nArchaeologists distinguish their research from pseudoarchaeology by pointing to differences in research methodology, including recursive methods, falsifiable theories, peer review, and a generally systematic approach to collecting data. Though there is overwhelming evidence of cultural connections informing folk traditions about the past,<ref name=LOWENTHAL1985>{{cite book|author=D.

They argue that the Earth is 4,000-10,000 years old, with figures varying, depending on the source. Some Hindu pseudoarchaeologists believe that the ''Homo sapiens'' species is much older than the 200,000 years it is generally believed to have existed. Archaeologist John R. Cole refers to such beliefs as \"cult archaeology\" and believes them to be pseudoarchaeological. He went on to say that this \"pseudoarchaeology\" had \"many of the attributes, causes, and effects of religion\".<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 03\"/>\n\nA more specific example of religious pseudoarcheology is the claim of [[Ron Wyatt]] to have discovered [[Noah's ark]], the graves of [[Noah]] and his wife, the location of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], the [[Tower of Babel]], and numerous other important sites. However, he has not presented evidence sufficient to impress Bible scholars, scientists, and historians. [[Answers in Genesis]] propagates many pseudoscientific notions as part of its [[creationist]] ministry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ohehir|first1=Andrew|title=Archaeology from the dark side|url=https://www.salon.com/2005/08/31/archaeology/|work=Salon|date=31 August 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Trollinger|first1=Susan L.|last2=Trollinger, Jr.|first2=William Vance|editor1-last=Gutjahr|editor1-first=Paul|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Bible in America|date=2017|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780190258856|pages=223\u2013225|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23o7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA223|language=en|chapter=Chapter 31:The Bible and Creationism}}</ref>\n\n==Description==\n\nPseudoarchaeology can be practised intentionally or unintentionally. [[Archaeological forgery|Archaeological frauds]] and [[hoax]]es are considered ''intentional pseudoarchaeology''. Genuine archaeological finds may be unintentionally converted to pseudoarchaeology through unscientific interpretation. (''cf.'' [[confirmation bias]])\n\nEspecially in the past, but also in the present, pseudoarchaeology has been motivated by [[racism]], especially when the basic intent was to discount or deny the abilities of [[person of color|non-white]] peoples to make significant accomplishments in astronomy, architecture, sophisticated technology, ancient writing, seafaring, and other accomplishments generally identified as evidence of \"[[civilization]]\".  Racism can be implied by attempts to attribute ancient sites and artefacts to [[Ten Lost Tribes|Lost Tribes]], [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]], or even [[extraterrestrial intelligence]] rather than to the intelligence and ingenuity of [[indigenous peoples]].\n\nPractitioners of pseudoarchaeology often rail against academic archaeologists and established scientific methods, claiming that conventional science has overlooked critical evidence. [[Conspiracy theory|Conspiracy theories]] may be invoked, in which \"the Establishment\" colludes in suppressing evidence.\n\nCountering the misleading \"discoveries\" of pseudoarchaeology binds academic archaeologists in a quandary, described by Cornelius Holtorf<ref>{{cite journal|author=Holtorf, Cornelius|title=Beyond Crusades: How (Not) to Engage with Alternative Archaeologies|journal=World Archaeology|volume=37|issue=4| postscript =Debates in \"World Archaeology\" |date=December 2005|pages=544\u2013551|doi=10.1080/00438240500395813}}</ref> as whether to strive to disprove alternative approaches in a \"crusading\" approach or to concentrate on better public understanding of the sciences involved; Holtorf suggested a third, relativist and contextualised<ref>\"We might want to remind ourselves of the truism that every past is the construct of a particular present-day context\" (p. 548.</ref> approach, in identifying the social and cultural needs that both scientific and alternative archaeologies address and in identifying the engagement with the [[Material culture|material remains]] of the past in the present in terms of critical understanding and dialogue with \"multiple pasts\", such as [[Barbara Bender]] explored for [[Stonehenge]].<ref>Bender, ''Stonehenge'', vol. 1 ''Making Space (Materializing Culture) '', 1998.</ref> In presenting the quest for truths as process rather than results, Holtorf quoted [[Gotthold Lessing]] (''Eine Duplik'', 1778):\n<blockquote>If God were to hold in his right hand all the truth and in his left the unique ever-active spur for truth, although with the corollary to err forever, asking me to choose, I would humbly take his left and say \"Father, give; for the pure truth is for you alone!\"</blockquote>\n\n\"Archaeological readings of the landscape enrich the experience of inhabiting or visiting a place,\" Holtorf asserted. \"Those readings may well be based on science but even non-scientific research contributes to enriching our landscapes.\"<ref>Holtorf 2005:548.</ref> The question for opponents of folk archaeology is whether such enrichment is delusional.\n\nParticipatory [[community archaeology|\"public\" or \"community\" archaeology]] offers guided engagement.\n\n==In history==\n\nIn the mid-2nd century, those exposed by [[Lucian]]'s sarcastic essay [[Alexander of Abonoteichus|\"Alexander the false prophet\"]] prepared an archaeological \"find\" in [[Chalcedon]] to prepare a public for the supposed oracle they planned to establish at [[Abonoteichus]] in [[Paphlagonia]] (Pearse, 2001<ref>Translated and notes by A.M.

One of the first books to address these directly was by archaeologist [[Robert Wauchope (archaeologist)|Robert Wauchope]] of [[Tulane University]].<ref>[[#Wau62|Wauchope 1962]]</ref> Prominent academic archaeologist [[Colin Renfrew]] stated his opinion that it was appalling that pseudoarchaeologists treated archaeological evidence in such a \"frivolous and self-serving way\", something he believed trivialised the \"serious matter\" of the study of human origins.<ref>[[#Ren06|Renfrew 2006]]. p. xvi.</ref> Academics like John R. Cole,<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/> [[Garrett G. Fagan]] and Kenneth L. Feder<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> have argued that pseudoarchaeological interpretations of the past were based upon sensationalism, self-contradiction, fallacious logic, manufactured or misinterpreted evidence, quotes taken out of context and incorrect information. Fagan and Feder characterised such interpretations of the past as being \"anti-reason and anti-science\" with some being \"hyper-nationalistic, racist and hateful\".<ref name=\"fagan720\"/> In turn, many pseudoarchaeologists have dismissed academics as being close minded and not willing to consider theories other than their own.<ref name=\"Cole 1980. p. 02\"/>\n\nMany academic archaeologists have argued that the spread of alternative archaeological theories is a threat to the general public's understanding of the past. Fagan was particularly scathing of television shows that presented pseudoarchaeological theories to the general public, believing that they did so because of the difficulties in making academic archaeological ideas comprehensible and interesting to the average viewer.<ref>[[#Fag03|Fagan 2003]].</ref> Renfrew however believed that those television executives commissioning these documentaries knew that they were erroneous, and that they had allowed them to be made and broadcast simply in the hope of \"short-term financial gain\".<ref name=\"Renfrew 2006. p. xii\"/>\n\nFagan and Feder believed that it was not possible for academic archaeologists to successfully engage with pseudoarchaeologists, remarking that \"you cannot reason with unreason\". Speaking from their own experiences, they thought that attempted dialogues just became \"slanging matches in which the expertise and motives of the critic become the main focus of attention.\"<ref name=\"fagan721\"/> Fagan has maintained this idea elsewhere, remarking that arguing with supporters of pseudoarchaeological theories was \"pointless\" because they denied logic. He noted that they included those \"who openly admitted to not having read a word written by a trained Egyptologist\" but who at the same time \"were pronouncing how academic Egyptology was all wrong, even sinister.\"<ref name=\"Fagan 2006a. p. xvii\">[[#Fag06a|Fagan 2006a]]. p. xvii.</ref>\n\n===Conferences and anthologies===\n\nAt the 1986 meeting of the [[Society for American Archaeology]], its organizers, [[Kenneth Feder]], Luanne Hudson and Francis Harrold decided to hold a symposium to examine pseudoarchaeological beliefs from a variety of academic standpoints, including archaeology, physical anthropology, sociology, history and psychology.<ref>[[#Har87|Harrold and Eve 1987]]. p. xi.</ref> From this symposium, an anthology was produced, entitled ''Cult Archaeology & Creationism: Understanding Pseudoarchaeological Beliefs about the Past'' (1987).\n\nAt the 2002 annual meeting of the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], a workshop was held on the topic of pseudoarchaeology. It subsequently led to the publication of an academic anthology, ''Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misinterprets the Past and Misleads the Public'' (2006), which was edited by [[Garrett G. Fagan]].<ref name=\"Fagan 2006a. p. xvii\"/>\n\nOn 23 and 24 April 2009, The [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] and the [[Duke University]] Center for Jewish Studies, along with the Duke Department of Religion, the Duke Graduate Program in Religion, the [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]] Committee on Faculty Research, and the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]], sponsored a conference entitled \"Archaeology, Politics, and the Media,\" which addressed the abuse of archaeology in the [[Holy Land]] for political, religious, and ideological purposes. Emphasis was placed on the media's reporting of sensational and politically motivated archaeological claims and the academy's responsibility in responding to it.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://fds.duke.edu/db?attachment-110--0-view-790|title=The Duke Symposium on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media:Re-visioning the Middle East|date=April 23\u201324, 2009|publisher=[[Duke University]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite podcast|url=http://asorblog.org/?p=252|title=Audio of Duke Conference on Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=ASOR Blog|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013191654/http://asorblog.org/?p=252 |archivedate=13 October 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite podcast|url=https://itunes.apple.com/itunes-u/center-for-jewish-studies/id420501356#ls=1|title=Center for Jewish Studies \u2013 Archaeology, Politics, and the Media|publisher=Duke Center for Jewish Studies iTunesU page}}</ref>\n\n===Inclusive attitudes===\nAcademic archaeologist Cornelius Holtorf believed however that critics of alternative archaeologies like Fagan were \"opinionated and patronizing\" towards alternative theories, and that purporting their views in such a manner was damaging to the public's perception of archaeologists.<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 545.</ref> Holtorf highlighted that there were similarities between academic and alternative archaeological interpretations, with the former taking some influence from the latter. As evidence, he highlighted [[archaeoastronomy]], which was once seen as a core component of fringe archaeological interpretations before being adopted by mainstream academics.<ref name=\"Holtorf 2005. p. 547\">[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 547.</ref> He also noted that certain archaeological scholars, like [[William Stukeley]] (1687\u20131765), [[Margaret Murray]] (1863\u20131963) and [[Marija Gimbutas]] (1921\u20131994) were seen as significant figures to both academic and alternative archaeologists.<ref name=\"Holtorf 2005. p. 547\"/> He came to the conclusion that a constructive dialogue should be opened up between academic and alternative archaeologists.<ref>[[#Hol05|Holtorf 2005]]. p. 550.</ref> Fagan and Feder have responded to Holtorf's views in detail, asserting that such a dialogue is no more possible than is one between evolutionary biologists and creationists or between astronomers and astrologers: one approach is scientific, the other is anti-scientific.<ref>[Fagan and Feder 2006]</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Kenneth Feder conducted a survey of his archaeology students. On the 50-question survey, 10 questions had to do with archaeology and/or pseudoscience. Some of the claims were more rational; the world is 5 billion years old, and human beings came about through evolution. However, questions also included issues such as, [[King Tut]]\u2019s tomb actually killed people upon discovery, and there is solid evidence for the existence of Atlantis.

Ray tracing-based rendering algorithms operate in [[Image and object order rendering|image order]] to render three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional images. Geometric [[Ray (optics)|rays]] are traced from the [[projective geometry|eye]] of the observer to sample the light ([[radiance]]) travelling toward the observer from the ray direction. The speed and simplicity of ray casting comes from computing the color of the light without recursively tracing additional rays that sample the radiance incident on the point that the ray hit. This eliminates the possibility of accurately rendering [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]], [[refractions]], or the natural falloff of [[shadow]]s; however all of these elements can be faked to a degree, by creative use of [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]] maps or other methods.  The high speed of calculation made ray casting a handy rendering method in early real-time 3D video games.\n\nIn nature, a light source emits a ray of light that travels, eventually, to a surface that interrupts its progress.  One can think of this \"ray\" as a stream of [[photon]]s travelling along the same path.  At this point, any combination of three things might happen with this light ray:  [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], reflection, and refraction.  The surface may reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions.  It might also absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light.  If the surface has any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[translucent]] properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] (and possibly altering the color).  Between absorption, reflection, and refraction, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more.  A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, and reflective properties are again calculated based on the incoming rays.  Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.  Attempting to simulate this real-world process of tracing light rays using a computer can be considered extremely wasteful, as only a minuscule fraction of the rays in a scene would actually reach the eye.\n\nThe first ray casting algorithm used for rendering was presented by Arthur Appel in 1968.<ref>[http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/CGF/slides/RayTracing4up.pdf \"Ray-tracing and other Rendering Approaches\"] (PDF), lecture notes, MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects, Jon Macey, [[University of Bournemouth]]</ref> The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray \u2013 think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel.  This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.  Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object.  The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow.  The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.

Ray tracing-based rendering algorithms operate in [[Image and object order rendering|image order]] to render three-dimensional scenes to two-dimensional images. Geometric [[Ray (optics)|rays]] are traced from the [[projective geometry|eye]] of the observer to sample the light ([[radiance]]) travelling toward the observer from the ray direction. The speed and simplicity of ray casting comes from computing the color of the light without recursively tracing additional rays that sample the radiance incident on the point that the ray hit. This eliminates the possibility of accurately rendering [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]], [[refractions]], or the natural falloff of [[shadow]]s; however all of these elements can be faked to a degree, by creative use of [[Texture (computer graphics)|texture]] maps or other methods.  The high speed of calculation made ray casting a handy rendering method in early real-time 3D video games.\n\nIn nature, a light source emits a ray of light that travels, eventually, to a surface that interrupts its progress.  One can think of this \"ray\" as a stream of [[photon]]s travelling along the same path.  At this point, any combination of three things might happen with this light ray:  [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]], reflection, and refraction.  The surface may reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions.  It might also absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light.  If the surface has any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[translucent]] properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the [[optical spectrum|spectrum]] (and possibly altering the color).  Between absorption, reflection, and refraction, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more.  A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, and reflective properties are again calculated based on the incoming rays.  Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.  Attempting to simulate this real-world process of tracing light rays using a computer can be considered extremely wasteful, as only a minuscule fraction of the rays in a scene would actually reach the eye.\n\nThe first ray casting algorithm used for rendering was presented by Arthur Appel in 1968.<ref>[http://nccastaff.bournemouth.ac.uk/jmacey/CGF/slides/RayTracing4up.pdf \"Ray-tracing and other Rendering Approaches\"] (PDF), lecture notes, MSc Computer Animation and Visual Effects, Jon Macey, [[University of Bournemouth]]</ref> The idea behind ray casting is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray \u2013 think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel.  This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel.  Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object.  The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow.  The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.  One important advantage ray casting offered over older [[scanline rendering|scanline algorithms]] was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as [[Cone (geometry)|cones]] and [[sphere]]s. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting.
