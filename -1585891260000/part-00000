Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Argentina.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term \"cr\u00eape\" derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), February 2nd. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. A normal savoury cr\u00eape recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfaro |first1=Danilo |title=Sweet or Savory Basic Crepe Recipe |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-crepe-recipe-sweet-or-savory-995317 |website=The Spruce Eats |publisher=Dotdash |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic.</ref>  Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the cr\u00eape and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nAn Indian variety of the cr\u00eape uses a multi-grain flour called \"bhajanee\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalipeeth |website=Wikipedia |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, eggs, [[Curd|curd]], and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have batter without lumps. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a [[Take-out|takeaway]] restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical in France, especially in [[Brittany]] ; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

(1984), ''Larousse gastronomique'' (French edition), Paris: Librairie Larousse.</ref>\n\nEnglish pancakes are similar to wheat flour cr\u00eapes and are served with golden syrup or lemon juice and sugar. [[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr\u00eapes are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Vaccinium_vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from [[Gotland]] which is made with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron|saffron]] and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (Scanian eggcake)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sk\u00e5nsk egg cake |url=http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/447-egg-cake |website=Swedish Food.com |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically [[bilberry]] jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] cr\u00eape which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In [[swedish language|Swedish]], a cr\u00eape is called ''pannkaka'' in southern regions while being called ''pl\u00e4ttar'' in the north, in [[danish language|Danish]], ''pandekager'' (\"pancakes\"), in Icelandic it is called ''p\u00f6nnukaka'', in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] a cr\u00eape is called either ''ohukainen'' or ''lettu'' or ''r\u00e4isk\u00e4le'', in [[Greek language|Greek]] it is krepa (\u039a\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b1), in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] it is a ''[[pannenkoek]]'' or ''flensje'', and in [[Afrikaans]] a ''pannekoek'', which is usually served with [[cinnamon]] and sugar. In the Spanish regions of [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Asturias]], they are traditionally served at carnivals. In Galicia, they're called ''filloas'', and may also be made with pork blood instead of milk. In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods such as cr\u00eapes, [[Souffl\u00e9|souffl\u00e9s]], and [[quiche]] have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984).

Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with [[caviar]], cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, some cr\u00eape manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a cr\u00eape made of [[gram flour]] is called \"Pudlaa\" or \"Poodla\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \"patibola\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]], or sugar. The [[injera]] of [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n/[[Somali people|Somali]]/[[Yemen]]i cuisine is often described as a thick cr\u00eape. In Somalia, Malawa\u1e25 ([[Somali language|Somali]]: Malawax) is very similar to a cr\u00eape.

Cr\u00eapes are usually of two types: ''sweet cr\u00eapes'' (''cr\u00eapes sucr\u00e9es'') and ''savoury [[galette]]s'' (''cr\u00eapes sal\u00e9es''). Cr\u00eapes are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to [[flamb\u00e9]]ed [[Cr\u00eape Suzette|cr\u00eapes Suzette]] or elaborate savoury [[galette]]s. While cr\u00eapes are often associated with [[Brittany]], a region in the northwest of France, the consumption is widespread in [[France]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Canada]], and many parts of Europe, North Africa, [[Lebanon]], Brazil and Argentina.\n\n==Etymology==\nCr\u00eapes belong to the general category of ancient Greek Tiganitai, from Greek tiganos (\u03c4\u03af\u03b3\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"frying pan\", which, in English, is literally translated to Pancakes.<ref>[Athenaeus, Deipnosophistae, XIV, 645c; Galen, On the Properties of Foods, I, 3]</ref>  The French term \"cr\u00eape\" derives from the Latin ''crispa'', meaning with \"creases\".  The name \"galette\" came from the French word ''galet'' (\"pebble\") since the first gallettes were made on a large pebble heated in a fire.\n\n==Traditions==\nIn France and Belgium, cr\u00eapes are traditionally served on [[Candlemas]] (''La Chandeleur''), February 2nd. This day was originally Virgin Mary's Blessing Day but became known in France as \"Le Jour des Cr\u00eapes\" (literally translated \"The Day of the Cr\u00eapes\", and sometimes called colloquially as \"Avec Cr\u00eape Day\", \"National Cr\u00eape Day\", or \"day of the Cr\u00eape\"), referring to the tradition of offering cr\u00eapes. The belief was that catching the cr\u00eape with a [[frying pan]] after tossing it in the air with your right hand while holding a gold coin in your left hand would cause you to become rich that year.<ref>{{cite news\n | last = Clay\n | first = Xanthe\n | title = With a flame in your art\n | work = The Daily Telegraph\n | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wine/main.jhtml?xml=/wine/2007/02/17/nosplit/edxanthe117.xml\n | date = 17 February 2007\n | access-date = 25 April 2008\n| location=London}}\n</ref><ref name=\"redmond\">Redmond, Barbara (30 January 2012).

Academic Search Complete.</ref>\n\n== Types of cr\u00eape ==\nSweet cr\u00eapes are generally made with [[wheat flour]] (''farine de froment''). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of [[breakfast]] or as a [[dessert]]. Common fillings include [[Nutella]] spread, [[preserves]], sugar (granulated or powdered), [[maple syrup]], [[golden syrup]], [[lemon juice]], [[whipped cream]], [[fruit spread]]s, [[custard]], and sliced soft fruits or [[confiture]].\n\nSavory cr\u00eapes are made with non-wheat flours such as [[buckwheat]]. A normal savoury cr\u00eape recipe includes using wheat flour but omitting the sugar.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alfaro |first1=Danilo |title=Sweet or Savory Basic Crepe Recipe |url=https://www.thespruceeats.com/basic-crepe-recipe-sweet-or-savory-995317 |website=The Spruce Eats |publisher=Dotdash |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=November 2019}} Batter made from buckwheat flour is [[gluten]]-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten allergy or [[Food intolerance|intolerance]] to eat this type of cr\u00eape. Common savoury fillings for cr\u00eapes served for [[lunch]] or [[dinner]] are cheese, ham, and eggs, [[ratatouille]], mushrooms, [[artichoke]] (in certain regions), and various meat products. \n\n[[Batter (cooking)|Batter]]s can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt, and sugar.<ref>\"Wrap it up in a cr\u00eape; Thin pancakes work in savoury or sweet dishes.\" Times Colonist (Victoria, British Columbia). (24 April 2013 Wednesday) LexisNexis Academic.</ref>  Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the cr\u00eape and served with the edges partially folded over the centre.\nAn Indian variety of the cr\u00eape uses a multi-grain flour called \"bhajanee\",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalipeeth |website=Wikipedia |publisher=Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>, eggs, [[Curd|curd]], and an assortment of spices as its ingredients. It is a modern variation of an Indian dish called  [[Thalipeeth]].\n\n==Making batter==\nIn order to make an evenly thin cr\u00eape, it is crucial to have batter without lumps. After whisking the batter, it is best to let it rest for half an hour, or even overnight, to let the bubbles from whisking disappear from the batter. Some even mix the batter to a fine consistency by using a blender or mixer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comsol.nl/blogs/finding-the-best-way-to-make-crepes-with-fluid-dynamics-research/|title=Finding the Best Way to Make Cr\u00eapes with Fluid Dynamics Research|date=2019-11-06}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eaperies==\n[[File:Picswiss BS-55-89.jpg|thumb|A small cr\u00eaperie]]\n[[File:Creperie du Ciel \u00e0 M\u00fcnster.JPG|thumb|Cr\u00eaperie in Germany]]\n\nA '''cr\u00eaperie''' may be a [[Take-out|takeaway]] restaurant or stall, serving cr\u00eapes as a form of fast food or [[street food]], or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or caf\u00e9.<ref>{{cite web|title=La Creperie Cafe|url=http://www.lacreperiecafe.net/|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nCr\u00eaperies are typical in France, especially in [[Brittany]] ; however, cr\u00eaperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.\n\nBecause a cr\u00eape may be served as either a main meal or a dessert, cr\u00eaperies may be quite diverse in their selection and may offer other baked goods such as [[baguette]]s.

[[Swedish pancake]]s, also called Nordic pancakes, are similar to French cr\u00eapes. In some of the Nordic countries, cr\u00eapes are served with jam or fruit, especially [[Vaccinium_vitis-idaea|lingonberries]] (or the butter from that fruit) as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Beside the usual thin pancakes, called pannkakor in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and r\u00e4isk\u00e4le in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], which resemble the French cr\u00eapes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup. The Swedish cuisine (as well as the Finnish one) has pl\u00e4ttar/lettu, which resemble tiny English pancakes, are fried several at a time in a special pan. Others resemble German pancakes but are baked in the oven and include fried pork in the batter (fl\u00e4skpannkaka). Potato pancakes called \"raggmunk\" contain shredded raw potato and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing r\u00e5rakor). \n\nA special Swedish pancake is the saffron pancake from [[Gotland]] which is made with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron|saffron]] and rice and baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special Swedish pancake is the ''[[\u00e4ggakaka]]'' (eggcake), also called ''[[\u00c4ggakaka|sk\u00e5nsk \u00e4ggakaka]]'' (Scanian eggcake)<ref>{{cite web |title=Sk\u00e5nsk egg cake |url=http://www.swedishfood.com/swedish-food-recipes-main-courses/447-egg-cake |website=Swedish Food.com |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. It is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is much thicker and more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan and is about 1\u00bd to 2 inches thick and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically [[bilberry]] jam) or sugar.{{cn|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:49ers flapjack OHP.jpg|thumb|right|A plate of 49er flapjacks]]\nThe '''49er flapjack''' is a [[sourdough]] cr\u00eape which is popular in the United States,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-16/news/ol-43368_1_original-pancake-house |title=Why They Sell Like Hot Cakes |work=Los Angeles Times |date=16 March 1995 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> getting its name from the popularity of this style of pancake during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In Asturias, they are called ''fayueles'' or ''frixuelos'', and in [[Turkey]], ''ak\u0131tma.''\n\nIn areas of [[central Europe]], formerly belonging to the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], there is a thin pancake comparable to a cr\u00eape that in [[Austro-Bavarian]] is called ''[[Palatschinken]]''; in {{lang-hu|palacsinta}}; and in [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], and {{lang-sl|pala\u010dinka}}; in {{lang-sk|palacinka}}. In the Balkan countries, ''pala\u010dinka'' or ''palla\u00e7inka'' may be eaten with fruit jam, [[quark cheese]], sugar, honey, or the hazelnut-chocolate cream [[Nutella]], while there is also a breaded variant which is mostly filled with meat. Restaurants which are specialised in pala\u010dinci are called \"Pala\u010dinkara\" in the region. In [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish cuisine, there is a similar dish known as the [[Blini|blintz]]. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' derives the German and Slavic words from the Hungarians ''[[palacsinta]]'', which it derives from the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'', which comes in turn from classical Latin ''placenta'' (\"small flat cake\"), even though the Romanian ''pl\u0103cint\u0103'' is more similar to a pie, and the cr\u00eapes are actually called ''cl\u0103tit\u0103''.\n\nCr\u00eapes have also long been popular in [[Japan]] and [[Malaysia]], with sweet and savoury varieties being sold at many small stands, usually called cr\u00eaperies. In [[Argentina]] and [[Uruguay]], they are called ''panqueques'' and are often eaten with [[dulce de leche]]. Various other French foods such as cr\u00eapes, [[Souffl\u00e9|souffl\u00e9s]], and [[quiche]] have slowly made their way into North American cooking establishments.<ref>Benenson, R. (1984). Dining in America. Editorial research reports 1984 (Vol. I). Washington, DC: CQ Press.</ref> Typically, these franchises stick to the traditional French method of making cr\u00eapes but they have also put their own spin on the cr\u00eape with new types such as the hamburger and pizza cr\u00eape.

It is rolled into a cylinder and filled with sweetened coconut meat strips (''[[bukayo|hinti]]'').<ref>{{cite web |last1=Polistico |first1=Edgie |title=daral |url=https://pinoyfoodillustrated.blogspot.com/2012/12/daral.html |website=Philippine Food Illustrated |accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cr\u00eapes in European culture==\nDuring the  Russian celebration of [[Maslenitsa]] (Russian Butter Week), one of the most popular foods is [[blini]], or cr\u00eapes. Since they are made from butter, eggs and milk, cr\u00eapes are allowed to be consumed during the celebration by the [[Orthodox church]]. There are endless combinations to the recipes and the execution of cr\u00eapes. White flour can be replaced with buckwheat flour and milk can be switched for [[kefir]]. Furthermore, different oils can be added or substituted.  Blini are served stocked with a piece of butter and topped with [[caviar]], cheese, meat, potatoes, mushrooms, honey, berry jam, or often a dollop of sour cream. The dish is supposed to represent the sun, since the holiday is about the beginning of the spring. \n<ref>{{cite web|last=Nesterova |first=Maria |url=http://eurokulture.missouri.edu/buttery-crepes-of-deliciousness-and-other-stuff/ |title=Maslenitsa, another Russian festival you\u2019ve probably never heard of |work=Eurokulture.missouri.edu |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cr\u00eaperies and cr\u00eape franchises, some cr\u00eape manufacturers use modern equipment to produce cr\u00eapes in bulk.\n\n[[File:Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape Paris.jpg|thumb|right|Chocolate-Coconut Cr\u00eape served in cr\u00eaperie near the Pantheon in Paris, France]]\nDishes with similar appearance, taste and preparation methods exist in other parts of the world as well. In South India, a cr\u00eape made of fermented [[rice]] [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] is called a [[dosa]], which often has savoury fillings. In Western India, a cr\u00eape made of [[gram flour]] is called \"Pudlaa\" or \"Poodla\", with the batter consisting of vegetables and spices. Another variety is called \"patibola\" and is sweet in taste due to milk, [[jaggery]], or sugar. The [[injera]] of [[Ethiopia]]n/[[Eritrea]]n/[[Somali people|Somali]]/[[Yemen]]i cuisine is often described as a thick cr\u00eape. In Somalia, Malawa\u1e25 ([[Somali language|Somali]]: Malawax) is very similar to a cr\u00eape.

He was the son of a prominent Hungarian [[laryngologist]], [[Johann Schnitzler]] (1835\u20131893), and Luise Markbreiter (1838\u20131911), a daughter of the Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter.

He began work at [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna's General Hospital]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Allgemeines Krankenhaus der Stadt Wien}}), but ultimately abandoned the practice of medicine in favour of writing.\n\nOn 26 August 1903, Schnitzler married Olga Gussmann (1882\u20131970), a 21-year-old aspiring actress and singer who came from a Jewish middle-class family. They had a son, Heinrich (1902\u20131982), born on 9 August 1902. In 1909 they had a daughter, Lili, who committed suicide in 1928. The Schnitzlers separated in 1921. Schnitzler died on 21 October 1931 in Vienna of a brain hemorrhage. In 1938, following the [[Anschluss]], his son Heinrich went to the United States and did not return to Austria until 1959; he is the father of the Austrian musician and conservationist [[Michael Schnitzler]], born in 1944 in Berkeley, California, who moved to Vienna with his parents in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220033139/http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Literary works==\nSchnitzler's works were often controversial, both for their frank description of sexuality (in a letter to Schnitzler [[Sigmund Freud]] confessed \"I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition \u2013 although actually as a result of sensitive introspection \u2013 everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons\")<ref>[http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx Schnitzler's hidden manuscripts explored] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315122800/http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx |date=15 March 2010 }} at research-horizons.cam.ac.uk</ref> and for their strong stand against [[anti-semitism]], represented by works such as his play ''[[Professor Bernhardi]]'' and his novel ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]''. However, although Schnitzler was Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fr\u00e4ulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.\n\nSchnitzler was branded as a pornographer after the release of his play ''[[La Ronde (play)|Reigen]]'', in which 10 pairs of characters are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furor after this play was couched in the strongest anti-semitic terms.<ref>[http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html Arthur Schnitzler scandal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128074046/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html |date=28 January 2007 }} at virtualvienna.net</ref> ''Reigen'' was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] as ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|La Ronde]]''. The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler's play is better known there under its French title. [[Richard Oswald]]'s film ''[[The Merry-Go-Round (film)|The Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1920), [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Circle of Love (film)|Circle of Love]]'' (1964) and Otto Schenk's ''Der Reigen'' (1973) also are based on the play. More recently, in [[Fernando Meirelles]]' film ''[[360 (film)|360]]'', Schnitzler's play was provided with a new version as has been the case with many other TV and film productions.\n\nIn the novella ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (novella)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' (1924) Schnitzler may be rebutting a contentious critique of the Jewish character by [[Otto Weininger]] (1903) by positioning the sexuality of the young female Jewish protagonist.<ref>Barker, Andrew (2001). \"Race, Sex and Character in Schnitzler's ''Fr\u00e4ulein Else''.\" ''German Life and Letters''. v. 54(1):1\u20139.</ref> The story, a first-person [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] narrative by a young aristocratic woman, reveals a moral dilemma that ends in tragedy.\n\nIn response to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what he thought about the critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied \"I write of love and death. What other subjects are there?\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vienna : a cultural history|last=Nicholas.|first=Parsons|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195376067|location=Oxford|oclc=221155367}}</ref> Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the [[bedroom farce]] in his plays (and had an affair with  [[Adele Sandrock]], one of his actresses). ''Professor Bernhardi'', a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.\n\nA member of the avant-garde group [[Young Vienna]] (''Jung-Wien''), Schnitzler toyed with formal as well as social conventions. With his 1900 novella ''Leutnant Gustl'', he was the first to write German fiction in stream-of-consciousness narration. The story is an unflattering portrait of its protagonist and of the army's obsessive code of formal honor. It caused Schnitzler to be stripped of his commission as a reserve officer in the medical corps \u2013 something that should be seen against the rising tide of anti-semitism of the time.\n\nHe specialized in shorter works like novellas and one-act plays. And in his short stories like \"The Green Tie\" (\"Die gr\u00fcne Krawatte\") he showed himself to be one of the early masters of [[microfiction]]. However he also wrote two full-length novels: ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]'' about a talented but not very motivated young composer, a brilliant description of a segment of pre-World War I Viennese society; and the artistically less satisfactory ''[[Therese (novel)|Therese]]''.\n\nIn addition to his plays and fiction, Schnitzler meticulously kept a diary from the age of 17 until two days before his death. The manuscript, which runs to almost 8,000 pages, is most notable for Schnitzler's casual descriptions of sexual conquests; he was often in relationships with several women at once, and for a period of some years he kept a record of every orgasm. Collections of Schnitzler's letters also have been published.\n\nSchnitzler's works were called \"Jewish filth\" by [[Adolf Hitler]] and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when [[Joseph Goebbels]] organized [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]] in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Stefan Zweig]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |title=Arthur Schnitzler |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206131904/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHis novella ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (novella)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' has been adapted a number of times, including the German silent film ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (1929 film)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' (1929), starring [[Elisabeth Bergner]], and the 1946 Argentine film ''[[The Naked Angel]]'', starring [[Olga Zubarry]].\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Plays ===\n* ''[[Anatol (play)|Anatol]]'' (1893), a series of seven acts revolving around a bourgeois playboy and his immature relationships.\n* ''Flirtation'' (''Liebelei'' \u2013 1895), also known as ''The Reckoning'', which was made into [[Liebelei (film)|a film]] by [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] in 1933, and [[Pierre Gaspard-Huit]] in 1958 (''[[Christine (1958 film)|Christine]]''), and also adapted as ''[[Dalliance]]'' by [[Tom Stoppard]] (1986)<ref>''Dalliance'' was staged at the National Theatre by Peter Wood.

He was the son of a prominent Hungarian [[laryngologist]], [[Johann Schnitzler]] (1835\u20131893), and Luise Markbreiter (1838\u20131911), a daughter of the Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter. His parents were both from Jewish families.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Road-Open-Verite-European-Classics-ebook/dp/B00KUFP4QU/|title=The Road to The Open (JC Verite European Classics Book 1) \u2013 Kindle edition by Arthur Schnitzler, J.

He began work at [[Vienna General Hospital|Vienna's General Hospital]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Allgemeines Krankenhaus der Stadt Wien}}), but ultimately abandoned the practice of medicine in favour of writing.\n\nOn 26 August 1903, Schnitzler married Olga Gussmann (1882\u20131970), a 21-year-old aspiring actress and singer who came from a Jewish middle-class family. They had a son, Heinrich (1902\u20131982), born on 9 August 1902. In 1909 they had a daughter, Lili, who committed suicide in 1928. The Schnitzlers separated in 1921. Schnitzler died on 21 October 1931 in Vienna of a brain hemorrhage. In 1938, following the [[Anschluss]], his son Heinrich went to the United States and did not return to Austria until 1959; he is the father of the Austrian musician and conservationist [[Michael Schnitzler]], born in 1944 in Berkeley, California, who moved to Vienna with his parents in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220033139/http://www.regenwald.at/de/project-information/who-is-michael-schnitzler.html |archivedate=20 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Literary works==\nSchnitzler's works were often controversial, both for their frank description of sexuality (in a letter to Schnitzler [[Sigmund Freud]] confessed \"I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition \u2013 although actually as a result of sensitive introspection \u2013 everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons\")<ref>[http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx Schnitzler's hidden manuscripts explored] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315122800/http://www.research-horizons.cam.ac.uk/features/schnitzler-s-hidden-manuscripts-explored.aspx |date=15 March 2010 }} at research-horizons.cam.ac.uk</ref> and for their strong stand against [[anti-semitism]], represented by works such as his play ''[[Professor Bernhardi]]'' and his novel ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]''. However, although Schnitzler was Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fr\u00e4ulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.\n\nSchnitzler was branded as a pornographer after the release of his play ''[[La Ronde (play)|Reigen]]'', in which 10 pairs of characters are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furor after this play was couched in the strongest anti-semitic terms.<ref>[http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html Arthur Schnitzler scandal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070128074046/http://www.virtualvienna.net/columns/vinal/arthur_schnitzler_scandal.html |date=28 January 2007 }} at virtualvienna.net</ref> ''Reigen'' was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] as ''[[La Ronde (1950 film)|La Ronde]]''. The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler's play is better known there under its French title. [[Richard Oswald]]'s film ''[[The Merry-Go-Round (film)|The Merry-Go-Round]]'' (1920), [[Roger Vadim]]'s ''[[Circle of Love (film)|Circle of Love]]'' (1964) and Otto Schenk's ''Der Reigen'' (1973) also are based on the play. More recently, in [[Fernando Meirelles]]' film ''[[360 (film)|360]]'', Schnitzler's play was provided with a new version as has been the case with many other TV and film productions.\n\nIn the novella ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (novella)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' (1924) Schnitzler may be rebutting a contentious critique of the Jewish character by [[Otto Weininger]] (1903) by positioning the sexuality of the young female Jewish protagonist.<ref>Barker, Andrew (2001). \"Race, Sex and Character in Schnitzler's ''Fr\u00e4ulein Else''.\" ''German Life and Letters''. v. 54(1):1\u20139.</ref> The story, a first-person [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] narrative by a young aristocratic woman, reveals a moral dilemma that ends in tragedy.\n\nIn response to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what he thought about the critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied \"I write of love and death. What other subjects are there?\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vienna : a cultural history|last=Nicholas.|first=Parsons|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195376067|location=Oxford|oclc=221155367}}</ref> Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the [[bedroom farce]] in his plays (and had an affair with  [[Adele Sandrock]], one of his actresses). ''Professor Bernhardi'', a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.\n\nA member of the avant-garde group [[Young Vienna]] (''Jung-Wien''), Schnitzler toyed with formal as well as social conventions. With his 1900 novella ''Leutnant Gustl'', he was the first to write German fiction in stream-of-consciousness narration. The story is an unflattering portrait of its protagonist and of the army's obsessive code of formal honor. It caused Schnitzler to be stripped of his commission as a reserve officer in the medical corps \u2013 something that should be seen against the rising tide of anti-semitism of the time.\n\nHe specialized in shorter works like novellas and one-act plays. And in his short stories like \"The Green Tie\" (\"Die gr\u00fcne Krawatte\") he showed himself to be one of the early masters of [[microfiction]]. However he also wrote two full-length novels: ''[[Der Weg ins Freie]]'' about a talented but not very motivated young composer, a brilliant description of a segment of pre-World War I Viennese society; and the artistically less satisfactory ''[[Therese (novel)|Therese]]''.\n\nIn addition to his plays and fiction, Schnitzler meticulously kept a diary from the age of 17 until two days before his death. The manuscript, which runs to almost 8,000 pages, is most notable for Schnitzler's casual descriptions of sexual conquests; he was often in relationships with several women at once, and for a period of some years he kept a record of every orgasm. Collections of Schnitzler's letters also have been published.\n\nSchnitzler's works were called \"Jewish filth\" by [[Adolf Hitler]] and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when [[Joseph Goebbels]] organized [[Nazi book burnings|book burnings]] in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler's works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[Stefan Zweig]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |title=Arthur Schnitzler |website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi) |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206131904/http://kirjasto.sci.fi/schnitz.htm |archivedate=6 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nHis novella ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (novella)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' has been adapted a number of times, including the German silent film ''[[Fr\u00e4ulein Else (1929 film)|Fr\u00e4ulein Else]]'' (1929), starring [[Elisabeth Bergner]], and the 1946 Argentine film ''[[The Naked Angel]]'', starring [[Olga Zubarry]].\n\n== Selected works ==\n\n=== Plays ===\n* ''[[Anatol (play)|Anatol]]'' (1893), a series of seven acts revolving around a bourgeois playboy and his immature relationships.\n* ''Flirtation'' (''Liebelei'' \u2013 1895), also known as ''The Reckoning'', which was made into [[Liebelei (film)|a film]] by [[Max Oph\u00fcls]] in 1933, and [[Pierre Gaspard-Huit]] in 1958 (''[[Christine (1958 film)|Christine]]''), and also adapted as ''[[Dalliance]]'' by [[Tom Stoppard]] (1986)<ref>''Dalliance'' was staged at the National Theatre by Peter Wood.
