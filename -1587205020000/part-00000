The campaign involved [[commerce raiding]] by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the [[Glorious First of June]] 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.\n\nBy the spring of 1794, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], under the rule of the [[National Convention]], was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with all its neighbours]]. With [[famine]] imminent, the French [[Committee of Public Safety]] looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the [[Atlantic]] during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the [[French Navy]]'s ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]], was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with the main body of the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the [[weather gage]] from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.\n\nThe culminating action of the campaign took place over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} into the Atlantic, and became known as the Glorious First of June. This final engagement saw Howe use the weather gage to attack Villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional [[line of battle]] formation. In the battle, the British fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on the French after a bitterly contested day of fighting. Forcing Villaret to retreat, Howe's force captured seven French battleships, one of which later sank, and inflicted 7,000 casualties on the enemy. Villaret however, claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for the convoy to reach France safely. The battle was the first in a series of defeats the French Navy suffered during the early years of the war, which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among the French officer corps to engage the British at sea.\n\n==Background==\nIn the winter of 1793, war and internal disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following the collapse of the harvest.<ref>Williams, p. 381.</ref> France's ongoing [[French Revolutionary Wars|conflict]] with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the [[National Convention]] was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British [[Royal Navy]]\u2014at war with France since early 1793\u2014patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at [[Hampton Roads]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name=\"NT89\">Tracy, p. 89</ref>\n\nA squadron commanded by Admiral [[Pierre Vanstabel]] was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel would bring the convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under [[Joseph-Marie Nielly]] would reinforce him for the rest of the journey.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> Together, these officers mustered six [[ships of the line]] and numerous smaller craft.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 [[cargo ship|merchant ships]] carrying enough food to feed France for a year.<ref name=\"WJ127\"/>\n\n[[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], admiral of the British Channel Fleet, was aware of the convoy's nature and destination long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block its passage. Sending several small squadrons to protect British commerce crossing the Bay of Biscay, Howe detailed Admiral [[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|George Montagu]] with six battleships to search for the convoy in the south of the Bay while Howe took the main body of the fleet, 26 ships of the line, to patrol near Brest.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref>\n\n==May 1794==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Glorious First of June}}\nApril 1794 was a month of fevered activity on both sides of the [[English Channel]] as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the [[British Empire|Empire]] had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as the [[Western Approaches]], and on 5 May sent the [[frigates]] [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] and [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] close in to Brest to ascertain the status of the French\u2014they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Commerce raiding===\nOut in the Atlantic, the detached squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were [[commerce raiding]] against enemy merchant shipping, but had thus far failed to find the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as [[Prize (law)|prizes]]\u2014including the convoy escort, the 32-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Castor (1785)|HMS ''Castor'']].<ref name=\"BI128\">Ireland, p. 128</ref> [[Thomas Troubridge]], captain of the ''Castor'', would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27765?docPos=3 Troubridge, Sir Thomas], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', P.K. Crimmin, retrieved 23 December 2007</ref> Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette ''Marie-Guiton'' and accurate intelligence on the direction and size of the French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe.<ref name=\"NM134\">Mostert, p. 134</ref> Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.\n\nWhile Nielly and Montagu searched out at sea, Howe took his fleet on a series of cruises back and forth across the Bay of Biscay in the hope of catching the convoy. Between 5 and 18 May he found nothing and so returned to Brest, where his scouting frigates reported that the French battlefleet had gone.<ref name=\"WJ127\" />  Taking advantage of dense fog, Villaret had sailed the previous day, his ships passing within earshot of the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> The French admiral was on the trail of Nielly's squadron; his intention was to meet both Nielly and the convoy and combine forces; with superior numbers he would then be able to escort the convoy to France in safety. Having eluded Howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous, Villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a Dutch convoy of 53 vessels. Its escorts, [[Dutch ship Alliance|''Alliance'']] and [[Dutch ship Waakzaamheid|''Waakzaamheid'']], fled at the sight of the approaching French fleet, and Villaret was free to attack the convoy, capturing 20 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n===Howe's pursuit===\nHowe realised that the direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref> Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but he was forced to burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet.<ref name=\"NM135\">Mostert, p. 135</ref> Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/>\n\nOn the morning of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his scouting frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made off in the direction of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']], of Nielly's squadron.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> Pursuing ''Audacieux'' after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun ''R\u00e9publicaine'' and 16-gun ''Inconnue''.<ref name=\"RG27\">Gardiner, p. 27</ref> Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.<sup>[[#notea|[Note A]]]</sup><ref name=\"RG28\">Gardiner, p. 28</ref>\n\n==28 May==\n[[File:Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe - Project Gutenberg eText 18314.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe;<br />mezzotint engraving by R. Dunkarton, after the painting by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]\nWith his enemy visible from the deck of his flagship by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail in the hope of engaging the rear of the scattered French line.<ref name=\"WJ130\" /> By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral [[Thomas Pasley]].<ref name=\"FJ94\">Jane, p. 94</ref> This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], commanded by [[John Willett Payne]], which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect.<ref name=\"NT96\">Tracy, p. 96, ''Biographical Memoir of Rear-Admiral John Willett Payne''</ref> In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French [[first rate]] 110-gun [[French ship Bretagne (1766)|''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']] exchanged places with the smaller [[third rate]]s at the rear of the line and engaged the pursuing British van.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WJ131\">James, p. 131</ref>\n\nThrough a sharp and skilful tack, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], one of the slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in bringing the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' to steady action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker ''Bellerophon'' taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back to be replaced by [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[George Cranfield Berkeley]].<ref name=\"NT100\">Tracy, p. 100, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> ''Marlborough'' was joined by HMS ''Russell'' and [[HMS Thunderer (1783)|HMS ''Thunderer'']], and between them they shot away much of the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire's'' rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable.<ref name=\"NT97\">Tracy, p. 97, ''The Biographical Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lord Gardner''</ref> [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''.<ref name=\"WJ132\">James, p. 132</ref> Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main body of his fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|William Parker]]. ''Audacious'' had engaged ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, ''Audacious'' took severe damage.<ref name=\"FJ94\"/>\n\nIt was not until 22:00 that ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' disentangled themselves and limped apart\u2014their respective fleets now some way off.<ref name=\"WJ132\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew later claimed that ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had struck her colours during the engagement, although this has not been corroborated.<ref name=\"WJ132\" />  Parker stated that he did not take possession of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' because he was concerned by the distant sighting of nine French battleships on the horizon. He had spotted a squadron under Commodore [[Jean-Joseph Castagnier]], which was uninvolved in the current campaign and which soon disappeared without participating in any of the subsequent engagements.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew made strenuous efforts to repair their ship and rejoin the British fleet during the night, but became disorientated and in the morning ''Audacious'' was still only half a mile from her former opponent.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/>\n\n''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had suffered much more severely than ''Audacious'', but survived the encounter without being boarded thanks to a misread signal by Captain [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] of ''Thunderer'', who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line ''Audacieux'', the frigate [[French frigate Bellone (1778)|''Bellone'']], and two corvettes.

At dawn on 29 May the British fleet saw ''Audacieux'' retiring to the east but did not follow, concentrating on the main French line with the hope of provoking a decisive engagement.<ref name=\"WJ134\">James, p. 134</ref> Howe ordered his ships to pursue the enemy rear, and the British line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through the French line and isolate and capture the ships east of the cut. Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] in [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was chosen to lead the attack as his ship was the fastest in the fleet, but the manoeuvre was a complete failure due to the inexplicable refusal of Molloy to close with the enemy.<ref name=\"NM137\">Mostert, p. 137</ref> Instead, ''Caesar'' and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']] opened fire on the rearmost French ships from a distance.<ref name=\"NT96\"/> The vans of the opposing fleets then engaged in a long-range broadside duel from 10:00.

''Bellerophon'' and [[Lord Hugh Seymour]] in ''Leviathan'' followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; ''Bellerophon'' successfully, ''Leviathan'' prevented by damage to her helm.<ref name=\"WJ137\">James, p. 137</ref> This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the [[French ship Terrible (1779)|''Terrible'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']], and [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/>\n\nAs Howe pressed after the main body of the French fleet\u2014now tailed by the damaged ''Terrible''\u2014the rest of his fleet followed, bombarding the already battered ''Tyrannicide'' and ''Indomptable'' as they passed.<ref name=\"NT101\"/> As [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Invincible (1765)|HMS ''Invincible'']], and [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] cut through the French in turn, Villaret [[Jibe (sailing)|wore]] his fleet round to face Howe.

Having driven away the ships threatening ''Indomptable'' and ''Tyrannicide'', Villaret reformed his fleet and attempted to escape westwards, closely followed by the British van who were now holding the weather gage. Both fleets were too damaged to continue action in the remaining daylight and firing stopped at 17:00.<ref name=\"PP16\">Padfield, p. 16</ref> The British fleet has suffered 67 killed and 128 wounded during the day's fighting.<ref name=\"NM138\"/>\n\nEvening found the fleets approximately {{convert|10|nmi|km}} apart, sailing northwest. Both were conducting hasty repairs and attempting to ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 May. Significantly, Lord Howe was unaware that to the northeast, over the same sea as the previous day's action had been fought, the ponderous convoy of merchant ships was passing, having successfully evaded British pursuit.<ref name=\"WJ172\">James, p. 172</ref> Unlike his opponent Villaret knew the location of the convoy, which was joined that evening by the battered ''Montagnard''. Escorting the convoy, Admiral Nielly had been apprised of the situation by ''Montagnard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, and had left his escort duties to reinforce Villaret.<ref name=\"WJ145\">James, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn a postscript to the day's action the British frigate ''Castor'', captured early in the campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller [[HMS Carysfort (1766)|HMS ''Carysfort'']] under Captain [[Francis Laforey]] at the [[frigate action of 29 May 1794]].

All but ''Caesar'' replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French.<ref name=\"NM139\">Mostert, p. 139</ref> Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or come to grips with the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north.<ref name=\"NT101\">Tracy, p. 101, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls.<ref name=\"WJ146\">James, p. 146</ref> Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing ''Montagnard'' and the frigate [[French ship Seine|''Seine'']] to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship [[French ship Mont Blanc (1791)|''Trente-un-Mai'']] and Nielly's squadron of ''Sans Pareil'', [[French ship Trajan (1792)|''Trajan'']], and [[French ship T\u00e9m\u00e9raire (1782)|''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'']].<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> Villaret had also dispatched the battered ''Indomptable'' for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.<ref>British sources have listed this ship as [[French ship Mont Blanc|''Mont Blanc'']], (James, p. 145) but in fact the ship originally named ''Mont Blanc'' had been renamed ''Trente-un-Mai'' by June 1794, and the French fleet did not possess another vessel of this name at this time. Thus, the identity of the ship departing with ''Indomptable'' is unclear, although it may have been [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Brutus'']], a 42-gun [[razee]].</ref>\n\nThroughout 31 May Howe's fleet closed with the French, making full use of the advantage of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9&nbsp;km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted.<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11&nbsp;km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more.<ref name=\"FJ95\">Jane, p. 95</ref> Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.\n\n==Glorious First of June==\n[[File:Vengeur du Peuple-Prairial.png|thumb|The sinking of the ''Vengeur du Peuple'',<br />engraving by P. Ozanne]]\n{{details|Glorious First of June}}\nAt 09:24 on the morning of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the original tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week.<ref name=\"JP153\">James, p. 153</ref> While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.<ref name=\"NR430\">Rodger, p. 430</ref>\n\nAs various British and French ships broke off into personal duels and some latecoming British ships struggled to get into action, Villaret led his flagship [[French ship Ocean (1790)|''Montagne'']] to the north and began assembling a coherent counter-force from those of his fleet which had escaped Howe's assault.<ref name=\"JP166\">James, p. 166</ref>  In the melee itself several very hard-fought engagements took place\u2014particularly that between [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[French ship Vengeur du Peuple|''Vengeur du Peuple'']]. At least twelve ships were dismasted, with the British battleships HMS ''Marlborough'' and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] losing all three masts and ten French vessels suffering similarly.<ref name=\"JP152\">James, p. 152</ref>\n\nBy 11:30 the initial action was dying down, and Villaret brought his reconstituted force back towards the battle site to contest ownership of the dismasted hulks floating there. Howe likewise reformed his main force and met Villaret, who failed to capture any of the battered British ships but did regather six of his own, leaving Howe with seven prizes.<ref name=\"FJ96\">Jane, p. 96</ref> Of these, the wrecked ''Vengeur'' soon sank, although British boats had removed many of her crew.<ref name=\"JP164\">James, p. 164</ref>  Howe was left in possession of the battle site, but Villaret had successfully held off the British long enough for the convoy to pass to the east unmolested. Both fleets returned to their home ports over the next week.<ref name=\"JP170\">James, p. 170</ref>\n\n==The convoy arrives==\nWhile searching for the convoy during the first week of June, Montagu's squadron became trapped between two French squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid Villaret's returning fleet. As a result, the French Atlantic seaboard was clear of British forces for a significant period.<ref name=\"JP171\">James, p. 171</ref> The food convoy arrived safely in France in the third week of June, and Montagu returned to Britain empty-handed. Both nations claimed victory in the campaign; the British by virtue of success in the only major action, and the French through the intact arrival of their convoy.<ref name=\"RG15\">Gardiner, p. 15</ref>\n\nThe campaign had notable effects on the navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the [[Mediterranean]]. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps, so that by the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook.<ref name=\"PP163\">Padfield, p. 163</ref> In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's officer corps. Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed at the end of the campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust.<ref name=\"ODNBCald\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4383 Caldwell, Sir Benjamin], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J.K.

As long as Villaret held the weather gage, Howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on the defensive while simultaneously attempting to force Villaret to give up his advantage.

The campaign involved [[commerce raiding]] by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the [[Glorious First of June]] 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.\n\nBy the spring of 1794, the [[First French Republic|French Republic]], under the rule of the [[National Convention]], was at [[French Revolutionary Wars|war with all its neighbours]]. With [[famine]] imminent, the French [[Committee of Public Safety]] looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an infusion of grain; this was to be convoyed across the [[Atlantic]] during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the [[French Navy]]'s ability to fight coherently and supply shortages had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]], was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with the main body of the Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the [[weather gage]] from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.\n\nThe culminating action of the campaign took place over {{convert|400|nmi|km}} into the Atlantic, and became known as the Glorious First of June. This final engagement saw Howe use the weather gage to attack Villaret directly while his opponent attempted to fight in a traditional [[line of battle]] formation. In the battle, the British fleet inflicted a heavy defeat on the French after a bitterly contested day of fighting. Forcing Villaret to retreat, Howe's force captured seven French battleships, one of which later sank, and inflicted 7,000 casualties on the enemy. Villaret however, claimed strategic success as his delaying tactics had bought enough time for the convoy to reach France safely. The battle was the first in a series of defeats the French Navy suffered during the early years of the war, which bred a defeatist attitude and an unwillingness among the French officer corps to engage the British at sea.\n\n==Background==\nIn the winter of 1793, war and internal disorder had combined with poor weather to leave France facing starvation following the collapse of the harvest.<ref>Williams, p. 381.</ref> France's ongoing [[French Revolutionary Wars|conflict]] with her neighbours precluded overland imports; the only nation willing and able to sell grain to the [[National Convention]] was the United States. Importing food from the Americas was a highly risky venture, as the British [[Royal Navy]]\u2014at war with France since early 1793\u2014patrolled much of the Atlantic passage. To provide effective protection for the vessels involved, a plan was agreed between France and the United States to collect the supplies over a period of months and transport them in a single convoy. A gathering point was arranged at [[Hampton Roads]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]].<ref name=\"NT89\">Tracy, p. 89</ref>\n\nA squadron commanded by Admiral [[Pierre Vanstabel]] was dispatched to Hampton Roads to provide escort. Vanstabel would bring the convoy to the Bay of Biscay, where a second squadron under [[Joseph-Marie Nielly]] would reinforce him for the rest of the journey.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> Together, these officers mustered six [[ships of the line]] and numerous smaller craft.<ref name=\"WJ127\">James, p. 127</ref> The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral [[Villaret de Joyeuse]] would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 [[cargo ship|merchant ships]] carrying enough food to feed France for a year.<ref name=\"WJ127\"/>\n\n[[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]], admiral of the British Channel Fleet, was aware of the convoy's nature and destination long before it left the Chesapeake, and made preparations to block its passage. Sending several small squadrons to protect British commerce crossing the Bay of Biscay, Howe detailed Admiral [[George Montagu (Royal Navy officer)|George Montagu]] with six battleships to search for the convoy in the south of the Bay while Howe took the main body of the fleet, 26 ships of the line, to patrol near Brest.<ref name=\"WJ125\">James, p. 125</ref>\n\n==May 1794==\n{{see also|Order of battle at the Glorious First of June}}\nApril 1794 was a month of fevered activity on both sides of the [[English Channel]] as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the [[British Empire|Empire]] had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as the [[Western Approaches]], and on 5 May sent the [[frigates]] [[HMS Latona (1781)|HMS ''Latona'']] and [[HMS Phaeton (1782)|HMS ''Phaeton'']] close in to Brest to ascertain the status of the French\u2014they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.<ref name=\"WJ126\">James, p. 126</ref>\n\n===Commerce raiding===\nOut in the Atlantic, the detached squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were [[commerce raiding]] against enemy merchant shipping, but had thus far failed to find the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as [[Prize (law)|prizes]]\u2014including the convoy escort, the 32-gun [[frigate]] [[HMS Castor (1785)|HMS ''Castor'']].<ref name=\"BI128\">Ireland, p. 128</ref> [[Thomas Troubridge]], captain of the ''Castor'', would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/27765?docPos=3 Troubridge, Sir Thomas], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', P.K.

He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.\n\nWhile Nielly and Montagu searched out at sea, Howe took his fleet on a series of cruises back and forth across the Bay of Biscay in the hope of catching the convoy. Between 5 and 18 May he found nothing and so returned to Brest, where his scouting frigates reported that the French battlefleet had gone.<ref name=\"WJ127\" />  Taking advantage of dense fog, Villaret had sailed the previous day, his ships passing within earshot of the British fleet.<ref name=\"WJ128\"/> The French admiral was on the trail of Nielly's squadron; his intention was to meet both Nielly and the convoy and combine forces; with superior numbers he would then be able to escort the convoy to France in safety. Having eluded Howe and still some days from his planned rendezvous, Villaret gained an unexpected success when he ran across a Dutch convoy of 53 vessels. Its escorts, [[Dutch ship Alliance|''Alliance'']] and [[Dutch ship Waakzaamheid|''Waakzaamheid'']], fled at the sight of the approaching French fleet, and Villaret was free to attack the convoy, capturing 20 [[cargo ship|merchantmen]].<ref name=\"WJ128\">James, p. 128</ref>\n\n===Howe's pursuit===\nHowe realised that the direction of Villaret's departure would take him directly across Admiral Montagu's planned route, and that, should Montagu meet Villaret, the British squadron would be destroyed.<ref name=\"WJ129\">James, p. 129</ref> Setting all sail in pursuit, Howe followed Villaret into the Atlantic on 20 May. The next day Howe's ships recaptured ten of the lost Dutch merchantmen, but he was forced to burn them since crewing them with British sailors would weaken his own already understrength fleet.<ref name=\"NM135\">Mostert, p. 135</ref> Prisoners from these ships gave Howe the information that the French fleet was only a short distance ahead, but that it had been joined by an additional ship from Nielly's squadron as well as several frigates.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> By now satisfied that Montagu was safely to the southwest, Howe pressed on hoped to bring Villaret to battle within the week. On 23 May however, the British fleet was driven southwards by strong winds and had to slowly work its way north to find the French track again. The detour did however enable him to recapture and destroy four more of Villaret's Dutch prizes.<ref name=\"WJ129\"/>\n\nOn the morning of 25 May Howe's pursuit finally bore fruit, when his scouting frigates spotted a lone French ship of the line at 04:00. This ship sighted Howe's force at the same time, and immediately made off in the direction of the French fleet. The fleeing battleship left behind an American merchant ship she had been towing, which when taken reported that the French ship was [[French ship Audacieux (1784)|''Audacieux'']], of Nielly's squadron.<ref name=\"WJ130\">James, p. 130</ref> Pursuing ''Audacieux'' after burning the American prize, the British fleet also overran and burnt two French corvettes, the 20-gun ''R\u00e9publicaine'' and 16-gun ''Inconnue''.<ref name=\"RG27\">Gardiner, p. 27</ref> Continuing his chase over the next three days, on 28 May Howe's lookouts spotted the French on the eastern horizon slightly to the south, indicating that the French held the weather gage.<sup>[[#notea|[Note A]]]</sup><ref name=\"RG28\">Gardiner, p. 28</ref>\n\n==28 May==\n[[File:Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe - Project Gutenberg eText 18314.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe;<br />mezzotint engraving by R. Dunkarton, after the painting by [[John Singleton Copley]]]]\nWith his enemy visible from the deck of his flagship by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail in the hope of engaging the rear of the scattered French line.<ref name=\"WJ130\" /> By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral [[Thomas Pasley]].<ref name=\"FJ94\">Jane, p. 94</ref> This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']], commanded by [[John Willett Payne]], which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect.<ref name=\"NT96\">Tracy, p. 96, ''Biographical Memoir of Rear-Admiral John Willett Payne''</ref> In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French [[first rate]] 110-gun [[French ship Bretagne (1766)|''R\u00e9volutionnaire'']] exchanged places with the smaller [[third rate]]s at the rear of the line and engaged the pursuing British van.<ref name=\"BI128\"/> This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer [[Jean Bon Saint-Andr\u00e9]].<ref name=\"WJ131\">James, p. 131</ref>\n\nThrough a sharp and skilful tack, [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], one of the slowest ships in the British van, succeeded in bringing the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' to steady action at 18:00. The ships exchanged fire for twenty minutes, the weaker ''Bellerophon'' taking severe damage to her rigging, and falling back to be replaced by [[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[George Cranfield Berkeley]].<ref name=\"NT100\">Tracy, p. 100, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> ''Marlborough'' was joined by HMS ''Russell'' and [[HMS Thunderer (1783)|HMS ''Thunderer'']], and between them they shot away much of the ''R\u00e9volutionnaire's'' rigging, so that by 19:30 she was unmanageable.<ref name=\"NT97\">Tracy, p. 97, ''The Biographical Memoirs of the Right Honourable Lord Gardner''</ref> [[HMS Leviathan (1790)|HMS ''Leviathan'']] also joined the action, firing at an unidentified ship ahead of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''.<ref name=\"WJ132\">James, p. 132</ref> Concerned about Pasley's squadron becoming cut off from the main body of his fleet, Howe recalled them to the British line at 20:00. All complied except the newly arrived [[HMS Audacious (1785)|HMS ''Audacious'']] under Captain [[Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Harburn|William Parker]]. ''Audacious'' had engaged ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' so closely that she could not safely withdraw, and although her gunnery eventually dismasted her huge opponent, ''Audacious'' took severe damage.<ref name=\"FJ94\"/>\n\nIt was not until 22:00 that ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' disentangled themselves and limped apart\u2014their respective fleets now some way off.<ref name=\"WJ132\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew later claimed that ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had struck her colours during the engagement, although this has not been corroborated.<ref name=\"WJ132\" />  Parker stated that he did not take possession of ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' because he was concerned by the distant sighting of nine French battleships on the horizon. He had spotted a squadron under Commodore [[Jean-Joseph Castagnier]], which was uninvolved in the current campaign and which soon disappeared without participating in any of the subsequent engagements.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> ''Audacious's'' crew made strenuous efforts to repair their ship and rejoin the British fleet during the night, but became disorientated and in the morning ''Audacious'' was still only half a mile from her former opponent.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/>\n\n''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' had suffered much more severely than ''Audacious'', but survived the encounter without being boarded thanks to a misread signal by Captain [[Sir Albemarle Bertie, 1st Baronet|Albemarle Bertie]] of ''Thunderer'', who failed to take possession of the dismasted three-decker when ordered to.<ref name=\"WJ133\"/> During the night Villaret sent reinforcements to rescue ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', and at dawn on 29 May Parker saw that his large opponent was soon to be supported by the undamaged ship of the line ''Audacieux'', the frigate [[French frigate Bellone (1778)|''Bellone'']], and two corvettes. Once more ''Audacious'' came under fire from ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'', leaving her no option but to flee this superior force.<ref name=\"WJ133\">James, p. 133</ref> ''Audacious'' was chased for half an hour by ''Bellone'' and the corvettes, before losing them in a rain squall, and eventually returned to [[Plymouth]] on 3 June. ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' also escaped pursuit and was taken under tow by ''Audacieux'', who brought her safely to [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] several days later.<ref name=\"RG28\"/> For leaving the battlefleet before the main engagement, ''R\u00e9volutionnaire''{{'}}s captain was subsequently arrested.<ref name=\"BI128\"/>\n\n==29 May==\n[[File:Louis-Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, vice-amiral (1750-1812).jpg|thumb|upright|Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, 1839 painting by [[Jean-Baptiste Paulin Gu\u00e9rin|Gu\u00e9rin]]]]\nWith ''Audacious'' and ''R\u00e9volutionnaire'' lost in the dark behind them, both British and French fleets continued westwards towards the convoy rendezvous. At dawn on 29 May the British fleet saw ''Audacieux'' retiring to the east but did not follow, concentrating on the main French line with the hope of provoking a decisive engagement.<ref name=\"WJ134\">James, p. 134</ref> Howe ordered his ships to pursue the enemy rear, and the British line was placed on a tack that was intended to cut through the French line and isolate and capture the ships east of the cut. Captain [[Anthony James Pye Molloy|Anthony Molloy]] in [[HMS Caesar (1793)|HMS ''Caesar'']] was chosen to lead the attack as his ship was the fastest in the fleet, but the manoeuvre was a complete failure due to the inexplicable refusal of Molloy to close with the enemy.<ref name=\"NM137\">Mostert, p. 137</ref> Instead, ''Caesar'' and [[HMS Queen (1769)|HMS ''Queen'']] opened fire on the rearmost French ships from a distance.<ref name=\"NT96\"/> The vans of the opposing fleets then engaged in a long-range broadside duel from 10:00. This inflicted mild damage on both sides, the worst hit being the French [[French ship Jupiter (1789)|''Montagnard'']].<ref name=\"WJ143\">James, p. 143</ref>\n\nHaving failed to cut the French line at his first attempt, Howe reissued the order at 12:30. Once more ''Caesar'' was to lead the way, with the intention of splitting the enemy fleet in half.<ref name=\"WJ135\">James, p. 135</ref> Captain Molloy then refused to carry out the order, signalling without cause that ''Caesar'' was unable to tack and then turning and sailing eastwards down the outside of the British fleet, rather than towards the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ138\">James, p. 138</ref> This unexpected move threw the following ships into a state of confusion; ''Queen'', coming behind ''Caesar'', attempted to obey Howe's signal alone but was badly damaged by shot, and her captain [[John Hutt (Royal Navy officer)|John Hutt]] mortally wounded.<ref name=\"ODNBHutt\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14295 Hutt, John], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], retrieved 23 December 2007</ref> Unable to effectively manoeuvre, ''Queen'' passed down the outside of the French line, firing as she went.<ref name=\"NT96\" />\n\nHis plan in tatters, Howe responded by example, leading his flagship [[HMS Queen Charlotte (1790)|HMS ''Queen Charlotte'']] towards the French line which was rapidly slipping ahead of the British, steering around the meandering ''Caesar'' as he did so.<ref name=\"NM138\">Mostert, p. 138</ref> ''Queen Charlotte'' first attempted to break through the French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to reach this gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship [[French ship Eole (1789)|''Eole'']] from close range. ''Bellerophon'' and [[Lord Hugh Seymour]] in ''Leviathan'' followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; ''Bellerophon'' successfully, ''Leviathan'' prevented by damage to her helm.<ref name=\"WJ137\">James, p. 137</ref> This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the [[French ship Terrible (1779)|''Terrible'']], [[French ship Tyrannicide (1793)|''Tyrannicide'']], and [[French ship Indomptable (1789)|''Indomptable'']], forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/>\n\nAs Howe pressed after the main body of the French fleet\u2014now tailed by the damaged ''Terrible''\u2014the rest of his fleet followed, bombarding the already battered ''Tyrannicide'' and ''Indomptable'' as they passed.<ref name=\"NT101\"/> As [[HMS Orion (1787)|HMS ''Orion'']], [[HMS Invincible (1765)|HMS ''Invincible'']], and [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] cut through the French in turn, Villaret [[Jibe (sailing)|wore]] his fleet round to face Howe. Encouraged by ''Caesar's'' disobedience, he deliberately sacrificed the weather gage in the belief that Howe's fleet was more damaged than it appeared.<ref name=\"WJ138\"/> All of Villaret's ships followed him except ''Montagnard'', which refused to turn, claiming to be seriously damaged.<ref name=\"WJ143\"/> Villaret's manoeuvre soon isolated the ''Queen Charlotte'', ''Bellerophon'', and ''Leviathan'', which were forced to retreat hastily before the main French force.  Having driven away the ships threatening ''Indomptable'' and ''Tyrannicide'', Villaret reformed his fleet and attempted to escape westwards, closely followed by the British van who were now holding the weather gage. Both fleets were too damaged to continue action in the remaining daylight and firing stopped at 17:00.<ref name=\"PP16\">Padfield, p. 16</ref> The British fleet has suffered 67 killed and 128 wounded during the day's fighting.<ref name=\"NM138\"/>\n\nEvening found the fleets approximately {{convert|10|nmi|km}} apart, sailing northwest. Both were conducting hasty repairs and attempting to ready themselves for what all assumed would be another day of battle on 30 May. Significantly, Lord Howe was unaware that to the northeast, over the same sea as the previous day's action had been fought, the ponderous convoy of merchant ships was passing, having successfully evaded British pursuit.<ref name=\"WJ172\">James, p. 172</ref> Unlike his opponent Villaret knew the location of the convoy, which was joined that evening by the battered ''Montagnard''. Escorting the convoy, Admiral Nielly had been apprised of the situation by ''Montagnard''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, and had left his escort duties to reinforce Villaret.<ref name=\"WJ145\">James, p. 145</ref>\n\nIn a postscript to the day's action the British frigate ''Castor'', captured early in the campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller [[HMS Carysfort (1766)|HMS ''Carysfort'']] under Captain [[Francis Laforey]] at the [[frigate action of 29 May 1794]]. Some of the crew were released by their rescuers but most, including the officers, were not aboard, having been taken onto Nielly's flagship [[French ship Sans Pareil (1793)|''Sans Pareil'']].<ref name=\"ODNBTroubridge\"/>\n\n==Between the actions==\nOn the morning of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they considered their ships ready for combat. All but ''Caesar'' replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French.<ref name=\"NM139\">Mostert, p. 139</ref> Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or come to grips with the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north.<ref name=\"NT101\">Tracy, p. 101, ''Proceedings of His Majesty's Ship the Orion''</ref> To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls.<ref name=\"WJ146\">James, p. 146</ref> Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing ''Montagnard'' and the frigate [[French ship Seine|''Seine'']] to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship [[French ship Mont Blanc (1791)|''Trente-un-Mai'']] and Nielly's squadron of ''Sans Pareil'', [[French ship Trajan (1792)|''Trajan'']], and [[French ship T\u00e9m\u00e9raire (1782)|''T\u00e9m\u00e9raire'']].<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> Villaret had also dispatched the battered ''Indomptable'' for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.<ref>British sources have listed this ship as [[French ship Mont Blanc|''Mont Blanc'']], (James, p. 145) but in fact the ship originally named ''Mont Blanc'' had been renamed ''Trente-un-Mai'' by June 1794, and the French fleet did not possess another vessel of this name at this time. Thus, the identity of the ship departing with ''Indomptable'' is unclear, although it may have been [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Brutus'']], a 42-gun [[razee]].</ref>\n\nThroughout 31 May Howe's fleet closed with the French, making full use of the advantage of the weather gage. By 17:00 the fleets were five miles (9&nbsp;km) apart, but at 19:00 Howe gave orders to keep his ships out of shot range but within easy sailing of the French. He did not want a repeat of the confusion of 29 May and preferred to delay any combat until he was assured of a full day in which to conduct it, in order that his signals not be obscured or misinterpreted.<ref name=\"WJ145\"/> During the night the fleets remained in visual contact, and by first light on 1 June the British were just six miles (11&nbsp;km) from Villaret's fleet and organising in preparation to attack once more.<ref name=\"FJ95\">Jane, p. 95</ref> Both fleets were now sailing in a western direction, Villaret still hoping to draw Howe away from the convoy.\n\n==Glorious First of June==\n[[File:Vengeur du Peuple-Prairial.png|thumb|The sinking of the ''Vengeur du Peuple'',<br />engraving by P. Ozanne]]\n{{details|Glorious First of June}}\nAt 09:24 on the morning of 1 June, Howe sent his ships into action using the original tactic of turning each ship in his line northwest simultaneously, so that they would bear down individually on Villaret's fleet and each break the enemy line separately. His intention was to cut the French line in 25 places, raking the enemy vessels at both bow and stern and dividing their fire so they could be defeated piecemeal. Ultimately though this ambitious plan failed, due to ill-discipline among Howe's subordinates and the damage his fleet had sustained over the previous week.<ref name=\"JP153\">James, p. 153</ref> While six of Howe's ships did break the French line as ordered, and several others came close, many of his captains failed to follow orders and instead engaged the enemy from a distance in desultory gun duels which had little effect.<ref name=\"NR430\">Rodger, p. 430</ref>\n\nAs various British and French ships broke off into personal duels and some latecoming British ships struggled to get into action, Villaret led his flagship [[French ship Ocean (1790)|''Montagne'']] to the north and began assembling a coherent counter-force from those of his fleet which had escaped Howe's assault.<ref name=\"JP166\">James, p. 166</ref>  In the melee itself several very hard-fought engagements took place\u2014particularly that between [[HMS Brunswick (1790)|HMS ''Brunswick'']] and [[French ship Vengeur du Peuple|''Vengeur du Peuple'']]. At least twelve ships were dismasted, with the British battleships HMS ''Marlborough'' and [[HMS Defence (1763)|HMS ''Defence'']] losing all three masts and ten French vessels suffering similarly.<ref name=\"JP152\">James, p. 152</ref>\n\nBy 11:30 the initial action was dying down, and Villaret brought his reconstituted force back towards the battle site to contest ownership of the dismasted hulks floating there. Howe likewise reformed his main force and met Villaret, who failed to capture any of the battered British ships but did regather six of his own, leaving Howe with seven prizes.<ref name=\"FJ96\">Jane, p. 96</ref> Of these, the wrecked ''Vengeur'' soon sank, although British boats had removed many of her crew.<ref name=\"JP164\">James, p. 164</ref>  Howe was left in possession of the battle site, but Villaret had successfully held off the British long enough for the convoy to pass to the east unmolested. Both fleets returned to their home ports over the next week.<ref name=\"JP170\">James, p. 170</ref>\n\n==The convoy arrives==\nWhile searching for the convoy during the first week of June, Montagu's squadron became trapped between two French squadrons and was forced to sail southwards to avoid Villaret's returning fleet. As a result, the French Atlantic seaboard was clear of British forces for a significant period.<ref name=\"JP171\">James, p. 171</ref> The food convoy arrived safely in France in the third week of June, and Montagu returned to Britain empty-handed. Both nations claimed victory in the campaign; the British by virtue of success in the only major action, and the French through the intact arrival of their convoy.<ref name=\"RG15\">Gardiner, p. 15</ref>\n\nThe campaign had notable effects on the navies of both Britain and France. The French did not directly contest British supremacy in Northern European waters again, spending most of the next 23 years in Brest and other ports, their few major sallies mainly directed at the [[Mediterranean]]. Continued upheavals in the French Navy resulted in a decline of quality in its officer corps, so that by the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] 11 years later the port-bound nature of the French fleet had resulted in a cautious and inexperienced tactical outlook.<ref name=\"PP163\">Padfield, p. 163</ref> In Britain, the battle created a division within the Royal Navy's officer corps. Howe's dispatch after the battle criticised some officers who he believed had hesitated in action, and those officers received none of the honours distributed at the end of the campaign. Fallout from this dispute was widespread, with several senior figures resigning in disgust.<ref name=\"ODNBCald\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/4383 Caldwell, Sir Benjamin], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', J.K.

When the wind was in the wrong direction, a captain could [[tacking (sailing)|tack]] to compensate, but possessing the weather gage meant that a ship could use the wind to attack their opponent directly, without the need for complicated manoeuvre. As long as Villaret held the weather gage, Howe was unable to attack him as he wished and instead had to be on the defensive while simultaneously attempting to force Villaret to give up his advantage. Villaret could have used the weather gage to attack Howe at any time, but did not do so in order to buy time for the convoy to pass the British fleet.</li>\n</ol>\n{{refend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Gardiner\n | first = Robert\n | year = 2001\n | origyear= reprint of 1996\n | chapter = The Glorious First of June\n | title = Fleet Battle and Blockade\n | publisher = Caxton Editions\n | isbn = 1-84067-363-X\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Ireland\n | first = Bernard\n | year = 2000\n | origyear=\n | chapter =\n | title = Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail\n | publisher = Harper Collins\n | isbn = 0-00-414522-4\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = James\n | first = William\n | authorlink = William James (naval historian)\n | year = 2002\n | origyear = reprint of 1827\n | chapter =\n | title = The Naval History of Great Britain, Volume 1, 1793\u20131796\n | publisher = Conway Maritime Press\n | isbn = 0-85177-905-0\n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Jane\n | first = Fred T.\n | authorlink = Fred T.

The spine of a tree can be thought of the trunk in the same way trees have leaves and a root. Though finger trees are often shown with the spine and branches coming off the sides, there are actually two nodes on the spine at each level that have been paired to make this central spine.

In this way, working down the tree is going from the leaves to the root of the tree, which is the opposite of the typical tree data structure. To get this nice and unusual structure, we have to make sure the original tree has a uniform depth. To ensure that the depth is uniform, when declaring the node object, it must be parameterized by the type of the child. The nodes on the spine of depth 1 and above point to trees, and with this parameterization they can be represented by the nested nodes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/26/finger-trees-done-right-i-hope/|title=Finger Trees Done Right (I hope)|work=Good Math, Bad Math|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Transforming a tree into a finger tree ===\nWe will start this process with a balanced [[2-3 tree]]. For the finger tree to work, all the leaf nodes need to also be level.\n\nA finger is \u201ca structure providing efficient access to nodes of a tree near a distinguished location.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> To make a finger tree we need to put fingers to the right and left ends of the tree and transform it like a [[Zipper (data structure)|zipper]]. This gives us that constant amortized time access to the ends of a sequence.\n\nTo transform, start with the balanced 2-3 tree.\n\nTake the leftmost and rightmost internal nodes of the tree and pull them up so the rest of the tree dangles between them as shown in the image to the right. \n\nCombines the spines to make a standard 2-3 finger tree.\n\nThis can be described as<ref name=\":0\" />: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ndata FingerTree a = Empty \n                    | Single a \n                    | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)\ndata Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>The digits in the examples shown are the nodes with letters. Each list is divided by the prefix or suffix of each node on the spine. In a transformed 2-3 tree it seems that the digit lists at the top level can have a length of two or three with the lower levels only having length of one or two. In order for some application of finger trees to run so efficiently, finger trees allow between one and four subtrees on each level.\n\nThe digits of the finger tree can be transformed into a list like so<ref name=\":0\" />:  <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntype Digit a = One a | Two a a | Three a a a | Four a a a a\n</syntaxhighlight>And so on the image, the top level has elements of type ''a'', the next has elements of type ''Node a'' because the node in between the spine and leaves, and this would go on meaning in general that the ''n''th level of the tree has elements of type <math>Node^n </math> ''a'', or 2-3 trees of depth n. This means a sequence of ''n'' elements is represented by a tree of depth \u0398(log ''n''). Even better, an element ''d'' places from the nearest end is stored at a depth of \u0398(log d) in the tree.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Reductions ====\nReduction of nodes:\n\n<math>\\begin{matrix} \\mathrm{instance} \\ Reduce \\ Node \\ \\mathrm{where}  \n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node2 \\ a \\ b) z = a \\prec(b \\prec z )\n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node3 \\ a \\ b \\ c) z = a \\prec(b \\prec(c \\prec z ))\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node2 \\ b \\ a) =(z \\succ b) \\succ a\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node3 \\ c \\ b \\ a) = ((z \\succ c) \\succ b) \\succ a \\end{matrix}</math>\n\nReduction of finger trees:\n\n'''instance''' ''Reduce FingerTree'' '''where'''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) ''Empty''                 ''z = z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Single x'')            ''z = x <math>\\prec</math> z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Deep pr m sf'' )   ''z = pr'' <math>\\prec</math>' (''m'' <math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> (''sf <math>\\prec</math>''<nowiki/>' ))\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\prec</math>') = ''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>)\n\n(<math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducer'' (''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>))\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z Empty''                    = z\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Single x'')               = z <math>\\succ</math> x\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Deep pr m sf'' )      = ((''z'' <math>\\succ</math>' ''pr'') <math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> ''m'') <math>\\succ</math>''<nowiki/>'sf''\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\succ</math>' ) = ''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>)\n\n(<math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducel'' (''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>))<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Deque operations ===\nFinger trees also make efficient [[Double-ended queue|deques]]. Whether the structure is persistent or not, all operations take \u0398(1) amortized time. The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

The nodes on the spine of depth 1 and above point to trees, and with this parameterization they can be represented by the nested nodes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2010/04/26/finger-trees-done-right-i-hope/|title=Finger Trees Done Right (I hope)|work=Good Math, Bad Math|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Transforming a tree into a finger tree ===\nWe will start this process with a balanced [[2-3 tree]]. For the finger tree to work, all the leaf nodes need to also be level.\n\nA finger is \u201ca structure providing efficient access to nodes of a tree near a distinguished location.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> To make a finger tree we need to put fingers to the right and left ends of the tree and transform it like a [[Zipper (data structure)|zipper]]. This gives us that constant amortized time access to the ends of a sequence.\n\nTo transform, start with the balanced 2-3 tree.\n\nTake the leftmost and rightmost internal nodes of the tree and pull them up so the rest of the tree dangles between them as shown in the image to the right. \n\nCombines the spines to make a standard 2-3 finger tree.\n\nThis can be described as: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ndata FingerTree a = Empty \n                    | Single a \n                    | Deep (Digit a) (FingerTree (Node a)) (Digit a)\ndata Node a = Node2 a a | Node3 a a a\n</syntaxhighlight><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe digits in the examples shown are the nodes with letters. Each list is divided by the prefix or suffix of each node on the spine. In a transformed 2-3 tree it seems that the digit lists at the top level can have a length of two or three with the lower levels only having length of one or two. In order for some application of finger trees to run so efficiently, finger trees allow between one and four subtrees on each level.\n\nThe digits of the finger tree can be transformed into a list like so:  <syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\ntype Digit a = [a]\n</syntaxhighlight><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnd so on the image, the top level has elements of type ''a'', the next has elements of type ''Node a'' because the node in between the spine and leaves, and this would go on meaning in general that the ''n''th level of the tree has elements of type <math>Node^n </math> ''a'', or 2-3 trees of depth n. This means a sequence of ''n'' elements is represented by a tree of depth \u0398(log ''n''). Even better, an element ''d'' places from the nearest end is stored at a depth of \u0398(log d) in the tree.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Reductions ====\nReduction of nodes:\n\n<math>\\begin{matrix} \\mathrm{instance} \\ Reduce \\ Node \\ \\mathrm{where}  \n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node2 \\ a \\ b) z = a \\prec(b \\prec z )\n\\\\ reducer (\\prec) (Node3 \\ a \\ b \\ c) z = a \\prec(b \\prec(c \\prec z ))\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node2 \\ b \\ a) =(z \\succ b) \\succ a\n\\\\ reducel (\\succ) z (Node3 \\ c \\ b \\ a) = ((z \\succ c) \\succ b) \\succ a \\end{matrix}</math>\n\nReduction of finger trees:\n\n'''instance''' ''Reduce FingerTree'' '''where'''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) ''Empty''                 ''z = z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Single x'')            ''z = x <math>\\prec</math> z''\n\n''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>) (''Deep pr m sf'' )   ''z = pr'' <math>\\prec</math>' (''m'' <math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> (''sf <math>\\prec</math>''<nowiki/>' ))\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\prec</math>') = ''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>)\n\n(<math>\\prec</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducer'' (''reducer'' (<math>\\prec</math>))\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z Empty''                    = z\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Single x'')               = z <math>\\succ</math> x\n\n''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>) ''z'' (''Deep pr m sf'' )      = ((''z'' <math>\\succ</math>' ''pr'') <math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki> ''m'') <math>\\succ</math>''<nowiki/>'sf''\n\n'''where''' (<math>\\succ</math>' ) = ''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>)\n\n(<math>\\succ</math><nowiki>''</nowiki>) = ''reducel'' (''reducel'' (<math>\\succ</math>))<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Deque operations ===\nFinger trees also make efficient [[Double-ended queue|deques]]. Whether the structure is persistent or not, all operations take \u0398(1) amortized time. The analysis can be compared to Okasaki's implicit deques, the only difference being that the FingerTree type stores Nodes instead of pairs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Application ==\nFinger trees can be used to build other trees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abhiroop.github.io/Finger-Trees/|title=Finger Tree - The ultimate data structure?|last=Sarkar|first=Abhiroop|website=abhiroop.github.io|access-date=2017-10-26}}</ref> For example, a [[priority queue]] can be implemented by labeling the internal nodes by the minimum priority of its children in the tree, or an indexed list/array can be implemented with a labeling of nodes by the count of the leaves in their children. Other applications are random-access sequences, described below, [[ordered sequence]]s, and [[interval tree]]s.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFinger trees can provide amortized O(1) pushing, reversing, popping, O(log n) append and split; and can be adapted to be indexed or ordered sequences. And like all functional data structures, it is inherently [[persistent data structure|persistent]]; that is, older versions of the tree are always preserved.\n\n=== Random-access sequences ===\nFinger trees can efficiently implement random-access sequences. This should support fast positional operations including accessing the ''n''th element and splitting a sequence at a certain position. To do this, we annotate the finger tree with sizes.<ref name=\":0\" /><syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Size = Size{ getSize :: N }\n  deriving (Eq, Ord)\n\ninstance Monoid Size where\n  \u2205 = Size 0\n  Size m \u2295 Size n = Size (m + n)\n</syntaxhighlight>The ''N'' is for natural numbers. The new type is needed because the type is the carrier of different monoids. Another new type is still needed for the elements in the sequence, shown below. \n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"haskell\">\nnewtype Elem a = Elem{ getElem :: a }\nnewtype Seq a = Seq (FingerTree Size (Elem a))\n\ninstance Measured (Elem a) Size where\n  ||Elem|| = Size 1\n</syntaxhighlight>These lines of code show that instance works a base case for measuring the sizes and the elements are of size one. The use of '''newtype'''s doesn't cause a run-time penalty in Haskell because in a library, the ''Size'' and ''Elem'' types would be hidden from the user with wrapper functions.\n\nWith these changes, the length of a sequence can now be computed in constant time.\n\n== First publication ==\nFinger trees were first published in 1977 by [[Leonidas J.

The translators were Hungarian Calvinist priests from [[Transylvania]]. The first complete translation to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] was made in 1688 (called \"[[Biblia de la Bucure\u015fti]]\"). The Old Testament was translated by Moldavian-born [[Nicolae Milescu]] in Constantinople. The translator used as his source a [[Septuagint]] published in Frankfurt in 1597. The manuscript was afterwards revised in Moldova and later brought to Bucharest, where it was again subject to revision by a team of Wallachian scholars (among whom were Radu and \u015eerban Greceanu) with the help of [[\u015eerban Cantacuzino]] and [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncoveanu]].\n\nBefore the publication of the Bucharest Bible, other partial translations were published, such as the Slavic-Romanian Gospel (1551), [[Coresi]]'s Gospel (1561), The Bra\u015fov Psalm Book (1570), Palia from Or\u0103\u015ftie (1582), The New Testament of Alba Iulia (1648) and others. In September 1911, the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]] printed the Iasi Old Testament with the Nitzulescu New Testament, revised by Professor Garboviceanu and checked by Prof Alexics. This was the official BFBS text before Cornilescu was adopted in 1924, but was more literal.

Eastern Han 25-220 CE. Anping, Hebei.jpg|thumb|280px|Powerful landlord in chariot, [[Eastern Han]] 25\u2013220 CE. [[Hebei]], China]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land, or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender]]. The manager of a [[pub]] in the [[United Kingdom]], strictly speaking a [[#Licensed victualler|licensed victualler]], is referred to as the landlord/lady.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405034238/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|archivedate=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases or license agreements <ref>Friedman on Leases (Sixth Edition) by Andrew R. Berman, Chapter 37: Leases, Licenses, and Easements Compared\u2014Parking Rights, Department Store Concessions, Lodgers, Etc.</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalnewsletters.com/sites/lawjournalnewsletters/2008/01/31/using-a-license-agreement-instead-of-a-lease/|title=Using a License Agreement Instead of a Lease|website=LawJournalNewsletters.com}}</ref>, and then, once rented, collecting rent from the tenant and performing repairs as needed.\n\n[[Image:E9438-David-Berry-monument.jpg|thumb|Being a good landlord, [[David Berry (landowner)|David Berry]] (who had owned much of what is now known as [[Berry, New South Wales|Berry - the town was named after him]]) is well remembered by his tenants.]]\n\n===United States===\nIn the [[United States]], [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[state law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door. The most common disputes result from either the landlord's failure to provide services or the tenant's failure to pay rent\u2014the former can also lead to the latter. The withholding of rent is justifiable cause for eviction, as often explained in the lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolander|first=Donald O.|title=The New Webster's Library of Practical Information: Family Legal Guide|year=1990|publisher=Lexicon Publications|isbn=0-7172-4500-4|pages=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 }}</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\") through a commercial landlord's right to the use of \"self-help\" evictions, although self-help is rare and restricted in many states. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realestate.findlaw.com/landlord-tenant-law/illegal-evictions-can-get-you-in-trouble-for-landlord-harassment.html|title=Illegal Evictions Can Get You in Trouble for Landlord Harassment|website=Findlaw}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalnewsletters.com/sites/lawjournalnewsletters/2006/01/04/the-availability-of-self-help-evictions-to-commercial-landlords/|title=The Availability of Self-Help Evictions to Commercial Landlords|website=LawJournalNewsletters.com}}</ref>  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043651/http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Due to lack of alternative options, such renters are often the victims of unscrupulous owners of unsafe and decrepit properties who neglect their responsibility to maintain the property.\n\nThe terms \"Slumlord\", \"slum landlord\", or \"Ghetto landlord\" is used to describe landlords of large numbers of such properties, often holding a virtual local monopoly. Public improvement or major private investment can improve such areas.  In extreme situations government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace or renovate the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death. He became notorious for exploitation of his [[Leasehold estate|tenants]], with the word \"'''Rachmanism'''\" entering the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''. His henchmen included [[Michael X|Michael de Freitas]] (aka Michael X/Abdul Malik), who created a reputation as a black-power leader, and [[Johnny Edgecombe]], who became a promoter of jazz and blues, which helped to keep him in the limelight.<ref name=\"Three\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historytalk.org/Tom+Vague+Pop+History/Chp+1.pdf|title=\u2013 historytalk.org|website=www.historytalk.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003054425/http://www.historytalk.org/Tom%20Vague%20Pop%20History/Chp%201.pdf|archivedate=2016-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==Rental investment and basis==\n;Incentives and disincentives\nThe incentive, certainly if not [[social housing]], is to obtain a good rental yield (annual return on investment) and prospect of property price inflation. The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom the owner and/or manager of a pub (public house) is usually called the \"landlord/landlady\" or \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

[[Hebei]], China]]\nA '''landlord''' is the owner of a [[house]], [[apartment]], [[condominium]], land, or [[real estate]] which is [[Renting|rent]]ed or [[lease]]d to an individual or business, who is called a [[Leasehold estate|tenant]] (also a ''lessee'' or ''renter'').  When a [[juristic person]] is in this position, the term landlord is used. Other terms include '''lessor''' and '''owner'''. The term '''landlady''' may be used for [[female]] owners, and lessor may be used regardless of [[gender]]. The manager of a [[pub]] in the [[United Kingdom]], strictly speaking a [[#Licensed victualler|licensed victualler]], is referred to as the landlord/lady.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a landlord may be traced back to the [[feudalism|feudal]] system of [[manoralism]] ([[seignorialism]]), where a [[landed estate]] is owned by a [[Lord of the Manor]] ([[mesne lord]]s), usually members of the lower nobility which came to form the rank of [[knight]]s in the high medieval period, holding their fief via [[subinfeudation]], but in some cases the land may also be directly subject to a member of higher nobility, as in the [[royal domain]] directly owned by a king, or in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Imperial Village|imperial villages]] directly subject to the emperor.\nThe medieval system ultimately continues the system of [[Roman villa|villas]] and [[latifundium|latifundia]] (peasant-worked broad farmsteads) of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|title=Feudalism|website=faculty.history.wisc.edu|accessdate=14 March 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170405034238/http://faculty.history.wisc.edu/sommerville/123/feudalism.htm|archivedate=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn modern times, landlord describes any individual(s) or entity (e.g. government body or institution) providing housing for persons who cannot afford or do not want to own their own homes. They may be peripatetic, stationed on a secondment away from their home, not want the risk of a mortgage and/or negative equity, may be a group of co-occupiers unwilling to enter into the ties of co-ownership, or may be improving their credit rating or bank balance to obtain a better-terms future mortgage. \n\n==Owner and tenant responsibilities==\nA [[rental agreement]], or ''lease'', is the [[contract]] defining such terms as the price paid, penalties for late payments, the length of the rental or lease, and the amount of notice required before either the homeowner or tenant cancels the agreement.  In general, responsibilities are given as follows: the homeowner is responsible for making repairs and performing property maintenance, and the tenant is responsible for keeping the property clean and safe.\n\nMany owners hire a [[property management]] company to take care of all the details of renting their property out to a tenant. This usually includes advertising the property and showing it to prospective tenants, negotiating and preparing the written leases or license agreements <ref>Friedman on Leases (Sixth Edition) by Andrew R.

State law and, in some places, city law or county law, sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord or landlady can evict his or her tenant before the expiration of the tenancy, though at the end of the lease term the rental relationship can generally be terminated without giving any reason. Some cities, counties, and States have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements such as smoke detectors and a locking door. The most common disputes result from either the landlord's failure to provide services or the tenant's failure to pay rent\u2014the former can also lead to the latter. The withholding of rent is justifiable cause for eviction, as often explained in the lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bolander|first=Donald O.|title=The New Webster's Library of Practical Information: Family Legal Guide|year=1990|publisher=Lexicon Publications|isbn=0-7172-4500-4|pages=44\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]],  [[residential]] homeowner\u2013tenant disputes are primarily governed by [[provincial law]] (not [[federal law]]) regarding [[property]] and [[contracts]].  Provincial  law sets the requirements for [[eviction]] of a tenant.  Generally, there are a limited number of reasons for which a landlord  can evict a tenant. Some provinces have laws establishing the maximum rent a landlord can charge, known as rent control, or [[rent regulation]], and related [[eviction]]. There is also an [[Implied warranty of habitability#Habitability|implied warranty of habitability]], whereby a landlord must maintain safe, decent and habitable housing, meeting minimum safety requirements.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|English land law#Leases and licences|Scots property law}}\n;Residential rental market (tenancies)\nPrivate sector renting is largely governed by many of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act]]s, in particular the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1985]] which sets bare minimum standards in tenants' rights against their landlords.  Another key statute is the [[Housing Act 2004]].  Rents can be freely increased at the end of a usual six-month duration, on proper notice given to the tenant. A Possession Order under the most common type, the [[Assured Shorthold Tenancy]] (AST) is usually obtainable after eight weeks/two months of unpaid rent, and at the court's discretion after serving the tenant with a [[Section 8 notice]] (under the [[Housing Act 1988]] as amended) for a lesser period for all assured tenancies &mdash; and on other grounds which defer to the landlord's ownership of the property.  If the tenancy is an AST then any possession order will not take effect until six months has passed into the initial tenancy.  A tenancy of someone who has been in occupation since before 15 January 1989 usually, if not a shorthold from the outset following their inception from 1980 onwards, may be a \"[[regulated tenancy]]\" with many more rights, especially under the [[Rent Act 1977]] and [[Protection from Eviction Act 1977]], introduced by the [[Third Wilson ministry]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-04-12 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413130952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/11445/138295.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-13 }}</ref>\n\nEach [[house in multiple occupation]], a unit the law does not regard it as a single household having more than three tenants, is subject to enhanced regulations including the [[Housing Act 2004]]. A council-issued Licence to be a landlord of such a unit is always required in some local authorities (in others, limited to the larger statutory examples).\n\n;Residential leasehold\nTenancies above a couple of years are normally called leases and tend to be long; if more than 7 years a new leasehold estate must be registered.<ref>[[LRA 2002]], Sch.3</ref> These are governed by few of the above rules and are in longer examples deliberately more akin to full ownership than tenancies, in general.  They seldom require a sizeable [[ground rent]]. The law has not regulated hefty break/resale charges nor does it prevent the sale of leasehold houses; in the 2010s certain of these proposals have been widely consulted upon and are being drafted.  Broadly, legislation allows such lessees (tenants) to club together to gain the [[Right to Manage]], and the right to buy the landlord's interest (to collectively enfranchise). It allows them individually to extend their leases for a new, smaller sum (\"premium\"), which if the tenants have enfranchised will not normally be demanded/recommended every 15-35 years.  Notice requirements and forms tend to be strict. In smaller examples the tenant, depending on a simple mathematical division of the building, may be able to enfranchise individually. Statute of 1925 implies into nearly all leases (tenancies at low rent and at a premium (fine, initial large sum)) of property that they can be sold (by the lessee, assigned); reducing any restriction to one whereby the landlord may apply standard that is \"reasonable\" vetting, without causing major delay. This is often known as the \"statutory qualified covenant on assignment/alienation\".\n\nIn the overall diminishing domain of [[social housing]], exceptionally, lessees widely acquire over time the [[Right to Buy]] for a fixed discount on the market price of the home.\n\n;Commercial (business) leases and tenancies\nIn commercial property much of the law, especially as to disputes and basic responsibilities, is based on freedom of contract of the [[common law]] including the implied terms of precedent decisions of wide-ranging case law such as the meaning of \"good and substantial repair\". Implied principles include \"non-derogation from grant\" and \"quiet enjoyment\". All businesses which are tenants (lessees) must decide whether to contract in or outside of Part 2 (i.e. II) the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] which gives them \"business security of tenure\". If not, it generally applies by default. This \"security of tenure\" is expressly subject to common reasons and associated mechanisms for a landlord to obtain back the premises.  If a landlord is selling a block and a qualifying tenant occupies more than 50%, the tenant should be given the [[right of first refusal]] at the asking price to buy the block. As in most jurisdictions the law on rigorous adherence to lease terms on unlawful subletting and assignment can be strictly enforced, resulting in financial and premises loss if broken. Failure to repay a rent demand, unlike residential, can result in direct landlord's repossession (\"peaceable re-entry\") through a commercial landlord's right to the use of \"self-help\" evictions, although self-help is rare and restricted in many states. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://realestate.findlaw.com/landlord-tenant-law/illegal-evictions-can-get-you-in-trouble-for-landlord-harassment.html|title=Illegal Evictions Can Get You in Trouble for Landlord Harassment|website=Findlaw}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawjournalnewsletters.com/sites/lawjournalnewsletters/2006/01/04/the-availability-of-self-help-evictions-to-commercial-landlords/|title=The Availability of Self-Help Evictions to Commercial Landlords|website=LawJournalNewsletters.com}}</ref>  The taking of a tenant's goods without a court-issued warrant (flowing from a court order or outstanding tax demand) ([[Distress (law)|distress]]) has been banned.<ref>[http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf ''Bailiffs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043651/http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN04103/SN04103.pdf |date=2018-04-13 }} Lorraine Conway and Jack Dent.

Due to lack of alternative options, such renters are often the victims of unscrupulous owners of unsafe and decrepit properties who neglect their responsibility to maintain the property.\n\nThe terms \"Slumlord\", \"slum landlord\", or \"Ghetto landlord\" is used to describe landlords of large numbers of such properties, often holding a virtual local monopoly. Public improvement or major private investment can improve such areas.  In extreme situations government [[compulsory purchase]] powers in many countries enable [[slum clearance]] to replace or renovate the worst of neighbourhoods.\n\nExamples:\n\n*[[Peter Rachman]] was a [[landlord]] who operated in [[Notting Hill]], [[London]] in the 1950s and until his 1962 death.

The disincentives are the locally varying duties of landlords in repair/maintenance and administration &mdash; and keynote risks (tenant disputes, damage, neglect, loss of rent, insurance inavailability/disputes, economic slump, increased rate of interest on any mortgage, and negative equity or loss of investment).  Net income (yield) and capital growth from [[letting]] (renting out) particularly in leveraged [[buy to let]], is subject to [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]], which is considered objectively intensified for a highly [[Leverage (finance)|leveraged]] investor limited to a small number of similar profile homes, of narrow rental market appeal in areas lacking economic resilience.<ref name=NYT032913>{{cite news|title=Rental Investment May Seem Safer Than It Really Is|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|accessdate=March 30, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 29, 2013|author=Tara Siegel Barnard|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330081922/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/your-money/investing-in-a-rental-home-isnt-as-safe-as-it-may-seem.html|archivedate=March 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\n;Basis\nRental properties can be paid for by the tenant on whatever basis agreed between the landlord and the tenant &mdash; more frequently than weekly or less than yearly is almost unheard of &mdash; and which is always included in the lease agreement (preferably for both sides in writing). It should be one of the factors that a tenant considers before moving in. \n\n;Security for rent and extra fees\n{{See also|Security deposit|Landlords' insurance}}\nA landlord or its agent can decide to collect a security deposit (and/or in some jurisdictions such as parts of the US, a move-in/administration fee). A deterrent if high and a relative attractive if low in many markets for a tenant, it is rarely debated in pre-tenancy term negotiations. In some jurisdictions either or both are banned in the original sense. Instead a landlord's loss of rent/comprehensive damage insurance may be factored into the rent agreed and/or a special type of deposit, a regulated sum of money as a bond (protected security deposit) from the tenant held by a registered third party (such as certain realty agents) may be permissible.  A deposit is normally by law to be offset against arrears (rent deficits) and damage by or failures to clean/repair by the tenant.\n\n==Licensed victualler==\n{{Main article|Pub}}\n\nIn the United Kingdom the owner and/or manager of a pub (public house) is usually called the \"landlord/landlady\" or \"[[publican]]\", the latter properly the appellation of a Roman public contractor or [[Tax farming|tax farmer]].

Each half of the chromosome replicated by one replication fork is called a \"replichore\". (Graphic computer art by Daniel Yuen)]]\n\nA '''circular prokaryote chromosome''' is a chromosome in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], in the form of a molecule of circular DNA. Unlike the [[Linear chromosome|linear DNA]] of most [[eukaryote]]s, typical prokaryote chromosomes are circular.\n\nMost prokaryote chromosomes contain a circular DNA molecule \u2013 there are no free ends to the [[DNA]]. Free ends would otherwise create significant challenges to cells with respect to [[DNA replication]] and stability. Cells that do contain chromosomes with DNA ends, or [[telomere]]s (most eukaryotes), have acquired elaborate mechanisms to overcome these challenges. However, a circular chromosome can provide other challenges for cells. After replication, the two progeny circular chromosomes can sometimes remain interlinked or tangled, and they must be resolved so that each cell inherits one complete copy of the chromosome during [[cell division]].\n\n== Replication ==\nThe circular bacteria chromosome replication is best understood in the well-studied bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Chromosome replication proceeds in three major stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The initiation stage starts with the ordered assembly of \"initiator\" proteins at the origin region of the chromosome, called [[oriC]]. These assembly stages are regulated to ensure that chromosome replication occurs only once in each cell cycle. During the elongation phase of replication, the [[enzyme]]s that were assembled at oriC during initiation proceed along each arm (\"[[replichore]]\") of the chromosome, in opposite directions away from the oriC, replicating the DNA to create two identical copies. This process is known as bidirectional replication. The entire assembly of molecules involved in DNA replication on each arm is called a \"[[replisome]].\" At the forefront of the replisome is a [[DNA helicase]] that unwinds the two strands of DNA, creating a moving \"[[replication fork]]\". The two unwound single strands of DNA serve as templates for [[DNA polymerase]], which moves with the helicase (together with other proteins) to synthesise a complementary copy of each strand. In this way, two identical copies of the original DNA are created. Eventually, the two replication forks moving around the circular chromosome meet in a specific zone of the chromosome, approximately opposite oriC, called the terminus region. The elongation enzymes then disassemble, and the two \"daughter\" chromosomes are resolved before cell division is completed.\n\n== Initiation ==\nThe ''E. coli'' bacterial replication origin, called ''oriC'' consists of [[DNA sequence]]s that are recognised by the [[DnaA]] protein, which is highly conserved amongst different [[bacteria]]l species. DnaA binding to the origin initiates the regulated recruitment of other enzymes and [[protein]]s that will eventually lead to the establishment of two complete replisomes for bidirectional replication.<ref>Jon M.

In his experiment, he [[Radioactive labeling|radioactively labeled]] the chromosome by growing his cultures in a medium containing 3H-[[thymidine]].

This was first demonstrated by specifically labelling replicating bacterial chromosomes with [[radioactive isotope]]s. The regions of DNA undergoing replication during the experiment were then visualized by using [[autoradiograph]]y and examining the developed film microscopically. This allowed the researchers to see where replication was taking place. The first conclusive observations of bidirectional replication was from studies of B. subtilis.<ref>Wake, R.G. 1972.

First, an RNA primer is synthesized by primase, and, like that in leading strand synthesis, DNA Pol III binds to the RNA primer and adds [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s.\n\nWhen the synthesis of an Okazaki fragment has been completed, replication halts and the core subunits of DNA Pol III dissociates from the \u03b2 sliding clamp [B sliding clap is the processivity subunit of DNA Pol III].<ref>Indiani C, O'Donnell M.

It occurs in the terminus region, approximately opposite oriC on the chromosome (Fig 5). The terminus region contains several DNA replication terminator sites, or \"Ter\" sites. A special \"replication terminator\" protein must be bound at the Ter site for it to pause replication. Each Ter site has polarity of action, that is, it will arrest a replication fork approaching the Ter site from one direction, but will allow unimpeded fork movement through the Ter site from the other direction. The arrangement of the Ter sites forms two opposed groups that forces the two forks to meet each other within the region they span. This arrangement is called the \"replication fork trap.\"<ref>Duggin IG, Wake RG, Bell SD, Hill TM. 2008. The replication fork trap and termination of chromosome replication. Mol Microbiol.

The circles are not covalently linked, but cannot be separated because they are interwound and each is covalently closed. The catenated circles require the action of [[topoisomerase]]s to separate the circles [decatanation]. In E.coli, DNA topoisomerase IV plays the major role in the separation of the catenated chromosomes, transiently breaking both DNA strands of one chromosome and allowing the other chromosome to pass through the break.\n\nThere has been some confusion about the role [[DNA gyrase]] plays in decatenation. To define the nomenclature, there are two types of topoisomerases: type I produces transient single-strand breaks in DNA and types II produces transient double-strand breaks. As a result, the type I enzyme removes [[supercoil]]s from DNA one at a time, whereas the type II enzyme removes supercoils two at a time. The topo I of both [[prokaryote]]s and eukaryotes are the type I topoisomerase. The eukaryotic topo II, bacterial gyrase, and bacterial topo IV belong to the type II.\n\nWe often forget that DNA gyrase does in fact have topoisomerase type II activity; thus, with it being a homologue of topoisomerase IV (also having topoisomerase II activity) we expect similarity in the two proteins' functions. DNA gyrase preliminary role is to introduce negative super coils into DNA, thereby relaxing positive supercoils that come into play during DNA replication. Topoisomerase IV also relaxes positive supercoils, therefore, DNA Gyrase and topoisomerase IV play an almost identical role in removing the positive supercoils ahead of a translocating DNA polymerase, allowing DNA replication to continue unhindered by topological strain.<ref>Chris Ullsperger and Nicholas R. Cozzarelli. Contrasting Enzymatic Activities of Topoisomerase IV and DNA Gyrase from Escherichia coli. Volume 271, Number 49, Issue of December 6, 1996, pp. 31549-31555</ref>\n\nConfusion arises when some [[scientific literature]] state that DNA gyrase is the sole enzyme responsible for decatanation. In an experiment conducted by Zechiedrich, Khodursky and Cozzarelli in 1997, it was found that topoisomerase IV is the only important decatenase of DNA replication intermediates in bacteria.<ref>E L Zechiedrich, A B Khodursky, N R Cozzarelli. Topoisomerase IV, not gyrase, decatenates products of site-specific recombination in Escherichia coli. Genes Dev. 1997 Oct 1;11 (19):2580-92 9334322</ref> In this particular experiment, when DNA gyrase alone were inhibited, most of the catenanes were unlinked. However, when Topoisomerase IV alone was inhibited, decatenation was almost completely blocked. The results obtained suggest that Topoisomerase IV is the primary decatenase ''[[in vivo]]'', and although DNA gyrase does play a role in decatenation, its function is not as essential as topoisomerase IV in the decatentation of interlinked chromosomes.\n\n== Acknowledgments ==\nThis is based on an article by Imalda Devaparanam and David Tribe made available under CC by SA licensing conditions from a University course activity at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, 2007.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Catenane]]\n* [[M\u00f6bius strip]]\n* [[Nucleoid]]\n* [[Plasmid]]\n* [[Ribbon theory]]\n* [[Rolling circle replication]]\n* [[Topoisomerase]]\n* [[Theta structure|Theta type replication]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Citizendium|title=Replication of a circular bacterial chromosome}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circular Bacterial Chromosome}}\n[[Category:Chromosomes]]\n[[Category:Bacteriology]]\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Circular DNA Replication.svg|thumb|300px|A circular bacterial chromosome, showing DNA replication proceeding bidirectionally, with two replication forks generated at the \"origin\". Each half of the chromosome replicated by one replication fork is called a \"replichore\". (Graphic computer art by Daniel Yuen)]]\n\nA '''circular prokaryote chromosome''' is a chromosome in [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]], in the form of a molecule of circular DNA. Unlike the linear DNA of most [[eukaryote]]s, typical prokaryote chromosomes are circular.\n\nMost prokaryote chromosomes contain a circular DNA molecule \u2013 there are no free ends to the [[DNA]]. Free ends would otherwise create significant challenges to cells with respect to [[DNA replication]] and stability. Cells that do contain chromosomes with DNA ends, or [[telomere]]s (most eukaryotes), have acquired elaborate mechanisms to overcome these challenges. However, a circular chromosome can provide other challenges for cells. After replication, the two progeny circular chromosomes can sometimes remain interlinked or tangled, and they must be resolved so that each cell inherits one complete copy of the chromosome during [[cell division]].\n\n== Replication ==\nThe circular bacteria chromosome replication is best understood in the well-studied bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''. Chromosome replication proceeds in three major stages: initiation, elongation and termination. The initiation stage starts with the ordered assembly of \"initiator\" proteins at the origin region of the chromosome, called [[oriC]]. These assembly stages are regulated to ensure that chromosome replication occurs only once in each cell cycle. During the elongation phase of replication, the [[enzyme]]s that were assembled at oriC during initiation proceed along each arm (\"[[replichore]]\") of the chromosome, in opposite directions away from the oriC, replicating the DNA to create two identical copies. This process is known as bidirectional replication. The entire assembly of molecules involved in DNA replication on each arm is called a \"[[replisome]].\" At the forefront of the replisome is a [[DNA helicase]] that unwinds the two strands of DNA, creating a moving \"[[replication fork]]\". The two unwound single strands of DNA serve as templates for [[DNA polymerase]], which moves with the helicase (together with other proteins) to synthesise a complementary copy of each strand. In this way, two identical copies of the original DNA are created. Eventually, the two replication forks moving around the circular chromosome meet in a specific zone of the chromosome, approximately opposite oriC, called the terminus region. The elongation enzymes then disassemble, and the two \"daughter\" chromosomes are resolved before cell division is completed.\n\n== Initiation ==\nThe ''E. coli'' bacterial replication origin, called ''oriC'' consists of [[DNA sequence]]s that are recognised by the [[DnaA]] protein, which is highly conserved amongst different [[bacteria]]l species. DnaA binding to the origin initiates the regulated recruitment of other enzymes and [[protein]]s that will eventually lead to the establishment of two complete replisomes for bidirectional replication.<ref>Jon M.

The circles are not covalently linked, but cannot be separated because they are interwound and each is covalently closed. The catenated circles require the action of [[topoisomerase]]s to separate the circles [decatanation]. In E.coli, DNA topoisomerase IV plays the major role in the separation of the catenated chromosomes, transiently breaking both DNA strands of one chromosome and allowing the other chromosome to pass through the break.\n\nThere has been some confusion about the role [[DNA gyrase]] plays in decatenation. To define the nomenclature, there are two types of topoisomerases: type I produces transient single-strand breaks in DNA and types II produces transient double-strand breaks. As a result, the type I enzyme removes [[supercoil]]s from DNA one at a time, whereas the type II enzyme removes supercoils two at a time. The topo I of both [[prokaryote]]s and eukaryotes are the type I topoisomerase. The eukaryotic topo II, bacterial gyrase, and bacterial topo IV belong to the type II.\n\nWe often forget that DNA gyrase does in fact have topoisomerase type II activity; thus, with it being a homologue of topoisomerase IV (also having topoisomerase II activity) we expect similarity in the two proteins' functions. DNA gyrase preliminary role is to introduce negative super coils into DNA, thereby relaxing positive supercoils that come into play during DNA replication. Topoisomerase IV also relaxes positive supercoils, therefore, DNA Gyrase and topoisomerase IV play an almost identical role in removing the positive supercoils ahead of a translocating DNA polymerase, allowing DNA replication to continue unhindered by topological strain.<ref>Chris Ullsperger and Nicholas R. Cozzarelli. Contrasting Enzymatic Activities of Topoisomerase IV and DNA Gyrase from Escherichia coli. Volume 271, Number 49, Issue of December 6, 1996, pp. 31549-31555</ref>\n\nConfusion arises when some [[scientific literature]] state that DNA gyrase is the sole enzyme responsible for decatanation. In an experiment conducted by Zechiedrich, Khodursky and Cozzarelli in 1997, it was found that topoisomerase IV is the only important decatenase of DNA replication intermediates in bacteria.<ref>E L Zechiedrich, A B Khodursky, N R Cozzarelli. Topoisomerase IV, not gyrase, decatenates products of site-specific recombination in Escherichia coli. Genes Dev. 1997 Oct 1;11 (19):2580-92 9334322</ref> In this particular experiment, when DNA gyrase alone were inhibited, most of the catenanes were unlinked. However, when Topoisomerase IV alone was inhibited, decatenation was almost completely blocked. The results obtained suggest that Topoisomerase IV is the primary decatenase ''[[in vivo]]'', and although DNA gyrase does play a role in decatenation, its function is not as essential as topoisomerase IV in the decatentation of interlinked chromosomes.\n\n== Acknowledgments ==\nThis is based on an article by Imalda Devaparanam and David Tribe made available under CC by SA licensing conditions from a University course activity at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Melbourne, 2007.\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Catenane]]\n* [[M\u00f6bius strip]]\n* [[Nucleoid]]\n* [[Plasmid]]\n* [[Ribbon theory]]\n* [[Rolling circle replication]]\n* [[Topoisomerase]]\n* [[Theta structure|Theta type replication]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Citizendium|title=Replication of a circular bacterial chromosome}}\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Circular Bacterial Chromosome}}\n[[Category:Chromosomes]]\n[[Category:Bacteriology]]\n[[Category:Cell anatomy]]\n", "name_user": "Iztwoz", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:link; caption change", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_prokaryote_chromosome"}

Construction began on the high-speed line from [[Seoul]] to [[Busan]] in 1992. KTX services were launched on April 1, 2004.\n\nFrom [[Seoul Station]] the KTX lines radiate with stops at [[Seoul Station]], [[Yongsan Station]] towards [[Busan]] and [[Gwangju]], and from [[Gangnam District]]'s   [[Suseo Station]] with intermediate stations in [[New Dongtan City]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 1]]'s [[Jije Station]] in [[Pyeongtaek]]. A new line from [[Wonju]] to [[Gangneung]] was completed in December 2017 to serve the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]].\n\nTop speed for trains in regular service is currently {{Convert|305|km/h|mph|abbr=on|0}}, though the infrastructure is designed for {{Convert|350|km/h|mph|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}.

significant portion of the journey on the high-speed line, like Seoul\u2013Busan: KTX took both the majority of the market and the bulk of rail passengers in the first year already, increasing the total share of rail from around two-fifths to a market dominating two-thirds by 2008.  On long-distance relations with significant distances along conventional lines and resulting more modest travel time gains, that is along the Honam Line, the KTX and overall rail market share gain decreases with distance.

Construction began on the high-speed line from [[Seoul]] to [[Busan]] in 1992. KTX services were launched on April 1, 2004.\n\nFrom [[Seoul Station]] the KTX lines radiate with stops at [[Seoul Station]], [[Yongsan Station]] towards [[Busan]] and [[Gwangju]], and from [[Gangnam District]]'s   [[Suseo Station]] with intermediate stations in [[New Dongtan City]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 1]]'s [[Jije Station]] in [[Pyeongtaek]]. A new line from [[Wonju]] to [[Gangneung]] was completed in December 2017 to serve the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]].\n\nTop speed for trains in regular service is currently {{Convert|305|km/h|mph|abbr=on|0}}, though the infrastructure is designed for {{Convert|350|km/h|mph|sigfig=3|abbr=on}}. The initial rolling stock was based on [[Alstom]]'s [[SNCF TGV R\u00e9seau|TGV R\u00e9seau]], and was partly built in Korea. The domestically developed [[HSR-350x]], which achieved {{Convert|352.4|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} in tests, resulted in a second type of high-speed trains now operated by Korail, the [[KTX Sancheon]]. The next generation KTX train, [[HEMU-430X]], achieved 421.4&nbsp;km/h in 2013, making South Korea the world's fourth country after  [[Japan]], [[France]] and [[China]] to develop a [[high-speed train]] running on conventional rail above 420&nbsp;km/h.\n\n==History==\n===Origins of the project===\nThe Seoul-Busan axis is Korea's main traffic corridor. In 1982, it represented 65.8% of South Korea's population, a number that grew to 73.3% by 1995, along with 70% of freight traffic and 66% of passenger traffic. With both the [[Gyeongbu Expressway]] and [[Korail]]'s [[Gyeongbu Line]] congested as of the late 1970s, the government saw the pressing need for another form of transportation.{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=11}}\n\nThe first proposals for a second Seoul-Busan railway line originated from a study prepared between 1972 and 1974 by experts from France's [[SNCF]] and the Japan Railway Technical Service on a request from the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]].{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|pp=13\u201314}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jarts.or.jp/project/project_i.html |title=Major Projects Overseas - I-K |publisher=[http://www.jarts.or.jp/outline/index_en.html Japan Railway Technical Service] |accessdate=2010-08-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722121425/http://www.jarts.or.jp/project/project_i.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 }}</ref>  A more detailed 1978-1981 study by [[KAIST]], focusing on the needs of freight transport, also came to the conclusion that separating long-distance passenger traffic on a high-speed passenger railway would be advisable, and it was adopted in the following Korean [[Five-year plans of South Korea|Five Year Plan]].{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=14}}\n\nDuring the following years, several feasibility studies were prepared for a high-speed line with a Seoul\u2013Busan travel time of 1 hour 30 minutes, which gave positive results.{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=14}}  In 1989, following the go-ahead for the project, the institutions to manage its preparation were established: the Gyeongbu High Speed Electric Railway & New International Airport Committee, and the High Speed Electric Railway Planning Department (later renamed HSR Project Planning Board).{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|pp=14\u201315}}  In 1990, the planned Seoul\u2013Busan travel time was 1 hour 51 minutes, the project was to be completed by August 1998,{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=42}} and costs were estimated at 5.85 trillion [[South Korean won]]{{sfn|Cho|Chung|2008|p=42}} in 1988 prices, 4.6 trillion of which were to be spent on infrastructure, the remainder on rolling stock.{{sfn|D.

significant portion of the journey on the high-speed line, like Seoul\u2013Busan: KTX took both the majority of the market and the bulk of rail passengers in the first year already, increasing the total share of rail from around two-fifths to a market dominating two-thirds by 2008.  On long-distance relations with significant distances along conventional lines and resulting more modest travel time gains, that is along the Honam Line, the KTX and overall rail market share gain decreases with distance.
