Driven by guilt from her actions during her combat days, she decides to dedicate the rest of her life to serving the son of her late commander as a maid. The manga was written by [[Bunj\u016br\u014d Nakayama]] and illustrated by [[Bow Ditama]]. Originally serialized in ''[[Comic Gum]]'' between 1998 and 2004, it has been compiled into eight [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes published by [[Wani Books]]. Studios [[Gainax]] and [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] made an anime adaptation of ''Mahoromatic'' between 2001 and 2009.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Misato Residence===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Mahoro Andou'''|\u5b89\u85e4 \u307e\u307b\u308d|And\u014d Mahoro}} (CODE: V1046-R MAHORO)\n* {{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Bridget Hoffman]]}}\n:Mahoro is an android created by VESPER to fight an alien invasion by ''Saint'' during the 1980s. She is fast and immensely powerful, and is considered to be a formidable opponent by her enemies.\n\n:Being an android, she has a limited life span. At the beginning of the story, she has just 398 days to live and VESPER gives her the freedom to do anything she wants. She chooses to become a maid for Suguru Misato: his father was her superior officer who was also killed (as collateral damage) when she killed an alien who had taken him hostage.\n\n:Mahoro has a very sunny disposition and is friendly to just about everyone\u2014she becomes a welcome regular at the market and becomes famous at Suguru's school when it is made known that she is working for him. She also quickly becomes an excellent cook, able to emulate and recreate dishes from the best restaurants. She is also quite devoted to Suguru, with feelings for him reminiscent of both a doting mother and a shy girlfriend.\n\n: However, she is very hostile towards anything perverted. A good portion of the story's humour comes from Mahoro chasing after Suguru's secret stash of pornographic magazines which, given her training, she is easily able to find. She is well known for this attitude from her catch phrase: ''\"Ecchi na no wa ikenai to omoimasu\"'' (\"I think that dirty thoughts are bad\"). Mahoro and Shikijo-sensei's dislike of one another stems from the fact that Shikijo is constantly trying to engage in an illicit relationship with Suguru. As such, Mahoro is very protective of Suguru when it comes to Shikijo's advances towards him.\n\n:Mahoro is very concerned about appearances, refusing to wear normal clothes given her position as a maid. She is also obsessed with her small breasts, and some stories actually deal with her rivalry with Shikijo (who has very large breasts), as well as her techniques and requests to VESPER for larger breasts.\n\n:Mahoro retains access to many of her weapons and gadgets from her VESPER days, and is able to pull out her gun at any time. She also has access to the \"silpheed\", which when worn on her back allows her to fly, as well as her support mech, Slash. She is able to call both the Silpheed and Slash at a moment's notice from the badge she wears on her maid uniform. In addition, she also has access to a fully equipped and armed BMW sports convertible and MV Agusta motorcycle.\n\n:Mahoro was created using Saint alien technology, so she has a true soul and a pure heart. Later in the series it is revealed that Mahoro is directly connected to the memories of Matthew, who occasionally advises her\n\n:She had no surname until the name Andou (short for android) was created by Suguru.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Suguru Misato'''|\u7f8e\u91cc \u512a|Misato Suguru}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Fujiko Takimoto]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (English) [[Wendee Lee]] (as a child)}}\n:Suguru Misato is a junior high school student living in Tokyo. He lost both his parents earlier\u2014his mother (who was half Saint), and years later, his father. While he believed his father was killed in an accident during a business trip, he was actually a commander (and Mahoro's commanding officer) in VESPER and was killed in action during the alien war. Although relatives offered to take him in, he refused and lived alone prior to Mahoro's arrival.\n\n:He is smart and has an IQ of 130. He makes a favorable impression on members of the opposite sex. Suguru had a whole stash of dirty magazines which were all thrown away when Mahoro first arrived. Although he continues to try to smuggle them in and hide them, Mahoro will often find them\u2014leading to comical confrontations between the two. Suguru uses a whole range of creative tactics to conceal his magazines, and is capable of running away very fast when being chased.\n\n:Suguru hired a maid because of the filthy state of his house. He was expecting an older woman, and Mahoro's arrival completely surprised him. At the end of the series Mahoro and Suguru have fallen in love.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Minawa Andou'''|\u5b89\u85e4 \u307f\u306a\u308f|And\u014d Minawa}} (CODE: 370) \n* {{Voiced by|[[Ai Shimizu]]|[[Lara Jill Miller]] (Something More Beautiful), [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] (I'm Home)}}\n:Minawa is first introduced in ''Mahoromatic ~Something More Beautiful~''. Clumsy and anemic, she ends up living with Mahoro and Suguru and going to school under the pretext of being Mahoro's younger sister. She has a habit of apologizing for everything she does, even when she does nothing wrong. She claims to be a runaway member of The Management, but is later revealed to have been sent to gather information on VESPER's battle android Mahoro after being promised a heart in return. However, Mahoro convinces her that the fact that she can cry means she already has a heart. Suguru's friend Hamaguchi develops a crush on her, and, despite her shortcomings, it is later insinuated that they form a relationship. It was later revealed that Minawa is not an android but a cyborg, and her body is in horrible shape due to all the experiments performed on her. Near the end of the series, she leaves earth so she can get treatment at Saint's home world. At the end of the anime, it is suggested she was completely healed and is with Hamaguchi.\n\n:Like Mahoro, Minawa had no surname until one was created by Suguru, and it better enabled her pretend to be Mahoro's little sister.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Slash'''|\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Surasshu}} (CODE: V1046 R9-SLASH ZERO)\n* {{Voiced by|[[Keiichi Noda]]|[[Lex Lang]]}}\n:Slash is known as a \"support mech\" and assists Mahoro during combat. He has the form of a panther and can be summoned at any time by Mahoro. Although he can speak, his mouth never moves except during times when he expresses emotions. Although used for combat in the past, he often now acts as a guard dog around the Misato residence and a friend to the Misato's dog\u2014a role he was not thrilled to take in the beginning.\n\n:He is friendly but tough and will lend a helping paw when asked. Although Mahoro is Slash's master, he will now take commands from Suguru: since Suguru is Mahoro's employer, he is also her master and thus Slash's master as well.\n\n:Near the end of the anime series, he was used to wipe out Management and was last seen standing at the side of the fallen Vesper leader.\n\n:However, (in the manga) he firmly stands by Mahoro's side, as she uses her final powers to destroy the asteroid to save mankind.\n\n===Junior High School===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Saori Shikijo'''|\u5f0f\u6761 \u6c99\u7e54|Shikij\u014d Saori}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Yumi Takada]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:Saori Shikijo, or Shikijo-sensei, is Suguru's perverted Junior High School teacher and is extremely attracted to him. She has an extreme [[Shotacon|shota complex]], or an attraction to young boys. Many of the jokes stem from her attempts to openly physically seduce Suguru, and the ways in which her attempts are foiled by Mahoro.\n\n:She is a beautiful and surprisingly strong woman; she also happens to be a heavy drinker and as a result is often broke and unable to afford food. Soon after Mahoro arrives at the Misato household, Shikijo starts inviting herself for dinner on a daily basis despite Mahoro's protests.\n\n:Shikijo and Mahoro often compete with each other, usually with Mahoro emerging victorious except when it comes to insults. She has much larger breasts than Mahoro, or any other character in the series, which she flaunts when comparing herself to Mahoro or in taunting her. Her large breasts are also a focus of her many attempts to seduce Suguru.\n\nIn the manga, it is shown, after the time lapse, that she has yet to age, most likely due to her mentioned strict beauty regiment, and has also become the principal of the junior high school, which has done nothing to dampen her love for young boys.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Miyuki Sakura'''|\u4f50\u5009 \u6df1\u96ea|Sakura Miyuki}}\n*{{Voiced by|Yumi Kikuchi|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:The blue haired member of the \"Triomatic,\" Miyuki, whose family owns the local bath house, is very tomboyish by contrast with the other two, but is just as loyal. She and her family have known Suguru since childhood; her father thinks of him as the son he never had. She doesn't admit it openly, but she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the forehead after he had come to her rescue from a group of bullies; a conflict which she had started.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, Miyuki is shown to have inherited, and still manage, the bath house, alongside her family. She is also shown to be married to Suguru's friend and former classmate, Kiyomi Kawahara, with whom she had a child. Despite being separated for so long, Miyuki still cares very deeply for Suguru, and is dismayed that he has yet to be happy or live his own life after Mahoro ceased to function.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rin Todoriki'''|\u7b49\u3005\u529b \u51db|T\u014dd\u014driki Rin}}\n* {{Voiced by|Manabi Mizuno|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]}}\n:Rin is the brown-haired and tallest member of the \"Triomatic.\" She is the most ladylike of the three, but is also a skilled martial artist and very loyal. Like Miyuki, she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the cheek during a summer class project involving insects.\n\n:Rin has also the most physically developed breasts of the Triomatic, which at times causes Miyuki and Chizuko consternation. For the most part Rin seems almost embarrassed when the other two complain about her breasts, but as the series goes on she becomes more and more comfortable with her \"advantage\", similar to their teacher, Shikijo-sensei.\n\n:Rin's family is wealthy (coming from a long military line), and lives in a palatial estate filled with numerous pieces of art.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Rin has now become a teacher at the same junior high school she and her friends had attended when they were younger; similar to when they were younger, she is still the most developed.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chizuko Oe'''|\u5927\u6c5f \u5343\u9db4\u5b50|\u014ce Chizuko}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Asami Sanada]]|[[Melissa Fahn]] (Original series, Something More Beautiful (episodes 5-11) and I'm Home), [[Rebecca Forstadt]] (Something More Beautiful (episodes 1-4 and 12-14))}}\n:Chizuko is a cheerful and bright, short blonde-haired girl, and is the most innocent of the \"Triomatic\". For the most part she treats Suguru as a friend, almost like a brother, and is very loyal. Some of her comments suggest that she loves him as more than a friend, but that she has put them aside, feeling that her love is unrequited, and chooses to simply remain by Suguru\u2019s side anyway. This notion is made somewhat evident when she states that Suguru won\u2019t choose anyone among the \u201cTriomatic\u201d, because he values their friendship more than love.\n\n:Chizuko enjoys food a great deal and has an extremely adept sense of taste, being able to identify the exact restaurant that a dish has come from and the exact origins of ingredients. Chizuko will often scream with absolute delight when she tastes Mahoro's cooking. While some initially mistake it as a scream of fear or horror, her friends know that it is a sign of culinary approval.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Chizuko went for her dream and became a popular author, most likely relating to food and taste.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Toshiya Hamaguchi'''|\u6d5c\u53e3 \u4fca\u4e5f|Hamaguchi Toshiya}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Hideki Ogihara]]|[[Dave Wittenberg]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Erik Scott Kimerer]] (I'm Home)}}\n:One of Suguru's male friends who shares his interest in dirty magazines. He has a crush on Minawa, which causes him much trouble because she doesn't understand his attempts to express his interest in her.\n\nAt the end of the anime, it is suggested that once Minawa is completely healed, Hamaguchi enters into a relationship with Minawa.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Kiyomi Kawahara'''|\u5ddd\u539f \u6e05\u5df3|Kawahara Kiyomi}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Atsushi Kisaichi]]|[[Kirk Thornton]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Keith Silverstein]] (I'm Home)}}\n:One of Suguru's male friends who also enjoys looking at dirty magazines. He is a [[kendo]] student, and is usually with Suguru's other friend Toshiya.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, Kiyomi is shown to be in a relationship with Suguru's friend and former classmate, Miyuki Sakura, and works at the bath house.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshimi Tanaka'''|\u7530\u4e2d \u4f73\u7f8e|Tanaka Yoshimi}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]|[[Lia Sargent]]}}\n\n===Vesper===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Minato Hokaze'''|\u5e06\u98a8\u3000\u307f\u306a\u3068|Hokaze Minato}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Shinji Kawada]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n\nA friend of Mahoro and her primary care giver, Minato is the scientist primarily responsible for the maintenance of Mahoro; he is also constantly asked by Mahoro to give her a bigger bust.\n\n===Saint===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Tou Ryuga'''|\u6d41\u6cb3\u3000\u6fe4|Ryuga Tou}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|[[Steven Blum]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Keith Silverstein]] (I'm Home)}}\n\nIs a combat android seen in the first series as a science teacher. His task was to investigate the reason Mahoro was living as a maid. He also wanted to finish the battle with her to see who is the strongest android/warrior, during the final battle he discovers the reason she is living as a maid for Suguru and who the true warrior is. In the second series, he decides to live as a human and continues to teach at Suguru's school much to the irritation to Slash.\n\nIn the end of the anime, he visit the members of the Saint for the last time as they depart to another galaxy.\n\nIn the manga version, he marries one of his students whom he saved earlier, and becomes a father of a reborn Mahoro.\n\n===Management===\nIntroduced in ''Something More Beautiful'', Management is a top secret organization that had shaped the world from the shadows throughout its history. They are dedicated to destroying not only Saint, to preserve the order they established from alien influence, but Vesper as well, for having sympathy for Saint.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Feldrance'''|\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9|Feldlance}} (CODE: 227)\n* {{Voiced by|Misato Sakamoto|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\nA cold-hearted android in the form of a youth who was created by and works under the Management's robotics scientist Professor Mephlis during his scheme to take Mahoro for himself. However, Feldrance was actually working for the higher-ups to collect the data that Mephlis gathered on Mahoro. When Mephlis's plans failed, Feldrance made his move and killed the scientist before taking the data as his creator's lab explodes; he felt no remorse for betraying his creator, coldly pointing out that it was Mephlis, after all, who made Feldrance the way he is.\n\nIn the anime, he soon met his untimely end along with the death of Mahoro.\n\nIn the manga version, he chops Suguru's hands while capturing Mahoro but soon stopped by Slash and Ryuuga. He also witnessed the death of Mahoro to save Mankind. In the epilogue, he was the one of the last defenses of The Management in Mars. he encounters Suguru who kills him. With his last breath, he asks whether the quest of vengeance gave him satisfaction.\n\n==Endings==\n\n===Anime's ending===\nThe finale is set on a Saint-Earth colony world, 20 years after Mahoro's \"death\" and the mutual defeat of Vesper and Management. Suguru left Japan, deciding never to return, and is now a renegade half-cyborg hunter of the last \"Management holdouts.\" He has only memories of Earth, and a sole companion who later turns out to be an android and tries to kill him for the bounty on his head.\n\nAs Suguru is in critical condition, Mahoro reappears alive, asking to take him home.\n\n===Manga's ending===\nThe ending is set on Earth, 20 years after Mahoro's death and the defeat of Management. Suguru has been working as a commander within Vesper, and has just returned to Earth from the final defeat of Management's last vestiges.\n\nUnbeknownst to Suguru, Mahoro was reborn as a baby shortly after her death as an android. She has grown up, and remembers Suguru.

Driven by guilt from her actions during her combat days, she decides to dedicate the rest of her life to serving the son of her late commander as a maid. The manga was written by [[Bunj\u016br\u014d Nakayama]] and illustrated by [[Bow Ditama]]. Originally serialized in ''[[Comic Gum]]'' between 1998 and 2004, it has been compiled into eight [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes published by [[Wani Books]]. Studios [[Gainax]] and [[Shaft (company)|Shaft]] made an anime adaptation of ''Mahoromatic'' between 2001 and 2009.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Misato Residence===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Mahoro Andou'''|\u5b89\u85e4 \u307e\u307b\u308d|And\u014d Mahoro}} (CODE: V1046-R MAHORO)\n* {{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Bridget Hoffman]]}}\n:Mahoro is an android created by VESPER to fight an alien invasion by ''Saint'' during the 1980s. She is fast and immensely powerful, and is considered to be a formidable opponent by her enemies.\n\n:Being an android, she has a limited life span. At the beginning of the story, she has just 398 days to live and VESPER gives her the freedom to do anything she wants. She chooses to become a maid for Suguru Misato: his father was her superior officer who was also killed (as collateral damage) when she killed an alien who had taken him hostage.\n\n:Mahoro has a very sunny disposition and is friendly to just about everyone\u2014she becomes a welcome regular at the market and becomes famous at Suguru's school when it is made known that she is working for him. She also quickly becomes an excellent cook, able to emulate and recreate dishes from the best restaurants. She is also quite devoted to Suguru, with feelings for him reminiscent of both a doting mother and a shy girlfriend.\n\n: However, she is very hostile towards anything perverted. A good portion of the story's humour comes from Mahoro chasing after Suguru's secret stash of pornographic magazines which, given her training, she is easily able to find. She is well known for this attitude from her catch phrase: ''\"Ecchi na no wa ikenai to omoimasu\"'' (\"I think that dirty thoughts are bad\"). Mahoro and Shikijo-sensei's dislike of one another stems from the fact that Shikijo is constantly trying to engage in an illicit relationship with Suguru. As such, Mahoro is very protective of Suguru when it comes to Shikijo's advances towards him.\n\n:Mahoro is very concerned about appearances, refusing to wear normal clothes given her position as a maid. She is also obsessed with her small breasts, and some stories actually deal with her rivalry with Shikijo (who has very large breasts), as well as her techniques and requests to VESPER for larger breasts.\n\n:Mahoro retains access to many of her weapons and gadgets from her VESPER days, and is able to pull out her gun at any time. She also has access to the \"silpheed\", which when worn on her back allows her to fly, as well as her support mech, Slash. She is able to call both the Silpheed and Slash at a moment's notice from the badge she wears on her maid uniform. In addition, she also has access to a fully equipped and armed BMW sports convertible and MV Agusta motorcycle.\n\n:Mahoro was created using Saint alien technology, so she has a true soul and a pure heart. Later in the series it is revealed that Mahoro is directly connected to the memories of Matthew, who occasionally advises her\n\n:She had no surname until the name Andou (short for android) was created by Suguru.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Suguru Misato'''|\u7f8e\u91cc \u512a|Misato Suguru}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Fujiko Takimoto]]|[[Derek Stephen Prince]] (English) [[Wendee Lee]] (as a child)}}\n:Suguru Misato is a junior high school student living in Tokyo. He lost both his parents earlier\u2014his mother (who was half Saint), and years later, his father. While he believed his father was killed in an accident during a business trip, he was actually a commander (and Mahoro's commanding officer) in VESPER and was killed in action during the alien war. Although relatives offered to take him in, he refused and lived alone prior to Mahoro's arrival.\n\n:He is smart and has an IQ of 130. He makes a favorable impression on members of the opposite sex. Suguru had a whole stash of dirty magazines which were all thrown away when Mahoro first arrived. Although he continues to try to smuggle them in and hide them, Mahoro will often find them\u2014leading to comical confrontations between the two. Suguru uses a whole range of creative tactics to conceal his magazines, and is capable of running away very fast when being chased.\n\n:Suguru hired a maid because of the filthy state of his house. He was expecting an older woman, and Mahoro's arrival completely surprised him. At the end of the series Mahoro and Suguru have fallen in love.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Minawa Andou'''|\u5b89\u85e4 \u307f\u306a\u308f|And\u014d Minawa}} (CODE: 370) \n* {{Voiced by|[[Ai Shimizu]]|[[Lara Jill Miller]] (Something More Beautiful), [[Christine Marie Cabanos]] (I'm Home)}}\n:Minawa is first introduced in ''Mahoromatic ~Something More Beautiful~''. Clumsy and anemic, she ends up living with Mahoro and Suguru and going to school under the pretext of being Mahoro's younger sister. She has a habit of apologizing for everything she does, even when she does nothing wrong. She claims to be a runaway member of The Management, but is later revealed to have been sent to gather information on VESPER's battle android Mahoro after being promised a heart in return. However, Mahoro convinces her that the fact that she can cry means she already has a heart. Suguru's friend Hamaguchi develops a crush on her, and, despite her shortcomings, it is later insinuated that they form a relationship. It was later revealed that Minawa is not an android but a cyborg, and her body is in horrible shape due to all the experiments performed on her. Near the end of the series, she leaves earth so she can get treatment at Saint's home world. At the end of the anime, it is suggested she was completely healed and is with Hamaguchi.\n\n:Like Mahoro, Minawa had no surname until one was created by Suguru, and it better enabled her pretend to be Mahoro's little sister.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Slash'''|\u30b9\u30e9\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5|Surasshu}} (CODE: V1046 R9-SLASH ZERO)\n* {{Voiced by|[[Keiichi Noda]]|[[Lex Lang]]}}\n:Slash is known as a \"support mech\" and assists Mahoro during combat. He has the form of a panther and can be summoned at any time by Mahoro. Although he can speak, his mouth never moves except during times when he expresses emotions. Although used for combat in the past, he often now acts as a guard dog around the Misato residence and a friend to the Misato's dog\u2014a role he was not thrilled to take in the beginning.\n\n:He is friendly but tough and will lend a helping paw when asked. Although Mahoro is Slash's master, he will now take commands from Suguru: since Suguru is Mahoro's employer, he is also her master and thus Slash's master as well.\n\n:Near the end of the anime series, he was used to wipe out Management and was last seen standing at the side of the fallen Vesper leader.\n\n:However, (in the manga) he firmly stands by Mahoro's side, as she uses her final powers to destroy the asteroid to save mankind.\n\n===Junior High School===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Saori Shikijo'''|\u5f0f\u6761 \u6c99\u7e54|Shikij\u014d Saori}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Yumi Takada]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:Saori Shikijo, or Shikijo-sensei, is Suguru's perverted Junior High School teacher and is extremely attracted to him. She has an extreme [[Shotacon|shota complex]], or an attraction to young boys. Many of the jokes stem from her attempts to openly physically seduce Suguru, and the ways in which her attempts are foiled by Mahoro.\n\n:She is a beautiful and surprisingly strong woman; she also happens to be a heavy drinker and as a result is often broke and unable to afford food. Soon after Mahoro arrives at the Misato household, Shikijo starts inviting herself for dinner on a daily basis despite Mahoro's protests.\n\n:Shikijo and Mahoro often compete with each other, usually with Mahoro emerging victorious except when it comes to insults. She has much larger breasts than Mahoro, or any other character in the series, which she flaunts when comparing herself to Mahoro or in taunting her. Her large breasts are also a focus of her many attempts to seduce Suguru.\n\nIn the manga, it is shown, after the time lapse, that she has yet to age, most likely due to her mentioned strict beauty regiment, and has also become the principal of the junior high school, which has done nothing to dampen her love for young boys.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Miyuki Sakura'''|\u4f50\u5009 \u6df1\u96ea|Sakura Miyuki}}\n*{{Voiced by|Yumi Kikuchi|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:The blue haired member of the \"Triomatic,\" Miyuki, whose family owns the local bath house, is very tomboyish by contrast with the other two, but is just as loyal. She and her family have known Suguru since childhood; her father thinks of him as the son he never had. She doesn't admit it openly, but she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the forehead after he had come to her rescue from a group of bullies; a conflict which she had started.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, Miyuki is shown to have inherited, and still manage, the bath house, alongside her family. She is also shown to be married to Suguru\u2019s friend and former classmate, Kiyomi Kawahara, with whom she had a child. Despite being separated for so long, Miyuki still cares very deeply for Suguru, and is dismayed that he has yet to be happy or live his own life after Mahoro ceased to function.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Rin Todoriki'''|\u7b49\u3005\u529b \u51db|T\u014dd\u014driki Rin}}\n* {{Voiced by|Manabi Mizuno|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn]]}}\n:Rin is the brown-haired and tallest member of the \"Triomatic.\" She is the most ladylike of the three, but is also a skilled martial artist and very loyal. Like Miyuki, she is in love with Suguru, mentioning that her first kiss with Suguru was on the cheek during a summer class project involving insects.\n\n:Rin has also the most physically developed breasts of the Triomatic, which at times causes Miyuki and Chizuko consternation. For the most part Rin seems almost embarrassed when the other two complain about her breasts, but as the series goes on she becomes more and more comfortable with her \"advantage\", similar to their teacher, Shikijo-sensei.\n\n:Rin's family is wealthy (coming from a long military line), and lives in a palatial estate filled with numerous pieces of art.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Rin has now become a teacher at the same junior high school she and her friends had attended when they were younger; similar to when they were younger, she is still the most developed.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Chizuko Oe'''|\u5927\u6c5f \u5343\u9db4\u5b50|\u014ce Chizuko}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Asami Sanada]]|[[Melissa Fahn]] (Original series, Something More Beautiful (episodes 5-11) and I'm Home), [[Rebecca Forstadt]] (Something More Beautiful (episodes 1-4 and 12-14))}}\n:Chizuko is a cheerful and bright, short blonde-haired girl, and is the most innocent of the \"Triomatic\". For the most part she treats Suguru as a friend, almost like a brother, and is very loyal. Some of her comments suggest that she loves him as more than a friend, but that she has put them aside, feeling that her love is unrequited, and chooses to simply remain by Suguru\u2019s side anyway. This notion is made somewhat evident when she states that Suguru won\u2019t choose anyone among the \u201cTriomatic\u201d, because he values their friendship more than love.\n\n:Chizuko enjoys food a great deal and has an extremely adept sense of taste, being able to identify the exact restaurant that a dish has come from and the exact origins of ingredients. Chizuko will often scream with absolute delight when she tastes Mahoro's cooking. While some initially mistake it as a scream of fear or horror, her friends know that it is a sign of culinary approval.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, it is shown that Chizuko went for her dream and became a popular author, most likely relating to food and taste.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Toshiya Hamaguchi'''|\u6d5c\u53e3 \u4fca\u4e5f|Hamaguchi Toshiya}}\n*{{Voiced by|[[Hideki Ogihara]]|[[Dave Wittenberg]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Erik Scott Kimerer]] (I'm Home)}}\n:One of Suguru's male friends who shares his interest in dirty magazines. He has a crush on Minawa, which causes him much trouble because she doesn't understand his attempts to express his interest in her.\n\nAt the end of the anime, it is suggested that once Minawa is completely healed, Hamaguchi enters into a relationship with Minawa.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Kiyomi Kawahara'''|\u5ddd\u539f \u6e05\u5df3|Kawahara Kiyomi}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Atsushi Kisaichi]]|[[Kirk Thornton]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Keith Silverstein]] (I'm Home)}}\n:One of Suguru's male friends who also enjoys looking at dirty magazines. He is a [[kendo]] student, and is usually with Suguru's other friend Toshiya.\n\nIn the manga, after the time lapse, Kiyomi is shown to be in a relationship with Suguru\u2019s friend and former classmate, Miyuki Sakura, and works at the bath house.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Yoshimi Tanaka'''|\u7530\u4e2d \u4f73\u7f8e|Tanaka Yoshimi}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Tomoko Kaneda]]|[[Lia Sargent]]}}\n\n===Vesper===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Minato Hokaze'''|\u5e06\u98a8\u3000\u307f\u306a\u3068|Hokaze Minato}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Shinji Kawada]]|[[Kirk Thornton]]}}\n\nA friend of Mahoro and her primary care giver, Minato is the scientist primarily responsible for the maintenance of Mahoro; he is also constantly asked by Mahoro to give her a bigger bust.\n\n===Saint===\n\n{{nihongo|'''Tou Ryuga'''|\u6d41\u6cb3\u3000\u6fe4|Ryuga Tou}}\n* {{Voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|[[Steven Blum]] (Original Series and Something More Beautiful), [[Keith Silverstein]] (I'm Home)}}\n\nIs a combat android seen in the first series as a science teacher. His task was to investigate the reason Mahoro was living as a maid. He also wanted to finish the battle with her to see who is the strongest android/warrior, during the final battle he discovers the reason she is living as a maid for Suguru and who the true warrior is. In the second series, he decides to live as a human and continues to teach at Suguru's school much to the irritation to Slash.\n\nIn the end of the anime, he visit the members of the Saint for the last time as they depart to another galaxy.\n\nIn the manga version, he marries one of his students whom he saved earlier, and becomes a father of a reborn Mahoro.\n\n===Management===\nIntroduced in ''Something More Beautiful'', Management is a top secret organization that had shaped the world from the shadows throughout its history. They are dedicated to destroying not only Saint, to preserve the order they established from alien influence, but Vesper as well, for having sympathy for Saint.\n\n{{nihongo|'''Feldrance'''|\u30d5\u30a7\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9|Feldlance}} (CODE: 227)\n* {{Voiced by|Misato Sakamoto|[[Mona Marshall]]}}\nA cold-hearted android in the form of a youth who was created by and works under the Management's robotics scientist Professor Mephlis during his scheme to take Mahoro for himself. However, Feldrance was actually working for the higher-ups to collect the data that Mephlis gathered on Mahoro. When Mephlis's plans failed, Feldrance made his move and killed the scientist before taking the data as his creator's lab explodes; he felt no remorse for betraying his creator, coldly pointing out that it was Mephlis, after all, who made Feldrance the way he is.\n\nIn the anime, he soon met his untimely end along with the death of Mahoro.\n\nIn the manga version, he chops Suguru's hands while capturing Mahoro but soon stopped by Slash and Ryuuga. He also witnessed the death of Mahoro to save Mankind. In the epilogue, he was the one of the last defenses of The Management in Mars. he encounters Suguru who kills him. With his last breath, he asks whether the quest of vengeance gave him satisfaction.\n\n==Endings==\n\n===Anime's ending===\nThe finale is set on a Saint-Earth colony world, 20 years after Mahoro's \"death\" and the mutual defeat of Vesper and Management. Suguru left Japan, deciding never to return, and is now a renegade half-cyborg hunter of the last \"Management holdouts.\" He has only memories of Earth, and a sole companion who later turns out to be an android and tries to kill him for the bounty on his head.\n\nAs Suguru is in critical condition, Mahoro reappears alive, asking to take him home.\n\n===Manga's ending===\nThe ending is set on Earth, 20 years after Mahoro's death and the defeat of Management. Suguru has been working as a commander within Vesper, and has just returned to Earth from the final defeat of Management's last vestiges.\n\nUnbeknownst to Suguru, Mahoro was reborn as a baby shortly after her death as an android. She has grown up, and remembers Suguru. When Suguru returns from Vesper headquarters expecting to find an empty house, she is there waiting for him.\n\n==Manga==\n{{nihongo|'''''Mahoromatic'''''|\u307e\u307b\u308d\u307e\u3066\u3043\u3063\u304f|Mahoromatikku}} manga series by Bow Ditama and [[Bunj\u016br\u014d Nakayama]] was originally serialized in ''[[Comic Gum]]'' magazine between December 1998 and July 26, 2004, and compiled into eight [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes published by [[Wani Books]].

In 1901, at sixteen years of age, Mercereau's first verses were published; poetry and criticism in ''Oeuvre d'art international''.

From 1907 to 1908 he co-founded and participated in the experience of the [[Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil]], a collective open to artists.

From 1910 he co-directed with [[Paul Fort]] the Parisian literary review ''Vers et Prose''. In 1911 he created the literary section of the [[Salon d'Automne]] in Paris, called ''Comit\u00e9 d'initiative th\u00e9\u00e2trale'', consisting of public lectures by emerging authors at the [[Od\u00e9on-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Europe|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Od\u00e9on]].

At this time, the art critic Jean Valmy Baysse (and soon historian of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]), in collaboration with Alexandre Mercereau, Ren\u00e9 Arcos, [[Charles Vildrac]] and [[Georges Duhamel]] were invited to participate on a new journal, titled ''La Vie''.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\">[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']</ref>\n\nSymbolist poet and writer [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Henri-Martin Barzun]] joined the group of writers and painters in 1905. Gleizes assisted in the formation of the Association [[Ernest Renan]] in December at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Pigalle]], in an attempt to counter the rise of militarist propaganda. In the process, publications and artwork tended towards a more popular and secular culture. Gleizes was in charge of the literary and artistic developments that organized poetry readings and street theatre.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\n[[File:AlexandreMercereau.jpg|thumb|255px|Alexandre Mercereau, circa 1906]]\n[[File:Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, interior scene, circa 1907.jpg|thumb|255px|Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil, interior scene, circa 1907]]\nMercereau, Gleizes and others throughout 1906 worked on a concept established by Charles Vildrac of creating a self-supporting community of artists. The motivation was to develop their art free of commercial considerations. In Cr\u00e9teil, a small village outside Paris, they invested a house and grounds. Barzun paid the rent for the first six months, financed with his small inheritance. Gleizes and Vildrac moved in during the month of December.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /> At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil]] consisted of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel and Barzun joined the group periodically. The musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''F\u00eates du Peuple'' also participated intermittently. In 1906 Mercereau travelled to Moscow, where he met a group of Russian symbolist and Art Nouveau artists called \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430 (Blue Rose).

Simultaneously, he worked as a correspondent for the Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" />\n\nHe returned to Paris in the Spring of 1907 with a Russian wife. At this time the Abbaye group supported itself through the printing (run by Linard and Gleizes) of high-quality material.

Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' ''Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne'' in a Russian exhibition of 1908.\n\n<blockquote>\"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity\", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], \"it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development\". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting.<ref name=\"Robbins, Guggenheim\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group\u2014including [[:fr:Roger Allard|Allard]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Barzun]], Beauduin, [[:fr:Pierre Castiaux|Castiaux]], [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Jouve]], [[:fr:Fernand Divoire|Divoire]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], [[:fr:Th\u00e9o Varlet|Varlet]] and even [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Salmon|Salmon]]\u2014became sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a ''Journ\u00e9e portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]].<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\"/><ref name=\"Metzinger, 1911\">Jean Metzinger, ''Alexandre Mercereau'', Vers et Prose, Paris, no. 27, October\u2013December, 1911, p. 122</ref><ref>Daniel Robbins, ''From Symbolism to Cubism: The Abbaye of Cr\u00e9teil\", The Art Journal, 1963-64, XXIII 2. pp. 111-116</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"In poetry\", writes Robbins, \"this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted<ref name=\"Metzinger, 1911\" />) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's ''Real Allegory'' which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet \"did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought\".<ref name=\"Robbins, Guggenheim\" /><ref>Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du \"Cubisme\"]]'', published by Eug\u00e8ne Figui\u00e8re, Paris, 1912.

Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Ind\u00e9pendants, Apollinaire wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1913, L'Homme au hamac, oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm.

Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]].

The motivation was to develop their art free of commercial considerations. In Cr\u00e9teil, a small village outside Paris, they invested a house and grounds. Barzun paid the rent for the first six months, financed with his small inheritance. Gleizes and Vildrac moved in during the month of December.<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\" /> At the outset of 1907 the [[Abbaye de Cr\u00e9teil]] consisted of Gleizes, Arcos and Vildrac with his wife Rose, sister of Duhamel. Duhamel and Barzun joined the group periodically. The musician [[:fr:Albert Doyen|Albert Doyen]], later to become known as founder of the ''F\u00eates du Peuple'' also participated intermittently. In 1906 Mercereau travelled to Moscow, where he met a group of Russian symbolist and Art Nouveau artists called \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u0430\u044f \u0440\u043e\u0437\u0430 (Blue Rose).

Mercereau had previously included Gleizes' ''Les Brumes du Matin sur la Marne'' in a Russian exhibition of 1908.\n\n<blockquote>\"Given Mercereau's long standing delight in promoting group activity\", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], \"it is easy to recognize his pleasure in having brought together three painters whose works exhibited similar interests and who could be identified with his own synthetic ideals, ideals which had been influential in the Abbaye's development\". As organizer of the literary section of the Salon d'Automne of 1909, he was able to introduce Gleizes to painters exhibiting there and to introduce his own concepts to the world of painting.<ref name=\"Robbins, Guggenheim\" /></blockquote>\n\nIn 1909 and 1910 a significant group of artists came together through Mercereau. The entire group\u2014including [[:fr:Roger Allard|Allard]], [[:fr:Henri-Martin Barzun|Barzun]], Beauduin, [[:fr:Pierre Castiaux|Castiaux]], [[:fr:Pierre Jean Jouve|Jouve]], [[:fr:Fernand Divoire|Divoire]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i|Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], [[:fr:Th\u00e9o Varlet|Varlet]] and even [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire]] and [[Andr\u00e9 Salmon|Salmon]]\u2014became sympathetic to the ideas of the Abbaye. During the Summer of 1908 Gleizes and Mercereau organized a ''Journ\u00e9e portes ouvertes'' at the Abbaye, with poetry readings, music and exhibitions. Participants included the Italian Symbolist poet, and soon principle theorist of [[Futurism]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and the Romanian sculptor [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]].<ref name=\"Brooke, Gleizes\"/><ref name=\"Metzinger, 1911\">Jean Metzinger, ''Alexandre Mercereau'', Vers et Prose, Paris, no. 27, October\u2013December, 1911, p. 122</ref><ref>Daniel Robbins, ''From Symbolism to Cubism: The Abbaye of Cr\u00e9teil\", The Art Journal, 1963-64, XXIII 2. pp. 111-116</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\"In poetry\", writes Robbins, \"this post-symbolist attempt to achieve new forms had to break decisively with the old unities of time, place and action. Unity of scene did not correspond with the reality of modem life; unity of time did not correspond with the culturally known and anticipated effects of change. That is why Mercereau (as Metzinger noted<ref name=\"Metzinger, 1911\" />) shifted his scenes so violently, why Barzun tried to solve the problem of simultaneously developing lines of action by choral chanting. Similarly Gleizes and his painter friends sought to create a vision free from introverted or obscure imagery which could treat collective and simultaneous factors. This necessitated a new kind of allegory opposed to the old meaning which presented one thing as the symbolic equivalent of another. A tentative precedent perhaps existed in Courbet's ''Real Allegory'' which, however, might have been considered an allegorical failure by Gleizes and Metzinger because Courbet \"did not suspect that the visible world only became the real world by the operation of thought\".<ref name=\"Robbins, Guggenheim\" /><ref>Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du \"Cubisme\"]]'', published by Eug\u00e8ne Figui\u00e8re, Paris, 1912. The authors begin their work with a discussion of Courbet</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis group of artists met regularly at Le Fauconnier's studio near the Boulevard de Montparnasse. Salmon and Apollinaire were only peripheral members, participating in divers literary and artistic circles, but clearly Apollinaire's conception of Cubism was influenced by the epic notions found in the old Abbaye circle. In his preface to the 1911 Brussels Ind\u00e9pendants, Apollinaire wrote:\n\n<blockquote>...thus has come a simple and noble art, expressive and measured, eager to discover beauty, and entirely ready to tackle those vast subjects which the painters of yesterday did not dare to undertake, abandoning them to the presumptuous, old-fashioned and boring daubers of the official Salons.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Albert Gleizes, 1913, L'Homme au hamac, oil on canvas, 130 x 155.5 cm.

Instead, it suggests the broad concepts held by the Mercereau-Gleizes circle, concepts at that time visible only in the paintings of Albert Gleizes, Henri Le Fauconnier, [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]]. The subjects treated by these Cubists differed significantly from the isolated still lifes or figures chosen by Picasso and Braque.<ref name=\"Robbins, Guggenheim\" />\n\nMercereau attempted to represent facets of [[time]] in his writings, much as Gleizes and Metzinger attempted to represent facets of space, time and form in their paintings.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HmPoAAAAMAAJ&q=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&dq=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7-MSUqGhEYXG4AOm6IGAAg&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAw Bernard Augustine De Voto, ''Saturday Review'', Volume 48, Saturday Review Company, 1965]</ref>\n\n{{quote|Alexandre Mercereau, quick to spotlight the merit of others, so fastidious about honor that he indicates the provenance of any idea he did not find within himself, possessor of an intelligence where the most antinomic philosophies are elaborated, has very quickly passed through the phases of contemporary literature, with the cheerful self-assurance of someone who has never been affected by the herd instinct. ...\n\nAlexandre Mercereau glorifies the androgyne, establishes ingenuous relationships between sacred vessels and instruments for the boudoir, and remains expressly a poet.|Jean Metzinger, 1911<ref name=\"Metzinger 1911\" />}}\n\nA painting by Gleizes entitled ''[[Man in a Hammock]]'' integrates the man into the landscape, forming a single image by virtue of a non-linear grid. This device is used by Gleizes to accommodate all aspects of the scene. One of Mercereau's books can be seen in the painting, along with the still-life next to the sitter, the man, and the environment. All are symbols of fundamental importance to Gleizes, an artist who rarely, if ever, contented himself with mundane subjects.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DfLqAAAAMAAJ&q=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&dq=Metzinger,+gleizes+hamac,+Mercereau&hl=en&sa=X&ei=OfsSUtPZJsHyyAH1soDYCQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwBg Painters of the Section d'Or: The Alternatives to Cubism.

The series centers on the exploits of a race of pet cats, drawn as [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|catgirls]] and the occasional catboy.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and [[TNK (company)|TNK]] aired from July 5, 2001, to September 27, 2001.\n\n==Summary==\nTaruto is a little [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|catgirl]] who at the beginning of the series moves to a new house in a huge city with her owner Iori Monaka and his niece Kinako. Taruto spends her days making friends and exploring her new home town; in reality Taruto is a legendary princess with special magic powers. Almost none of Taruto's friends believe that she's capable of using magic or that she's a princess from a faraway kingdom, but Taruto is determined to prove it to them no matter what happens.\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Animals===\n; {{nihongo|Taruto|\u305f\u308b\u3068|Taruto}}\n: {{Voiced by|Hisayo Mochizuki|[[Jessica Straus]]}}\n: The heroine of the story, Taruto is believed to be the legendary Kinka princess. She often is found goofing around and talking with her master, Iori, who she admires deeply, to the point she has a crush on him despite Iori's being human and calls him her fianc\u00e9.  She loves adventure, and she is often bullied by Charlotte.  She says \"meow\" (\"nyan\") after almost every phrase she says, though she is the only cat who does this. Taruto usually has frustration when Iori doesn't understand her when she tries to communicate. In the final episode it is revealed that the Kinka kingdom had two princesses. Taruto is the older sister of the twins.\n; {{nihongo|Charlotte|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30ed\u30c3\u30c6|Sharurotte}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Masayo Kurata]]|Lisa Enochs}}\n: Charlotte's past remains mysterious, as to her name was given by an elder, but it is known that she escaped from the pound.  Because of this past, she has shown great disliking of caged, or as she thinks of it, \"imprisoned\" animals. Charlotte is known for her stubborn attitude, and doubts that Taruto is really the Kinka princess. Charlotte has however tried to be kind to Taruto, such as trying to help her escape from Anzunko, though she only did this because she claimed it was her \"duty.\"\n; {{nihongo|Chitose|\u3061\u3068\u305b|Chitose}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Maria Yamamoto]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n: She has a quiet and graceful personality and seems very much the [[epitome]] of the proper Japanese girl, wearing an all-day green [[kimono]] as her everyday clothing-wear. She seems bubbly and particularly joyful. But even though she is very polite, Chitose never hesitates to speak her mind. She once had a lady cat who named Tort, but she passed on. She Chitose has a rather strange fixation with Taruto's tail. Even though their personalities are quite different, she is best friends with Charlotte.\n; {{nihongo|Kakipi|\u67ff\u30d4\u30fc|Kakip\u012b}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Yoshiko Kamei]]|[[R. Martin Klein|Robert Martin Klein]]}}\n: Ever since he was trapped in Iori's ceiling and Taruto rescued him, Kakipi has been Taruto's trusted sidekick. He appears to be a flying squirrel, but has difficulty flying. He was the one who came up with the idea that Taruto may be the Kinka princess, and believes this with all of his heart. He is usually trying to break Taruto of her lazy habits, but finds this job very difficult.\n; {{nihongo|Chips|\u30dd\u30c6\u30c1|Potechi}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|[[Elisa Dease]]}}\n: Chips is the leader of her mall team with her brother Nachos. Her name in Japanese, Potechi roughly translates to \"Potato Chips.\" She is a \"rebel\", and has an obsession with collecting shiny objects. She dislikes Taruto, believing that she is \"weak\". She has somewhat of a boyish appearance. She has one way or another an annoyance to her brother's attraction to Taruto. Chips once stole Iori's good luck charm, a small bottle, but after Nachos broke one of Chips' collected bottles, she realized how bad Iori must feel, and she reluctantly returns it.\n; {{nihongo|Nachos|\u30ca\u30c1\u30e7\u30b9|Nachosu}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Kaori Mizuhashi]]|[[Ben Salisbury]]}}\n: Nachos' gender is often confused because of his appearance, but he is actually a boy. He is calm and laid-back, and is Chips' partner and brother, who refers to his sister Chips as \"boss\". And he will always do what she says. He has a crush on Taruto, and even helps her and the group, such as when he came up with a plan to rescue a cat which was trapped in a house.\n; {{nihongo|Chiffon|\u30b7\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3|Shifon}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|Sarah Sido}}\n: The wise and long-lived Chiffon is often found with her face in a book. She is very knowledgeable about all kinds of subjects. She is always seen when there is a problem, for her knowledge always comes up with a good solution. Chiffon was the one who took Charlotte in when she was a stray, and also gave Charlotte her name.\n; {{nihongo|Rakugan|\u843d\u96c1|Rakugan}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Kazuki Yao]]|[[Robert Clotworthy]]}}\n: Rakugan is a very old cat, possibly as old as Chiffon or older, and calls himself a master of magic. In reality, he only knows a few ninja tricks (such as his smoke bomb, which he commonly uses for escapes and entrances). In a way, Taruto wants him to be his teacher in magic. He is the one who taught Taruto to use the \"Hail Tiger\" spell, and is willing to give advice despite the fact it doesn't always work the way she expects.\n\n===Humans===\n; {{nihongo|Iori Monaka|\u6700\u4e2d \u5eb5|Monaka Iori}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Takahashi]]|Greg Lastrapes}}\n: Iori is Taruto's kind master.  He is very gentle but easy-going. His hobby is making all kinds of sweets and foods, and he is very good at it. He is very affectionate towards Taruto, but, since he is a human, cannot understand her and sometimes frustrates her when she is trying to communicate with him, but he seems to only hear cat language because he cannot understand her. He is smitten with Anzuko Domyoji, but she shows no interest in him whatsoever.\n; {{nihongo|Kinako Monaka|\u6700\u4e2d \u304d\u306a\u5b50|Monaka Kinako}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Tomoko Ishimura]]|Laurel Hatfield}}\n: Kinako is Iori's niece, and is very fond of him. She has a vibrant, independent, tomboyish personality, and likes to go on all sorts of adventures. Kinako feels lonely when Iori, whom she lives with for unknown reasons, ignores her and spends his time trying to impress Anzuko. Though they were once rivals, she is good friends with Geppei.\n; {{nihongo|Anzuko Domyoji|\u9053\u660e\u5bfa \u674f\u5b50|D\u014dmy\u014dji Anzuko}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]|Sherrie Jackson}}\n: Anzuko is a cat collector, and once she has set her eyes on a cat, she will go to great lengths to catch it, possibly being the stereotype of a [[Crazy cat lady syndrome|crazy cat lady]]. The first time she saw Taruto, she has wanted her for her cat collection. Since Iori would not give Taruto to her (despite his crush on Anzuko), so she decided to capture Taruto instead. Any time she sees Taruto she will give chase - even cutting through people's lawns, breaking other people's belongings, or pushing people forcibly out of her way. Her nickname that mostly close friends call her is \"Anko.\"\n; {{nihongo|Geppei Okaki|\u5ca1\u6728 \u6708\u5e73|Okaki Geppei}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]|[[Jimmy Keegan]]}}\n: Geppei Okaki thinks he is better than everyone else, and acts like he is the boss of the town. However, his ex-rival, Kinako, set him straight. When they first met, they were enemies, but soon put their differences aside and became close friends, and often go on adventures together. Gallette, one of the few cat boys in the series, is his pet and goes everywhere with him. He has a pet cat named Gelette, who Taruto usually talks to for questions.\n\n==Episode list==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! Episode no. !! Episode title !!

He tells the group that he would like to visit an old lady who once helped him find his way home when he was lost.

The series centers on the exploits of a race of pet cats, drawn as [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|catgirls]] and the occasional catboy.\n\nA 12-episode [[anime]] television series adaptation animated by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] and [[TNK (company)|TNK]] aired from July 5, 2001, to September 27, 2001.\n\n==Summary==\nTaruto is a little [[Catgirl (anime and manga)|catgirl]] who at the beginning of the series moves to a new house in a huge city with her owner Iori Monaka and his niece Kinako. Taruto spends her days making friends and exploring her new home town; in reality Taruto is a legendary princess with special magic powers. Almost none of Taruto\u2019s friends believe that she's capable of using magic or that she\u2019s a princess from a faraway kingdom, but Taruto is determined to prove it to them no matter what happens.\n\n==Characters==\n\n=== Animals===\n; {{nihongo|Taruto|\u305f\u308b\u3068|Taruto}}\n: {{Voiced by|Hisayo Mochizuki|[[Jessica Straus]]}}\n: The heroine of the story, Taruto is believed to be the legendary Kinka princess. She often is found goofing around and talking with her master, Iori, who she admires deeply, to the point she has a crush on him despite Iori's being human and calls him her fianc\u00e9.  She loves adventure, and she is often bullied by Charlotte.  She says \"meow\" (\"nyan\") after almost every phrase she says, though she is the only cat who does this. Taruto usually has frustration when Iori doesn't understand her when she tries to communicate. In the final episode it is revealed that the Kinka kingdom had two princesses. Taruto is the older sister of the twins.\n; {{nihongo|Charlotte|\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30ed\u30c3\u30c6|Sharurotte}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Masayo Kurata]]|Lisa Enochs}}\n: Charlotte's past remains mysterious, as to her name was given by an elder, but it is known that she escaped from the pound.  Because of this past, she has shown great disliking of caged, or as she thinks of it, \"imprisoned\" animals. Charlotte is known for her stubborn attitude, and doubts that Taruto is really the Kinka princess. Charlotte has however tried to be kind to Taruto, such as trying to help her escape from Anzunko, though she only did this because she claimed it was her \"duty.\"\n; {{nihongo|Chitose|\u3061\u3068\u305b|Chitose}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Maria Yamamoto]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n: She has a quiet and graceful personality and seems very much the [[epitome]] of the proper Japanese girl, wearing an all-day green [[kimono]] as her everyday clothing-wear. She seems bubbly and particularly joyful. But even though she is very polite, Chitose never hesitates to speak her mind. She once had a lady cat who named Tort, but she passed on. She Chitose has a rather strange fixation with Taruto's tail. Even though their personalities are quite different, she is best friends with Charlotte.\n; {{nihongo|Kakipi|\u67ff\u30d4\u30fc|Kakip\u012b}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Yoshiko Kamei]]|[[R. Martin Klein|Robert Martin Klein]]}}\n: Ever since he was trapped in Iori's ceiling and Taruto rescued him, Kakipi has been Taruto's trusted sidekick. He appears to be a flying squirrel, but has difficulty flying. He was the one who came up with the idea that Taruto may be the Kinka princess, and believes this with all of his heart. He is usually trying to break Taruto of her lazy habits, but finds this job very difficult.\n; {{nihongo|Chips|\u30dd\u30c6\u30c1|Potechi}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|[[Elisa Dease]]}}\n: Chips is the leader of her mall team with her brother Nachos. Her name in Japanese, Potechi roughly translates to \"Potato Chips.\" She is a \"rebel\", and has an obsession with collecting shiny objects. She dislikes Taruto, believing that she is \"weak\". She has somewhat of a boyish appearance. She has one way or another an annoyance to her brother's attraction to Taruto. Chips once stole Iori's good luck charm, a small bottle, but after Nachos broke one of Chips' collected bottles, she realized how bad Iori must feel, and she reluctantly returns it.\n; {{nihongo|Nachos|\u30ca\u30c1\u30e7\u30b9|Nachosu}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Kaori Mizuhashi]]|[[Ben Salisbury]]}}\n: Nachos' gender is often confused because of his appearance, but he is actually a boy. He is calm and laid-back, and is Chips' partner and brother, who refers to his sister Chips as \"boss\". And he will always do what she says. He has a crush on Taruto, and even helps her and the group, such as when he came up with a plan to rescue a cat which was trapped in a house.\n; {{nihongo|Chiffon|\u30b7\u30d5\u30a9\u30f3|Shifon}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Aya Hisakawa]]|Sarah Sido}}\n: The wise and long-lived Chiffon is often found with her face in a book. She is very knowledgeable about all kinds of subjects. She is always seen when there is a problem, for her knowledge always comes up with a good solution. Chiffon was the one who took Charlotte in when she was a stray, and also gave Charlotte her name.\n; {{nihongo|Rakugan|\u843d\u96c1|Rakugan}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Kazuki Yao]]|[[Robert Clotworthy]]}}\n: Rakugan is a very old cat, possibly as old as Chiffon or older, and calls himself a master of magic. In reality, he only knows a few ninja tricks (such as his smoke bomb, which he commonly uses for escapes and entrances). In a way, Taruto wants him to be his teacher in magic. He is the one who taught Taruto to use the \"Hail Tiger\" spell, and is willing to give advice despite the fact it doesn't always work the way she expects.\n\n===Humans===\n; {{nihongo|Iori Monaka|\u6700\u4e2d \u5eb5|Monaka Iori}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Takahashi]]|Greg Lastrapes}}\n: Iori is Taruto's kind master.  He is very gentle but easy-going. His hobby is making all kinds of sweets and foods, and he is very good at it. He is very affectionate towards Taruto, but, since he is a human, cannot understand her and sometimes frustrates her when she is trying to communicate with him, but he seems to only hear cat language because he cannot understand her. He is smitten with Anzuko Domyoji, but she shows no interest in him whatsoever.\n; {{nihongo|Kinako Monaka|\u6700\u4e2d \u304d\u306a\u5b50|Monaka Kinako}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Tomoko Ishimura]]|Laurel Hatfield}}\n: Kinako is Iori's niece, and is very fond of him. She has a vibrant, independent, tomboyish personality, and likes to go on all sorts of adventures. Kinako feels lonely when Iori, whom she lives with for unknown reasons, ignores her and spends his time trying to impress Anzuko. Though they were once rivals, she is good friends with Geppei.\n; {{nihongo|Anzuko Domyoji|\u9053\u660e\u5bfa \u674f\u5b50|D\u014dmy\u014dji Anzuko}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Akemi Okamura]]|Sherrie Jackson}}\n: Anzuko is a cat collector, and once she has set her eyes on a cat, she will go to great lengths to catch it, possibly being the stereotype of a [[Crazy cat lady syndrome|crazy cat lady]]. The first time she saw Taruto, she has wanted her for her cat collection. Since Iori would not give Taruto to her (despite his crush on Anzuko), so she decided to capture Taruto instead. Any time she sees Taruto she will give chase - even cutting through people's lawns, breaking other people's belongings, or pushing people forcibly out of her way. Her nickname that mostly close friends call her is \"Anko.\"\n; {{nihongo|Geppei Okaki|\u5ca1\u6728 \u6708\u5e73|Okaki Geppei}}\n: {{Voiced by|[[Daisuke Sakaguchi]]|[[Jimmy Keegan]]}}\n: Geppei Okaki thinks he is better than everyone else, and acts like he is the boss of the town. However, his ex-rival, Kinako, set him straight. When they first met, they were enemies, but soon put their differences aside and became close friends, and often go on adventures together. Gallette, one of the few cat boys in the series, is his pet and goes everywhere with him. He has a pet cat named Gelette, who Taruto usually talks to for questions.\n\n==Episode list==\n{|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"98%\"\n|-\n! Episode no. !! Episode title !!

He is not very sociable and prefers to live inside the house, but once he starts talking he keeps babbling on. He tells the group that he would like to visit an old lady who once helped him find his way home when he was lost.  This old lady turns out to be Iori's mother, whose granddaughter Kinako is also visiting to reconcile with her.

Taruto gets to live happily ever after with Iori in the human world.\n}}\n|}\n\n==Theme songs==\n\n'''Opening Theme'''\n* {{nihongo|\"Today's Flower\"|\u4eca\u65e5\u306e\u82b1|Kyou no Hana}}\n** Lyrics by: Masaaki Taniguchi\n** Composition and Arranged by: Masumi It\u014d\n** Song by: [[Masumi It\u014d]]\n\n'''Ending Theme'''\n* {{nihongo|\"Hallelujah in Humming!\"|\u30cf\u30ca\u30a6\u30bf\u30ce\u30cf\u30ec\u30eb\u30e4!|Hanauta no Hareruya!}}\n** Lyrics by: Masaaki Taniguchi\n** Composition and Arranged by: Masumi It\u014d\n** Song by: Magical Nyan Nyan (Hisayo Mochizuki, [[Masayo Kurata]], [[Maria Yamamoto]])\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.b-ch.com/cgi-bin/contents/ttl/det.cgi?ttl_c=159 Bandai Channel Official website] {{in lang|ja}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110713175124/http://www.kyou-no-hana.com/ Kyou no Hana - A Magical Nyan Nyan Taruto Fansite]\n* {{ann|manga|4399}}\n\n{{Ultra Jump}}\n{{Madhouse}}\n{{TNK}}\n\n[[Category:2001 anime television series]]\n[[Category:Bandai Entertainment anime titles]]\n[[Category:Kemonomimi]]\n[[Category:Madhouse (company)]]\n[[Category:Seinen manga]]\n[[Category:Shueisha franchises]]\n[[Category:Shueisha manga]]\n[[Category:TNK (company)]]\n[[Category:WOWOW shows]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSummary:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: she\u2019s \u2192 she's, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_Meow_Meow_Taruto"}

It is also known as the '''I-35 Rivalry''' since San Antonio and Dallas lie on [[Interstate 35]], it is one of the three [[National Basketball Association rivalries]] between teams from [[Texas]], the others featuring Dallas and San Antonio versus the [[Houston Rockets]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons.\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of [[Steve Nash]], [[Michael Finley]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], had just defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] despite not having home court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]], respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, [[Don Nelson]] would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur [[Avery Johnson]], the [[point guard]] of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the [[New York Knicks]]. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' Head Coach [[Gregg Popovich]], he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, [[Michael Finley]], waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |title=Dallas Mavericks Upset by Oakland Upstarts |publisher=NPR |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Dallas vs. Golden State Recap, May 3, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3281217&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Sweep!

[[Joey Crawford]], the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, [[American Airlines Center]] erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\nIn the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round.  The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth seeded [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the first time an eight seed defeated a one seed since the infamous Mavs-Warriors series of 2007.  In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led [[Miami Heat]] in the NBA Finals, similar again to how the 2007 Spurs defeated a LeBron James-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] team in the Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] by the Spurs for the first time since the [[1997\u20131998 NBA season|1998 season]], Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a [[Vince Carter]] 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|title=Spurs edge Mavericks to sweep season series|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]], where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n==Annual results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Season'''\n| NBA season\n|-\n| '''Mavericks'''/'''Spurs'''\n|

[[San Antonio Spurs]]. It is also known as the '''I-35 Rivalry''' since San Antonio and Dallas lie on [[Interstate 35]], it is one of the three [[National Basketball Association rivalries]] between teams from [[Texas]], the others featuring Dallas and San Antonio versus the [[Houston Rockets]].\n\n==Background==\nThe Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is relatively new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas roots\u2014the Spurs began their life in the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating the Spurs 103\u201392. The teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with the Spurs defeating the Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated the Spurs in 2006 and 2009. The Spurs have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. The Spurs have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons.\n\nThe two teams met in the playoffs during the 2000\u20132001 season with the Spurs winning in five games. Little was made during this series, as the Spurs won their first NBA championship only two years before. The Mavericks, run by a trio of [[Steve Nash]], [[Michael Finley]], and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], had just defeated the [[Utah Jazz]] despite not having home court advantage and were only starting to meld into a title contender.\n\nThe two teams met again in 2003 in the Western Conference Finals. Both the Spurs and the Mavericks had 60-win seasons and reached the Western Conference Finals after defeating the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] and the [[Sacramento Kings]], respectively. Despite having the best season of their history, the Mavericks fell in six games to the Spurs.\n\nThe rivalry took on a new meaning in 2005 when, near the end of the regular season, [[Don Nelson]] would resign as head coach of the Mavericks, apparently satisfied with the state of the team, and hand the coaching reins to former Spur [[Avery Johnson]], the [[point guard]] of the 1999 NBA champion Spurs team who hit the game-winning shot against the [[New York Knicks]]. Since Johnson was coached under Spurs' Head Coach [[Gregg Popovich]], he would be familiar with most, if not all, of Popovich's coaching style and philosophy. During the 2005 offseason, [[Michael Finley]], waived by the Mavericks under the amnesty clause, joined the Spurs in search for the elusive title.\n\nDuring the 2006 playoffs the two rivals met again. San Antonio won the first game at home 87\u201385. The Mavericks got revenge the next game, winning 113\u201391 and evening the series up at 1\u20131. The Mavericks then won a dramatic Game 3 by a single point, 104\u2013103. Though Manu Gin\u00f3bili could have made a game-winning basket with five seconds on the clock, he committed an error, allowing the ball to bounce away from him with one second remaining. Dallas won a tightly-contested Game 4 123\u2013118 in overtime. The Spurs proceeded to avoid elimination by taking Game 5. In the final seconds of the game, Jason Terry was seen punching former teammate Michael Finley under the belt, leading to his suspension for Game 6. He was sorely missed as the Spurs won, taking the series back home for a Game 7. In the crucial Game 7, with 2.6 seconds to go, Nowitzki converted a three-point play to force overtime. [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], who fouled Dirk on the play, had just given San Antonio their first lead one possession earlier. Tim Duncan, who had played in all 48 minutes of regulation, was too fatigued to carry his team in overtime. The Mavericks, meanwhile, were set to take control of the game and they did just that, winning 119\u2013111. The Mavericks went on to the Conference Finals where they defeated the Suns in six games, but succumbed to the champion Heat in the NBA Finals.\n\nDespite much anticipation of a renewed meeting in the 2007 Western Conference finals, the Mavericks lost to the Golden State Warriors in one of the greatest upsets in NBA history. The Spurs won the NBA finals after beating the Cleveland Cavaliers 4\u20130.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10005744 |title=Dallas Mavericks Upset by Oakland Upstarts |publisher=NPR |date=May 4, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> The eighth seed Warriors, who made the playoffs on the last game of the NBA season, defeated the 67-win, first-seed Mavericks in six games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=270503009 |title=ESPN&nbsp;\u2013 Dallas vs. Golden State Recap, May 3, 2007 |publisher=ESPN |date=May 3, 2007 |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}</ref> Meanwhile, the Spurs would ultimately go on to win the 2007 NBA Championship, establishing themselves as a true NBA dynasty.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory?id=3281217&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Sweep!

[[Joey Crawford]], the referee who ejected Duncan, allegedly asked Duncan to a fight which led to the longtime ref's season-ending suspension. As Duncan was heading into the locker room, [[American Airlines Center]] erupted into a huge cheer, applauding Duncan's ejection. The game saw chippy play, with [[Jerry Stackhouse]] and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] getting into an altercation after a rebound.\n\nIn the 2009 NBA Playoffs, the Mavericks and Spurs squared off again in the first round.  The Spurs and Mavericks split the first two games in San Antonio, but Dallas defeated the Spurs in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated the Spurs at the AT&T Center in San Antonio.\n\nIn 2010, the Dallas Mavericks matched up against the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Playoffs. Although the Mavericks managed to obtain the number two seed, they were defeated by the Spurs in six games.\n\nDuring the 2011 playoffs, a role reversal of sorts occurred between the two rivals, when the top seeded Spurs were defeated by the eighth seeded [[Memphis Grizzlies]], the first time an eight seed defeated a one seed since the infamous Mavs-Warriors series of 2007.  In addition, the Mavericks defeated the LeBron James-led [[Miami Heat]] in the NBA Finals, similar again to how the 2007 Spurs defeated a LeBron James-led [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] team in the Finals.\n\nThe Mavericks were swept in the [[2012\u201313 NBA season|2012\u201313 season]] by the Spurs for the first time since the [[1997\u20131998 NBA season|1998 season]], Tim Duncan's rookie season. In their last match up of the season, San Antonio escaped with a 92\u201391 victory over Dallas when a [[Vince Carter]] 3-point attempt bounced off the rim at the buzzer. With the win the Spurs clinched a playoff spot for the 16th straight season, currently the longest streak in the NBA. San Antonio also reached 50 wins for the 14th straight season, the longest streak in NBA history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278687|title=Spurs edge Mavericks to sweep season series|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2013\u201314 NBA season|2013\u201314 season]], the Spurs once again swept the Mavs in the regular season, giving them nine straight victories. In addition, an overtime loss to the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] on April 16, 2014 ensured that the Mavericks would face the Spurs once again in the [[2014 NBA Playoffs]], where the Mavs would be the eighth seed and San Antonio the first. In Game 1 in San Antonio, the game was relatively close. Dallas managed to reach an 81\u201371 lead in the fourth quarter, but the Spurs rallied back and took Game 1 at home, 85\u201390. However, the Mavs managed to force 22 turnovers in Game 2 to rout the Spurs 113\u201392, splitting the first two games before the series went to Dallas. In Game 3, [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]] managed to hit a shot that put the Spurs up 108\u2013106 with 1.7 left, but a buzzer beater by [[Vince Carter]] gave the Mavs the victory, putting them up 2\u20131 in the series. The Spurs took Game 4 in Dallas 93\u201389 and later Game 5 at home 109\u2013103, giving them a 3\u20132 lead. Luckily, the Mavs avoided elimination in Game 6 at home by rallying in the fourth quarter, winning 111\u2013113. The Spurs won game 7 119\u201396, eliminating the Mavericks in the first round.\n\n==Annual results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Season'''\n| NBA season\n|-\n| '''Mavericks'''/'''Spurs'''\n|

He claims to be of Berber ancestry. During the Nazi occupation of Tunisia, Memmi was imprisoned in a forced labor camp from which he later escaped.<ref>\"The Colonizer and the Colonized,\" back cover material</ref>\n\nMemmi was educated in French primary schools, and continued on to the Carnot high school in [[Tunis]], the [[University of Algiers]] where he studied [[philosophy]], and finally the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in [[Paris]]. Albert Memmi found himself at the crossroads of three cultures, and based his work on the difficulty of finding a balance between the East and the West.<ref>Kabanda, Th\u00e9ophiste. \"La Permanence de l'exil dans le roman francophone.\" ''Nouvelles \u00e9tudes francophones.'' 1:24, 2009.</ref>\n\nParallel with his literary work, he pursued a career as a teacher, first as a teacher at the Carnot high school in Tunis (1953) and later in France (where he remained after Tunisian independence) at the Practical School of Higher Studies, at the [[HEC Paris|HEC]] High School in Paris and at the [[University of Nanterre]] (1970).\n\nAlthough he supported the independence movement in Tunisia, he was not able to find a place in the new Muslim state both because of his French education and his Jewish faith, and following independence he \"was asked to leave\" the new state.<ref>Martinot, Introduction to \"Racism,\" at xvi</ref>\n\n==Writings==\nMemmi's well-regarded first novel, ''La statue de sel'' (translated as ''The Pillar of Salt''), was published in 1953 with a preface by [[Albert Camus]] and was awarded the [[F\u00e9n\u00e9on Prize]] in 1954.<ref name=encyclopedia>Brennan, Carol, [http://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/albert-memmi \"Memmi, Albert 1920\u2013\"], Contemporary Black Biography. ''Encyclopedia.com''.</ref>  His other novels include ''Agar'' (translated as ''Strangers''), ''Le Scorpion'' (''The Scorpion''), and ''Le Desert'' (''The Desert'').\n\nHis best-known non-fiction work is ''[[The Colonizer and the Colonized]]'', about the interdependent relationship of the two groups.  It was published in 1957, a time when many national liberation movements were active.  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote the preface.  The work is often read in conjunction with [[Frantz Fanon]]'s ''Les damn\u00e9s de la Terre'' (''[[The Wretched of the Earth]]'') and ''Peau noire, masques blancs'' (''[[Black Skin, White Masks]]'') and [[Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire]]'s ''[[Discourse on Colonialism]]''. In October 2006, Memmi's follow-up to this work, entitled ''Decolonization and the Decolonized'', was published. In this book, Memmi suggests that in the wake of global decolonization, the suffering of former colonies cannot be attributed to the former colonizers, but to the corrupt leaders and governments that control these states.\n\nMemmi's related sociological works include ''Dominated Man'', ''Dependence'', and ''Racism''.\n\nSean P. Hier, in a review of Memmi's ''Racism'', calls it \"well-written and autobiographically informed.\" He writes that Memmi's main claim is that racism is a \"'lived experience' arising within human situations which only secondarily become 'social experiences.' According to Hier, Memmi writes that racism is \"endemic to collective human existence.\"<ref name=\"Hier2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Hier|first1=Sean P.|title=Racism|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|date=2001|volume=26|issue=1|page=127|doi=10.2307/3341517|jstor=3341517}}</ref>\n\nMemmi has also written extensively on [[Judaism]], including ''Portrait of a Jew'', ''Liberation of the Jew'' and ''Jews and Arabs''.\n\nHe is also known for the ''Anthology of Maghrebian literature'' (written in collaboration) published in 1965 (vol. 1) and 1969 (vol. 2).\n\nReviewing Memmi's fiction, scholar Judith Roumani asserts that the Tunisian writer's work \"reveals the same philosophical evolution over time from his original viewpoints to less radical but perhaps more realistic positions.\" She concludes that \"his latest fiction is certainly more innovative and different than his earlier work.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Albert Memmi by Judith Roumani | journal = Research in African Literatures | year = 1989 | first = Hedi | last = Bouraoui | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 126\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Memmi said of his own work: \"All of my work has been in sum an inventory of my attachments; all of my work has been, it should be understood, a constant revolt against my attachments; all of my work, for certain, has been an attempt at...reconciliation between the different parts of myself.\"\n\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== French ===\n* ''A contre-courants''.

According to Hier, Memmi writes that racism is \"endemic to collective human existence.\"<ref name=\"Hier2001\">{{cite journal|last1=Hier|first1=Sean P.|title=Racism|journal=Canadian Journal of Sociology|date=2001|volume=26|issue=1|page=127|doi=10.2307/3341517|jstor=3341517}}</ref>\n\nMemmi has also written extensively on [[Judaism]], including ''Portrait of a Jew'', ''Liberation of the Jew'' and ''Jews and Arabs''.\n\nHe is also known for the ''Anthology of Maghrebian literature'' (written in collaboration) published in 1965 (vol. 1) and 1969 (vol. 2).\n\nReviewing Memmi's fiction, scholar Judith Roumani asserts that the Tunisian writer's work \"reveals the same philosophical evolution over time from his original viewpoints to less radical but perhaps more realistic positions.\" She concludes that \"his latest fiction is certainly more innovative and different than his earlier work.\"<ref>{{cite journal | title = Albert Memmi by Judith Roumani | journal = Research in African Literatures | year = 1989 | first = Hedi | last = Bouraoui | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 126\u2013127}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Memmi said of his own work: \"All of my work has been in sum an inventory of my attachments; all of my work has been, it should be understood, a constant revolt against my attachments; all of my work, for certain, has been an attempt at...reconciliation between the different parts of myself.\"\n\n{{Wikiquote}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n=== French ===\n* ''A contre-courants''.
