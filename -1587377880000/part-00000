The song was also performed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert in [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].

According to Currie, Ure was hesitant about the overly classical romantic feel of the orchestration, and said: \"This means nothing to me,\" to which the producer Conny Plank replied: \"Well, sing that then.\" Ure said that he had in his mind only the line \"The feeling is gone, this means nothing to me \u2013 oh Vienna!\" when he went into studio.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\nIn interviews at the time it was said that the song took its inspiration from the 1948 film ''[[The Third Man]]'', which is based around the Austrian capital, but Midge Ure later admitted he made that up when asked what the song was about.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Ure is said to have been influenced by [[The Walker Brothers]]' 1978 single \"[[The Electrician (song)|The Electrician]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nite-flights-mw0000464403 |title=Nite Flights - The Walker Brothers &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nUre said of the track: \"We wanted to take the song and make it incredibly pompous in the middle, leaving it very sparse before and after, but finishing with a typically over-the top classical ending.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/vienna-mt0011151782 |title=Vienna - Ultravox &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe song became the title track on the band's album ''[[Vienna (album)|Vienna]]'', released in 1980. The record company [[Chrysalis Records]] was reluctant to release the song as a single, as they thought it was too slow and too long to be successful. But the band wanted to release it as a single and it was released as the album's third single in January 1981.

According to Currie, Ure was hesitant about the overly classical romantic feel of the orchestration, and said: \"This means nothing to me,\" to which the producer Conny Plank replied: \"Well, sing that then.\" Ure said that he had in his mind only the line \"The feeling is gone, this means nothing to me \u2013 oh Vienna!\" when he went into studio.<ref name=\"Guardian\" />\n\nIn interviews at the time it was said that the song took its inspiration from the 1948 film ''[[The Third Man]]'', which is based around the Austrian capital, but Midge Ure later admitted he made that up when asked what the song was about.<ref name=\"Independent\" /> Ure is said to have been influenced by [[The Walker Brothers]]' 1978 single \"[[The Electrician (song)|The Electrician]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/nite-flights-mw0000464403 |title=Nite Flights - The Walker Brothers &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nUre said of the track: \"We wanted to take the song and make it incredibly pompous in the middle, leaving it very sparse before and after, but finishing with a typically over-the top classical ending.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Thompson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/vienna-mt0011151782 |title=Vienna - Ultravox &#124; Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=3 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\nThe song became the title track on the band's album ''[[Vienna (album)|Vienna]]'', released in 1980. The record company [[Chrysalis Records]] was reluctant to release the song as a single, as they thought it was too slow and too long to be successful. But the band wanted to release it as a single and it was released as the album's third single in January 1981.

Selection of epoxies is based on their superior adhesion, permeability, purity, and corrosion- and stress-resistance properties.}}</ref> Epoxy resins, also known as '''polyepoxides''', are a class of reactive [[prepolymer]]s and [[polymer]]s which contain epoxide groups.\n\nEpoxy resins may be reacted ([[cross-linked]]) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or with a wide range of co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and [[acid anhydride]]s), phenols, alcohols and [[thiols]] (usually called mercaptans). These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015). [https://www.onepetro.org/download/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS?id=conference-paper%2FSPE-176457-MS Is Epoxy-Based Polymer Suitable for Water Shut-Off Application?] SPE-176457-MS. SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n[[File:Nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg|thumb|Offshore Wind Farm]]\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Photo-1565992441121-4367c2967103.jpg|thumb|Exemplary epoxy application in sports industry]]\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

The use of composite leaf springs in particular in light trucks increases the cargo load. [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-leaf-springs-saving-weight-in-production-suspension-systems/ Composite LEaf Springs]  50 % mass reduction is achievable when replacing steel for the manufacture of coil springs by fiber reinforced Epoxy.  New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards. Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the thermoset plastic materials|the chemical group|epoxide}}\n{{citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n[[File:FiveMinEpoxy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A syringe of \"5-minute\" epoxy glue, containing separate compartments for the epoxy resin and the hardener.]]\n[[File:Epoxide_generic.png|thumb|Structure of the epoxide group, a reactive functional group present in all epoxy resins.]]\n'''Epoxy''' refers to any of the basic components or [[Curing (chemistry)|cured]] end products of '''epoxy resins''', as well as a colloquial name for the [[epoxide]] functional group.<ref name=\"May2018\">{{cite book |author=Clayton May |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology (Second Edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1XlaDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA2-PA64&lpg=RA2-PA64&focus=viewport&vq=%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed%22&dq=may+Epoxy+Resins:+Chemistry+and+Technology+Second+Edition,+%22Epoxies+are+the+resins+most+commonly+employed+for+electrical+and+electronic+applications%22#v=onepage&q=%22Epoxies%20are%20the%20resins%20most%20commonly%20employed%22&f=false |date=11 May 2018 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-1-351-44995-3 |page=65 |quote=Epoxies are the resins most commonly employed for electrical and electronic applications.

These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing.\n\nReaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]]ting [[polymer]], often with favorable mechanical properties and high thermal and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics/electrical components/LEDs, high tension electrical insulators, paint brush manufacturing, [[fibre-reinforced plastic|fiber-reinforced plastic]] materials, and [[adhesive]]s for structural and other purposes.\n\n== Epoxy resins (prepolymers and monomers) ==\nMost of the commercially used epoxy monomers are produced by the reaction of a compound with [[Hydroxy group|acidic hydroxy groups]] and [[epichlorohydrin]]:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis epoxide Epichlorohydrin.svg|400px|First the hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by dehydrohalogenation.]]\n:<small>First a hydroxy group reacts in a coupling reaction with epichlorohydrin, followed by [[dehydrohalogenation]].</small>\n\nEpoxy resins produced from such epoxy monomers are called [[Glycidol|glycidyl]]-based epoxy resins. The hydroxy group may be derived from [[aliphatic diol]]s, [[polyol]]s (polyether polyols), [[phenolic compounds]] or [[dicarboxylic acid]]s. Phenols can be compounds such as [[bisphenol A]] and [[novolak]]. Polyols can be compounds such as [[1,4-Butanediol|1,4-butanediol]]. Di- and polyols lead to diglycid polyethers. Dicarboxylic acids such as hexahydrophthalic acid are used for diglycide ester resins. Instead of a hydroxy group, also the nitrogen atom of an [[amine]] or [[amide]] can be  reacted with epichlorohydrin.\n\nThe other production route for epoxy resins is the conversion of [[Aliphatic alkene|aliphatic]] or [[cycloaliphatic alkene]]s with [[peracid]]s:<ref name=\"Ullmann\" /><ref name=\"KunstChem\">[[Wolfgang Kaiser (Chemiker)|Wolfgang Kaiser]]: ''Kunststoffchemie f\u00fcr Ingenieure.'' 3.

Bisphenol A-based resins are the most widely commercialised resins but also other [[Bisphenol|bisphenols]] are analogously reacted with epichlorohydrin, for example [[Bisphenol F]].\n\n:[[File:Diglycidether.svg|400px|Synthesis of bisphenol A diglycidyl ether.]]\n:<small>In this two-stage reaction, epichlorohydrin is first added to bisphenol A (bis(3-chloro-2-hydroxy-propoxy)bisphenol A is formed), then a bisepoxide is formed in a condensation reaction with a stoichiometric amount of sodium hydroxide. The chlorine atom is released as [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl), the hydrogen atom as of water.</small>\n\nHigher molecular weight diglycidyl ethers (n \u2265 1) are formed by the reaction of the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether formed with further bisphenol A, this is called prepolymerization:\n\n:[[File:Synthesis Bisphenol A diglycidyl ether higher Mw.svg|600px|Synthesis of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether with a high [[molar mass]].]]\n\nA product comprising a few repeat units (''n'' = 1 to 2) is a viscous, clear liquid; this is called a liquid epoxy resin. A product comprising more repeating units (''n'' = 2 to 30) is at room temperature a colourless solid, which is correspondingly referred to as solid epoxy resin.\n\nInstead of bisphenol A, other bisphenols (especially [[bisphenol F]]) or brominated bisphenols (e. g. [[tetrabromobisphenol A]]) can be used for the said [[epoxidation]] and prepolymerisation. [[Bisphenol F]] may undergo epoxy resin formation in a similar fashion to bisphenol A. These resins typically have lower viscosity and a higher mean epoxy content per gram than bisphenol A resins, which (once cured) gives them increased chemical resistance.\n\nImportant epoxy resins are produced from combining [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[bisphenol A]] to give [[bisphenol A diglycidyl ether]]s.\n[[File:Epoxy prepolymer chemical structure.png|thumb|300px|Structure of bisphenol-A diglycidyl ether epoxy resin: ''n'' denotes the number of polymerized subunits and is typically in the range from 0 to 25]]\nIncreasing the ratio of bisphenol A to epichlorohydrin during manufacture produces higher molecular weight linear polyethers with glycidyl end groups, which are semi-solid to hard crystalline materials at room temperature depending on the molecular weight achieved. This route of synthesis is known as the \"taffy\" process. More modern manufacturing methods of higher molecular weight epoxy resins is to start with liquid epoxy resin (LER) and add a calculated amount of bisphenol A and then a catalyst is added and the reaction heated to circa {{convert|160|C|F}}. This process is known as \"advancement\".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/5521261.pdf |title=Epoxy resin mixtures containing advancement catalysts |website=freepatentsonline.com |language=en |access-date=2018-08-29}}</ref>  As the molecular weight of the resin increases, the epoxide content reduces and the material behaves more and more like a [[thermoplastic]]. Very high molecular weight polycondensates (ca. 30 000 \u2013 70 000 g/mol) form a class known as phenoxy resins and contain virtually no epoxide groups (since the terminal epoxy groups are insignificant compared to the total size of the molecule). These resins do however contain hydroxyl groups throughout the backbone, which may also undergo other cross-linking reactions, e.g. with aminoplasts, phenoplasts and [[isocyanate]]s.\n\nEpoxy resins are polymeric or semi-polymeric materials or an [[oligomer]], and as such rarely exist as pure substances, since variable chain length results from the polymerisation reaction used to produce them. High purity grades can be produced for certain applications, e.g. using a distillation purification process. One downside of high purity liquid grades is their tendency to form crystalline solids due to their highly regular structure, which then require melting to enable processing.\n\nAn important criterion for epoxy resins is the epoxide group content. This is expressed as the \"'''epoxide equivalent weight'''\", which is the ratio between the molecular weight of the monomer and the number of epoxide groups.\nThis parameter is used to calculate the mass of co-reactant (hardener) to use when curing epoxy resins. Epoxies are typically cured with [[stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] or near-stoichiometric quantities of hardener to achieve the best physical properties.\n\n===Novolac===\n[[File:Epoxyphenol-Novolak.svg|thumb|General structure of epoxyphenol novolak with ''n'' usually in the range from 0 to 4. The compound is present in the form of various [[Structural isomer|constitutional isomers]].]]\n\nNovolaks are produced by reacting [[phenol]] with [[methanal]] (formaldehyde). The reaction of [[epichlorohydrin]] and [[novolak]]s produces novolaks with [[Glycidol|glycidyl residues]], such as epoxyphenol novolak (EPN) or epoxycresol novolak (ECN). These highly viscous to solid resins typically carry 2 to 6 epoxy groups per molecule. By curing, highly cross-linked polymers with high temperature and chemical resistance but low mechanical flexibility are formed due to the high functionality of these resins.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">{{cite journal |author = Ha Q. Pham, Maurice J.

These are highly viscous to solid resins with typical mean epoxide functionality of around 2 to 6. The high epoxide functionality of these resins forms a highly crosslinked polymer network displaying high temperature and chemical resistance, but low flexibility.\n\n=== Aliphatic ===\nThere are two common types of aliphatic epoxy resins: those obtained by epoxidation of double bonds (cycloaliphatic epoxides and epoxidized vegetable oils) and those formed by reaction with epichlorohydrin (glycidyl ethers and esters).\n\n[[File:Diepoxyester.svg|thumb|Structural formula of [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]]]\n\nCycloaliphatic epoxides contain one or more aliphatic rings in the molecule on which the oxirane ring is contained (e.g. [[3,4-Epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3\u2019,4\u2019-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate|3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3',4'-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate]]). They are produced by the reaction of a cyclic alkene with a [[peracid]] (see above).<ref>L. Hammerton, ed. by Rebecca Dolbey: ''Recent Developments in Epoxy Resins.'' RAPRA Review Reports, 1996, {{ISBN|978-1-85957-083-8}}, S.&nbsp;8.</ref>  Cycloaliphatic epoxides are characterised by their aliphatic structure, high oxirane content and the absence of chlorine, which results in low viscosity and (once cured) good weather resistance, low dielectric constants and high [[Glass transition|T<sub>g</sub>]]. However, aliphatic epoxy resins polymerize very slowly at room temperature, so higher temperatures and suitable accelerators are usually required. Because aliphatic epoxies have a lower electron density than aromatics, cycloaliphatic epoxies react less readily with nucleophiles than bisphenol A-based epoxy resins (which have aromatic ether groups). This means that conventional nucleophilic hardeners such as amines are hardly suitable for crosslinking. Cycloaliphatic epoxides are therefore usually homopolymerized thermally or UV-initiated in an electrophilic or cationic reaction. Due to the low dielectric constants and the absence of chlorine, cycloaliphatic epoxides are often used to encapsulate electronic systems, such as microchips or LEDs. They are also used for radiation-cured paints and varnishes. Due to their high price, however, their use has so far been limited to such applications.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nEpoxidized vegetable oils are formed by epoxidation of [[unsaturated fatty acids]] by reaction with peracids. In this case, the peracids can also be formed in situ by reacting carboxylic acids with hydrogen peroxide. Compared with LERs (liquid epoxy resins) they have very low viscosities. If, however, they are used in larger proportions as [[reactive diluent]]s, this often leads to reduced chemical and thermal resistance and to poorer mechanical properties of the cured epoxides. Large scale epoxidized vegetable oils such as epoxidized soy and lens oils are used to a large extent as secondary plasticizers and cost stabilizers for [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]].<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nAliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins of low molar mass (mono-, bi- or polyfunctional) are formed by the reaction of epichlorohydrin with aliphatic alcohols or polyols (glycidyl ethers are formed) or with aliphatic carboxylic acids (glycidyl esters are formed). The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, analogous to the formation of bisphenol A-diglycidyl ether. Also aliphatic glycidyl epoxy resins usually have a low viscosity compared to aromatic epoxy resins. They are therefore added to other epoxy resins as [[reactive diluent]]s or as [[adhesion promoter]]s. Epoxy resins made of (long-chain) polyols are also added to improve tensile strength and impact strength.\n\nA related class is cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, which contains one or more cycloaliphatic rings in the molecule (e.g. 3,4-epoxycyclohexylmethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane carboxylate). This class also displays lower viscosity at room temperature, but offers significantly higher temperature resistance than the aliphatic epoxy diluents. However, reactivity is rather low compared to other classes of epoxy resin, and high temperature curing using suitable accelerators is normally required. As aromaticity is not present in these materials as it is in Bisphenol A and F resins, the UV stability is considerably improved.\n\n=== Halogenated ===\nHalogenated epoxy resins are admixed for special properties, in particular brominated and fluorinated epoxy resins are used.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\nBrominated bisphenol A is used when flame retardant properties are required, such as in some electrical applications (e.g. [[printed circuit board]]s). The tetrabrominated bisphenol A (TBBPA, 2,2-bis(3,5-dibromophenyl)propane) or its diglycidyl ether, 2,2-bis[3,5-dibromo-4-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)phenyl]propane, can be added to the epoxy [[formulation]]. The formulation may then be reacted in the same way as pure bisphenol A. Some (non-crosslinked) epoxy resins with very high molar mass are added to engineering thermoplastics, again to achieve flame retardant properties.\n\nFluorinated epoxy resins have been investigated for some [[High-performance plastics|high performance applications]], such as the fluorinated diglycidether 5-heptafluoropropyl-1,3-bis[2-(2,3-epoxypropoxy)hexafluoro-2-propyl]benzene. As it has a low surface tension, it is added as a wetting agent (surfactant) for contact with glass fibres. Its reactivity to hardeners is comparable to that of bisphenol A. When cured, the epoxy resin leads to a thermosetting plastic with high chemical resistance and low water absorption. However, the commercial use of fluorinated epoxy resins is limited by their high cost and low T<sub>g</sub>.\n\n===Diluents===\nEpoxy resins diluents are typically formed by glycidylation of aliphatic alcohols or polyols. The resulting materials may be monofunctional (e.g. dodecanol glycidyl ether), difunctional (butanediol diglycidyl ether), or higher functionality (e.g. trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether). These resins typically display low viscosity at room temperature (10-200 mPa.s) and are often referred to as [[reactive diluent]]s. They are rarely used alone, but are rather employed to modify (reduce) the viscosity of other epoxy resins. This has led to the term \u2018modified epoxy resin\u2019 to denote those containing viscosity-lowering reactive diluents.\n\n===Glycidylamine ===\nGlycidylamine epoxy resins are higher functionality epoxies which are formed when aromatic amines are reacted with epichlorohydrin. Important industrial grades are triglycidyl-''p''-aminophenol (functionality 3) and ''N'',''N'',''N''\u2032,''N''\u2032-tetraglycidyl-bis-(4-aminophenyl)-methane (functionality 4). The resins are low to medium viscosity at room temperature, which makes them easier to process than EPN or ECN resins. This coupled with high reactivity, plus high temperature resistance and mechanical properties of the resulting cured network makes them important materials for aerospace composite applications.\n\n==Curing==\n[[File:VernetzteEpoxidharze.svg|thumb|320px|right|Structure of a cured epoxy glue. The triamine hardener is shown in red, the resin in black. The resin's epoxide groups have reacted with the hardener and are not present anymore. The material is highly [[crosslink]]ed and contains many OH groups, which confer adhesive properties.]]\nIn general, uncured epoxy resins have only poor mechanical, chemical and heat resistance properties. However, good properties are obtained by reacting the linear epoxy resin with suitable curatives to form three-dimensional cross-linked thermoset structures. This process is commonly referred to as curing or gelation process.<ref name=\"onepetro.org\">Hakiki, Farizal et al. (2015). [https://www.onepetro.org/download/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS?id=conference-paper%2FSPE-176457-MS Is Epoxy-Based Polymer Suitable for Water Shut-Off Application?] SPE-176457-MS. SPE/IATMI Asia Pacific Oil & Gas Conference and Exhibition, 20\u201322 October, Nusa Dua, Bali, Indonesia. doi: [https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-176457-MS 10.2118/176457-MS]</ref> Curing of epoxy resins is an [[exothermic reaction]] and in some cases produces sufficient heat to cause thermal degradation if not controlled.\n\nCuring may be achieved by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a [[copolymer]] with polyfunctional curatives or '''hardeners'''. In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of hardeners for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols. Relative reactivity (lowest first) is approximately in the order: phenol < anhydride < aromatic amine < cycloaliphatic amine < aliphatic amine < thiol.\n\nWhile some epoxy resin/ hardener combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, with temperatures up to {{cvt|150|C}} being common, and up to {{cvt|200|C}} for some specialist systems. Insufficient heat during cure will result in a network with incomplete polymerisation, and thus reduced mechanical, chemical and heat resistance. Cure temperature should typically attain the [[glass transition]] temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties. Temperature is sometimes increased in a step-wise fashion to control the rate of curing and prevent excessive heat build-up from the exothermic reaction.\n\nHardeners which show only low or limited reactivity at ambient temperature, but which react with epoxy resins at elevated temperature are referred to as '''latent hardeners'''. When using latent hardeners, the epoxy resin and hardener may be mixed and stored for some time prior to use, which is advantageous for many industrial processes. Very latent hardeners enable one-component (1K) products to be produced, whereby the resin and hardener are supplied pre-mixed to the end user and only require heat to initiate curing. One-component products generally have shorter shelf-lives than standard 2-component systems, and products may require cooled storage and transport.\n\nThe epoxy curing reaction may be accelerated by addition of small quantities of [[accelerant|accelerators]]. Tertiary amines, carboxylic acids and alcohols (especially phenols) are effective accelerators. Bisphenol A is a highly effective and widely used accelerator, but is now increasingly replaced due to health concerns with this substance.\n\n===Homopolymerisation===\nEpoxy resin may be reacted with itself in the presence of an anionic catalyst (a Lewis base such as tertiary amines or imidazoles) or a cationic catalyst (a Lewis acid such as a boron trifluoride complex) to form a cured network. This process is known as catalytic homopolymerisation. The resulting network contains only ether bridges, and exhibits high thermal and chemical resistance, but is brittle and often requires elevated temperature for the curing process, so finds only niche applications industrially.\nEpoxy homopolymerisation is often used when there is a requirement for UV curing, since cationic UV catalysts may be employed (e.g. for [[UV coating]]s).\n\n===Amines===\nPolyfunctional primary amines form an important class of epoxy hardeners. Primary amines undergo an [[addition reaction]] with the epoxide group to form a hydroxyl group and a secondary amine. The secondary amine can further react with an epoxide to form a tertiary amine and an additional hydroxyl group. Kinetic studies have shown the reactivity of the primary amine to be approximately double that of the secondary amine. Use of a difunctional or polyfunctional amine forms a three-dimensional cross-linked network.\nAliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic amines are all employed as epoxy hardeners. Amine type hardeners will alter both the processing properties (viscosity, reactivity) and the final properties (mechanical, temperature and heat resistance) of the cured copolymer network. Thus amine structure is normally selected according to the application. Overall reactivity potential for different hardeners can roughly be ordered; aliphatic amines > cycloaliphatic amines > aromatic amines, though aliphatic amines with steric hindrance near the amino groups may react as slowly as some of the aromatic amines. Slower reactivity allows longer working times for processors. Temperature resistance generally increases in the same order, since aromatic amines form much more rigid structures than aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines were widely used as epoxy resin hardeners, due to the excellent end properties when mixed with a parent resin. Over the past few decades concern about the possible adverse health effects of many aromatic amines has led to increased use of aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amine alternatives. Amines are also blended, adducted and reacted to alter properties and these amine resins are more often used to cure epoxy resins than a pure amine such as TETA. increasingly, WATER BASED polyamines are also used to help reduce the toxicity profile among other reasons. \n[[File:N1,N1'-(ethane-1,2-diyl)bis(ethane-1,2-diamine) 200.svg|thumb|150px|Structure of [[Triethylenetetramine|TETA]], a typical hardener. The amine (NH2) groups react with the epoxide groups of the resin during polymerisation.]]\n\n===Anhydrides===\nEpoxy resins may be cured with cyclic anhydrides at elevated temperatures. Reaction occurs only after opening of the anhydride ring, e.g. by secondary hydroxyl groups in the epoxy resin. A possible side reaction may also occur between the epoxide and hydroxyl groups, but this may suppressed by addition of tertiary amines.\nThe low viscosity and high latency of anhydride hardeners makes them suitable for processing systems which require addition of mineral fillers prior to curing, e.g. for high voltage electrical insulators.\n\n===Phenols===\nPolyphenols, such as bisphenol A or novolacs can react with epoxy resins at elevated temperatures ({{cvt|130|-|180|C|disp=comma}}), normally in the presence of a catalyst. The resulting material has ether linkages and displays higher chemical and oxidation resistance than typically obtained by curing with amines or anhydrides. Since many novolacs are solids, this class of hardeners is often employed for [[powder coating]]s.\n\n===Thiols===\nAlso known as mercaptans, thiols contain a sulfur which reacts very readily with the epoxide group, even at ambient or sub-ambient temperatures. While the resulting network does not typically display high temperature or chemical resistance, the high reactivity of the thiol group makes it useful for applications where heated curing is not possible, or very fast cure is required e.g. for domestic DIY adhesives and chemical [[rock bolt]] [[Anchor bolt|anchors]]. Thiols have a characteristic odour, which can be detected in many two-component household adhesives.\n\n==History==\nCondensation of epoxides and amines was first reported and patented by Paul Schlack of Germany in 1934.<ref>P.

Castan's work was licensed by [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|Ciba]], Ltd. of Switzerland, which went on to become one of the three major epoxy resin producers worldwide. Ciba's epoxy business was spun off as Vantico in the late 1990s, which was subsequently sold in 2003 and became the Advanced Materials [[strategic business unit|business unit]] of [[Huntsman Corporation]] of the United States. In 1946, Sylvan Greenlee, working for the Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds Company, patented resin derived from bisphenol-A and epichlorohydrin.<ref>{{cite patent |country= US |inventor= Sylvan Owen Greenlee |assignee= DeVoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds |number= 2456408 |gdate= 1948-12-14 |title= Synthetic drying compositions }}</ref> Devoe&nbsp;&&nbsp;Raynolds, which was active in the early days of the epoxy resin industry, was sold to [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell Chemical]]; the division involved in this work was eventually sold, and via a series of other corporate transactions is now part of [[Hexion Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://epoxyflooringtech.com/history-of-epoxy-resin/|title=History of Epoxy Resin|website=epoxyflooringtech.com}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe applications for epoxy-based materials are extensive and include coatings, [[adhesive]]s and [[composite material]]s such as those using [[carbon fiber]] and [[fiberglass]] reinforcements (although [[polyester]], [[vinyl ester resin|vinyl ester]], and other [[thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] [[resin]]s are also used for glass-reinforced plastic). The chemistry of epoxies and the range of commercially available variations allows cure polymers to be produced with a very broad range of properties. In general, epoxies are known for their excellent adhesion, chemical and heat resistance, good-to-excellent mechanical properties and very good [[Insulator (electrical)|electrical insulating]] properties. Many properties of epoxies can be modified (for example [[silver]]-filled epoxies with good [[electrical conductivity]] are available, although epoxies are typically electrically insulating). Variations offering high thermal insulation, or thermal conductivity combined with high electrical resistance for electronics applications, are available.<ref>{{cite book|last=May |first=Clayton A. |title=Epoxy Resins: Chemistry and Technology|publisher=Marcel Dekker Inc|location=New York|date=1987-12-23|edition=Second|page=794|isbn=0-8247-7690-9}}</ref>\n\nAs with other classes of thermoset polymer materials, blending different grades of epoxy resin, as well as use of additives, plasticizers or fillers is common to achieve the desired processing or final properties, or to reduce cost. Use of blending, additives and fillers is often referred to as '''formulating''' (see: [[formulation]].\n\n=== Paints and coatings ===\nTwo part epoxy coatings were developed for heavy duty service on metal substrates and use less energy than heat-cured [[powder coating]]s. These systems provide a tough, protective coating with excellent hardness. One part epoxy coatings are formulated as an emulsion in water, and can be cleaned up without solvents.\n\nEpoxy coatings are often used in industrial and automotive applications since they are more heat resistant than latex-based and alkyd-based paints. Epoxy paints tend to deteriorate, known as \"chalking out\", due to UV exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last= Bayliss |first= D.A. |title= Steelwork corrosion control |year= 2002 |publisher= Spon |location= London |isbn= 978-0-415-26101-2 |pages= 13.6.6 Chalking |edition= 2nd |author2=Deacon, D.H.}}</ref>\n\n[[Polyester]] epoxies are used as [[powder coating]]s for washers, driers and other \"white goods\". [[Fusion bonded epoxy coating|Fusion Bonded Epoxy Powder Coatings]] (FBE) are extensively used for corrosion protection of steel pipes and fittings used in the oil and gas industry, potable water transmission pipelines (steel), and concrete reinforcing [[rebar]]. Epoxy coatings are also widely used as [[Primer (paint)|primers]] to improve the adhesion of automotive and marine paints especially on metal surfaces where [[corrosion]] (rusting) resistance is important. Metal cans and containers are often coated with epoxy to prevent rusting, especially for foods like tomatoes that are [[acid]]ic.\n\nEpoxy resins have several flooring applcations. They are used for protection again mechanical wear, chemical attack and thermal stressing in places such as industrial facilities, car parks or retail establishments. They can also have decorative applications, such as [[terrazzo]] flooring, chip flooring, and colored aggregate flooring.\n\nEpoxies were modified in a variety of ways, Reacted with fatty acids derived from oils to yield epoxy esters, which were cured the same way as alkyds . Typical ones were L8(80% linseed, D4 (40% Dehydrated castor oil). These were often reacted with styrene to make styrenated epoxy esters, used as primers. Curing with phenolics to make drum linings, curing esters with amine resins and pre-curing epoxies with amino resins to make resistant top coats. \nOne of the best examples was a system of using solvent free epoxies for priming ships during construction, this used a system of hot airless spray with premixing at the head. This obviated the problem of solvent retention under the film, which caused adhesion problems later on.\n\n=== Adhesives ===<!-- [[Epoxy adhesive]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Titan epoxy.jpg|thumb|right|Special epoxy is strong enough to withstand the forces between a [[surfboard]] fin and the fin mount. This epoxy is waterproof and capable of [[Curing (chemistry)|curing]] underwater. The blue-coloured epoxy on the left is still undergoing curing.]]\n\nEpoxy [[adhesive]]s are a major part of the class of adhesives called \"structural adhesives\" or \"engineering adhesives\" (that includes [[polyurethane]], [[Acryloyl group|acrylic]], [[cyanoacrylate]], and other chemistries.) These high-performance adhesives are used in the construction of aircraft, automobiles, bicycles, boats, golf clubs, skis, snowboards, and other applications where high strength bonds are required. Epoxy adhesives can be developed to suit almost any application. They can be used as adhesives for wood, metal, glass, stone, and some plastics. They can be made flexible or rigid, [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] or [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]]/colored, fast setting or slow setting. Epoxy adhesives are better in heat and chemical resistance than other common adhesives. In general, epoxy adhesives cured with heat will be more heat- and chemical-resistant than those cured at room temperature. The strength of epoxy adhesives is degraded at temperatures above {{convert|350|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name='jjmorena'>{{cite book|last=Morena |first=John J |title=Advanced Composite Mold Making|publisher=Van Nostrand Reinhold Co.

Such epoxies are commonly used in [[optics]], [[optical fiber|fiber optics]], and [[optoelectronics]].\n\nRecent  developments are coatings for onshore, marine and offshore protection, as well as shipping containers. Traditionally solvent-borne, solvent-free or high-solids, state of the art products are waterborne epoxy systems to protect customers' metal assets from corrosion. This includes waterborne epoxy resin system for making zinc-rich primers.\n\n=== Industrial tooling and composites ===\nEpoxy systems are used in industrial tooling applications to produce [[Molding (process)|molds]], master models, [[laminate]]s, [[casting]]s, [[Fixture (tool)|fixtures]], and other industrial production aids. This \"plastic tooling\" replaces metal, wood and other traditional materials, and generally improves the efficiency and either lowers the overall cost or shortens the lead-time for many industrial processes. Epoxies are also used in producing fiber-reinforced or composite parts. They are more expensive than polyester resins and [[vinyl ester resin]]s, but usually produce stronger and more temperature-resistant [[thermoset polymer matrix]] composite parts.\n\n[[File:Nicholas-doherty-pONBhDyOFoM-unsplash.jpg|thumb|Offshore Wind Farm]]\n=== Wind turbine composites ===\nEpoxy resins are used as bonding matrix along with glass or carbon fiber fabrics to produce composites with very high strength to weight characteristics, allowing longer and more efficient rotor blades to be produced. In addition, for offshore and onshore wind energy installations, epoxy resins are used as protective coatings on steel towers, base struts and concrete foundations. Aliphatic polyurethane top coats are applied on top to ensure full UV protection, prolong operational lifetimes and lowering maintenance costs. Electric generators, connected via the drivetrain with the rotor blades, convert mechanical wind energy in usable electric energy, and rely on epoxies electrical insulation and high thermal resistance properties. The same applies to transformers, bushings, spacers, and composites cables connecting the windmills to the grid In Europe, wind energy components account for the largest segment of epoxy applications, about 27% of the market.<ref name=socio2013>[https://epoxy-europe.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Epoxy_Socioeconomic_Study_Main_Findings_August-2017.pdf Epoxy Resins Committee > Socioeconomic Analysis] 2013</ref>\n\n===Leisure and marine===\nHigh strength and weight reduction are the main performance criteria for manufacturers of sport components. Skis, snowboards, surf and kite boards are fiber reinforced epoxy applications. Epoxy resin systems in combination with multi-axial, unidirectional, woven fabrics and variety of core materials play also a key role to manufacture high performance boats, yachts and commercial and military vessels. \n[https://www.thoughtco.com/composite-materials-in-boats-820410/ composite boats]\n\nEpoxies are sold in hardware stores, typically as a pack containing separate resin and hardener, which must be mixed immediately before use. They are also sold in boat shops as repair resins for marine applications. Epoxies typically are not used in the outer layer of a boat because they deteriorate by exposure to [[UV]] light. They are often used during boat repair and assembly, and then over-coated with conventional or two-part polyurethane paint or marine-varnishes that provide UV protection.\n\nThere are two main areas of marine use. Because of the better mechanical properties relative to the more common [[polyester resins]], epoxies are used for commercial manufacture of components where a high strength/weight ratio is required. The second area is that their strength, gap filling properties and excellent adhesion to many materials including timber have created a boom in amateur building projects including aircraft and boats.\n\nNormal [[gelcoat]] formulated for use with [[polyester]] resins and vinylester resins does not adhere to epoxy surfaces, though epoxy adheres very well if applied to polyester resin surfaces. \"Flocoat\" that is normally used to coat the interior of polyester fibreglass yachts is also compatible with epoxies.\n\nEpoxy materials tend to harden somewhat more gradually, while polyester materials tend to harden quickly, particularly if a lot of catalyst is used.<ref>Hakiki, F., Nuraeni, N., Salam, D.D., Aditya, W., Akbari, A., Mazrad, Z.A.I. and Siregar, S. [http://archives.datapages.com/data/ipa_pdf/2015/ipa15-se-025.htm Preliminary Study on Epoxy-Based Polymer for Water Shut-Off Application]. Paper IPA15-SE-025. Proceeding of The 39th IPA Conference and Exhibition, Jakarta, Indonesia, May 2015.</ref> The chemical reactions in both cases are exothermic. Large quantities of mix will generate their own heat and greatly speed the reaction, so it is usual to mix small amounts which can be used quickly.\n\nWhile it is common to associate polyester resins and epoxy resins, their properties are sufficiently different that they are properly treated as distinct materials. Polyester resins are typically low strength unless used with a reinforcing material like glass fibre, are relatively brittle unless reinforced, and have low adhesion. Epoxies, by contrast, are inherently strong, somewhat flexible and have excellent adhesion. However, polyester resins are much cheaper.\n\nEpoxy resins typically require a precise mix of two components which form a third chemical. Depending on the properties required, the ratio may be anything from 1:1 or over 10:1, but in every case they must be mixed exactly. The final product is then a precise thermo-setting plastic. Until they are mixed the two elements are relatively inert, although the 'hardeners' tend to be more chemically active and should be protected from the atmosphere and moisture. The rate of the reaction can be changed by using different hardeners, which may change the nature of the final product, or by controlling the temperature.\n\nBy contrast, polyester resins are usually made available in a 'promoted' form, such that the progress of previously-mixed resins from liquid to solid is already underway, albeit very slowly. The only variable available to the user is to change the rate of this process using a catalyst, often Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone-Peroxide ([[MEKP]]), which is very toxic. The presence of the catalyst in the final product actually detracts from the desirable properties, so that small amounts of catalyst are preferable, so long as the hardening proceeds at an acceptable pace. The rate of cure of polyesters can therefore be controlled by the amount and type of catalyst as well as by the temperature.\n\nAs adhesives, epoxies bond in three ways: a) Mechanically, because the bonding surfaces are roughened; b) by proximity, because the cured resins are physically so close to the bonding surfaces that they are hard to separate; c) ionically, because the epoxy resins form ionic bonds at an atomic level with the bonding surfaces. This last is substantially the strongest of the three. By contrast, polyester resins can only bond using the first two of these, which greatly reduces their utility as adhesives and in marine repair.\n\n=== Aerospace ===\nIn the aerospace industry, epoxy is used as a structural matrix material which is then reinforced by fiber. Typical fiber reinforcements include [[glass]], [[carbon]], [[Kevlar]], and [[boron]].\nEpoxies are also used as a structural [[glue]]. Materials like [[wood]], and others that are 'low-tech' are glued with epoxy resin. Epoxies generally out-perform most other resin types in terms of mechanical properties and resistance to environmental degradation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://netcomposites.com/guide/resin-systems/epoxy-resins/ |title=Epoxy Resins |website=netcomposites.com |language=en |access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\nGlider and small aircraft designers considered epoxy based composites in an early date.

The use of composite leaf springs in particular in light trucks increases the cargo load. [https://www.compositesworld.com/articles/composite-leaf-springs-saving-weight-in-production-suspension-systems/ Composite LEaf Springs]  50 % mass reduction is achievable when replacing steel for the manufacture of coil springs by fiber reinforced Epoxy.  New generation, in particular of electrically driven cars, require chassis and other significant load bearing structures made from CFRP. But, mass-production requires adequate automotive manufacturing. Traditionally, the poly-addition reaction of epoxy with curatives is more time consuming than metal forming or unsaturated polyester cure. But fast processing and higher thermo-mechanical resistance is required. In numbers, coming from low double digit minutes for cure to single digits and increasing the thermo-mechanical resistance from 130\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C and higher.

Such epoxy resin formulations are relevant to the electrical and electronics industry in voltage ranges from 400 kV down to  >1V.The purpose of the products is to insulate, protect or shield the environment from electric current or the devices from the environment. Formulated bisphenol-based epoxy resins, cured with dicarboxylic anhydrides or amines are used for indoor applications. Cycloaliphatic epoxy resins, preferably 1,2-Cyclohexanedicarboxylic acid, bis(2,3-epoxypropyl) ester, in combination with cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic anhydrides and silanised silica flour are the base for outdoor-resistant electrical insulation, e.g. production of insulators, bushings, instrument transformers.\nMost common processing technologies are Vacuum Pressure Impregnation for power generators, Vacuum Casting and Automatic Pressure Gelation  for medium voltage equipment and potting under vacuum for e.g. ignition coils and small transformers or potting under ambient pressure for e.g. capacitors.\n\nEpoxy resins are applied using the technology of [[resin dispensing]].\n\n===Electronics===\n[[File:Hybridcircuit.jpg|thumb|An epoxy [[conformal coating|encapsulated]] [[hybrid circuit]] on a [[printed circuit board]].]]\nIn the electronics industry epoxy resins are the primary resin used in overmolding [[integrated circuit]]s, [[transistor]]s and [[hybrid circuit]]s and making [[printed circuit boards]]. The largest volume type of circuit board\u2014an \"[[FR-4]] board\"\u2014is a sandwich of layers of glass cloth bonded into a composite by an epoxy resin. Epoxy resins are used to bond copper foil to circuit board substrates, and are a component of the solder mask on many circuit boards. Since these applications require self-extinguishing properties, flame retardant epoxy resins or epoxy formulations with flame retardant additives are utilized.\n\n=== Petroleum and petrochemical ===\nEpoxies can be used to plug selective layers in a reservoir which are producing excessive brine.

The epoxy resin market is dominated by the Asia-Pacific region. China is the major producer and consumer globally, contributing to almost 50% of the global resin global capacity in 2018. The global market is made up of approximately 50\u2013100 manufacturers of basic or commodity epoxy resins and hardeners. In Europe, the largest markets for epoxy resins are Germany, Italy, France and the UK.\n\nThese commodity epoxy [[Manufacturing|manufacturers]] mentioned above typically do not sell epoxy resins in a form usable to smaller end users, so there is another group of companies that purchase epoxy raw materials from the major producers and then compounds (blends, modifies, or otherwise customizes) epoxy systems from these [[raw material]]s. These companies are known as \"formulators\". The majority of the epoxy systems sold are produced by these formulators and they comprise over 60% of the dollar value of the epoxy market. There are hundreds of ways that these formulators can modify epoxies\u2014by adding [[mineral]] fillers ([[talc]], [[silica]], [[alumina]], etc.), by adding flexibilizers, [[viscosity]] reducers, [[colorant]]s, thickeners, accelerators, [[adhesion]] promoters, etc. These modifications are made to reduce costs, to improve performance, and to improve processing convenience. As a result, a typical formulator sells dozens or even thousands of formulations\u2014each tailored to the requirements of a particular application or market.\n\nThe raw materials for epoxy resin production are today largely [[petroleum]] derived, although some plant derived sources are now becoming commercially available (e.g. plant derived glycerol used to make [[epichlorohydrin]]).\n\n== Health risks ==\n\nThe primary risk associated with epoxy use is often related to the hardener component and not to the epoxy resin itself. Amine hardeners in particular are generally [[corrosive]], but may also be classed as [[toxic]] or [[carcinogenic/mutagenic]]. Aromatic amines present a particular health hazard (most are known or suspected carcinogens), but their use is now restricted to specific industrial applications, and safer aliphatic or cycloaliphatic amines are commonly employed.\nAnother group of hardeners which have come into the regulatory focus over recent years are dicarboxylic anhydrides, namely Hexahydropthalic-Anhydride (HHPA) and Methyl-Hexahydrophthalic-Anhydride (m-HHPA). Both substances have been identified under REACH as substances of equivalent concern due to the potential risk of respiratory sensitization. This SVHC identification implies that both substances are listed on the REACH candidate list for further regulatory measures.\nLiquid epoxy resins in their uncured state are mostly classed as [[irritant]] to the eyes and skin, as well as toxic to aquatic organisms. Solid epoxy resins are generally safer than liquid epoxy resins, and many are classified non-hazardous materials. One particular risk associated with epoxy resins is sensitization. The risk has been shown to be more pronounced in epoxy resins containing low molecular weight epoxy diluents.[21] Exposure to epoxy resins can, over time, induce an [[allergic reaction]]. Sensitization generally occurs due to repeated exposure (e.g. through poor working hygiene or lack of protective equipment) over a long period of time. Allergic reaction sometimes occurs at a time which is delayed several days from the exposure. Allergic reaction is often visible in the form of [[dermatitis]], particularly in areas where the exposure has been highest (commonly hands and forearms). There is some incidence that use of epoxy resin systems may cause sensitizer-induced occupational asthma in some exposed workers. However, this may apply to specific application technologies, e.g. spray application, insufficient use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the use of volatile components, e.g. amine-based curing agents. Most epoxy resins have due to their high(er) molecular weight a low vapor pressure, thus do not vaporize easily.  \n[[Bisphenol-A]], which is a major building block to manufacture Bis-A- epoxy resins, has been identified as an endocrine disruptor for human health and the environment under REACH. The concept of endocrine disruption is not without controversy within the scientific community. Substances which are typically quoted in the context of endocrine disruption are xeno- and phytoestrogens, i.e. substances which mimic the effects of the human female sex hormone estrogen. The strength of a physiological response to natural estrogen or xenoestrogen is dependent on the affinity to bind to estrogen receptors on the cell surface of target organs or tissues. Human estrogen has a high binding affinity to estrogen receptors and thus elicits a physiological response at very low concentrations at nanomolar or sub-nanomolar level.\nXeno- or phytoestrogens however, have a much lower binding affinity to the estrogen receptors and as such require a much higher concentration to elicit a similar physiological response as natural estrogen. The uptake of such concentrations via food ingestion does not seem plausible for most xenoestrogens such as BPA, as it would require ingesting vast quantities of canned food stuffs or beverages to induce an appreciable effect. Consequently, the risk of adverse effects for BPA exposure via a normal diet is considered to be relatively insignificant.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Thermosetting polymer]]\n* [[Thermoset polymer matrix]]\n* [[Plastic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wiktionary}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060220105252/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm Epoxy Resin health hazards] (California Department of Health Services) 21 April 2008 @ [[Wayback Machine]] [https://epoxi.es/2HfHeiX https://web.archive.org/web/20080421095718/http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ohb/HESIS/epoxy.htm]\n* [http://pslc.ws/macrog/epoxy.htm The chemistry of epoxide], simple to understand\n\n<!-- LocalWords: catalyzing epoxies -->\n\n[[Category:Organic polymers]]\n[[Category:Adhesives]]\n[[Category:Synthetic resins]]\n[[Category:Thermosetting plastics]]\n\n[[da:Kunstharpiks]]\n", "name_user": "HGChemEng", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLeisure and marine", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epoxy"}

They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nDuring the surveillance, the surveillance team observed Reed pulling into driveway of a house of a associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka admitted that he knew Peter Reed through his association with Craig Minogue, Zelinka also admitted that he saw Craig Minogue pulling into the garage of Zelinka's home in a Commodore identical to the bomb car. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home. Zelinka then admitted that Craig Minogue had told him to grab the lid of Zelinka's metal rubbish bin and put it on the a pile in the trailer. When the detectives asked about the pile in the trailer, Zelinka admitted that the Minogue Brothers took the pile in the trailer to a rubbish tip.   \n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In 1961, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.

They called Miller's office five times, the detectives traced the calls coming from a series of public phone boxes in the [[St. Kilda, Victoria | St. Kilda]] area. In an attempt to get the caller to make contact, Miller and Victoria's Premier[[John Cain (41st Premier of Victoria) | John Cain]] announced the $500,000 as a reward. The caller was later identified as 38 year-old industrial chemist; Vladimir Rhychta who was arrested while calling Miller's office from a public phone box by a St. Kilda detective on 16 April 1986 and charged with hindering a police investigation as it was found that Rhychta's information was false.<ref name=\"Foresnic\">''Forensic Investigators'' - ''S02 Ep06 Russell Street Bombing''</ref><ref>[http://www.timetoast.com/timelines/the-events-of-the-russell-street-bombing The Events of the Russell Street Bombing], timetoast.com</ref>\n\nThe taskforce then received information from a second witness who stated that they seen a male suspect parking a Commodore identical to the bomb car in front of the Russell Street Police HQ at around 12:30pm on the day of the bombing, the witness' description was enough to provide detectives with an [[identikit]] picture of the suspect, the identikit matched the description of career criminal; Claudio Crupi. Crupi was a career armed robber who had a hatred towards police, prior to the bombing, Crupi had been charged with a burglary and was on bail.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/the-day-terror-came-to-melbourne-the-russell-street-bombing-30-years-on-and-the-murder-of-angela-taylor-20160223-gn15xs.html|title=The day terror came to Melbourne: The Russell Street Bombing 30 years on and the murder of Angela Taylor|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2016-02-23|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref> Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, in a raid on Crupi's home, taskforce detectives found a homemade device on Crupi's kitchen table, making him a prime suspect, He was later arrested in Sydney on 15 April 1986. Under police questioning, Crupi denied that he had any involvement in the bombing but admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street. Crupi also stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria |Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria |East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria |St. Albans]] where he had stolen another car from a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a backpack, containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria |Victorian number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997, came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A |VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in[[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at[[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number |VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed (born Peter Komiazyk). Reed was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in matters relating to several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\nDuring the surveillance, the surveillance team observed Reed pulling into driveway of a house of a associate on Haros Street in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Police checks on the house identified the associate as Karl Zelinka, while Zelinka had no criminal background, he was known to Reed who visited Zelinka on multiple occasions.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided Zelinka's house, evidence recovered from the house matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, Zelinka (who had no criminal record) admitted that he saw Craig Minogue drive a Commodore identical to the one used in the bombing into the garage of the Zelinka's home. Zelinka also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for Zelinka and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney for the Easter Holiday just before the bombing occurred with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. Zelinka then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue brothers filling up a small trailer and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from Zelinka's home.\n\nZelinka then told the detectives that while the Minogue brothers were staying at his home, they were visited multiple on several occasions before the bombing by an associate known to Craig Minogue. Zelinka described the associate as a older male aged about 50 and was referred to as \"Stan the Man\", Zelinka's description of \"Stan the Man\" matched to armed robber; Stanley Brian Taylor. Stan Taylor had a extensive criminal record dating back to 1946 when at the age of 8, he was arrested for truancy and sent to Bayswater Boys Home at [[The Basin, Victoria | The Basin]] for two years. In 1949, he was arrested for fishing in prohibited area. During his young adult years, Taylor had been convicted of theft of motorcycles and burglary. In the early 1960s, Taylor was convicted of a armed robbery on a [[Milk bar | milk bar]] in [[Clayton, Victoria | Clayton]] and was sent to [[HM Prison Pentridge | Pentridge's]] notorious H Division where met [[Ronald Ryan]]; the last man hanged in Australia. Ryan had asked Taylor to accompanied him on his escape but Taylor refused. Instead, Taylor and another prisoner escaped from Pentridge, while on the run, Taylor committed seven bank robberies over a period of five days before being recaptured and sent back to prison.      \n\nWhile in prison, Taylor became a model prisoner and was released in 1978. After his release, Taylor became a social worker to help young men avoid a life of crime. Taylor was also a bit actor, in 1979, he starred in an episode of [[Prisoner (TV series) | Prisoner]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/russell-street-bomber-the-dying-embers-of-hate-20150611-ghlatl.html|title=Russell Street Bomber: the dying embers of hate|last=Silvester|first=John|date=2015-06-11|work=The Age|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nDetectives arrested Taylor at his home in [[Birchip, Victoria | Birchip]] on the 30 May 1986. Under questioning, Taylor claimed that he had no involvement in the bombing and that knew Craig and Rodney Minogue through his job as a social worker and he met them to prevent them from getting involved in any crime, but admitted that both Craig and Rodney Minogue and Peter Reed were responsible for the Russell Street Bombing.\n\nDetectives then ran a search for Craig and Rodney Minogue and found that they moved into a house within close distance of Taylor's home in Birchip, a raid on the house failed to locate the Minogue Brother but turned up evidence linking them to Russell Street Bombing. At the house, detectives recovered an large drill machine that matched to the drill marks on both the stolen silver Commodore and on the bomb car.\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nProsecutors did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing fingerprints belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing. Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (i.e. never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.

When quark\u2013gluon plasma disassembles into [[hadron]]s in a breakup process, the high availability of strange [[quark|antiquarks]] helps to produce antimatter containing multiple strange quarks, which is otherwise rarely made.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s. After this brief time the hot drop of quark plasma evaporates in a process called [[hadronization]]. This is so since practically all QGP components flow out at relativistic speed. In this way, it is possible to study conditions akin to those in the early Universe at the age of 10\u201340 microseconds.\n\n[[QCD matter#Laboratory experiments|Discovery]] of this new QGP [[state of matter]] has been announced both at [[CERN]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abbott|first=Alison|year=2000|title=CERN claims first experimental creation of quark\u2013gluon plasma|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/35001196|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=403|issue=6770|pages=581|doi=10.1038/35001196|pmid=10688162|bibcode=2000Natur.403..581A|issn=0028-0836|via=|doi-access=free}}</ref> and at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (BNL).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacak|first=Barbara|last2=Steinberg|first2=Peter|year=2010|title=Creating the perfect liquid in heavy-ion collisions|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=39\u201343|doi=10.1063/1.3431330|bibcode=2010PhT....63e..39J|issn=0031-9228}}</ref> At this time comprehensive experimental evidence about its properties is being assembled.

Therefore, any strange quarks or antiquarks observed in experiments have been \"freshly\" made from the kinetic energy of colliding nuclei. Conveniently, the [[mass]] of strange quarks and antiquarks is equivalent to the temperature or energy at which protons, neutrons and other [[hadron]]s dissolve into quarks. This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

The [[ALICE experiment]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity, the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) as the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) that requires two pairs minimum to be made.

ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume\u2014there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead, this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions remains an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.

This gas is called a ''[[quark\u2013gluon plasma]]'' (QGP), since the quark-interaction charge ([[color charge]]) is mobile and quarks and gluons move around. This is possible because at a high temperature the early universe is in a different [[vacuum decay|vacuum state]], in which normal matter cannot exist but quarks and gluons can, they are [[deconfinement|deconfined]] (able to exist independently as separate unbound particles). In order to recreate this [[deconfinement|deconfined]] [[Phase (matter)|phase of matter]] in the laboratory it is necessary to exceed a minimum temperature, or its equivalent, a minimum [[energy density]]. Scientists achieve this using [[Relativistic nuclear collisions|particle collisions]] at extremely high speeds, where the energy released in the collision can raise the subatomic particles' energies to an exceedingly high level, sufficient for them to briefly form a tiny amount of quark-gluon plasma which can be studied in laboratory experiments for little more than the time light needs to cross the QGP fireball, thus about 10<sup>\u221222</sup> s.

This means that the abundance of strange quarks is sensitive to the conditions, structure and dynamics of the deconfined matter phase, and if their number is large it can be assumed that deconfinement conditions were reached.

The energy at RHIC is 11 times greater in the CM frame of reference compared to the earlier CERN work. The important result is that enhancement observed by STAR also increases with the number of participating nucleons. We further note that for the most peripheral events at the smallest number of participants, copper and gold systems show at the same number of participants the same enhancement as could be expected.\n\nAnother remarkable feature of these results comparing CERN and STAR is that the enhancement is of similar magnitude for the vastly different energy available in the reaction. This near energy independence of the enhancement also agrees with the quark\u2013gluon plasma approach regarding the mechanism of production of these particles and confirms that a quark\u2013gluon plasma is created over a wide range of collision energies, very probably once a minimal energy threshold is exceeded.\n\n==ALICE: Resolution of remaining questions about strangeness as signature  of quark-gluon plasma==\n[[File:AliceXiPhiRev.png|thumb |280px| LHC-ALICE results for (\\bar{\\Xi}+\\Xi/\\phi) obtained inthree different collision systems at highest available energy as function of charged hadronmultiplicity produced.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Sushanta|year=2019|title=Energy dependence of \u03d5(1020) production at mid-rapidity in pp collisions with ALICE at the LHC|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947418302665|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=982|pages=180\u2013182|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.09.078|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tripathy|first=Sushanta|date=2019-07-01|title=An insight into strangeness with $\\phi$(1020) production in small to large collision systems with ALICE at the LHC|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00842|journal=arXiv:1907.00842 [hep-ex, physics:nucl-ex]}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Alice1807StrangeY.png|thumb|280px|Universal dependence of <math>p(uud)+\\bar{p}(\\bar{u}\\bar{u}\\bar{d}),</math><math> K_s(d\\bar{s}+\\bar{d}s),</math><math> \\Lambda(uds)+\\bar{\\Lambda}(\\bar{u}\\bar{d}\\bar{s}), \\phi(s\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Xi^-(dss)+\\bar{\\Xi}^+(\\bar{d}\\bar{s}\\bar{s}),</math><math> \\Omega(sss)+\\bar{\\Omega}(\\bar{s}\\bar{s}\\bar{s})</math> multiplicities (scaled by yield of <math>\\pi^++\\pi^-</math>) obtained in p-p, p-A and A-A by LHC-ALICE experiment at LHC collision energies indicated.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Albuquerque|first=D.S.D.|year=2019|title=Hadronic resonances, strange and multi-strange particle production in Xe-Xe and Pb-Pb collisions with ALICE at the LHC|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0375947418301775|journal=Nuclear Physics A|language=en|volume=982|pages=823\u2013826|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2018.08.033|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|year=2020|title=Discovery of Quark-Gluon Plasma: Strangeness Diaries|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1140/epjst/e2019-900263-x|journal=The European Physical Journal Special Topics|language=en|volume=229|issue=1|pages=1\u2013140|doi=10.1140/epjst/e2019-900263-x|issn=1951-6355|via=}}</ref>]]\nThe very high precision of (strange) particle spectra and large transverse momentum coverage reported by the [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] Collaboration at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) allows in-depth exploration of lingering challenges, which always accompany new physics, and here in particular the questions surrounding strangeness signature. Among the most discussed challenges has been the question if the abundance of particles produced is enhanced or if the comparison base line is suppressed. Suppression is expected when a otherwise absent quantum number, such as strangeness, is rarely produced. This situation was recognized by [[Rolf Hagedorn|Hagedorn]] in his early analysis of particle production<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Rolf|date=|year=1968|title=Statistical thermodynamics of strong interactions at high energies - III : heavy pair(quark) production rates|url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/936485|journal=Nuovo Cimento Suppl.|volume=6|pages=311-354|via=}}</ref> and solved by [[Johann Rafelski|Rafelski]] and Danos.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rafelski|first=Johann|last2=Danos|first2=Michael|year=1980|title=The importance of the reaction volume in hadronic collisions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0370269380906012|journal=Physics Letters B|language=en|volume=97|issue=2|pages=279\u2013282|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(80)90601-2|via=}}</ref> In that work it was shown that even if just a few new pairs of strange particles were produced the effect disappears.

This argument can be resolved by exploring specific sensitive experimental signatures for example the ratio of double strange particles of different type, such yield of <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) compared to <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>). The [[ALICE experiment]] obtained this ratio for several collision systems in a wide range of [[hadronization]] volumes as described by the total produced particle multiplicy. The results show that this ratio assumes the expected value for a large range volumes (two orders of magnitude). At small particle volume or multiplicity, the curve shows the expected reduction: The <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) must be smaller compared to  <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) as the number of produced strange pairs decreases and thus it easier to make <math>\\bar{s}s</math>(<math>\\phi</math>) compared to <math>ssq</math> (<math>\\Xi</math>) that requires two pairs minimum to be made.  However, we also see an increase at very high volume\u2014this is an effect at the level of one-two standard deviations. Similar results were already recognized before by Petran et al..<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petr\u00e1\u0148|first=Michal|last2=Rafelski|first2=Johann|year=2010|title=Multistrange particle production and the statistical hadronization model|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|journal=Physical Review C|language=en|volume=82|issue=1|pages=011901|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.82.011901|issn=0556-2813|via=}}</ref>\n\nAnother highly praised [[ALICE experiment|ALICE]] result<ref name=\":0\" /> is the observation of same strangeness enhancement, not only on AA  (nucleus-nucleus) but also in pA (proton-nucleus) and pp (proton-proton) collisions when the particle production yields are presented as a function of the multiplicity, which as noted corresponds to the available [[hadronization]] volume. ALICE results display a smooth volume dependence of total yield of all studied particles as function of volume\u2014there is no additional \"canonical\" suppression.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is so since the yield of strange pairs in QGP  is sufficiently high and tracks well the expected abundance increase as the volume and lifespan of QGP increases. This increase is incompatible with the hypothesis that for all reaction volumes QGP is always in chemical (yield) equilibrium of strangeness. Instead, this confirms the  theoretical kinetic model proposed by Rafelski and [[Berndt M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]].<ref name=\":4\" /> The production of QGP in pp collisions was not expected by all, but should not be a surprise: the [[onset of deconfinement]] is naturally a function of both energy and collision system size. The fact that at extreme LHC energies we cross this boundary also in experiments with the smallest elementary collision systems, such as pp, confirms the unexpected strength of the processes leading to QGP formation. Onset of deconfinement in pp and other \"small\" system collisions remains an active research topic.\n\nBeyond strangeness the great advantage offered by LHC energy range is the abundant production of charm and bottom flavor. When QGP is formed these quarks are embedded in a high density of strangeness present. This should lead to copious production of exotic heavy particles, for example {{Subatomic particle|Strange D}}.  Other heavy flavor particles, some which have not even been discovered at this time are also likely to appear.<ref>\n{{cite journal|author=I. Kuznetsova|author2=J.

These results are presented as function of the variable called [[rapidity]] which characterizes the speed of the source. The peak of emission indicates that the additionally formed antimatter particles do not originate from the colliding nuclei themselves, but from a source that moves at a speed corresponding to one-half of the rapidity of the incident nucleus that is a common center of momentum frame of reference source formed when both nuclei collide, that is the hot quark\u2013gluon plasma fireball.\n==Horn in <math>K \\rightarrow \\pi </math> ratio and the onset of deconfinement==\n{{See also|Onset of deconfinement}}[[File:NA61-NA49_horn.png|thumb|280px|The ratio of mean multiplicities of positively charged [[kaon]]s and [[pion]]s as a function of collision energy in collisions of two [[lead]] [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and [[proton]]\u2013proton interactions.]]One of most interesting questions is if there is a threshold in reaction energy and/or volume size which needs to be exceeded in order to form a domain in which quarks can move freely.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gazdzicki|first=Marek|last2=Gorenstein|first2=Mark|last3=Seyboth|first3=Peter|year=2020|title=Brief history of the search for critical structures in heavy-ion collisions|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02255|journal=arXiv:2004.02255 [hep-ph, physics:nucl-ex, physics:nucl-th]|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> It is natural to expect that if such a threshold exists the particle yields/ratios we have shown above should indicate that.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Becattini|first=F.|year=2012|title=Strangeness and onset of deconfinement|journal=Physics of Atomic Nuclei|language=en|volume=75|issue=5|pages=646\u2013649|doi=10.1134/S106377881205002X|bibcode=2012PAN....75..646B|issn=1063-7788}}</ref> One of the most accessible signatures would be the relative [[Kaon]] yield ratio.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=N.K.

The theoretical work in this field today focuses on the interpretation of the overall particle production data and the derivation of the resulting properties of the bulk of quark\u2013gluon plasma at the time of breakup.<ref name=\":6\" /> The global description of all produced particles can be attempted based on the picture of hadronizing hot drop of quark\u2013gluon plasma or, alternatively, on the picture of confined and equilibrated hadron matter. In both cases one describes the data within the statistical thermal production model, but considerable differences in detail differentiate the nature of the source of these particles. The experimental groups working in the field also like to develop their own analysis models and the outside observer sees many different analysis results. There are as many as 10\u201315 different particles species which follow the pattern predicted for the QGP as function of reaction energy, reaction centrality, and strangeness content. At yet higher LHC energies saturation of strangeness yield and binding to heavy flavor open new experimental opportunities.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Quark\u2013gluon plasma]]\n* [[Quark matter]]\n* [[Hadronization]]\n* [[Strangelet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{physics-footer}}\n{{Phase of matter}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Strangeness Production}}\n[[Category:Strangeness production| ]]\n[[Category:Strange quark|Production]]\n[[Category:Exotic matter]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Particle physics]]\n[[Category:Phases of matter]]\n[[Category:Plasma physics]]\n[[Category:Quantum chromodynamics]]\n", "name_user": "Bibliophilen", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixed small typo in figure caption.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangeness_production"}

In 1979 the band went on tour supporting the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Stiff Little Fingers]], which had just released an album distributed by [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]].\n\n===1980\u20131989===\nIn 1980, Miller released the single \"Kebab-Tr\u00e4ume\" by the German band [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft]] (D.A.F.), who had recently moved to [[London]]. The band's 1980 album, ''[[Die Kleinen und die B\u00f6sen]]'', was the first album released by the new label.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> The album had the catalogue prefix \"STUMM\", a play on the record label's name, meaning \"[[Muteness|mute]]\" in [[German language|German]]. This prefix was used through most of the label's album catalogue.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nAlso in 1980, Miller recorded and released the cover single \"[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis Tennessee]]\" under the name [[Silicon Teens]]. The band was Miller's realisation of a dream Mute Records group whose main instruments were [[synthesiser]]s. In mid-1980, Mute Records released the Silicon Teens' album, titled ''Music For Parties''.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nAround this time the artist [[Fad Gadget]] had begun recording new [[Demo (music)|demos]], including the track \"Back To Nature\". This was released as a single in 1980, followed by the next single \"[[Ricky's Hand]]\" and the album ''[[Fireside Favourites]]'' recorded at [[Blackwing Studios]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n[[File:Mute records.jpg|left|thumb|Previous logo.]]\nSeptember 1980 saw the release of the double-holed, multi-speed [[Gramophone record|7\" single]] by Non & Smegma, one of the first experimental noise releases from the label. [[Boyd Rice]] (Non) went on to release several more recordings with Mute Records.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> After touring with Daniel Miller as [[Robert Rental]] & [[The Normal]], Robert Rental released his only Mute Records single, \"Double Heart\", a rare remaining trace of this late [[electronic music]] pioneer.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nMiller approached [[Depeche Mode]] in 1980, after seeing them perform in London, wanting them to record a single for his label; that first single was \"[[Dreaming of Me]]\".<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Emerging out of the British electronic pop scene, Depeche Mode quickly asserted themselves as a radio-friendly pop group, and they had hits with their next three singles, including the [[UK Singles Chart|UK top ten]] single \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\". Their loyalty to Mute was reciprocated by the label's rapid expansion to cope with their success. In defiance of the major record labels' predictions of failure, Depeche Mode became successful worldwide,<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> even after the departure of principal songwriter [[Vince Clarke]].

It has featured several prominent musical acts on its roster such as [[Depeche Mode]], [[Erasure]], [[Fad Gadget]], [[Goldfrapp]], [[Grinderman]], [[Inspiral Carpets]], [[Moby]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], [[Nitzer Ebb]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[Yeasayer]], [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]], and [[M83 (band)|M83]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\nDuring 1978, [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] began recording music, using synthesisers, under the name [[The Normal]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\">Mute - Documentary Evidence - Biba Kopf 1986</ref> He recorded the tracks \"T.V.O.D.\" and \"[[Warm Leatherette]]\" and distributed them through [[Rough Trade Shops]] under the label name Mute Records.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> The label was formed initially just to release the one single.<ref name=\"Muted response\">Muted Response - Daniel Miller Interview - E&MM 1984</ref> \"T.V.O.D.\"/\"Warm Leatherette\" became a cult hit ensuring the future of the label. \"Warm Leatherette\" was later [[Cover version|covered]] by [[Grace Jones]]<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> and [[Chicks on Speed]] as well as Rose McDowell.\n\nAfter meeting [[Robert Rental]] (who had previously worked with [[Thomas Leer]]), Miller began recording and playing live as Robert Rental & The Normal. In 1979 the band went on tour supporting the [[Punk rock|punk]] band [[Stiff Little Fingers]], which had just released an album distributed by [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]].\n\n===1980\u20131989===\nIn 1980, Miller released the single \"Kebab-Tr\u00e4ume\" by the German band [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft]] (D.A.F.), who had recently moved to [[London]]. The band's 1980 album, ''[[Die Kleinen und die B\u00f6sen]]'', was the first album released by the new label.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> The album had the catalogue prefix \"STUMM\", a play on the record label's name, meaning \"[[Muteness|mute]]\" in [[German language|German]]. This prefix was used through most of the label's album catalogue.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nAlso in 1980, Miller recorded and released the cover single \"[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis Tennessee]]\" under the name [[Silicon Teens]]. The band was Miller's realisation of a dream Mute Records group whose main instruments were [[synthesiser]]s. In mid-1980, Mute Records released the Silicon Teens' album, titled ''Music For Parties''.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nAround this time the artist [[Fad Gadget]] had begun recording new [[Demo (music)|demos]], including the track \"Back To Nature\". This was released as a single in 1980, followed by the next single \"[[Ricky's Hand]]\" and the album ''[[Fireside Favourites]]'' recorded at [[Blackwing Studios]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n[[File:Mute records.jpg|left|thumb|Previous logo.]]\nSeptember 1980 saw the release of the double-holed, multi-speed [[Gramophone record|7\" single]] by Non & Smegma, one of the first experimental noise releases from the label. [[Boyd Rice]] (Non) went on to release several more recordings with Mute Records.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> After touring with Daniel Miller as [[Robert Rental]] & [[The Normal]], Robert Rental released his only Mute Records single, \"Double Heart\", a rare remaining trace of this late [[electronic music]] pioneer.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nMiller approached [[Depeche Mode]] in 1980, after seeing them perform in London, wanting them to record a single for his label; that first single was \"[[Dreaming of Me]]\".<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Emerging out of the British electronic pop scene, Depeche Mode quickly asserted themselves as a radio-friendly pop group, and they had hits with their next three singles, including the [[UK Singles Chart|UK top ten]] single \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (Depeche Mode song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\". Their loyalty to Mute was reciprocated by the label's rapid expansion to cope with their success. In defiance of the major record labels' predictions of failure, Depeche Mode became successful worldwide,<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> even after the departure of principal songwriter [[Vince Clarke]]. [[Martin Gore]] took over the main songwriting role, opening the band up to different influences and sustaining their creativity.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nMute continued to support other experimental artists, such as NON, releasing an album of [[Boyd Rice]]'s pre-NON recordings, titled ''Boyd Rice''.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> 1982 began with the release of the [[12-inch single]], \"Rise\", by Boyd Rice, released under the name NON.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nFad Gadget released his third album for the label, titled ''[[Under the Flag]]'', influenced by the current [[Falklands War]] and the feeling of being British in the most unseemly of times.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> The album spawned the singles \"For Whom the Bells Toll\" and \"Life on the Line\".<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nMute Record's big commercial success of 1982 was the band [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]], the duo of [[Vince Clarke]] and [[Alison Moyet]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> After leaving Depeche Mode, Clarke had set up a studio in the Blackwing Studios complex, where he recorded the singles \"[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]\" and \"[[Don't Go (Yazoo song)|Don\u2019t Go]]\".<ref>E&MM Magazine - March 1984</ref>\nThat year, Mute licensed the single \"Fred Vom Jupiter\" from the German record label Atatak. The track was recorded by [[Holger Hiller]], Andreas Dorau and the schoolgirl Marinas.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Also from Germany was the single \"Los Ninos Del Parque\", by [[Liaisons Dangereuses (band)|Liaisons Dangereuses]], later released by Mute. Liaisons Dangereuses included Chrislo Hass, who had previously been in the German band DAF.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nAfter returning from a world tour in 1983, Depeche Mode released the [[Industrial music|industrial]]-influenced hit single \"[[Everything Counts]]\".<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]], of the band [[Wire (band)|Wire]] (who had been working together under the name [[Dome (band)|Dome]]), teamed up with Daniel Miller to form a project known as Duet Emmo, an [[anagram]] of Mute and Dome. They released an album and 12-inch single, both titled ''Or So It Seems''.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Miller also secured the rights to the back catalogue of the experimental bands [[Throbbing Gristle]], [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]] and [[Richard H. Kirk]]<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\nDuring 1983, the Australian band [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]] transferred from [[4AD]] to Mute Records. The band broke up after releasing their final 12-inch EP, \"Mutiny\".<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Birthday Party's singer, [[Nick Cave]], stayed with Mute and released his debut single as [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]]. The single was a cover of the song \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", by [[Mac Davis]], previously made famous by [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> Yazoo released the album ''[[You and Me Both]]'' that year and disbanded. Vince Clarke then began working at Blackwing Studios under the name [[The Assembly]]. The project's first single, \"[[Never Never (The Assembly song)|Never Never]]\", was a hit, featuring [[Feargal Sharkey]] on vocals.<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" />\n\n[[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft|D.A.F.]] split up, and in 1983, ex-member [[Robert G\u00f6rl]] released the single \"Mit Dir\" on Mute. He recorded the album ''Night Full of Tension'' the following year, including the single \"Darling Don\u2019t Leave Me\", featuring [[Annie Lennox]].<ref name=\"Documentary Evidence\" /> In 1984, Depeche Mode had one of their biggest hits in the UK with the single \"[[People Are People]]\".<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\">Mute - Documentary Evidence (Album Booklet) 1986</ref> Their album that year, ''[[Some Great Reward]]'', reached number one in [[Germany]] and became their first hit in the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\" />\n\nMute released an album of archive material from the German band [[Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten]], titled ''[[Strategies Against Architecture '80\u2013'83]]'', compiled by [[J. G. Thirlwell|Jim Thirlwell]].<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\" /> Mute used [[Berlin]] as a recording location at this time. Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten member [[F.M.

Howard]] (ex-guitarist for The Birthday Party), who also contributed to the 1983 Fad Gadget single \"I Discover Love\".<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\" /> Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten's [[Blixa Bargeld]] began working with Nick Cave at this time, playing guitar with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. The resulting 1984 album, ''[[From Her to Eternity]]'', included a cover of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s song, \"[[Avalanche (Leonard Cohen song)|Avalanche]]\".<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\" />\n\nIn 1984, [[Bruce Gilbert]] extended his field of music into dance after a commission to write music for dancer [[Michael Clark (dancer)|Michael Clark]].<ref name=\"Mego\">Bruce Gilbert \u2013 This Way (Editions Mego) CD sleeve notes.</ref> Gilbert recorded with engineer [[John Fryer (music)|John Fryer]] at Blackwing Studios.<ref name=\"Mego\" /> The recordings were documented by Mute on the album, ''This Way''.<ref name=\"Mute Evidence\" />\n\nThe synth duo [[I Start Counting (band)|I Start Counting]] released their debut single, \"Letters to a Friend\", in June 1984, produced by Daniel Miller.<ref>[http://www.mute.com/releases/viewRelease.jsp?showPrices=false&id=25640 \"Mute Records \u2013 Letters to a Friend\"].

The final HDI is a value between 0 and 1 with countries grouped into four categories depending on the value, very high for HDI of 0.800 and above, high from 0.700 to 0.799, medium from 0.550 to 0.699 and low below 0.550.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Technical notes 2019\">{{cite web |title=Human Development Report 2019 \u2013 Technical notes |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019_technical_notes.pdf |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Human Development Report has been published most years since 1990.

(humanity)|human development]] by combining measurements of [[life expectancy]], [[education]], and [[per capita income]] into the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) in its annual [[Human Development Report]].\n\nThe HDI is a summary index using [[life expectancy at birth]], expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults, and [[GNI per capita]]. The final HDI is a value between 0 and 1 with countries grouped into four categories depending on the value, very high for HDI of 0.800 and above, high from 0.700 to 0.799, medium from 0.550 to 0.699 and low below 0.550.<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Technical notes 2019\">{{cite web |title=Human Development Report 2019 \u2013 Technical notes |url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019_technical_notes.pdf |website=hdr.undp.org |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=23 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Human Development Report has been published most years since 1990.

The report stated that while the HDI remains useful, \"the IHDI is the actual level of human development (accounting for inequality)\" and \"the HDI can be viewed as an index of 'potential' human
