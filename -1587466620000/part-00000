Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters.

However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians.

The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT). A general election took place on 7 August 1967, and the Labour Party and its two allies obtained the majority of seats.

In 1969, the opposition party [[Mauritian Militant Movement]] (MMM) led by [[Paul B\u00e9renger]] was founded.

However, ideological and personality differences emerged within the MMM leadership. The power struggle between B\u00e9renger and Jugnauth peaked in March 1983. Jugnauth travelled to New Delhi to attend a [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit; on his return, B\u00e9renger proposed constitutional changes that would strip power from the Prime Minister. At Jugnauth's request, PM [[Indira Gandhi]] of India planned an armed intervention involving the [[Indian Navy]] and [[Indian Army]] to prevent a [[coup]] under the code name [[Operation Lal Dora]].<ref>{{cite news|title=When India drew Top Secret 'red line' in Mauritius|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/when-india-drew-top-secret-red-line-in-mauritius/article4493495.ece|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=10 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Medcalf|first=Rory|title=When India (Almost) Invaded Mauritius|url=http://thediplomat.com/flashpoints-blog/2013/03/19/when-india-almost-invaded-mauritius/|accessdate=22 March 2013|newspaper=The Diplomat|date=19 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Brewster|url= https://www.academia.edu/7992843|title=India's Ocean: the Story of India's Bid for Regional Leadership}}.

Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the ''Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act'', the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail. This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction in the education sector. There were not enough high-quality secondary colleges to answer the growing demand of primary school leavers who had got through their CPE (Certificate of Primary Education). In 1991, a master plan for education failed to get national support and contributed to the government's downfall.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\n[[Navin Ramgoolam]] was elected as prime minister in 1995.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

Styles and forms introduced by Dutch, French, and British settlers from the seventeenth century onward, mixed with influences from India and East Africa, resulted in a unique hybrid architecture of international historic, social, and artistic significance. Mauritian structures present a variety of designs, materials, and decorative elements that are unique to the country and inform the historical context of the Indian Ocean and European colonialism.<ref name=\"wmf.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wmf.org/project/traditional-architecture-mauritius|title=Traditional Architecture of Mauritius|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDecades of political, social, and economic change have resulted in the routine destruction of Mauritian architectural heritage. Between 1960 and 1980, the historic homes of the island's high grounds, known locally as campagnes, disappeared at alarming rates. More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage. Rising land values are pitted against the cultural value of historic structures in Mauritius, while the prohibitive costs of maintenance and the steady decline in traditional building skills make it harder to invest in preservation.<ref name=\"wmf.org\"/>\n\nThe general populace historically lived in what are termed creole houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vintagemauritius.org/vintage-houses/old-colonial-creole-style-houses-mauritius-part-1/|title=Old Colonial and Creole-Style Houses in Mauritius \u2013 Part 1 \u2013 Vintage Mauritius|date=6 June 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Mauritian literature}}\nProminent Mauritian writers include [[Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Humbert]], [[Malcolm de Chazal]], [[Ananda Devi]], [[Shenaz Patel]], [[Khal Torabully]], [[J.

The Dutch inhabited the island in 1638, from which they exploited [[ebony]] trees and introduced [[sugar cane]], [[domestic animals]] and [[deer]]. It was from here that Dutch navigator [[Abel Tasman]] set out to discover the western part of Australia. The first Dutch settlement lasted twenty years.

Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir, and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]], which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story that made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne) and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref> [[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters.

However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en''), which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves, who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was R\u00e9my Ollier, a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition that was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\n[[File:The web of empire - a diary of the imperial tour of their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York in 1901 (1902) (14763807672).jpg|thumb|Duke and Duchess of [[Duchy of Cornwall|Cornwall]] and [[Duke of York|York]] in Mauritius, 1901]]\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. In fact, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity due to a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, which included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement, which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France were elected in the 1921 elections. In the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, marking the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01 |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref> Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938.

Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled but workers\u2019 salaries increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane. This led to an intense campaign to halt the population explosion, and the decade registered a sharp decline in population growth.\n\n===Independence (since 1968)===\n{{main|Mauritius (1968\u20131992)}}\nAt the Lancaster Conference of 1965, it became clear that Britain wanted to relieve itself of the colony of Mauritius. In 1959, [[Harold Macmillan]] had made his famous ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change Speech]]'' where he acknowledged that the best option for Britain was to give complete independence to its colonies. Thus, since the late Fifties, the way was paved for independence.<ref>{{cite news|title=Why independence was irresistible (by Anand Moheeputh)|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/243359/|newspaper=L'Express|date=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nLater in 1965, after the Lancaster Conference, the [[Chagos Archipelago]] was excised from the territory of Mauritius to form the [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] (BIOT).

Throughout the decade, Anerood Jugnauth ruled the country with the help of the PMSD and the Labour Party.\n\nThat period saw growth in the EPZ (Export Processing Zone) sector. Industrialisation began to spread to villages as well, and attracted young workers from all ethnic communities. As a result, the sugar industry began to lose its hold on the economy. Large retail chains began opening stores in 1985 and offered credit facilities to low-income earners, thus allowing them to afford basic household appliances. There was also a boom in the tourism industry, and new hotels sprang up throughout the island.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the ''Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act'', the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail. This caused a public outcry and the government had to review its policy.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThere was also dissatisfaction in the education sector.

However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the state whether it wishes to subject itself to the court's jurisdiction. Where the state chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the court in a number of ways. The UK's clause deposited at the court excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the court with regard \"to any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\". The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the court on the Chagos dispute because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. When Mauritius threatened to leave the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', thereby quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the court, even if it left.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Before the Portuguese arrival in 1507, there were no terrestrial mammals on the island. This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species. The arrival of humans saw the introduction of invasive alien species, the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna. Less than 2% of the [[Forest|native forest]] now remains, concentrated in the [[Black River Gorges National Park]] in the south-west, the Bambous Mountain Range in the south-east, and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the north-west. There are some isolated mountains, [[Corps de Garde]], [[Le Morne Brabant]], and several [[Islets of Mauritius|offshore islands]], with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity. Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened. Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npcs.govmu.org/English//DOCUMENTS/CHAP1.PDF|title=Chapter 1.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

Considered part of Africa geographically, Mauritius has friendly relations with African states in the region, particularly South Africa, by far its largest continental trading partner. Mauritian investors are gradually entering African markets, notably Madagascar, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The country's political heritage and dependence on Western markets have led to close ties with the [[European Union]] and its member states, particularly France. Relations with India is very strong for both historical and commercial reasons. Mauritius established diplomatic relations with China in April 1972 and was forced to defend this decision, along with naval contracts with the USSR in the same year.\n\nMauritius is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[La Francophonie]], the [[African Union]], the [[Southern Africa Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Indian Ocean Commission]], [[COMESA]], and formed the [[Indian Ocean Rim Association]].\n\n==Legal system==\nMauritius has an hybrid legal system derives from [[British common law]] and the [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Mauritius]] established the [[separation of powers]] between the [[legislature]], the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and the [[judiciary]] and guaranteed the protection of the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual. Mauritius has a single-structured judicial system consisting of two tiers, the [[Supreme Court of Mauritius|Supreme Court]] and subordinate courts. The Supreme Court is composed of various divisions exercising jurisdiction such as the Master's Court, the Family Division, the Commercial Division (Bankruptcy), the Criminal Division, the Mediation Division, the Court of First Instance in civil and criminal proceedings, the Appellate jurisdiction: the Court of Civil Appeal and the Court of Criminal Appeal. Subordinate courts consist of the Intermediate Court, the Industrial Court, the District Courts, the Bail and Remand Court and the Court of Rodrigues. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] is the final court of appeal of Mauritius. After the independence of Mauritius in 1968, Mauritius maintained the Privy Council as its highest court of appeal. Appeals to the Judicial Committee from decisions of the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court may be as of right or with the leave of the Court, as set out in section 81 of the Constitution and section 70A of the Courts Act. The Judicial Committee may also grant special leave to appeal from the decision of any court in any civil or criminal matter as per section 81(5) of the Constitution.<ref name=\"Constitution\">{{Cite web |url=http://mauritiusassembly.govmu.org/English/constitution/Pages/constitution2016.pdf |title=Constitution of Mauritius |date=2019-10-13 |publisher=[[National Assembly (Mauritius)]] |access-date=2019-10-13}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Mauritius population pyramid 2011.svg|thumb|[[Population pyramid]] of Mauritius according to 2011 census]]\n{{main|Demographics of Mauritius|Religion in Mauritius}}\nThe estimated population of the Republic of Mauritius was at 1,265,985, of whom 626,341 were males and 639,644 females as at 1 July 2019.

More recent years have witnessed the demolition of plantations, residences, and civic buildings as they have been cleared or drastically renovated for new developments to serve an expanding tourism industry. The capital city of Port Louis remained relatively unchanged until the mid-1990s, yet now reflects the irreversible damage that has been inflicted on its built heritage.

It is based on the Hindi movie ''[[Jalwa]]'' (1987), and was directed by [[A. Kodandarami Reddy]] and produced by [[Chiranjeevi]] himself and his brother [[Nagendra Babu]]. The film was Chiranjeevi's 100th movie.The film is a remake of the 1984 film ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''.

He runs a big aashram on Goa's beach, and under this Aashram's mask, he runs his underworld. His underworld is the channel for drug-trafficking, which cashes in upon the weakness of the youth. To investigate  this Aashram's dark secrets, the [[Indian government]] appoints a CBI officer ([[Nagendra Babu]]), who prepares a complete report on its activities, but is killed by D.D's men. When the CBI officer never returns, the CBI gets suspicious and sends another officer, who is Abhimanyu ([[Chiranjeevi]]). Abhimanyu lands in Goa and meets D.I.G. ([[Kaikala Satyanarayana]]) to inform him about his mission. But Goa police and CBI don't share good terms and the D.I.G. appoints 2 Sub-Inspectors, (Nuthan Prasad and Prasad Babu) to follow and observe Abhimanyu. Meanwhile, Bhanupriya's brother becomes a drug addict, and to cure him she gets him admitted into a hospital. Hospital chief Ranganath meets Abhimanyu in a strange incident. When Bhanu's brother tries to jump off the top floor of hospital, Abhimanyu saves him and thus meets Bhanu. Being clueless about the missing CBI officer, Abhimanyu manages to enter into the aashram and exposes the secret activities carried out there. He witnesses drugs being exported in dead bodies. When Abhimanyu informs about these to D.I.G, he doesn't believe him, but on pressure he raids the aashram, but finds nothing, much to the shock of Abhimanyu. D.D. becomes more self-conscious and Goa police stop co-operating with Abhimanyu. Abhimanyu is attacked in many ways, and the Goa police get rid of him by sending him off in a ship. However, Abhimanyu escapes and returns to Goa, this time more determined to complete his mission. Abhimanyu realizes that Ranganath is D.D.'s right hand, and he sets a trap in which Ranganath is killed by D.D. himself. He also succeeds in donating D.D.'s money to a homeless people's fund. D.D. gets furious, and kidnaps Chiru's mother (Annapurna). Abhimanyu informs this to the Goa police, but they don't believe him. So, Abhimanyu himself as one-man army, attacks the aashram, destroys it, rescues his mother and marries Bhanupriya. This is Chiranjeevi's 100th movie. The movie was released on 22nd september 1988 which coincides with his first movie release date ie., his first movie PRANAM KAREETHU was released on 22nd September 1978.

While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=against_the_grain_(album) |title=Against The Grain (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref> \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\", one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band's most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show.\n\nDrummer [[Pete Finestone]] left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and [[Bobby Schayer]] joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]'', which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio,<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=generator_(album)|title=Generator - the album|website=Thebrpage.net|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}</ref> because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was \"time to change\" and the band \"did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different\".<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\" /> To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video \"[[Atomic Garden (song)|Atomic Garden]]\", which was also their first song to be released as a single.\n\nTo coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, ''[[80\u201385]]'', in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'', their two EPs, ''[[Bad Religion (EP)|Bad Religion]]'' and ''[[Back to the Known]]'' and the band's three track contributions to the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP. This compilation did not include ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]''. ''80\u201385'' is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' with the same track listings.\n\n===Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993\u20131995)===\n\nWith [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, with \"[[American Jesus]]\" and \"[[Struck a Nerve]]\" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time.\n\n''Recipe for Hate'' was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]\", \"[[Infected (song)|Infected]]\", and a re-recording of \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\", which was originally released on ''Against the Grain''. The band also recorded the song \"Leaders and Followers\" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of ''Stranger Than Fiction'') for the soundtrack for the [[Kevin Smith]] film, ''[[Clerks]]''. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded [[RIAA Certification|gold certification]] on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification (type in \"Bad Religion\" in the artist box) |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |accessdate=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s punk rock explosion, along with [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[NOFX]].<ref name=\"autobiography\" /><ref name=\"theguardian\" />\n\nRight before the release of ''Stranger Than Fiction'', Gurewitz left the band. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as [[the Offspring]] (who had just released ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of [[selling out]] for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Neal|title=The Higher Calling|date=May 9, 1996|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427023721/http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archivedate=April 27, 2005}}</ref> As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts such as \"I want to know where Brett gets his crack\" or \"I want to know why Gurewitz cracked,\" on the song \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]\".<ref name=\"strangerthanfiction\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=stranger_than_fiction_%28song%29 |title=Stranger Than Fiction (song) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |website=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>  These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's ''Suffer Tour'' documentary, ''[[Along the Way]]'', and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band [[The Daredevils (band)|the Daredevils]] entitled \"[[Hate You (Daredevils song)|Hate You]]\", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley.\n\nGurewitz was replaced as a guitarist by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], a former member of the bands [[Minor Threat]], [[Dag Nasty]] and [[Junkyard (band)|Junkyard]].

Despite never garnering the amount of attention that ''Stranger Than Fiction'' received, it would score Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song \"A Walk\" as well as the European release of \"Punk Rock Song\".\n\n[[File:Badr1995.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] (left) with Bad Religion, live in the Netherlands, 1995.]]\nIn 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, ''[[No Substance]]'', produced by [[Alex Perialas]], Ronnie Kimball and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with ''Stranger Than Fiction'' and ''The Gray Race'', it was given mixed reviews by critics and fans.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r348580|pure_url=yes}} Ankeny, J: \"No Substance\" review]</ref> Following the release of ''No Substance'', the band embarked on a year-long tour.\n\nIn 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together, called \"Believe It\", which would appear on their next album, ''[[The New America]]'' (2000). For it, [[Todd Rundgren]], an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. \"Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.\" In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/shows/tour.asp?tourID=33|title=2000 - The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show Tour (supporting Blink 182) &#124; Tours & shows &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref> Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, \"I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything.\"<ref name=\"chartattack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|title=Bad Religion: The Process of Labels|first=Keith|last=Carman|work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]|date=July 19, 2002|accessdate=September 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606183720/http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|archivedate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Schayer]] left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]]).\n\n===Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001\u20132004)===\nIn 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' (2002). Graffin states, \"there was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|title=The New State of Bad Religion|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|date=May 11, 2000}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'', was released in June 2004. Like ''The Process of Belief'', it is widely regarded by fans{{who|date=June 2012}} as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.\n\nIn April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except ''Into the Unknown''). The ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued ''80\u201385'' compilation, including their first EP, the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the \"Back To The Known\" EP. To coincide with the re-issues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS ''[[Along the Way]]'' on DVD for the first time. Though ''Recipe for Hate'' was released on Epitaph, the album could not be re-issued; due to the fact that it was re-issued on Atlantic, problems with the rights ownership made a re-issue unlikely.\n\n===''New Maps of Hell'' (2005\u20132008)===\n[[File:Bad Religion 2005-6-22.jpg|left|thumb|Bentley (left) and Graffin (right) with Bad Religion, live in the House of Blues, 2005.]]\nOn March 7, 2006, a live DVD, ''[[Live at the Palladium (Bad Religion DVD)|Live at the Palladium]]'' was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium, as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] said the band's next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out not to be the case.<ref name=\"palladium\" />\n\n[[Greg Graffin]] released his second solo album, ''[[Cold as the Clay]]'', on July 11, 2006.\n\nBad Religion's fourteenth studio album, ''[[New Maps of Hell (Bad Religion album)|New Maps of Hell]]'', was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29, of that year ([[Greg Hetson]]'s 46th birthday), [[Epitaph Records]] started selling ''New Maps of Hell'' at the [[Warped Tour]] in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned three hit singles \"[[Honest Goodbye]]\", \"Heroes and Martyrs\", and \"[[New Dark Ages]]\", and as a result, ''New Maps of Hell'' reached number 35 on the ''Billboard'' 200, marking Bad Religion's highest-ever chart position.

I was interviewed for it\u2014and yet I think I was included as a sidebar but not as a main feature and I think the main reason they did that was because they noticed that I wasn't that happy billing myself as an atheist. To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a ''naturalist'' is someone who ... first of all\u2014they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message\u2014I think\u2014to send to the world, which is ... we can agree on what the truth is ... and it has to be through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So ... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the ''structure'' of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework\u2014it can ''reconstruct'' the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say \"you're an atheist\", it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say \"you're a naturalist\", I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a ''fundamental'' way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition.

It features a black [[Latin cross]] with a red [[prohibition sign]] over it. It was created by guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] by drawing it on a piece of paper and showing it to the rest of the band.\n\nIn the live documentary ''[[Along the Way]]'', Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin and Jay Bentley are all asked the question \"What's the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?\".\n\nHetson: \"The meaning of the symbol? It's, to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be [[anti-establishment]].\"\n\nGraffin: \"Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids and we thought 'Yeah, this is a great idea, it'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years-old, the first thing you think about is 'How can I piss people off?', you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a [[no parking]] sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [''[[sic]]''] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.\"\n\nBentley: \"Brett made that when we were fifteen years-old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said 'That's really funny' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [''sic''] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.\"\n\nBrian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, sums it up as follows:\n\n\"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ...

This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release.<ref name=\"opiateofthemasses\" />\n\nSoon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with [[Circle Jerks]] guitarist [[Greg Hetson]] replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, [[rock and roll]] version of their original sound with the ''[[Back to the Known]]'' EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985.\n\n===Reunion, ''Suffer'', ''No Control'', ''Against the Grain'' and ''Generator'' (1986\u20131992)===\nBad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the ''Back to the Known'' line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back.<ref name=\"opiateofthemasses\" /> This lineup recorded the band's third album, ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as ''[[Trust (magazine)|Trust]]'', ''[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' and ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=suffer_%28album%29 |title=Suffer (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=August 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring the ''Suffer'' tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the [[Westbeach Recorders]] studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]'', was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion's best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=no%5Fcontrol%5F%28album%29 |title=No Control (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=October 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'', which was released in 1990.

In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]'', which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio,<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\">{{cite web|last=|first=|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=generator_(album)|title=Generator - the album|website=Thebrpage.net|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}</ref> because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was \"time to change\" and the band \"did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different\".<ref name=\"Generatorinfo\" /> To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video \"[[Atomic Garden (song)|Atomic Garden]]\", which was also their first song to be released as a single.\n\nTo coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, ''[[80\u201385]]'', in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'', their two EPs, ''[[Bad Religion (EP)|Bad Religion]]'' and ''[[Back to the Known]]'' and the band's three track contributions to the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP. This compilation did not include ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]''. ''80\u201385'' is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' with the same track listings.\n\n===Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993\u20131995)===\n\nWith [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, with \"[[American Jesus]]\" and \"[[Struck a Nerve]]\" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time.\n\n''Recipe for Hate'' was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]\", \"[[Infected (song)|Infected]]\", and a re-recording of \"[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]\", which was originally released on ''Against the Grain''. The band also recorded the song \"Leaders and Followers\" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of ''Stranger Than Fiction'') for the soundtrack for the [[Kevin Smith]] film, ''[[Clerks]]''. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded [[RIAA Certification|gold certification]] on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification (type in \"Bad Religion\" in the artist box) |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |accessdate=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archivedate=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s punk rock explosion, along with [[Green Day]], [[The Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[NOFX]].<ref name=\"autobiography\" /><ref name=\"theguardian\" />\n\nRight before the release of ''Stranger Than Fiction'', Gurewitz left the band. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as [[the Offspring]] (who had just released ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of [[selling out]] for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Neal|title=The Higher Calling|date=May 9, 1996|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427023721/http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archivedate=April 27, 2005}}</ref> As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts such as \"I want to know where Brett gets his crack\" or \"I want to know why Gurewitz cracked,\" on the song \"[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]\".<ref name=\"strangerthanfiction\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=stranger_than_fiction_%28song%29 |title=Stranger Than Fiction (song) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |website=Thebrpage.net |date= |accessdate=April 27, 2016}}</ref>  These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's ''Suffer Tour'' documentary, ''[[Along the Way]]'', and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band [[The Daredevils (band)|the Daredevils]] entitled \"[[Hate You (Daredevils song)|Hate You]]\", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley.\n\nGurewitz was replaced as a guitarist by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], a former member of the bands [[Minor Threat]], [[Dag Nasty]] and [[Junkyard (band)|Junkyard]].

Despite never garnering the amount of attention that ''Stranger Than Fiction'' received, it would score Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song \"A Walk\" as well as the European release of \"Punk Rock Song\".\n\n[[File:Badr1995.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] (left) with Bad Religion, live in the Netherlands, 1995.]]\nIn 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, ''[[No Substance]]'', produced by [[Alex Perialas]], Ronnie Kimball and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with ''Stranger Than Fiction'' and ''The Gray Race'', it was given mixed reviews by critics and fans.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r348580|pure_url=yes}} Ankeny, J: \"No Substance\" review]</ref> Following the release of ''No Substance'', the band embarked on a year-long tour.\n\nIn 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together, called \"Believe It\", which would appear on their next album, ''[[The New America]]'' (2000). For it, [[Todd Rundgren]], an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. \"Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself.\" In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/shows/tour.asp?tourID=33|title=2000 - The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show Tour (supporting Blink 182) &#124; Tours & shows &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref> Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, \"I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything.\"<ref name=\"chartattack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|title=Bad Religion: The Process of Labels|first=Keith|last=Carman|work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]|date=July 19, 2002|accessdate=September 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606183720/http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|archivedate=June 6, 2011}}</ref> However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Schayer]] left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]]).\n\n===Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001\u20132004)===\nIn 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' (2002). Graffin states, \"there was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|title=The New State of Bad Religion|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|date=May 11, 2000}}</ref>\n\nTheir next album, ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'', was released in June 2004. Like ''The Process of Belief'', it is widely regarded by fans{{who|date=June 2012}} as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.\n\nIn April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except ''Into the Unknown''). The ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued ''80\u201385'' compilation, including their first EP, the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the \"Back To The Known\" EP. To coincide with the re-issues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS ''[[Along the Way]]'' on DVD for the first time. Though ''Recipe for Hate'' was released on Epitaph, the album could not be re-issued; due to the fact that it was re-issued on Atlantic, problems with the rights ownership made a re-issue unlikely.\n\n===''New Maps of Hell'' (2005\u20132008)===\n[[File:Bad Religion 2005-6-22.jpg|left|thumb|Bentley (left) and Graffin (right) with Bad Religion, live in the House of Blues, 2005.]]\nOn March 7, 2006, a live DVD, ''[[Live at the Palladium (Bad Religion DVD)|Live at the Palladium]]'' was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium, as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] said the band's next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out not to be the case.<ref name=\"palladium\" />\n\n[[Greg Graffin]] released his second solo album, ''[[Cold as the Clay]]'', on July 11, 2006.\n\nBad Religion's fourteenth studio album, ''[[New Maps of Hell (Bad Religion album)|New Maps of Hell]]'', was released on July 10, 2007. On June 29, of that year ([[Greg Hetson]]'s 46th birthday), [[Epitaph Records]] started selling ''New Maps of Hell'' at the [[Warped Tour]] in Pomona, California. The album was a commercial success and spawned three hit singles \"[[Honest Goodbye]]\", \"Heroes and Martyrs\", and \"[[New Dark Ages]]\", and as a result, ''New Maps of Hell'' reached number 35 on the ''Billboard'' 200, marking Bad Religion's highest-ever chart position.

To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a ''naturalist'' is someone who ... first of all\u2014they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message\u2014I think\u2014to send to the world, which is ... we can agree on what the truth is ... and it has to be through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So ... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the ''structure'' of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework\u2014it can ''reconstruct'' the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say \"you're an atheist\", it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say \"you're a naturalist\", I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a ''fundamental'' way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition.

It features a black [[Latin cross]] with a red [[prohibition sign]] over it. It was created by guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] by drawing it on a piece of paper and showing it to the rest of the band.\n\nIn the live documentary ''[[Along the Way]]'', Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin and Jay Bentley are all asked the question \"What's the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?\".\n\nHetson: \"The meaning of the symbol? It's, to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be [[anti-establishment]].\"\n\nGraffin: \"Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids and we thought 'Yeah, this is a great idea, it'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years-old, the first thing you think about is 'How can I piss people off?', you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a [[no parking]] sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [''[[sic]]''] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans.\"\n\nBentley: \"Brett made that when we were fifteen years-old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said 'That's really funny' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [''sic''] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide.\"\n\nBrian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, sums it up as follows:\n\n\"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ...

The Big Bash League replaced the previous competition, the [[KFC Twenty20 Big Bash]], and features eight city-based franchises instead of the six state teams which had participated previously. The competition has been sponsored by fast food chicken outlet [[KFC]] since its inception. It is one of the two T20 cricket leagues, alongside the [[Indian Premier League]], to feature amongst the [[List of sports attendance figures#Top 10 leagues in average attendance|top ten domestic sport leagues in average attendance]]. The winner of [[2019\u201320 Big Bash League season|BBL|09 (2019/2020)]] was the [[Sydney Sixers]] who beat the [[Melbourne Stars]] by 19 runs in the final. The [[Sydney Sixers]] took the title from the [[Melbourne Renegades]] who beat the [[Melbourne Stars]] in the BBL|08 (2018/2019) final.\n\nBBL matches are played in Australia during the southern hemisphere summer, in the months of December, January and February.\n\nOut of the eight teams in the tournament, six have won the title at least once. The [[Perth Scorchers]] are the most successful team in the league's short history, winning the title three times including consecutively for two years and have reached the final of the tournament in five of the eight seasons. The other five teams which have won the title are the [[Adelaide Strikers]], [[Sydney Sixers]], [[Melbourne Renegades]], [[Brisbane Heat]] and [[Sydney Thunder]]. The current champions are the [[Sydney Sixers]] defeating the Melbourne Stars on 8 February 2020 at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in a game that was reduced to 12 overs each due to rain.\n\nBefore 2014, the top two teams in the tournament used to qualify for the [[Champions League Twenty20]] tournament. It was an annual international Twenty20 competition played between the top domestic teams from various nations, which became defunct after the 2014 tournament.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/story/898873.html |title=Champions League T20 discontinued |date=15 July 2015 |work=ESPN |accessdate=15 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Trophy===\nA design contest was held in 2011 to determine the design of the Big Bash League trophy.
