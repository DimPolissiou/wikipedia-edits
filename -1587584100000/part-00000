By the 1840s, the Karankawa, exiled, split into two groups, one of which settled on [[Padre Island]] while the other fled into the Mexican state of [[Tamaulipas]]. In 1858, [[Juan Cortina|Juan Nepomuceno Cortina]] led a group of Texan colonists against the Karankawa's last refuge and killed the remaining members of the tribe.<ref name=\":1\" /> By 1891, the Karankawa, as an organized tribe, were believed to be extinct.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHistorical research of the Karankawa is hindered because the documents concerning them were overwhelmingly written by open enemies of the tribe.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">Geneser, Vivien L. \"Native transgressions: a look at the portrayal of Karankawa natives in Texas history textbooks and trade books.\" ''American Educational History Journal'' 38, no. 1-2 (2011): 219+.

Karankawa was theorized to originate from related peoples living nearby who called the dog the term \"klam\" or \"glam\", and to love, to like, to be fond of, \"kawa.\" Thus Karankawa could mean dog-lovers or dog-raisers. Meanwhile, the [[Tonkawa]] called them Wrestlers (\"Keles\" or \"Killis\"), due to the Karankawas' skill in the art. They alternatively called them the barefooted or those without moccasins (\"Yakokon kapa-i\"), but this name was also applied to other groups with which the Tonkawe were acquainted. The [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan-Apache]] called the Karankawa the people who walk in the water (\"Nda kun dadehe\"), possibly referring to their mode of fishing and catching turtles. Notably, the Karankawa called themselves \"Karankawa\" as well.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLater speculation placed the Karankawa language in the Cariban linguistic stock. Linguistic data suggests that the Karankawa name originated from the old Spanish Main, \"Kalina,\" and a suffix from a Northern Carib tribe, \"kxura,\"meaning \"people;\" a compound emerges: Karinxkxura, meaning \"Carib people.\" <ref name=\":3\" /> But this theory is disputed and ultimately, the origins of the name \"Karankawa\" remain unknown.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nAccording to some contemporary sources, former migrations of their ancestors were entirely unknown to the Karankawa of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the linguist Herbert Landar argues that based on linguistic evidence, the Karankawa language and people originated from a [[Caribbean|Carib]] subgroup. The Carib subgroup to which the Karankawa people belong remains to be discovered. Their exact migratory path northward is equally indistinct. Migration northward is theorized to have occurred in the late fifteenth century. The route north was from the original land north of the Amazon river toward Tamaulipas and Texas, and was probably finished over a long period of time in short bursts of migration.<ref name=\":3\" /> Scholars have speculated that the Karankawa were descended from a group of Carib Indians who arrived by sea from the Caribbean basin. This is partially based on the similarity of their physical appearance to Caribbean Natives. However,  no ethnographic or archaeological evidence has been found to support this speculation.<ref name=\":4\">Rickliss, Robert. ''The Karankawa Indians of Texas: An Ecological Study of Cultural Tradition and Change'', University of Texas Press. Austin: 1996. p. vii</ref>\n\nRecent archaeological records that used radiocarbon dating for artifacts indicated that these native groups had been in the area as early as the 5th- millennium BCE.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Lifestyle ==\n\n=== Seasonal nomadic lifestyle ===\nThe Karankawa voyaged from place to place on a seasonal basis in their [[Dugout canoe|dugouts]], made from large trees with the bark left intact. They travelled in groups of thirty to forty people and remained in each place for about four weeks. After European contact, canoes were of two kinds, both being called \"awa'n\": the original dugout and old skiffs obtained from the whites. Neither were used for fishing but for transportation only, and their travels were limited to the waters close to the land. The women, children, and possessions travelled in the hold while the men stood on the stern and poled the canoe. Upon landing at their next destination, the women set up [[wigwam]]s (called ''ba'ak'' in their native language) and the men hauled the boats on the shore. Their campsites were always close to the shoreline of the nearby body of water.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir wigwams consisted of willow branches arranged in a circle, with the tops of the branches bent toward the center and interlocked in wickerwork. This wickerwork was fastened with deerskin. Upon this framework, the Karankawa lay deer, wildcat, panther or bear skins, again fastened with deerskin thongs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe next step was to make a fire. After European contact, the Karankawa begged for matches or tinderboxes from settlers; otherwise, they resorted to the traditional method of using their firesticks, which they always carried in a package of deerthongs. The fire was always made in the center of their dwellings and kept burning day and night. They used animal skins to sit and sleep on within their dwellings. Their household goods and utensils included wooden spoons, some clay vessels, fishbone needles, and fine deer sinew.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Methods of hunting and gathering ===\nThe primary food sources of the Karankawa were venison, rabbit, birds, fish, oysters, and turtles. They supplemented their hunting with gathering food such as berries, persimmons, wild grapes, sea-bird eggs, and nuts.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir food was always boiled in earthen pots or roasted. Although there were a lot of salt deposits nearby, the Karankawa used chile for seasoning their food. After European contact, the Karankawa also would mix flour with water, lay the dough upon a flat stone, and baked it on the open fire. They were fond of sweet coffee.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Karankawa seemed to manage to always get pure, freshwater, although the whites did not know where they obtained it, because the wells of the whites had a brackish taste.<ref name=\":2\" />\n<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Karankawa spoken language was observed to be deeply [[guttural]]. Syllabic structure was vocalic, they doubled consonants and vowels, and often extended sentences beyond the supply of breath which they could command. They often abbreviated their words and spoke softly.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThey also possessed a gesture language for conversing with people from other Native American tribes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Smoke signalling ====\nThe Karankawa were noted for their skill of communicating with each other over long distances using smoke. The Karankawa could make the smoke of a small fire ascend toward the sky in many different ways, and it was as intelligible to them across long distances as their language. Their methods are unknown.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Manners and customs ===\nThe Karankawa had a specific way of conversing. They carefully repressed their breath while speaking; at the end of their sentences, they exhaled heavily, releasing the air they held back during speaking. Moreover, their expression was interpreted by Europeans as impassive, especially because they never looked at the person to whom they were speaking. Their pronunciation was very exact, and they ridiculed poor elocution by the whites who tried to learn their language. The Europeans described their general demeanor as surly and fatigued.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThey did not have a regular sleep schedule, but slept whenever they wished. They also ate and drank at all times of the day.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nKarankawa never communicated their native names to the whites. However, they all adopted English or Spanish names. Many men adopted American military epithets and Christian names, and they would change these frequently.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAmong the Karankawa there exists an in-law taboo. Once a man and his wife have become in the Karankawa sense, married, the husband and his children are now no longer allowed to enter the residence of his wife's parents nor can his wife's parents enter his or his children's home. These two groups are also no longer allowed to talk with one another and must never come face to face with one another. If there is the danger of coming face to face with one another both parties must avert their eyes and move away from each other. This taboo only seems to apply to the husbands and their children, most likely due to inconvenience on the wife's part as Karankawans are typically patrilocal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of North American Indians Vol. 10|last=Sturtevant|first=William C.|publisher=U.S. Govt. Print. Off.|year=1978|isbn=|location=Washington|pages=359\u2013367}}</ref>\n\n=== Arts, athletics, and recreation ===\nThe Karankawa possessed at least three musical instruments: a large gourd filled with stones which was shaken to produce sound, a fluted piece of wood which the Karankawa drew a stick over to produce sound, and a flute which was softly blown.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Karankawa practiced [[Axe throwing|hatchet-throwing]], recreational brawls with knives, ball plays, and wrestling matches. No gambling or guessing games seemed to have developed among the Karankawa.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Karankawa were also noted for their remarkable physical feats, such as continuing to fight after being wounded in battle, breaking ice with their bodies, and swimming in freezing water.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Archery ====\nTheir best-honed skill was that of [[archery]]. The Karankawa made their own bows and arrows, and were renowned for equal skill whether standing on land, in calm waters, or in turbulent waters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir bows were made of red cedar wood and they made them according to the height of each archer, reaching from the foot to the chin or eye. The bows were always kept in perfect repair. The arrows were about a yard long, tipped with steel and feathered with wild geese feathers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs well as using archery for hunting, the Karankawa engaged in archery as a recreational activity. They often shot at the mark or shot arrows perpendicularly into space. The shooting matches they held were lively and sportive. Many young men were able to split the previous arrow in the target in two from a distance of at least eighty feet.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Social institutions ===\n\n==== Tribal leadership ====\nThe groups of Karankawa were commonly led by two chiefs: a civil government chief with a hereditary succession in the male lines, and a war-chief, probably appointed by the civil government chief. No evidence of a confederacy, like that of the [[Caddo]] or [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creeks]], was found. The Karankawa were probably a loose-knit body living under separate chiefs only united by the common language and shared war expeditions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe ritual in order to become a chief has been studied by 18th-century Spaniards. They have stated that a selection starts from many candidates and each is injured by a comb created from the spines of a sea fish, long wounds being dug into their skin from the top of their head to the soles of their feet and then tied to a pole for several days to either emerge thin or emaciated and close to death. While this description can indeed be a ritual to choose a chief, a diary of Fray Gaspar Jose De Solis states that he suspects these rituals could simply be a puberty rite or an initiation ritual to a brotherhood.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=chief&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W. W. Newcomb|date=2010-01-01|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292793248|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender and family structures ====\nOne aspect of the Karankawa culture was their recognition of three gender roles: male, female, and a third role taken on by some males and women. Males who took on this third role are called ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]'' (Karankawa: ''monanguia''.) They generally took on female roles and activities in daily life, while playing a special role in religious rites.  According to some accounts, the ''berdache'' also performed as passive sexual partners for other males.<ref>{{Harvnb|Himmel|1999|p=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the written accounts of [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] it is mentioned that [[bride price]] and [[bride service]] is part of a Karankawa marriage. While the bride price is assumed to be the generalized system in the indigenous population found by Cabeza de Vaca where the groom gives gift to the parents of the girl he wishes to marry in order to secure their permission, the bride service is based on a ritual where the husband must give every morsel of food he managed to collect or hunt to his wife. His wife then delivers the bounty to her parents and in return is gifted food to give back to her husband. This ritual goes on for an unknown number of months, but when it is concluded the pair typically then engage in [[patrilocal residence]]. In terms of marriage, divorce is a common aspect typically only to marriages that have not created any children and is highly unlikely if children have been born from the marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=bride&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W.

The Karankawa reacted strongly and sometimes violently to Europeans interfering in marital or familial affairs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Karankawa was known to have a deep compassion and tenderness for their children.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Children not able to walk yet were carried by the mother on the back, wrapped in a loop of skin.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\n==== Physical character ====\nThe Karankawa had distinctive tattoos, notably: a blue circle tattooed over each cheekbone, one horizontal blue line from the outer angle of the eye toward the ear, three perpendicular parallel lines on the chin from the middle of the lower lip downward, and two other lines extending down from under each corner of the mouth.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover,  they were observed by sixteenth century explorers to have piercings of cane on the lower lips, nose, and other parts of the body.<ref name=\":7\">Trigger, Bruce G, and Washburn, Wilcomb E. \"The Greater Southwest and California from the Beginning of European Settlement to the 1880s.\" In ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', 57-116.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\nThe woman in some tribes such as the Coco group also had a tattoo of concentric black circles from their nipple to circling their entire breast.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBoth men and women were noted for their spectacularly white teeth, even elders.<ref name=\":2\" /> Men, women, and children alike rubbed sharks' oil on their entire bodies regularly to deter mosquitoes effectively and to keep their skin soft and supple. Europeans who encountered the Karankawa were disgusted by the odor.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nForehead flattening was practiced for all Karankawa. As babies, a piece of cloth was applied first, then a thin board, and then a wadded cloth. Each of these tied to the head with a bandage and left to stay there about one year.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Dress ====\nThe men wore a breech-clout of skins, while the women wore skirts of deerskin. Neither head-covers nor shoes were ever worn by the Karankawa. Some women of the tribe obtained European clothing occasionally, but would only tear them apart or wear them temporarily. European blankets were of greater use to the tribe, worn fastened to their bodies during cold weather and pinned with thorns. Both men and women wore a small bracelet of undressed deer skin. The children were left to roam undressed until they were about ten years old.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Differences in appearance between the sexes ====\nMany Europeans noted the sharp contrasts in appearance between Karankawa men and women. The women were described as plainer, shorter and of stouter build than the men. The men were very tall, of strong athletic build, and had coarse black hair. Most men wore their hair so long as to be waist-length. Their foreheads were mostly low and broad, and the heads larger than most whites. The men, in contrast with the women, had lithe builds and slender hands and feet. Their skin color was said to be lighter and closer to cinammon-colored than the women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe women wore no ornaments,  while the men were seen with many ornaments. Men's long hair was braided and consisted of three strands. They inserted bright objects (e..g, ribbons, colored flannel). The women never braided their hair nor combed it regularly. The men wore necklaces of small shells, glass beads, pistachios, and thin metal disks on their throats (never on their chests). Rings were also worn by the men.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Religion and ritual ===\nEuropeans knew limited information about the rituals of the Karankawa because the latter did not reveal the purposes of their actions or their beliefs.<ref name=\":2\" /> When Joutel, an explorer and companion of Robert Cavalier de La Salle, questioned their religious beliefs, the Karankawa only pointed at the sky.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt the full moon and after very successful hunting or fishing expeditions, the Karankawa traditionally held a ceremonial. After gathering around a central fire, they boiled a strong and bitter brew from the leaves of the [[Ilex vomitoria|yaupon]] tree and stirred it until the top was covered with a yellowish froth. This brew was shared and all the Karankawa drank freely. Although this brew was said to be intoxicating, Europeans did not notice any visible effects on the natives. One Native stood within the circle of men, wrapped up to his head in skins, and he bent over as he walked circled the fire. They chanted in chromatic ascending and descending tones, and all the Natives joined in the chorus. This ceremony would continue throughout the night.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOther than this, only a few other rituals were observed, and their purposes are unknown. The Karankawa would stare at the sun when it disappeared into the sea, like some other native groups of the area. They would also smoke tobacco through their nostrils first to the north, then to the east, west, and south. They frequently whistled at certain times and apparently for some objective, but ultimately for unknown purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Cabeza de Vaca Portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca.]]\nIn regards to special burial rites or rituals, the Karankawa seemed to be indifferent, and buried their dead at the site of their passing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cannibalism ====\nAccording to some sources, the Karankawa practiced ritual [[cannibalism]], in common with other Gulf coastal tribes of present-day Texas and Louisiana.<ref name=\"gene\">[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/karankawa/karankawahist.htm \"Karankawa Indian Tribe History.\"] ''Access Genealogy.''</ref><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], a Spanish conquistador who lived among the Karankawa for several years in the 1530 and wrote a memoir, made no mention of cannibalism except for ritualistic consumption of deceased relatives in the form of funeral ashes \"presented in water for the relatives to drink.\" Cabeza De Vaca admitted that he and his fellow survivors had committed acts of cannibalism of their own, eating their dead in order to survive after shipwrecking off Galveston Bay. The Karankawa people were shocked at the Spanish cannibalism, which they found to be repugnant.<ref name=\":1\" /> Whites never actually witnessed an act of cannibalism, and second and third-hand accounts are of disputed credibility.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Newcomb|1961|p=77}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Dogs ===\nThe Karankawa was distinctive in that they were one of the only tribes known to keep dogs. The Karankawan dogs, of a coyote-like or wolf-like species, accompanied the Karankawa on hunts, swims, and recreational activities.<ref name=\":5\" /> The dogs were voiceless, with straight ears and fox-like snouts.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early encounters with the Spanish and French (16th - 17th centuries)===\n[[File:Karankawa Indian Campsite Marker in Jamaica Beach, Texas.jpg|thumb|Karankawa Indian campsite and burial ground historical marker located in [[Jamaica Beach, Texas|Jamaica Beach]] on the west end of [[Galveston Island]]]]\nIn 1528, one of two barges put together by survivors of the failed [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]] expedition to Florida struck aground at Galveston Island.

Vol. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.</ref> De Vaca reported that extensive trade occurred with inland groups as far as the extent of the entire length of the present-day United States. After the introduction of the horse by Spaniards, these trade networks strengthened.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n[[Henri Joutel]], the companion of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] on his last expedition in 1687, recorded several tribes living in the coastal area, including the Karankawa (which he spelled as Korenkake and Koinekahe).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> His observations were that the Karankawa were peaceable rather than hostile. Upon their first meeting, Joutel reports that the Karankawa \"demonstrated their friendship by putting their hands over their hearts, which meant that they were glad to see us.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> He also noted that they possessed horses, which were undoubtedly obtained from the Spanish.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen de La Salle stole some canoes from the Karankawa to sail up a river and establish Fort St. Louis, the Karankawas were enraged. When they heard of de La Salle's departure and subsequent death, they attacked about twenty French settlers left in the fort and massacred all but five. The survivors were forcibly tattooed and made to follow the Karankawa on their hunting and fishing expeditions; they were eventually rescued by a Spanish expedition in 1689.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Relations with the Spanish ===\nThe La Salle venture stimulated the Spanish into active exploration and colonization of south Texas. A Spanish search for Fort St. Louis to check if the French had returned led to a skirmish between the Karankawa and the Spanish, and an establishment of hostilities between these two groups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1691, Captain Domingo Teran led a combined land-sea expedition to Texas to strengthen recently established missions and to search for French presence. Both expeditions were mismanaged and led to a temporary lapse in Spanish interest.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHowever, continued French action encouraged the Spaniards to occupy the area of [[Matagorda Bay]] permanently.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLa Bah\u00eda del Espiritu Santo, a mission-presidio complex, was established in 1722 on the southern bank of the San Antonio river. At first, the Karankawa were not antagonistic to the Spanish. But in 1723, a skirmish occurred between the Spanish and Karankawa, after which the Karankawa moved away from the mission and became hostile. By 1727, the Karankawa depredations forced the mission-presidio complex to move inland to the Guadalupe river, where they remained until 1749. The Karankawa successfully reduced Spanish claim to the Texas coast.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the 1730s, the Karankawa and other native tribes of the Texas area were viewed by the Spanish as the primary obstacle to control of northern New Spain. In 1749, Jose Escandon was made governor and representative of the viceroy, appointed to conquer and settle northern Mexico and the region of Texas and to map, survey, and acquaint himself with the area and with the natives. He recommended that the mission of La Bah\u00eda should be moved because of native hostility and the unfavorable climate.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA new mission, Mission Rosario, was established in 1754. It was in constant fear of revolt by the natives in the mission and often appealed to La Bah\u00eda for military aid. Overall, it was extremely ineffective as a spiritual and \"civilizing\" center. The Karankawa fled when subjected to any corporal punishment, and continued to enjoy the resources provided by the Spanish without being dependent on them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOver time, the Karankawa grew to speak Spanish with great fluency and adopted Spanish names for themselves to facilitate interaction with the whites.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe late eighteenth century saw a revival of Karankawa resistance and strength. The Spanish began to see them as unable to be converted to mission life, and some began to scheme for their extermination. However, none of these schemes were carried out.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1806, the Rosario mission was merged with that of Refugio. In 1830, Refugio and La Bah\u00eda del Espiritu Santo were secularized.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Relations with the British and French ===\nWhile the Spanish tried to incorporate the Karankawa into their empire, the Karankawa engaged in purely economic terms with the British and French, trading skins and deer for weapons (i.e., muskets, guns) and household goods.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Encounters with Jean Lafitte===\nWhen Galveston Island was occupied by the pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] from 1817 to 1821, some of his men kidnapped a Karankawa woman. In response, about three hundred Karankawa moved in to attack. When Lafitte learned of their encampment and impending attack, he sent two hundred of his men, armed with two cannons to confront the Karankawa. After the Karankawa lost about thirty men, they retreated to the mainland, with the pirates in pursuit. On the mainland, a few more Karankawa were killed.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Encounters with the Texan colonists===\nAustin was introduced to the Karankawas via an encounter with a peaceful Coco tribe. After some talks and an exchange of tobacco and a frying pan, Moses Austin considered them good friends, but after a warning of Karankawas at the mouth of a nearby river, Moses wrote in his journal that Karankawas are universal enemies of man and cannot be befriended and must be removed in order for Anglo-American settlers to live in peace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conquest of the Karankawas and the Tonkawas|last=Himmel|first=Kelly|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780890968673|location=Texas|pages=47}}</ref>\n[[File:Painting, \"The Settlement of Austin's Colony,\" by Henry Arthur McArdle, in the House of Representatives chamber in the Texas Capitol.

The Karankawa sought to hinder their progress by killing settlers who were guarding the ship John Motley and by stealing their supplies. By 1825, settlers banded together to attack the Karankawa. Stephen Austin commissioned Captain Kuykendall to lead volunteers to expel them from the territory, which extended to the Lavaca river. They chased the Karankawa to Manahila Creek, where a Spanish missionary interceded on their behalf and made them promise to never again go east of the Lavaca. This promise was broken, however, and was met by disproportionate violence by the Texan colonists.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Genocide of the Karankawa community ===\nDuring the Texan-Mexican war, some of the Karankawa served in the Mexican Army. They suffered greatly in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] of 1836, and the Texans retaliated heavily for their service.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nChief Jose Maria's 19-year-old son, Walupe, was captured by the Mexicans and killed. His father came on board the ship of a Texan settler and announced his intent of revenge. However, he and the majority of his men were killed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Antonio, who claimed he was the brother of Jose Maria, became chief after that. During his administration and afterward, the Karankawa population diminished significantly from disease, conflict with Europeans and infighting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the 1840s, the Karankawa consisted of two groups: one settled on [[Padre Island]], while the other applied to settle in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After being exiled from their homeland, the latter group reportedly plundered and stole; the Mexican government subsequently ordered troops to subdue them. General Avalos was ordered to move the Karankawa to the border of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The two states disputed over the Karankawa, and they were eventually returned to Reynosa. After continued robberies, the Karankawa were removed to Texas.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1858, the judge of Rosario, Mexico, sent a message to the mayor of Reynosa that he had tried to arrest the Karankawa but they moved north of the American border beyond his jurisdiction. He added that Mexicans and Americans should work together for the Karankawas' arrest. Later that year, [[Juan Cortina]] made a surprise attack on the recently returned Karankawa and annihilated the last members of the tribe.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> In a study on the Karankawa published in 1888, one interviewee \"thought that some [Karankawa] may be still in existence, but could not tell where.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Environment==\nThe Karankawa traveled to the mountains and basins region. They hunted and gathered food from rivers and by the mountains.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the region that the Karankawa inhabited, numerous small chunks of [[asphalt]]um have been found along the coast from oil seepage beneath the Gulf of Mexico. These chunks were used to bind arrowheads to their shafts; as a coating for pottery such as [[olla]]s, jars, and bowls; and as a way to waterproof woven baskets.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=asphaltum&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W.

Karankawa was theorized to originate from related peoples living nearby who called the dog the term \"klam\" or \"glam\", and to love, to like, to be fond of, \"kawa.\" Thus Karankawa could mean dog-lovers or dog-raisers. Meanwhile, the [[Tonkawa]] called them Wrestlers (\"Keles\" or \"Killis\"), due to the Karankawas' skill in the art. They alternatively called them the barefooted or those without moccasins (\"Yakokon kapa-i\"), but this name was also applied to other groups with which the Tonkawe were acquainted. The [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan-Apache]] called the Karankawa the people who walk in the water (\"Nda kun dadehe\"), possibly referring to their mode of fishing and catching turtles. Notably, the Karankawa called themselves \"Karankawa\" as well.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLater speculation placed the Karankawa language in the Cariban linguistic stock. Linguistic data suggests that the Karankawa name originated from the old Spanish Main, \"Kalina,\" and a suffix from a Northern Carib tribe, \"kxura,\"meaning \"people;\" a compound emerges: Karinxkxura, meaning \"Carib people.\" <ref name=\":3\" /> But this theory is disputed and ultimately, the origins of the name \"Karankawa\" remain unknown.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nAccording to some contemporary sources, former migrations of their ancestors were entirely unknown to the Karankawa of the early nineteenth century.<ref name=\":2\" /> However, the linguist Herbert Landar argues that based on linguistic evidence, the Karankawa language and people originated from a [[Caribbean|Carib]] subgroup. The Carib subgroup to which the Karankawa people belong remains to be discovered. Their exact migratory path northward is equally indistinct. Migration northward is theorized to have occurred in the late fifteenth century. The route north was from the original land north of the Amazon river toward Tamaulipas and Texas, and was probably finished over a long period of time in short bursts of migration.<ref name=\":3\" /> Scholars have speculated that the Karankawa were descended from a group of Carib Indians who arrived by sea from the Caribbean basin. This is partially based on the similarity of their physical appearance to Caribbean Natives. However,  no ethnographic or archaeological evidence has been found to support this speculation.<ref name=\":4\">Rickliss, Robert. ''The Karankawa Indians of Texas: An Ecological Study of Cultural Tradition and Change'', University of Texas Press. Austin: 1996. p. vii</ref>\n\nRecent archaeological records that used radiocarbon dating for artifacts indicated that these native groups had been in the area as early as the 5th- millennium BCE.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Lifestyle ==\n\n=== Seasonal nomadic lifestyle ===\nThe Karankawa voyaged from place to place on a seasonal basis in their [[Dugout canoe|dugouts]], made from large trees with the bark left intact. They travelled in groups of thirty to forty people and remained in each place for about four weeks. After European contact, canoes were of two kinds, both being called \"awa'n\": the original dugout and old skiffs obtained from the whites. Neither were used for fishing but for transportation only, and their travels were limited to the waters close to the land. The women, children, and possessions travelled in the hold while the men stood on the stern and poled the canoe. Upon landing at their next destination, the women set up [[wigwam]]s (called ''ba'ak'' in their native language) and the men hauled the boats on the shore. Their campsites were always close to the shoreline of the nearby body of water.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir wigwams consisted of willow branches arranged in a circle, with the tops of the branches bent toward the center and interlocked in wickerwork. This wickerwork was fastened with deerskin. Upon this framework, the Karankawa lay deer, wildcat, panther or bear skins, again fastened with deerskin thongs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe next step was to make a fire. After European contact, the Karankawa begged for matches or tinderboxes from settlers; otherwise, they resorted to the traditional method of using their firesticks, which they always carried in a package of deerthongs. The fire was always made in the center of their dwellings and kept burning day and night. They used animal skins to sit and sleep on within their dwellings. Their household goods and utensils included wooden spoons, some clay vessels, fishbone needles, and fine deer sinew.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Methods of hunting and gathering ===\nThe primary food sources of the Karankawa were venison, rabbit, birds,  fish, oysters, and turtles. They supplemented their hunting with gathering food such as berries, persimmons, wild grapes, sea-bird eggs, and nuts.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir food was always boiled in earthen pots or roasted. Although there were a lot of salt deposits nearby, the Karankawa used chile for seasoning their food. After European contact, the Karankawa also would mix flour with water, lay the dough upon a flat stone and baked it on the open fire. They were fond of sweet coffee.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Karankawa seemed to manage to always get pure, fresh water, although the whites did not know where they obtained it, because the wells of the whites had a brackish taste.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Language ===\nThe Karankawa spoken language was observed to be deeply [[guttural]]. Syllabic structure was vocalic, they doubled consonants and vowels, and often extended sentences beyond the supply of breath which they could command. They often abbreviated their words and spoke softly.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThey also possessed a gesture language for conversing with people from other Native American tribes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Smoke signalling ====\nThe Karankawa were noted for their skill of communicating with each other over long distances using smoke. The Karankawa could make the smoke of a small fire ascend toward the sky in many different ways, and it was as intelligible to them across long distances as their language. Their methods are unknown.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Manners and customs ===\nThe Karankawa had a specific way of conversing. They carefully repressed their breath while speaking; at the end of their sentences, they exhaled heavily, releasing the air they held back during speaking. Moreover, their expression was interpreted by Europeans as impassive, especially because they never looked at the person to whom they were speaking. Their pronunciation was very exact, and they ridiculed poor elocution by the whites who tried to learn their language. The Europeans described their general demeanor as surly and fatigued.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThey did not have a regular sleep schedule, but slept whenever they wished. They also ate and drank at all times of the day.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nKarankawa never communicated their native names to the whites. However, they all adopted English or Spanish names. Many men adopted American military epithets and Christian names, and they would change these frequently.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAmong the Karankawa there exists an in-law taboo. Once a man and his wife have become in the Karankawa sense, married, the husband and his children are now no longer allowed to enter the residence of his wife's parents nor can his wife's parents enter his or his children's home. These two groups are also no longer allowed to talk with one another and must never come face to face with one another. If there is the danger of coming face to face with one another both parties must avert their eyes and move away from each other. This taboo only seems to apply to the husbands and their children, most likely due to inconvenience on the wife's part as Karankawans are typically patrilocal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Handbook of North American Indians Vol. 10|last=Sturtevant|first=William C.|publisher=U.S. Govt. Print.

No gambling or guessing games seemed to have developed among the Karankawa.<ref name=\":2\" /> The Karankawa were also noted for their remarkable physical feats, such as continuing to fight after being wounded in battle, breaking ice with their bodies, and swimming in freezing water.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==== Archery ====\nTheir best-honed skill was that of [[archery]]. The Karankawa made their own bows and arrows, and were renowned for equal skill whether standing on land, in calm waters, or in turbulent waters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTheir bows were made of red cedar wood and they made them according to the height of each archer, reaching from the foot to the chin or eye. The bows were always kept in perfect repair. The arrows were about a yard long, tipped with steel and feathered with wild geese feathers.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs well as using archery for hunting, the Karankawa engaged in archery as a recreational activity. They often shot at the mark or shot arrows perpendicularly into space. The shooting matches they held were lively and sportive. Many young men were able to split the previous arrow in the target in two from a distance of at least eighty feet.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Social institutions ===\n\n==== Tribal leadership ====\nThe groups of Karankawa were commonly led by two chiefs: a civil government chief with a hereditary succession in the male lines, and a war-chief, probably appointed by the civil government chief. No evidence of a confederacy, like that of the [[Caddo]] or [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creeks]], was found. The Karankawa were probably a loose-knit body living under separate chiefs only united by the common language and shared war expeditions.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe ritual in order to become a chief has been studied by 18th-century Spaniards. They have stated that a selection starts from many candidates and each is injured by a comb created from the spines of a sea fish, long wounds being dug into their skin from the top of their head to the soles of their feet and then tied to a pole for several days to either emerge thin or emaciated and close to death. While this description can indeed be a ritual to choose a chief, a diary of Fray Gaspar Jose De Solis states that he suspects these rituals could simply be a puberty rite or an initiation ritual to a brotherhood.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=chief&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W.

Newcomb|date=2010-01-01|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292793248|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== Gender and family structures ====\nOne aspect of the Karankawa culture was their recognition of three gender roles: male, female, and a third role taken on by some males and women. Males who took on this third role are called ''[[Two-Spirit|berdache]]'' (Karankawa: ''monanguia''.) They generally took on female roles and activities in daily life, while playing a special role in religious rites.  According to some accounts, the ''berdache'' also performed as passive sexual partners for other males.<ref>{{Harvnb|Himmel|1999|p=20}}</ref>\n\nIn the written accounts of [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]] it is mentioned that [[bride price]] and [[bride service]] is part of a Karankawa marriage. While the bride price is assumed to be the generalized system in the indigenous population found by Cabeza de Vaca where the groom gives gift to the parents of the girl he wishes to marry in order to secure their permission, the bride service is based on a ritual where the husband must give every morsel of food he managed to collect or hunt to his wife. His wife then delivers the bounty to her parents and in return is gifted food to give back to her husband. This ritual goes on for an unknown number of months, but when it is concluded the pair typically then engage in [[patrilocal residence]]. In terms of marriage, divorce is a common aspect typically only to marriages that have not created any children and is highly unlikely if children have been born from the marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=bride&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W.

The Karankawa reacted strongly and sometimes violently to Europeans interfering in marital or familial affairs.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe Karankawa was known to have a deep compassion and tenderness for their children.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Children not able to walk yet were carried by the mother on the back, wrapped in a loop of skin.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Appearance ===\n\n==== Physical character ====\nThe Karankawa had distinctive tattoos, notably: a blue circle tattooed over each cheekbone, one horizontal blue line from the outer angle of the eye toward the ear, three perpendicular parallel lines on the chin from the middle of the lower lip downward, and two other lines extending down from under each corner of the mouth.<ref name=\":2\" /> Moreover,  they were observed by sixteenth century explorers to have piercings of cane on the lower lips, nose, and other parts of the body.<ref name=\":7\">Trigger, Bruce G, and Washburn, Wilcomb E. \"The Greater Southwest and California from the Beginning of European Settlement to the 1880s.\" In ''The Cambridge History of the Native Peoples of the Americas'', 57-116.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996.</ref>\n\nThe woman in some tribes such as the Coco group also had a tattoo of concentric black circles from their nipple to circling their entire breast.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\nBoth men and women were noted for their spectacularly white teeth, even elders.<ref name=\":2\" /> Men, women, and children alike rubbed sharks' oil on their entire bodies regularly to deter mosquitoes effectively and to keep their skin soft and supple. Europeans who encountered the Karankawa were disgusted by the odor.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nForehead flattening was practiced for all Karankawa. As babies, a piece of cloth was applied first, then a thin board, and then a wadded cloth. Each of these tied to the head with a bandage and left to stay there about one year.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Dress ====\nThe men wore a breech-clout of skins, while the women wore skirts of deerskin. Neither head-covers nor shoes were ever worn by the Karankawa. Some women of the tribe obtained European clothing occasionally, but would only tear them apart or wear them temporarily. European blankets were of greater use to the tribe, worn fastened to their bodies during cold weather and pinned with thorns. Both men and women wore a small bracelet of undressed deer skin. The children were left to roam undressed until they were about ten years old.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Differences in appearance between the sexes ====\nMany Europeans noted the sharp contrasts in appearance between Karankawa men and women. The women were described as plainer, shorter and of stouter build than the men. The men were very tall, of strong athletic build, and had coarse black hair. Most men wore their hair so long as to be waist-length. Their foreheads were mostly low and broad, and the heads larger than most whites. The men, in contrast with the women, had lithe builds and slender hands and feet. Their skin color was said to be lighter and closer to cinammon-colored than the women.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe women wore no ornaments,  while the men were seen with many ornaments. Men's long hair was braided and consisted of three strands. They inserted bright objects (e..g, ribbons, colored flannel). The women never braided their hair nor combed it regularly. The men wore necklaces of small shells, glass beads, pistachios, and thin metal disks on their throats (never on their chests). Rings were also worn by the men.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Religion and ritual ===\nEuropeans knew limited information about the rituals of the Karankawa because the latter did not reveal the purposes of their actions or their beliefs.<ref name=\":2\" /> When Joutel, an explorer and companion of Robert Cavalier de La Salle, questioned their religious beliefs, the Karankawa only pointed at the sky.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAt the full moon and after very successful hunting or fishing expeditions, the Karankawa traditionally held a ceremonial. After gathering around a central fire, they boiled a strong and bitter brew from the leaves of the [[Ilex vomitoria|yaupon]] tree and stirred it until the top was covered with a yellowish froth. This brew was shared and all the Karankawa drank freely. Although this brew was said to be intoxicating, Europeans did not notice any visible effects on the natives. One Native stood within the circle of men, wrapped up to his head in skins, and he bent over as he walked circled the fire. They chanted in chromatic ascending and descending tones, and all the Natives joined in the chorus. This ceremony would continue throughout the night.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nOther than this, only a few other rituals were observed, and their purposes are unknown. The Karankawa would stare at the sun when it disappeared into the sea, like some other native groups of the area. They would also smoke tobacco through their nostrils first to the north, then to the east, west, and south. They frequently whistled at certain times and apparently for some objective, but ultimately for unknown purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Cabeza de Vaca Portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of \u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca.]]\nIn regards to special burial rites or rituals, the Karankawa seemed to be indifferent, and buried their dead at the site of their passing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cannibalism ====\nAccording to some sources, the Karankawa practiced ritual [[cannibalism]], in common with other Gulf coastal tribes of present-day Texas and Louisiana.<ref name=\"gene\">[http://www.accessgenealogy.com/native/tribes/karankawa/karankawahist.htm \"Karankawa Indian Tribe History.\"] ''Access Genealogy.''</ref><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n[[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], a Spanish conquistador who lived among the Karankawa for several years in the 1530 and wrote a memoir, made no mention of cannibalism except for ritualistic consumption of deceased relatives in the form of funeral ashes \"presented in water for the relatives to drink.\" Cabeza De Vaca admitted that he and his fellow survivors had committed acts of cannibalism of their own, eating their dead in order to survive after shipwrecking off Galveston Bay. The Karankawa people were shocked at the Spanish cannibalism, which they found to be repugnant.<ref name=\":1\" /> Whites never actually witnessed an act of cannibalism, and second and third-hand accounts are of disputed credibility.<ref name=\":6\">{{Harvnb|Newcomb|1961|p=77}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Dogs ===\nThe Karankawa was distinctive in that they were one of the only tribes known to keep dogs.

After the introduction of the horse by Spaniards, these trade networks strengthened.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n[[Henri Joutel]], the companion of [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] on his last expedition in 1687, recorded several tribes living in the coastal area, including the Karankawa (which he spelled as Korenkake and Koinekahe).<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> His observations were that the Karankawa were peaceable rather than hostile. Upon their first meeting, Joutel reports that the Karankawa \"demonstrated their friendship by putting their hands over their hearts, which meant that they were glad to see us.\"<ref name=\":5\" /> He also noted that they possessed horses, which were undoubtedly obtained from the Spanish.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhen de La Salle stole some canoes from the Karankawa to sail up a river and establish Fort St. Louis, the Karankawas were enraged. When they heard of de La Salle's departure and subsequent death, they attacked about twenty French settlers left in the fort and massacred all but five. The survivors were forcibly tattooed and made to follow the Karankawa on their hunting and fishing expeditions; they were eventually rescued by a Spanish expedition in 1689.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Relations with the Spanish ===\nThe La Salle venture stimulated the Spanish into active exploration and colonization of south Texas. A Spanish search for Fort St. Louis to check if the French had returned led to a skirmish between the Karankawa and the Spanish, and an establishment of hostilities between these two groups.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1691, Captain Domingo Teran led a combined land-sea expedition to Texas to strengthen recently established missions and to search for French presence. Both expeditions were mismanaged and led to a temporary lapse in Spanish interest.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nHowever, continued French action encouraged the Spaniards to occupy the area of [[Matagorda Bay]] permanently.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nLa Bah\u00eda del Espiritu Santo, a mission-presidio complex, was established in 1722 on the southern bank of the San Antonio river. At first, the Karankawa were not antagonistic to the Spanish. But in 1723, a skirmish occurred between the Spanish and Karankawa, after which the Karankawa moved away from the mission and became hostile. By 1727, the Karankawa depredations forced the mission-presidio complex to move inland to the Guadalupe river, where they remained until 1749. The Karankawa successfully reduced Spanish claim to the Texas coast.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the 1730s, the Karankawa and other native tribes of the Texas area were viewed by the Spanish as the primary obstacle to control of northern New Spain. In 1749, Jose Escandon was made governor and representative of the viceroy, appointed to conquer and settle northern Mexico and the region of Texas and to map, survey, and acquaint himself with the area and with the natives. He recommended that the mission of La Bah\u00eda should be moved because of native hostility and the unfavorable climate.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA new mission, Mission Rosario, was established in 1754. It was in constant fear of revolt by the natives in the mission and often appealed to La Bah\u00eda for military aid. Overall, it was extremely ineffective as a spiritual and \"civilizing\" center. The Karankawa fled when subjected to any corporal punishment, and continued to enjoy the resources provided by the Spanish without being dependent on them.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOver time, the Karankawa grew to speak Spanish with great fluency and adopted Spanish names for themselves to facilitate interaction with the whites.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe late eighteenth century saw a revival of Karankawa resistance and strength. The Spanish began to see them as unable to be converted to mission life, and some began to scheme for their extermination. However, none of these schemes were carried out.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1806, the Rosario mission was merged with that of Refugio. In 1830, Refugio and La Bah\u00eda del Espiritu Santo were secularized.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Relations with the British and French ===\nWhile the Spanish tried to incorporate the Karankawa into their empire, the Karankawa engaged in purely economic terms with the British and French, trading skins and deer for weapons (i.e., muskets, guns) and household goods.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Encounters with Jean Lafitte===\nWhen Galveston Island was occupied by the pirate [[Jean Lafitte]] from 1817 to 1821, some of his men kidnapped a Karankawa woman. In response, about three hundred Karankawa moved in to attack. When Lafitte learned of their encampment and impending attack, he sent two hundred of his men, armed with two cannons to confront the Karankawa. After the Karankawa lost about thirty men, they retreated to the mainland, with the pirates in pursuit. On the mainland, a few more Karankawa were killed.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Encounters with the Texan colonists===\nAustin was introduced to the Karankawas via an encounter with a peaceful Coco tribe. After some talks and an exchange of tobacco and a frying pan, Moses Austin considered them good friends, but after a warning of Karankawas at the mouth of a nearby river, Moses wrote in his journal that Karankawas are universal enemies of man and cannot be befriended and must be removed in order for Anglo-American settlers to live in peace.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conquest of the Karankawas and the Tonkawas|last=Himmel|first=Kelly|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=1999|isbn=9780890968673|location=Texas|pages=47}}</ref>\n[[File:Painting, \"The Settlement of Austin's Colony,\" by Henry Arthur McArdle, in the House of Representatives chamber in the Texas Capitol.

The Karankawa sought to hinder their progress by killing settlers who were guarding the ship John Motley and by stealing their supplies. By 1825, settlers banded together to attack the Karankawa. Stephen Austin commissioned Captain Kuykendall to lead volunteers to expel them from the territory, which extended to the Lavaca river. They chased the Karankawa to Manahila Creek, where a Spanish missionary interceded on their behalf and made them promise to never again go east of the Lavaca. This promise was broken, however, and was met by disproportionate violence by the Texan colonists.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Genocide of the Karankawa community ===\nDuring the Texan-Mexican war, some of the Karankawa served in the Mexican Army. They suffered greatly in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] of 1836, and the Texans retaliated heavily for their service.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\" />\n\nChief Jose Maria's 19-year-old son, Walupe, was captured by the Mexicans and killed. His father came on board the ship of a Texan settler and announced his intent of revenge. However, he and the majority of his men were killed.<ref name=\":1\" /> Antonio, who claimed he was the brother of Jose Maria, became chief after that. During his administration and afterward, the Karankawa population diminished significantly from disease, conflict with Europeans and infighting.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nBy the 1840s, the Karankawa consisted of two groups: one settled on [[Padre Island]], while the other applied to settle in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas. After being exiled from their homeland, the latter group reportedly plundered and stole; the Mexican government subsequently ordered troops to subdue them. General Avalos was ordered to move the Karankawa to the border of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Le\u00f3n. The two states disputed over the Karankawa, and they were eventually returned to Reynosa. After continued robberies, the Karankawa were removed to Texas.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 1858, the judge of Rosario, Mexico, sent a message to the mayor of Reynosa that he had tried to arrest the Karankawa but they moved north of the American border beyond his jurisdiction. He added that Mexicans and Americans should work together for the Karankawas' arrest. Later that year, [[Juan Cortina]] made a surprise attack on the recently returned Karankawa and annihilated the last members of the tribe.<ref name=\":5\" /><ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> In a study on the Karankawa published in 1888, one interviewee \"thought that some [Karankawa] may be still in existence, but could not tell where.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Environment==\nThe Karankawa traveled to the mountains and basins region. They hunted and gathered food from rivers and by the mountains.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nIn the region that the Karankawa inhabited, numerous small chunks of [[asphalt]]um have been found along the coast from oil seepage beneath the Gulf of Mexico. These chunks were used to bind arrowheads to their shafts; as a coating for pottery such as [[olla]]s, jars, and bowls; and as a way to waterproof woven baskets.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Indians_of_Texas.html?id=1oujAsexDj0C&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&q=asphaltum&f=false|title=The Indians of Texas: From Prehistoric to Modern Times|last=Jr|first=W.

The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate. However, there were capable rulers among the rebels, including Yuzbak Shah (1257), Tughral Khan (1271-1282), and [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] (1301-1322). The latter achieved the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] and established a strong administration in eastern and south-western Bengal. In 1325, the Delhi Sultan [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] reorganized the province into three administrative regions, with [[Sonargaon]] ruling eastern Bengal; [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]] ruling northern Bengal; and [[Satgaon]] ruling southern Bengal. Even this arrangement broke down. By 1338, the three administrative regions had separatist [[Sultan]]s, including [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]] in Sonargaon; [[Alauddin Ali Shah]] in Gauda, and [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]] in Satgaon.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\">Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

Due to the riverine geography and climate, it was not feasible to use cavalry throughout the year in Bengal. The cavalry was probably the weakest component of the Bengal Sultanate's army, as the horses had to be imported from foreign countries. The artillery was an important section.

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty. The Sultans also built forts, including temporary mud walled forts.<ref name=\"banglapedia2\"/>\n[[File:Defeat of the last Bengal Sultan by Akbar.jpg|thumb|Akbar leads his army into battle against Daud Khan Karrani, the last Sultan of Bengal]]\n====Bengal-Delhi Wars====\n{{Main|Bengal Sultanate-Delhi Sultanate War}}\nIn 1353, the Sultan of Delhi attacked the newly formed Bengal Sultanate.

During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali control over Assam reached its zenith. Alauddin Hussain Shah overthrew the Hindu [[Khen dynasty]] during a war against the Kamata Kingdom. Eventually, the [[Ahom kingdom]] re-asserted Assamese independence.\n\n====Campaigns in Arakan====\n{{Main|Reconquest of Arakan|Bengal Sultanate-Kingdom of Mrauk U War of 1512-1516}}\nThe Bengal Sultanate defeated Burmese forces in Arakan and restored the Arakanese throne in 1430. Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire. The invasion prompted the Mughal Empire to occupy parts of Bengal. Both the Mughals and Bengal Sultanate were overrun by the Suri forces. Bengal regained its independence after Suri governors rebelled and re-established the sultanate.  \n\n====Bengal-Mughal Wars====\n{{Main|Battle of Ghaghra|Battle of Tukaroi|Battle of Raj Mahal}}\nThe first Mughal emperor Babur turned his sights on Bengal after the Battle of Panipat in 1526. At the Battle of Ghaghra in 1529, Bengal reached a peace treaty with Babur. During the invasion of Sher Shah Suri, the second Mughal emperor Humayun occupied [[Gauda (city)|Gaur]].

The second source was the tribute payments of subordinate kingdoms which were paid in silver bullion. The third source was during military campaigns when Bengali forces sacked neighboring states.<ref>John H Munro (6 October 2015).

[[Ma Huan]]'s testimony of a flourishing shipbuilding industry was part of the evidence that Bengal enjoyed significant seaborne trade. The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century. The testimony of European travelers such as [[Ludovico di Varthema]], [[Duarte Barbosa]] and [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] attest to the presence of a large number of wealthy Bengali merchants and shipowners in [[Malacca Sultanate|Malacca]].<ref name=\"Habib2011\">{{cite book |author=Irfan Habib |title=Economic History of Medieval India, 1200-1500 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K8kO4J3mXUAC&pg=PA185 |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson Education India |isbn=978-81-317-2791-1 |page=185 |author-link=Irfan Habib}}</ref> Historian Rila Mukherjee wrote that ports in Bengal may have been [[entrepot]]s, importing goods and re-exporting them to China.<ref name=\"Mukherjee2011\">{{cite book |author=Rila Mukherjee |year=2011 |title=Pelagic Passageways: The Northern Bay of Bengal Before Colonialism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7xeqhnYtrKcC&pg=PA30 |publisher=Primus Books |page=30 |isbn=978-93-80607-20-7 |quote=\"some of them [items exported from Bengal to China] were probably re-exports.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''. Bengali streets were well provided with eating establishments, drinking houses and bathhouses. At least six varieties of fine muslin cloth existed. Silk fabrics were also abundant.

The Abbasid caliph was still considered to be the symbolic leader of Sunni Islam at the time, despite dwindling territory under direct caliphate rule. For the Bengali Sultans, relations with the caliphate provided legitimacy among the Muslim clergy. For example, the [[religious conversion|converted Sultan]] [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]] received recognition from [[Al-Mu'tadid II]], which strengthened Jalaluddin's legitimacy in the eyes of the clergy.<ref name=\"banglapedia.org1\"/> Many coins minted by the Bengal Sultanate bore the names of both the Bengali Sultans and the Abbasid Caliphs.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Coins|chapter=Coins| title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh|author=Muhammad Rezaul Karim|publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref>\n[[File:Tribute Giraffe with Attendant.jpg|thumb|200px|Chinese manuscript ''Tribute Giraffe with Attendant'', depicting a giraffe presented by Bengali envoys to the Ming court (Philadelphia Museum of Art)]]\nSultan [[Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah]] sponsored the construction of [[madrasa]]s (Islamic theological schools) in the pilgrimage cities of [[Makkah]] and [[Madinah]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard M.

The [[Delhi Sultanate]] initially received tributes from the Bengal Sultanate between 1353 and 1359. Tributes stopped after a war and peace treaty in 1359. Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam sent envoys to the neighboring [[Jaunpur Sultanate]]. He sent elephants as gifts to Sultan Malik Sarwar Khwajah-i-Jahan.<ref name=\"banglapedia.org\"/> The two sultanates fought a war between 1415 and 1420.

[[Min Saw Mon]], a deposed Arakanese king, fled to Bengal after a Burmese invasion. With the support of Bengali forces led by a Pashtun general, he regained control of his country during the [[Reconquest of Arakan]]. The restored Arakanese realm became a vassal state of Bengal. A war with Arakan in 1459 led to the defeat of Bengali Sultan [[Rukunuddin Barbak Shah]]. The Arakanese developed an alliance with [[Portuguese Chittagong]] against Bengal. Despite achieving independence from the Sultans of Bengal, the Arakanese kings continued to fashion themselves after the Bengali Sultans by copying clothes, coins, titles and administrative techniques.

The first compartment was the royal court. The second was the living quarter of the Sultan. The third was the harem. A high wall enclosed the palace. A moat surrounded the palace on three sides and was connected to the Ganges. The city of Pandua developed from a small hamlet into a military garrison. It included imperial mosques and mausolea. Urban architecture in the Bengal Sultanate was based on Arab, Bengali, Persian, Indo-Turkish, and Byzantine influences. A glimpse of houses in the Bengal Sultanate can be seen in the ''Iskandar Nama'' (Book of Alexander) published by Sultan Nusrat Shah.<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref> There were significant indigenous developments.

The large number of mosques built during the Bengal Sultanate indicates the rapidity with which the local population converted to Islam. The period between 1450 and 1550 was an intensive mosque building era. These mosques dotted the countryside, ranged from small to medium sizes and were used for daily devotion. [[Ponds]] were often located beside a mosque. Arabic inscriptions in the mosques often include the name of the patron or builder. The most commonly cited verse from the Quran in inscriptions was Surah 72 ([[Al-Jinn]]).<ref name=\"Grabar1989\">{{cite book|author=Oleg Grabar|title=Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0NCAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA58|year=1989|publisher=Brill Archive|isbn=978-90-04-09050-7|pages=58\u201372|author-link=Oleg Grabar}}</ref> The buildings were made of brick or stone. The brick mosque with terracotta decoration represented a grand structure in the Bengal Sultanate. They were often the gift of a wealthy patron and the fruit of extraordinary effort, which would not be found in every Muslim neighborhood.<ref name=\"Grabar1989\"/> Mosques were built across the length and breadth of the Bengal Sultanate. The highest concentration of mosques from the Bengal Sultanate can be found in the [[North Bengal]] regions of Bangladesh and Indian West Bengal. A [[Mosque City of Bagerhat|mosque city]] developed near the southwestern Bengali Sundarbans forest as a result of the patronization of Governor Khan Jahan Ali. In 1985, UNESCO designated the city as a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/321/|title=Historic Mosque City of Bagerhat|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> In central areas, the [[Pathrail Mosque]] in [[Faridpur District|Faridpur]] is one of the best-preserved sultanate-era structures. In the northeast, the [[Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid]] in [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] is a well-preserved structure of the Bengal Sultanate. In the northeastern Indian state of [[Assam]], the [[Panbari Mosque]] was built during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah. Other mosques can be found in southern West Bengal and the Indian state of [[Bihar]], such as the [[Sayed Jamaluddin Mosque]]. In the southeast, the Santikan Mosque (built in the 1430s) stands in ruins in Rakhine State (formerly [[Arakan]]) of [[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/06/150625-myanmar-burma-rohingya-refugees-archaeology-world/|title=Lost Myanmar Empire Is Stage for Modern Violence|date=2015-06-26|website=National Geographic News|language=en|access-date=2019-12-31}}</ref> \n\nImperial mosques had an in-built throne for the Sultan.

Initially, [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] were erected based on Iranian models, such as the [[Tomb of Cyrus]]. Sarcophagi would include mihrabs and arches resembling the architecture in Adina Mosque. For example, the tomb of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah in Sonargaon has features similar to the architecture of Adina Mosque built by his father Sultan Sikandar Shah. An indigenous Islamic mausolea style developed with the [[Eklakhi Mausoleum]], which is the royal tomb chamber of Sultan Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah.

It began with [[Bakhtiar Khilji]]'s conquest of Gauda between 1202 and 1204 during the reign of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. The Delhi Sultan [[Iltumish]] declared Bengal as a province of Delhi in 1225. The Delhi Sultans attempted to govern Bengal through appointed governors, however Delhi could not succeed given the considerable overland distance with Bengal. Ambitious governors rebelled and ruled as independent rulers until being suppressed militarily by the Delhi Sultanate. However, there were capable rulers among the rebels, including Yuzbak Shah (1257), Tughral Khan (1271-1282), and [[Shamsuddin Firoz Shah]] (1301-1322). The latter achieved the [[Conquest of Sylhet]] and established a strong administration in eastern and south-western Bengal. In 1325, the Delhi Sultan [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] reorganized the province into three administrative regions, with [[Sonargaon]] ruling eastern Bengal; [[Gauda (city)|Gauda]] ruling northern Bengal; and [[Satgaon]] ruling southern Bengal. Even this arrangement broke down. By 1338, the three administrative regions had separatist [[Sultan]]s, including [[Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah]] in Sonargaon; [[Alauddin Ali Shah]] in Gauda, and [[Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah]] in Satgaon.<ref name=\"Kunal Chakrabarti 2013 p. 12\">Kunal Chakrabarti; Shubhra Chakrabarti (22 August 2013).

Due to the riverine geography and climate, it was not feasible to use cavalry throughout the year in Bengal. The cavalry was probably the weakest component of the Bengal Sultanate's army, as the horses had to be imported from foreign countries. The artillery was an important section. Portuguese historian [[Jo\u00e3o de Barros]] opined that the military supremacy of Bengal over Arakan and Tripura was due to its efficient artillery.

Apart from carrying war materials, elephants were also used for the movement of the armed personnel. In riverine Bengal the usefulness of elephants, though very slow, could not be minimised. The navy was of prime necessity in riverine Bengal. In fact, the cavalry could ensure the hold over this country for a period of six months whereas the boats backed by the paiks could command supremacy over the other half of the year. Since the time of Iwaz Khalji, who first organised a naval force in Islamic Bengal, the war boats played an important role in the political affairs of the country. The chief of the admiralty had various responsibilities, including [[Shipbuilding in Bangladesh|shipbuilding]], river transport, to fit out strong boats for transporting war elephants; to recruit seamen; to patrol the rivers and to collect tolls at ghats. The efficiency of the navy eroded during the Hussain Shahi dynasty.

Later, Bengal and Arakan fought several wars for control of Chittagong. Arakan asserted its independence as a coastal power. During the Hussain Shahi dynasty, Bengali sovereignty was restored in Chittagong and northern Arakan. However, the Arakanese allied with Portuguese pirates to reduce Bengali control over Chittagong.  \n\n====Sher Shah Suri's invasion====\n{{See also|Suri Empire}}\nBengal was overwhelmed during the pan-Indian invasion of [[Sher Shah Suri]] and became part of the Suri Empire.

[[Ma Huan]]'s testimony of a flourishing shipbuilding industry was part of the evidence that Bengal enjoyed significant seaborne trade. The expansion of [[muslin]] production, [[sericulture]] and the emergence of several other crafts were indicated in Ma Huan's list of items exported from Bengal to China. Bengali shipping co-existed with Chinese shipping until the latter withdrew from the Indian Ocean in the mid-15th-century.

The shipbuilding tradition is evidenced in the sultanate's naval campaigns in the Ganges delta. The trade between Bengal and the Maldives, based on rice and cowry shells, was probably done on Arab-style [[baghlah]] ships. Chinese accounts point to Bengali ships being prominent in Southeast Asian waters. A vessel from Bengal, probably owned by the Sultan of Bengal, could accommodate three tribute missions- from Bengal, [[Brunei]] and Sumatra- and was evidently the only vessel capable of such a task.

Vegetables included ginger, mustard, onions, and garlic among others. There were four types of wines, including coconut, rice, ''tarry'' and ''kajang''. Bengali streets were well provided with eating establishments, drinking houses and bathhouses. At least six varieties of fine muslin cloth existed. Silk fabrics were also abundant.

It was the preferred language of the aristocracy and the [[Sufi]]s. Thousands of Persian books and manuscripts were published in Bengal. The earliest Persian work compiled in Bengal was a translation of Amrtakunda from Sanskrit by Qadi Ruknu'd-Din Abu Hamid Muhammad bin Muhammad al-'Amidi of Samarqand, a famous Hanafi jurist and Sufi. During the reign of Ghiyasuddin Azam Shah, the city of [[Sonargaon]] became an important centre of [[Persian literature]], with many publications of prose and poetry. The period is described as the \"[[golden age]] of Persian literature in Bengal\". Its stature is illustrated by the Sultan's own correspondence with the Persian poet [[Hafez]].

The invocation tradition saw Islamic figures replacing the invocation of Hindu gods and goddesses in Bengali texts. The literary romantic tradition saw poems by [[Shah Muhammad Sagir]] on [[Yusuf and Zulaikha]], as well as works of Bahram Khan and Sabirid Khan. The ''[[Dobhashi]]'' culture featured the use of [[Arabic]] and Persian words in Bengali texts to illustrate Muslim stories. [[Epic poetry]] included ''Nabibangsha'' by [[Syed Sultan]], ''Janganama'' by [[Abdul Hakim (poet)|Abdul Hakim]] and ''Rasul Bijay'' by Shah Barid.
