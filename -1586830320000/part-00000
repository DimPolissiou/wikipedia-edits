[[Demography]] is a [[social science]] which entails the statistical study of populations. \nPopulation, in a more simple term, is the number of people in a city or town, region, country or world; population is usually determined by a process called census (a process of collecting, analyzing, compiling and publishing data).\n\n== Population genetics (ecology) ==\nIn [[population genetics]] a sex population is a set of organisms in which any pair of members can [[Breeding in the wild|breed]] together. This means that they can regularly exchange gametes to produce normally-fertile offspring, and such a breeding group is also known therefore as a ''Gamo deme''. This also implies that all members belong to the same species.<ref>{{cite book | last=Hartl | first=Daniel | title=Principles of Population Genetics | publisher=[[Sinauer Associates]] | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-87893-308-2 | page=95}}</ref>\nIf the Gamo deme is very large (theoretically, approaching infinity), and all gene alleles are uniformly distributed by the gametes within it, the Gamo deme is said to be panmictic. Under this state, [[allele]] ([[gamete]]) frequencies can be converted to genotype ([[zygote]]) frequencies by expanding an appropriate [[quadratic equation]], as shown by Sir [[Ronald Fisher]] in his establishment of quantitative genetics.<ref>{{cite book | last=Fisher | first=R. A. | title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-19-850440-5}}</ref>\n\nThis seldom occurs in Nature: localization of gamete exchange \u2013 through dispersal limitations, preferential mating, cataclysm, or other cause \u2013 may lead to small actual Gamo demes which exchange gametes reasonably uniformly within themselves but are virtually separated from their neighboring Gamo demes. However, there may be low frequencies of exchange with these neighbors. This may be viewed as the breaking up of a large sexual population (panmictic) into smaller overlapping sexual populations. This failure of [[panmixia]] leads to two important changes in overall population structure: (1) the component Gamo demos vary (through gamete sampling) in their allele frequencies when compared with each other and with the theoretical panmictic original (this is known as dispersion, and its details can be estimated using expansion of an appropriate [[binomial equation]]); and (2) the level of homozygosity rises in the entire collection of Gamo demes. The overall rise in homozygosity is quantified by the inbreeding coefficient (''f'' or ''\u03c6''). Note that all homozygotes are increased in frequency \u2013 both the deleterious and the desirable. The mean phenotype of the Gamo demes collection is lower than that of the panmictic original \u2013 which is known as inbreeding depression. It is most important to note, however, that some dispersion lines will be superior to the panmictic original, while some will be about the same, and some will be inferior. The probabilities of each can be estimated from those binomial equations. In [[plant breeding|plant]] and [[animal breeding]], procedures have been developed which deliberately utilize the effects of dispersion (such as line breeding, pure-line breeding, backcrossing). It can be shown that dispersion-assisted selection leads to the greatest genetic advance (''\u0394G''=change in the phenotypic mean), and is much more powerful than selection acting without attendant dispersion.

In the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its increasing effects on poverty, [[environmental degradation]], and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates. While population control can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's one-child per family policy, have resorted to coercive measures. To control of population structure,it measures through efficient mixed-model association (EMMA) method, which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping.<ref>http://www.genetics.org/content/178/3/1709</ref>\n\nIn the 1978s, stress increased between population control advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's [[reproductive rights]] as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/2 2] |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref> Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/4 4]\u20135 |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Community (ecology)]]\n* [[List of countries by population]]\n* [[Lists of organisms by population]]\n* [[Human overpopulation]]\n* [[Population geography]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.unfpa.org/ UNFPA, The United Nations Population Fund]\n* [https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm United Nations Population Division]\n* [http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/IndexPublications.htm CICRED homepage] a platform for interaction between research centres and international organizations, such as the United Nations Population Division, [[UNFPA]], [[WHO]] and [[FAO]].\n* [http://www.prb.org/ Population Reference Bureau] analyzes demographic data and research providing objective, accurate, and up-to-date population information in accessible formats.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205020959/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html Current World Population]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301130913/http://www.necsp.org/ NECSP HomePage]\n* [http://www.overpopulation.info/ Overpopulation]\n*[https://proenglishessay.com/essay-on-population/ Population Matters]\n* [http://www.populationworld.com/ Population World: Population of World].

Historically, human population control has been implemented with the goal of decreasing the rate of population growth. In the period from the 1950s to the 1980s, concerns about global population growth and its increasing effects on poverty, [[environmental degradation]], and political stability led to efforts to reduce population growth rates. While population control can involve measures that improve people's lives by giving them greater control of their reproduction, a few programs, most notably the Chinese government's one-child per family policy, have resorted to coercive measures. To control of population structure,it measures through efficient mixed-model association (EMMA) method, which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping.<ref>http://www.genetics.org/content/178/3/1709</ref>\n\nIn the 1978s, stress increased between population control advocates and women's health activists who advanced women's [[reproductive rights]] as part of a [[human rights]]-based approach.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/2 2] |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref> Growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant change in population control policies in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Reproductive Rights in a Global Context |last= Knudsen |first=Lara |year=2006 |publisher= Vanderbilt University Press |isbn=978-0-8265-1528-5 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud/page/4 4]\u20135 |url=https://archive.org/details/reproductiverigh0000knud |url-access=registration |quote=reproductive rights. }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Community (ecology)]]\n* [[List of countries by population]]\n* [[Lists of organisms by population]]\n* [[Human overpopulation]]\n* [[Population geography]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.unfpa.org/ UNFPA, The United Nations Population Fund]\n* [https://www.un.org/esa/population/unpop.htm United Nations Population Division]\n* [http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Publications/IndexPublications.htm CICRED homepage] a platform for interaction between research centres and international organizations, such as the United Nations Population Division, [[UNFPA]], [[WHO]] and [[FAO]].\n* [http://www.prb.org/ Population Reference Bureau] analyzes demographic data and research providing objective, accurate, and up-to-date population information in accessible formats.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080205020959/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/popclockworld.html Current World Population]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070301130913/http://www.necsp.org/ NECSP HomePage]\n* [http://www.overpopulation.info/ Overpopulation]\n*[https://proenglishessay.com/essay-on-population/ Population Matters]\n* [http://www.populationworld.com/ Population World: Population of World].
