The film focuses on a team whose mission is to drill to the center of the Earth and set off a series of [[nuclear weapon|nuclear explosions]] in order to restart the rotation of the [[Structure of the Earth|Earth's core]]. The film was released on March 28, 2003 by [[Paramount Pictures]].\n\n==Plot==\n[[Geophysics|Geophysicist]] Dr. Josh Keyes ([[Aaron Eckhart]]) and scientists Dr. Serge Leveque ([[Tch\u00e9ky Karyo]]) and Dr. Conrad Zimsky ([[Stanley Tucci]]) become aware of an instability of [[Earth's magnetic field]] after a series of bizarre incidents across the globe. They determine that the Earth's molten core, which generates this field, has stopped rotating and that, within a year, the field will collapse, exposing the planet's surface directly to devastating solar radiation. Backed by the U.S. government, Keyes, Leveque, and Zimsky create a plan to bore down to the core and set off several [[nuclear explosion]]s to restart the rotation. They gain the help of rogue scientist Dr. Ed \"Braz\" Brazzelton ([[Delroy Lindo]]), who has devised a vessel made of \"[[Unobtainium]]\" that can withstand the heat and pressure within the Earth's crust and convert it to energy, as well as a laser-driven boring system that will allow them to quickly pass through the crust.\n\nConstruction starts immediately on the ''[[Virgil]]'', a multi-compartment vessel to be helmed by [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] pilots [[Commander]] Robert Iverson ([[Bruce Greenwood]]) and [[Major]] Rebecca \"Beck\" Childs ([[Hilary Swank]]), who will join Keyes and the others. To prevent a worldwide panic, Keyes enlists computer [[hacker]] Theodore Donald \"Rat\" Finch ([[DJ Qualls]]) to scour the Internet and eliminate all traces of the pending disaster or their plan.\n\n''Virgil'' is launched through the [[Marianas Trench]] from an offshore platform. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty [[geode]] structure {{convert|700|mi|km}} below the surface, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base and cracking the geode's structure and causing magma to flow in from above. The crew repairs and restarts the laser array in time, but before they can return to the ship, Iverson is killed by a falling crystal shard that hits him in the helmet.  As ''Virgil'' continues, it clips a huge diamond that breaches the hull of the last compartment. Leveque sacrifices himself to save the nuclear launch codes before the compartment is crushed by extreme pressure.\n\nMeanwhile, on the surface, the public becomes aware of problems after a lightning superstorm and an unfiltered patch of ultra-violet radiation from the sun destroy [[Rome]] and [[San Francisco]], respectively.\n''Virgil'' eventually reaches the [[Earth's outer core|molten core]], and, as they take readings, they discover that the density of the core is far different from what they expected, which will not allow their plan to work. Finch is unable to stop worldwide panic but instead learns of the top-secret project \"DESTINI\" (Deep Earth Seismic Trigger INItiative), which is the government's 'secondary protocol' and will be deployed should the ''Virgil'' mission fail. Finch relays his information to Keyes, who discovers that Zimsky was one of DESTINI's lead scientists. DESTINI, according to Zimsky, was designed as a weapon to propagate earthquakes through the Earth's core, but its first activation unintentionally stopped its rotation instead. Zimsky reveals the government will use it again to attempt a restart of the core. Keyes is convinced it will have disastrous results and has Finch hack into DESTINI's system and cut its power supply to buy the ''Virgil'' more time.\n\nThe ''Virgil'' team formulates an alternative plan, and calculates that by splitting their nuclear weapons into the remaining compartments and jettisoning each at specific distances, they can create a \"[[ripple effect]]\", where the power of each bomb will push against the blast of the next, generating the energy required to restart the core. However, because ''Virgil'' was not designed to jettison undamaged compartments, the plan requires someone to deactivate a safety switch that is in an area exposed to the extreme temperatures. Braz volunteers and deactivates the switch, dying shortly afterwards.\n\nKeyes and Zimsky race to reset the nuclear charges, and Zimsky gets trapped in one of the detaching compartments. Keyes believes they still may have too little yield, but Zimsky suggests they use the ship's nuclear fuel source as well, which will leave the ''Virgil'' powerless; Zimsky then forces Keyes out of the compartment before it closes, sacrificing himself. Keyes deploys the nuclear core in the last compartment and detaches it just as the triggered detonations start, and then the core's rotation is restarted. Drifting powerless in the core, Keyes and Childs realize they can use the unobtainium shell to convert the heat and pressure from the wavefront to power the ''Virgil'', and they are able to escape from the Earth's core.\n\nThey break through the crust underwater, leaving them safe on the ocean floor, but power and communications are offline. They believe themselves lost underwater but use the remaining power to activate a weak sonar beacon. The beacon attracts a nearby whale pod, and Finch is able to trace their [[whale sound|whale songs]] to locate the ''Virgil''. A week after the mission, Finch unleashes the full details of the mission, (including those lost), and of DESTINI to the public via the Internet. As a result, the ''Virgil'' crew is hailed as heroes, and the government is forced to answer questions about DESTINI.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Aaron Eckhart]] as Dr. Joshua \"Josh\" Keyes, a scientist and professor at the [[University of Chicago]] who designs the navigation system for ''Virgil'' and is assigned as head of the project.\n* [[Hilary Swank]] as [[Major (United States)|Major]] Rebecca \"Beck\" Childs, [[United States Air Force|USAF]], an astronaut who distinguished herself during an emergency crash landing of the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] in Los Angeles, California, a result of the magnetic instability.\n* [[Delroy Lindo]] as Dr. Edward \"Braz\" Brazzelton, the designer of ''Virgil'' and the ultrasonic laser.\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dr. Conrad Zimsky, Earth specialist and designer of Project D.E.S.T.INI, based in London.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader Raul Masvidal. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and introduced him to Buddhist philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nMasvidal co-founded Cynic with drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in the late 80\u2019s, having released four demos from 1988-1991 that circulated in the underground tape trading community. Masvidal developed a reputation in the South Florida music scene for his musicianship and attention began to grow quickly around the band. In 1989, while still in high school, Masvidal toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]], but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular act, but Masvidal persevered with Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990. In 1991, Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert were recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''. In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the album as the 70th greatest metal album of all time<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/|title=The 100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time|last=Christe|first=Christopher R.

Roadrunner released a reissue of Focus in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Cynic took a 12 year hiatus in 1995 after recording \"''The Portal Tapes\"'' demos. Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]], where he also began work as a session musician and composer for network TV and film. \n\n[[File:Aeon Spoke Band.jpg|thumb|152x152px|[[\u00c6on Spoke]]|alt=]]During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded [[\u00c6on Spoke]], whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio.

OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles.

In [[ancient Mesopotamia]], many rulers of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Sumer]] were absolute monarchs as well. In ancient and medieval India, rulers of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]], [[Gupta]], [[Chola]] and [[Chalukya]] Empires, as well as other major and minor empires, were considered absolute monarchs. In the [[Khmer Empire]], the kings were called '[[Devaraja]]' and '[[Chakravartin]]' (King of the world), and exercised absolute power over the empire and people.\n\nThroughout [[Imperial China]], many [[Emperor of China|emperors]] and one empress ([[Wu Zetian]]) wielded absolute power through the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In [[pre-Columbian America]], the [[Inca Empire]] was ruled by a [[Sapa Inca]], who was considered the son of [[Inti]], the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation. Korea under the [[Joseon dynasty]] and short-lived [[Korean Empire|empire]] was also an absolute monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vWNNWVwaUpMC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy#v=onepage&q=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&f=false|title=Interior Space and Furniture of Joseon Upper-class Houses|first=Sang-hun|last=Choi|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|via=Google Books|page=16|quote=Joseon was an absolute monarchy|isbn=9788973007202}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nThroughout much of European history, the [[divine right of kings]] was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs, claimed [[Tsarist autocracy|supreme autocratic power]] by divine right, and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power. [[James I of England|James VI]] of [[Scotland]] (later also James I of [[England]]) and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of Scotland and England tried to import this principle. Charles I's attempt to enforce [[episcopal polity]] on the [[Church of Scotland]] led to rebellion by the [[Covenanter]]s and the [[Bishops' Wars]], then fears that Charles I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the [[English Civil War]], despite the fact that he did rule this way for 11 years starting in 1629, after dissolving the [[Parliament of England]] for a time. By the 19th century, the Divine Right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the [[Western world]], except in Russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the Tsar's power until [[February Revolution]] in 1917.\n\nThere is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as [[Perry Anderson]], argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism.<ref>Mettam, Roger.  ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', 1991.</ref>  In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of ''absolutism'' argue that most monarchs labeled as ''absolutist'' exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other ''non-absolutist'' rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist [[rhetoric]] of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs.  Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:\n{{quote|Nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble, unable to tap the wealth of those ablest to pay, and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate income.<ref>Bouwsma, William J., in Kimmel, Michael S. ''Absolutism and Its Discontents: State and Society in Seventeenth-Century France and England''.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1988, 15</ref>|William Bouwsma}}\n\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire]], many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their title, the \"Shadow of God on Earth\".\n\n====Denmark\u2013Norway====\nAbsolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 {{lang-da|Kongeloven|lit=King's Law|label=none}} of [[Denmark-Norway]], which ordered that the Monarch {{Quote|shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |title=Kongeloven af 1665 |publisher=Danske konger |language=da |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330135036/http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |archivedate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>A partial English translation of the law can be found in Ernst Ekman, \"The Danish Royal Law of 1665\" pp. 102-107 in: ''The Journal of Modern History'', 1957, vol. 2.</ref>}} This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the [[Rigsraad|Council of the Realm]] in Denmark. Absolute monarchy lasted until [[1814 in Norway|1814]] in Norway, and [[1848 in Denmark|1848]] in Denmark.\n\n====Habsburgs====\n{{See|House of Habsburg}}\n\n====Hungary====\n{{See|King of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary}}\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Absolute monarchy in France}}\n{{Weasel words|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis XIV of France]]]]\nThough some historians{{who|date=October 2018}}<!-- It's true that he almost certainly didn't say it, but you can't just say \"some historians\" and not specify.

More recently, revisionist historians{{who|date=October 2018}} have questioned whether Louis' reign should be considered 'absolute',{{Such as?|date=October 2018}} given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility.<ref>Mettam, R. ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988.</ref>{{Request quotation|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe King of France concentrated legislative, executive, and judicial powers in his person. He was the supreme judicial authority. He could condemn people to death without the right of appeal. It was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.<ref>Mousnier, R. ''The Institutions of France under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-2012 V1.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref>\n\n====Prussia====\nIn [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the \"first servant of the state\", but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of Absolutism. [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] (r. 1640\u20131688), known as the Great Elector, used the uncertainties of the final stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} to consolidate his territories into the dominant kingdom in northern Germany, whilst increasing his power over his subjects. His actions largely originated the militaristic streak of the [[Hohenzollern]].\n\nIn 1653 the Diet of Brandenburg met for the last time and gave Frederick William the power to raise taxes without its consent, a strong indicator of absolutism.{{dispute-inline|date=December 2018}} Frederick William enjoyed support from the nobles, who enabled the Great Elector to undermine the Diet and other representative assemblies. The leading families saw their future in cooperation with the central government and worked to establish absolutist power.\n\nThe most significant indicator of the nobles' success was the establishment of two tax rates \u2013 one for the cities and the other for the countryside &ndash; to the great advantage of the latter, which the nobles ruled. The nobles served in the upper levels of the elector's army and bureaucracy, but they also won new prosperity for themselves. The support of the Elector enabled the imposition of serfdom and the consolidation of land holdings into vast estates which provided for their wealth.\n\nThey became known as [[Junker]]s (from the German for young lord, ''junger Herr''). Frederick William faced resistance from representative assemblies and long-independent cities in his realm. City leaders often revolted at the imposition of Electorate authority. The last notable effort was the uprising of the city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] which allied with the Estates General of Prussia to refuse to pay taxes. Frederick William crushed this revolt in 1662, by marching into the city with thousands of troops. A similar approach was used with the towns of Cleves.<ref>''The Western Experience'', Seventh Edition, Boston: [[McGraw-Hill]], 1999.</ref>\n\n====Russia====\nUntil 1905 the [[Tsar]]s and [[Emperor of All Russia|Emperors]] of [[Russia]] governed as absolute monarchs. [[Ivan IV|Ivan the Terrible]] was known for his reign of terror through [[oprichnina]]. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] reduced the power of the [[Boyar|Russian nobility]] and strengthened the central power of the monarch, establishing a bureaucracy and a [[police state]]. This tradition of absolutism, known as [[Tsarist autocracy]], was expanded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II the Great]] and her descendants. Although [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made some reforms and established an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]]. However, the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in Russia that the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] still described the monarch as an autocrat. Russia became the last [[Europe]]an country (excluding [[Vatican City]]) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the [[Ottoman Empire]] drafted its first constitution in 1877).\n\n====Sweden====\nThe form of government instituted in [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] under King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] and passed on to his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy; however, the Swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense that he wielded [[arbitrary power]]. The monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]; rather, the absolutism introduced was the monarch's ability to run the government unfettered by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|privy council]], contrary to earlier practice. The absolute rule of Charles XI was instituted by the crown and the Riksdag in order to carry out the [[Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility. After the death of Charles XII in 1718, the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the [[Great Northern War]], and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum, ushering in the [[Age of Liberty]]. After half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] seized back royal power in the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1772, and later once again abolished the privy council under the [[Union and Security Act]] in 1789, which, in turn, was rendered void in 1809 when [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] was deposed in a coup and the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|constitution of 1809]] was put in its place. The years between 1789 and 1809, then, are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy.\n\n==Contemporary trends==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\n\nMany nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Morocco]], have moved towards [[constitutional monarchy]], although in these cases the monarch still retains tremendous power, to the point that the parliament's influence on political life is negligible.\n\nIn [[Bhutan]], the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the [[Tshogdu]] in 2003, and the [[2008 Bhutanese National Assembly election|election of a National Assembly in 2008]].\n\n[[Nepal]] had several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the [[Nepalese Civil War]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist insurgency]], and the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]], with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on May 28, 2008.\n\nIn [[Tonga]], the [[King of Tonga|King]] had majority control of the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Legislative Assembly]] until 2010.\n\n[[Liechtenstein]] has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch: the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] was given expanded powers after a [[2003 Liechtenstein constitutional referendum|referendum]] amending the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] in 2003, which led the BBC to describe the prince as an \"absolute monarch again\".<ref name=\"Liechtenstein\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm |title=Liechtenstein prince wins powers |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2015-10-26 |date=2003-03-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] of [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' absolute monarchy<ref>Young W.

In [[ancient Mesopotamia]], many rulers of [[Assyria]], [[Babylonia]] and [[Sumer]] were absolute monarchs as well. In ancient and medieval India, rulers of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana Dynasty|Satavahana]], [[Gupta]], [[Chola]] and [[Chalukya]] Empires, as well as other major and minor empires, were considered absolute monarchs. In the [[Khmer Empire]], the kings were called '[[Devaraja]]' and '[[Chakravartin]]' (King of the world), and exercised absolute power over the empire and people.\n\nThroughout [[Imperial China]], many [[Emperor of China|emperors]] and one empress ([[Wu Zetian]]) wielded absolute power through the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In [[pre-Columbian America]], the [[Inca Empire]] was ruled by a [[Sapa Inca]], who was considered the son of [[Inti]], the sun god and absolute ruler over the people and nation. Korea under the [[Joseon dynasty]] and short-lived [[Korean Empire|empire]] was also an absolute monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vWNNWVwaUpMC&pg=PA16&lpg=PA16&dq=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy#v=onepage&q=joseon+dynasty+absolute+monarchy&f=false|title=Interior Space and Furniture of Joseon Upper-class Houses|first=Sang-hun|last=Choi|date=27 October 2017|publisher=Ewha Womans University Press|via=Google Books|page=16|quote=Joseon was an absolute monarchy|isbn=9788973007202}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nThroughout much of European history, the [[divine right of kings]] was the theological justification for absolute monarchy. Many European monarchs, claimed [[Tsarist autocracy|supreme autocratic power]] by divine right, and that their subjects had no rights to limit their power. [[James I of England|James VI]] of [[Scotland]] (later also James I of [[England]]) and his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] of Scotland and England tried to import this principle. Charles I's attempt to enforce [[episcopal polity]] on the [[Church of Scotland]] led to rebellion by the [[Covenanter]]s and the [[Bishops' Wars]], then fears that Charles I was attempting to establish absolutist government along European lines was a major cause of the [[English Civil War]], despite the fact that he did rule this way for 11 years starting in 1629, after dissolving the [[Parliament of England]] for a time. By the 19th century, the Divine Right was regarded as an obsolete theory in most countries in the [[Western world]], except in Russia where it was still given credence as the official justification for the Tsar's power until [[February Revolution]] in 1917.\n\nThere is a considerable variety of opinion by historians on the extent of absolutism among European monarchs. Some, such as [[Perry Anderson]], argue that quite a few monarchs achieved levels of absolutist control over their states, while historians such as Roger Mettam dispute the very concept of absolutism.<ref>Mettam, Roger.  ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', 1991.</ref>  In general, historians who disagree with the appellation of ''absolutism'' argue that most monarchs labeled as ''absolutist'' exerted no greater power over their subjects than any other ''non-absolutist'' rulers, and these historians tend to emphasize the differences between the absolutist [[rhetoric]] of monarchs and the realities of the effective use of power by these absolute monarchs.  Renaissance historian William Bouwsma summed up this contradiction:\n{{quote|Nothing so clearly indicates the limits of royal power as the fact that governments were perennially in financial trouble, unable to tap the wealth of those ablest to pay, and likely to stir up a costly revolt whenever they attempted to develop an adequate income.<ref>Bouwsma, William J., in Kimmel, Michael S. ''Absolutism and Its Discontents: State and Society in Seventeenth-Century France and England''.  New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Books, 1988, 15</ref>|William Bouwsma}}\n\nIn the [[Ottoman Empire]], many sultans wielded absolute power through heavenly mandates reflected in their title, the \"Shadow of God on Earth\".\n\n====Denmark\u2013Norway====\nAbsolutism was underpinned by a written constitution for the first time in Europe in 1665 {{lang-da|Kongeloven|lit=King's Law|label=none}} of [[Denmark-Norway]], which ordered that the Monarch {{Quote|shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |title=Kongeloven af 1665 |publisher=Danske konger |language=da |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330135036/http://danskekonger.dk/kilder/kongeloven |archivedate=2012-03-30}}</ref><ref>A partial English translation of the law can be found in Ernst Ekman, \"The Danish Royal Law of 1665\" pp. 102-107 in: ''The Journal of Modern History'', 1957, vol. 2.</ref>}} This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the [[Rigsraad|Council of the Realm]] in Denmark. Absolute monarchy lasted until [[1814 in Norway|1814]] in Norway, and [[1848 in Denmark|1848]] in Denmark.\n\n====Habsburgs====\n{{See|House of Habsburg}}\n\n====Hungary====\n{{See|King of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary}}\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Absolute monarchy in France}}\n{{Weasel words|section|date=December 2019}}\n[[File:Louis XIV of France.jpg|thumb|right|[[Louis XIV of France]]]]\nThough some historians{{who|date=October 2018}}<!-- It's true that he almost certainly didn't say it, but you can't just say \"some historians\" and not specify.

More recently, revisionist historians{{who|date=October 2018}} have questioned whether Louis' reign should be considered 'absolute',{{Such as?|date=October 2018}} given the reality of the balance of power between the monarch and the nobility.<ref>Mettam, R. ''Power and Faction in Louis XIV's France'', Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1988.</ref>{{Request quotation|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe King of France concentrated legislative, executive, and judicial powers in his person. He was the supreme judicial authority. He could condemn people to death without the right of appeal. It was both his duty to punish offenses and stop them from being committed. From his judicial authority followed his power both to make laws and to annul them.<ref>Mousnier, R. ''The Institutions of France under the Absolute Monarchy, 1598-2012 V1.'' Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1979.</ref>\n\n====Prussia====\nIn [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], the concept of absolute monarch took a notable turn from the above with its emphasis on the monarch as the \"first servant of the state\", but it also echoed many of the important characteristics of Absolutism. [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] (r. 1640\u20131688), known as the Great Elector, used the uncertainties of the final stages of the [[Thirty Years' War]]{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} to consolidate his territories into the dominant kingdom in northern Germany, whilst increasing his power over his subjects. His actions largely originated the militaristic streak of the [[Hohenzollern]].\n\nIn 1653 the Diet of Brandenburg met for the last time and gave Frederick William the power to raise taxes without its consent, a strong indicator of absolutism.{{dispute-inline|date=December 2018}} Frederick William enjoyed support from the nobles, who enabled the Great Elector to undermine the Diet and other representative assemblies. The leading families saw their future in cooperation with the central government and worked to establish absolutist power.\n\nThe most significant indicator of the nobles' success was the establishment of two tax rates \u2013 one for the cities and the other for the countryside &ndash; to the great advantage of the latter, which the nobles ruled. The nobles served in the upper levels of the elector's army and bureaucracy, but they also won new prosperity for themselves. The support of the Elector enabled the imposition of serfdom and the consolidation of land holdings into vast estates which provided for their wealth.\n\nThey became known as [[Junker]]s (from the German for young lord, ''junger Herr''). Frederick William faced resistance from representative assemblies and long-independent cities in his realm. City leaders often revolted at the imposition of Electorate authority. The last notable effort was the uprising of the city of [[K\u00f6nigsberg]] which allied with the Estates General of Prussia to refuse to pay taxes. Frederick William crushed this revolt in 1662, by marching into the city with thousands of troops. A similar approach was used with the towns of Cleves.<ref>''The Western Experience'', Seventh Edition, Boston: [[McGraw-Hill]], 1999.</ref>\n\n====Russia====\nUntil 1905 the [[Tsar]]s and [[Emperor of All Russia|Emperors]] of [[Russia]] governed as absolute monarchs. [[Ivan IV|Ivan the Terrible]] was known for his reign of terror through [[oprichnina]]. [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I the Great]] reduced the power of the [[Boyar|Russian nobility]] and strengthened the central power of the monarch, establishing a bureaucracy and a [[police state]]. This tradition of absolutism, known as [[Tsarist autocracy]], was expanded by [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II the Great]] and her descendants. Although [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] made some reforms and established an independent judicial system, Russia did not have a representative assembly or a constitution until the [[Russian Revolution of 1905|1905 Revolution]]. However, the concept of absolutism was so ingrained in Russia that the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] still described the monarch as an autocrat. Russia became the last [[Europe]]an country (excluding [[Vatican City]]) to abolish absolutism, and it was the only one to do so as late as the 20th century (the [[Ottoman Empire]] drafted its first constitution in 1877).\n\n====Sweden====\nThe form of government instituted in [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] under King [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]] and passed on to his son, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] is commonly referred to as absolute monarchy; however, the Swedish monarch was never absolute in the sense that he wielded [[arbitrary power]]. The monarch still ruled under the law and could only legislate in agreement with the [[Riksdag of the Estates]]; rather, the absolutism introduced was the monarch's ability to run the government unfettered by the [[Privy Council of Sweden|privy council]], contrary to earlier practice. The absolute rule of Charles XI was instituted by the crown and the Riksdag in order to carry out the [[Reduction (Sweden)|Great Reduction]] which would have been made impossible by the privy council which comprised the high nobility. After the death of Charles XII in 1718, the system of absolute rule was largely blamed for the ruination of the realm in the [[Great Northern War]], and the reaction tipped the balance of power to the other extreme end of the spectrum, ushering in the [[Age of Liberty]]. After half a century of largely unrestricted parliamentary rule proved just as ruinous, King [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustav III]] seized back royal power in the coup d'\u00e9tat of 1772, and later once again abolished the privy council under the [[Union and Security Act]] in 1789, which, in turn, was rendered void in 1809 when [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav IV Adolf]] was deposed in a coup and the [[Instrument of Government (1809)|constitution of 1809]] was put in its place. The years between 1789 and 1809, then, are also referred to as a period of absolute monarchy.\n\n==Contemporary trends==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2015}}\n\nMany nations formerly with absolute monarchies, such as [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Morocco]], have moved towards [[constitutional monarchy]], although in these cases the monarch still retains tremendous power, to the point that the parliament's influence on political life is negligible.\n\nIn [[Bhutan]], the government moved from absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy following planned parliamentary elections to the [[Tshogdu]] in 2003, and the [[2008 Bhutanese National Assembly election|election of a National Assembly in 2008]].\n\n[[Nepal]] had several swings between constitutional rule and direct rule related to the [[Nepalese Civil War]], the [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Maoist insurgency]], and the 2001 [[Nepalese royal massacre]], with the Nepalese monarchy being abolished on May 28, 2008.\n\nIn [[Tonga]], the [[King of Tonga|King]] had majority control of the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga|Legislative Assembly]] until 2010.\n\n[[Liechtenstein]] has moved towards expanding the power of the monarch: the [[Prince of Liechtenstein]] was given expanded powers after a [[2003 Liechtenstein constitutional referendum|referendum]] amending the [[Constitution of Liechtenstein]] in 2003, which led the BBC to describe the prince as an \"absolute monarch again\".<ref name=\"Liechtenstein\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2853991.stm |title=Liechtenstein prince wins powers |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2015-10-26 |date=2003-03-16}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|ruling Kim family]] of [[North Korea]] ([[Kim Il-sung]], [[Kim Jong-il]] and [[Kim Jong-un]]) has been described as a ''de facto'' absolute monarchy<ref>Young W.

The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, on the west side of the Fox River, the East Side, between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]].\n\nThe Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to a large collection of [[Sears Catalog Home]]s (over 50 homes) and [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes (seven homes). The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers arrived. They initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake brothers on the west side. The Lake brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archivedate=10 December 2008}}</ref> A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora.\n\nAurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\"/> In 1857, the two towns joined officially, incorporated as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| accessdate = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archivedate = 9 July 2012}}</ref> As representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, most public buildings were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.\n\nAs the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1856, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer, a rank it held until the 1960s. Railroad restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as the number of railroads reduced and they dropped lines for passenger traffic. Aurora at one time had regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad ran passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See \"Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864\u20131964\" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref>\n\nThe heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors\u2014a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops\u2014accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.\n\nThe city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse and continued until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it drew off retail businesses and manufacturing from downtown and the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, respectively, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs started to form.\n\nDuring this time Aurora became a much more ethnically diverse city. The Latino population began to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.\n\nToday, Aurora is an ethnically diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aurora picture.jpg|thumb|The Phillips Park 'Sunken Garden']]\n\nAurora is at {{Coord|41|45|50|N|88|17|24|W|display=inline}} (41.7637855, \u221288.2901352).<ref name=\"gnis\"/>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Aurora has an area of {{convert|45.799|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|44.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.12%) is land and {{convert|0.859|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.88%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n |accessdate=2015-12-25\n |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213041547/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |archive-date=2020-02-13\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nWhile the city has traditionally been regarded as being in [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], Aurora also includes parts of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties.

Its name is deceptive because it is actually the part of the city ''farthest'' from the Fox River and its valley.

Flooding occurred in almost every low-lying area in the city, and in neighborhoods bordering the Fox River, causing major damage in some neighborhoods. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.\n\nAurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the [[Aurora Downs|Aurora Driving Park]], a large recreation/amusement park and race track where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is today. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers \"Greatest Show on Earth\" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the supercell thunderstorm that produced the deadly [[1990 Plainfield tornado|Plainfield Tornado]] passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado, which touched down in nearby Oswego, less than 5 miles from downtown. The tornado then traveled through Plainfield and Joliet, killing 29 people.\n\nThe city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.\n\nAurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909.

The city is the final stop of the [[BNSF Railway Line|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] line of the [[Metra]] commuter rail system, allowing rail service into [[Chicago]].  The city also has a stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra)|Rt. 59 station]] on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The [[BNSF Railroad]] owns and maintains a [[rail yard]] in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.\n\n[[Pace (transit)|Pace Suburban Bus]] operates local bus service in Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities and village such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles. [[Metra]] trains and Pace buses stop at the [[Aurora (Metra)|Aurora Transportation Center]].

The closest Amtrak station is in [[Naperville station|Napervile]]. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s in favor of regional bus service. Aurora also had an extensive [[Tram|streetcar]] system, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], that served most neighborhoods. Aurora was served by a number of [[interurban]] lines, the most prominent of which was the [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]] which provided service into Chicago. The [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]] would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.\n\nThe [[Aurora Municipal Airport (Illinois)|Aurora Municipal Airport]] is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora's west side.\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:Rush-Copley Medical Center.JPG|thumb|[[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]]]]\nAurora has two hospitals, one on the west side, Presence Mercy Medical Center, and one in Fox Valley, [[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]].\n\nThere are other area hospitals, including Edward Hospital in Naperville, Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Central DuPage in Winfield and a Level 1 Trauma center at Good Samaritan in Downers Grove.\n\nAurora had three hospitals, St. Joseph Hospital, on the west side, St. Charles hospital, east of downtown, and Copley Memorial Hospital, on the east side. St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble.\n\n[https://archive.today/20130110200534/http://www.dreyermed.com/ Dreyer Medical Clinic] and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city.

According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.\n\nDue to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents \u2013 some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.\n\nThe [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.\n\nAurora is also home to other private schools.

The city is divided into three regions, the West Side, on the west side of the Fox River, the East Side, between the eastern bank of the Fox River and the Kane/DuPage County line, and the Far East Side/Fox Valley, which is from the County Line to the city's eastern border with [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]].\n\nThe Aurora area has some significant architecture, including structures by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Bruce Goff]] and [[George Grant Elmslie]]. Aurora is also home to a large collection of [[Sears Catalog Home]]s (over 50 homes) and [[Lustron house|Lustron]] all-steel homes (seven homes). The Hollywood Casino Aurora, a dockside gaming facility with {{convert|53,000|sqft|m2}} and 1,200 gaming positions, is located along the river in downtown Aurora.\n\n==History==\nBefore European settlers arrived, there was a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village in what is today downtown Aurora, on the banks of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. In 1834, following the [[Black Hawk War]], the McCarty brothers arrived. They initially owned land on both sides of the river, but sold their lands to the Lake brothers on the west side. The Lake brothers opened a mill on the opposite side of the river. The McCartys lived and operated their mill on the east side.<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|title=Aurora, IL|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210094756/http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/91.html|archivedate=10 December 2008}}</ref> A post office was established in 1837, officially creating Aurora.\n\nAurora was originally two villages: East Aurora, incorporated in 1845,<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\">{{cite web|url=http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|title=History of Aurora, Illinois|first=K.|last=Torp|website=genealogytrails.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html|archivedate=9 July 2012}}</ref> on the east side of the river, and West Aurora, formally organized on the west side of the river in 1854.<ref name=\"genealogytrails.com\"/> In 1857, the two towns joined officially, incorporated as the city of Aurora.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| title = Aurora Township, Kane County, Illinois| encyclopedia = Historical Encyclopedia of Illinois| publisher = Kane County Illinois Genealogy Trails| accessdate = 24 September 2011| url-status = live| archiveurl = https://archive.today/20120709131951/http://genealogytrails.com/ill/kane/aurora.html| archivedate = 9 July 2012}}</ref> As representatives could not agree which side of the river should house the public buildings, most public buildings were built on or around [[Stolp Island]] in the middle of the river.\n\nAs the city grew, it attracted numerous factories and jobs. In 1856, the [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]] located its [[Chicago, Burlington, & Quincy Roundhouse and Locomotive Shop|roundhouse and locomotive shop]] in Aurora, becoming the town's largest employer, a rank it held until the 1960s. Railroad restructuring in the railroad industry resulted in a loss of jobs as the number of railroads reduced and they dropped lines for passenger traffic. Aurora at one time had regularly scheduled passenger trains to Chicago.<ref>The Burlington Railroad ran passenger trains between Chicago and Aurora for over 100 years, since Aurora was an important suburb. See \"Chicago-Aurora Centennial, 1864\u20131964\" (Burlington Railroad, 1964).</ref>\n\nThe heavy industries on the East side provided employment for generations of European immigrants, who came from [[Ireland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Italy]]. Aurora became the economic center of the [[Fox Valley (Illinois)|Fox Valley region]]. The combination of these three factors\u2014a highly industrialized town, a sizable river that divided it, and the Burlington railroad's shops\u2014accounted for much of the dynamics of Aurora's political, economic, and social history. The city openly supported [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]] before the [[American Civil War]]. [[Mexico|Mexican]] migrants began arriving after the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910. Socially, the town was [[progressivism|progressive]] in its attitude toward education, religion, welfare, and women. The first free public school district in Illinois was established in 1851 here and the city established a high school for girls in 1855.\n\nThe city developed as a manufacturing powerhouse and continued until the early 1970s, when the railroad shops closed. Soon many other factories and industrial areas relocated or went out of business. By 1980, there were few industrial areas operating in the city, and unemployment soared to 16%.<ref name=Encyclopedia/> During the late 1970s and early 1980s, development began of the Far East side along the Eola Road and Route 59 areas. While this was financially beneficial to the city, it drew off retail businesses and manufacturing from downtown and the industrial sectors of the near East and West Sides, respectively, weakening them. In the mid-1980s crime rates soared and street gangs started to form.\n\nDuring this time Aurora became a much more ethnically diverse city. The Latino population began to grow rapidly in the city in the 1980s. In the late 1980s, several business and industrial parks were established on the city's outskirts. In 1993, the Hollywood Casino was built downtown, which helped bring the first redevelopment to the downtown area in nearly twenty years. In the late 1990s, more development began in the rural areas and towns outside Aurora. Subdivisions sprouted up around the city, and Aurora's population soared.\n\nToday, Aurora is an ethnically diverse city of around 200,000 residents. Historic areas downtown are being redeveloped, and new developments are being built all over the city.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Aurora picture.jpg|thumb|The Phillips Park 'Sunken Garden']]\n\nAurora is at {{Coord|41|45|50|N|88|17|24|W|display=inline}} (41.7637855, \u221288.2901352).<ref name=\"gnis\"/>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Aurora has an area of {{convert|45.799|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|44.94|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.12%) is land and {{convert|0.859|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.88%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n |accessdate=2015-12-25\n |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213041547/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1703012\n |archive-date=2020-02-13\n |url-status=dead\n }}</ref>\n\nWhile the city has traditionally been regarded as being in [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane County]], Aurora also includes parts of [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage]], [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] and [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] counties.

Flooding occurred in almost every low-lying area in the city, and in neighborhoods bordering the Fox River, causing major damage in some neighborhoods. The flooding was just as bad in Blackberry Creek, on Aurora's far west side.\n\nAurora has not been struck by any major tornadoes in recent history, although they occur in Northern Illinois annually. In 1906, a tornado went through the [[Aurora Downs|Aurora Driving Park]], a large recreation/amusement park and race track where the Riddle Highlands neighborhood and Northgate shopping center is today. The tornado hit during the afternoon performance of the Ringling Brothers \"Greatest Show on Earth\" circus, when the park was crowded. It killed 2 people and injured 22, but the grandstand was still filled for the evening performance. Weak tornadoes struck the city in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1991. In 1990, the supercell thunderstorm that produced the deadly [[1990 Plainfield tornado|Plainfield Tornado]] passed over the city, dropping golf ball sized hail and causing wind damage. Less than ten minutes after passing through Aurora, the storm produced an F5 tornado, which touched down in nearby Oswego, less than 5 miles from downtown. The tornado then traveled through Plainfield and Joliet, killing 29 people.\n\nThe city can receive heavy snowfall and experiences blizzards periodically.\n\nAurora was hit with one of the strongest earthquakes ever [[List of earthquakes in Illinois|to strike Illinois]], a M 5.1, on May 26, 1909.

The team played in a stadium on the west side in the former Riverview Park. He became known as a manager of baseball teams.\n\nWaubonsie Valley High School (IPSD\u2014District 204) Soccer has won the Northern Illinois regional championship in this highly competitive region, for both boys and girls, almost every year since 1987.

Several youth soccer players from Aurora have received college scholarships to major college soccer programs throughout the U.S. In addition, Aurora maintains several developmental advantages for soccer enthusiasts. Three high-quality indoor soccer venues allow year-round soccer training and competition for children and adults. Additionally, several area traveling soccer clubs, as well as high schools, boast coaches and trainers who have played soccer professionally or have been starting players for national teams. Some played for teams that won the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. Supplementing the local soccer training regimen are professional soccer trainers from England, Brazil, The Netherlands, Scotland, and other countries. Several played in the [[Premier League]] and for the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]], and for the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].\n\n[[Fastpitch softball]] has been in Aurora since the 1930s.

The Sealmasters won National Championships in 1959, 1961, 1965, and 1967, and World Championships in 1966 and 1968. The Sealmasters played their games at Stevens-Adamson Field, a significant fastpitch stadium on Ridgeway Avenue on the city's southwest side. The Sealmasters hosted many famous competitors from all over the United States, most notably [[Eddie Feigner]] and The King and His Court, as well as international opponents. There were many different and competitive men's leagues in Aurora from the 1960s through the mid-1990s.

The city is the final stop of the [[BNSF Railway Line|Burlington Northern Santa Fe]] line of the [[Metra]] commuter rail system, allowing rail service into [[Chicago]].  The city also has a stop at the [[Route 59 (Metra)|Rt. 59 station]] on the BNSF Line. This station is on the border with Naperville and each city maintains a parking lot on their respective side of the tracks. The [[BNSF Railroad]] owns and maintains a [[rail yard]] in Aurora, which they named Eola Yard.\n\n[[Pace (transit)|Pace Suburban Bus]] operates local bus service in Aurora six days a week (no service on Sundays) and connects to cities and village such as Naperville, Geneva, Batavia, Oswego, and St. Charles.

The closest Amtrak station is in [[Naperville station|Napervile]]. Aurora City Lines, the old city bus lines, was closed in the late 1980s in favor of regional bus service. Aurora also had an extensive [[Tram|streetcar]] system, operated by the [[Aurora, Elgin and Fox River Electric Company]], that served most neighborhoods. Aurora was served by a number of [[interurban]] lines, the most prominent of which was the [[Chicago Aurora and Elgin Railroad]] which provided service into Chicago. The [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]] would have a third station at Ferry Rd. north of the BNSF Line.\n\nThe [[Aurora Municipal Airport (Illinois)|Aurora Municipal Airport]] is a general aviation airport in Sugar Grove, Illinois, just outside Aurora. Although the airport is in Sugar Grove, it is owned and operated by the City of Aurora. The Aurora Airport is designed as a reliever airport for Chicago's O'Hare and Midway Airports and also handles a lot of international cargo. It is capable of landing Boeing 757 aircraft. In addition, the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center is on Aurora's west side.\n\n===Healthcare===\n[[File:Rush-Copley Medical Center.JPG|thumb|[[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]]]]\nAurora has two hospitals, one on the west side, Presence Mercy Medical Center, and one in Fox Valley, [[Rush\u2013Copley Medical Center]].\n\nThere are other area hospitals, including Edward Hospital in Naperville, Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Central DuPage in Winfield and a Level 1 Trauma center at Good Samaritan in Downers Grove.\n\nAurora had three hospitals, St. Joseph Hospital, on the west side, St. Charles hospital, east of downtown, and Copley Memorial Hospital, on the east side. St Joseph and St, Charles hospitals have been converted into senior living centers, and the old Copley hospital, which was one of the largest hospitals in the area, sits vacant. The city of Aurora recently demolished the old smokestacks from the hospital, as they were starting to crumble.\n\n[https://archive.today/20130110200534/http://www.dreyermed.com/ Dreyer Medical Clinic] and several other independent clinics and medical groups are spread throughout the city.

According to the census of Aurora's population over the age of twenty-five, 26% hold a bachelor's degree.\n\nStarting in the 1860s, Aurora was served by two main school systems, one on either side of the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]], which physically divides the city. In the mid-20th century, the district on the western side of the river expanded to include the students in the village of North Aurora, including the North Aurorans on the east side of the Fox.  Additionally, in 1972, the Indian Prairie School District (IPSD) 204 was formed to serve the far eastern portion of Aurora within [[DuPage County, Illinois|DuPage County]]. All three districts (Aurora Public Schools: West Side (District 129), Aurora Public Schools: East Side (District 131) and IPSD) have their headquarters and administrative offices within the Aurora city limits. As of 2005, there were at least forty public schools within Aurora city limits, serving residents of Aurora and neighboring communities.\n\nDue to the city's size, these are not the only three school systems serving residents \u2013 some students in the far north end of the city (north of [[Interstate 88 (west)|I88]] in Kane County) attend [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] public schools, some on the far southwest side attend Kaneland CUSD 302 schools (headquartered in [[Maple Park, Illinois|Maple Park]]), and some students in the far south end of the city (a small corner of the Kane, Kendall and Will County portions) attend [[Oswego, Illinois|Oswego]] public schools. Four of the schools in Oswego CUSD 308, Wheatlands Elementary, Homestead Elementary, Wolf's Crossing Elementary, and Bednarcik Junior High are within Aurora's limits.\n\nThe [[Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy]] (IMSA) is a state-funded residential [[magnet school]] for grades 10 to 12. While IMSA operates under public funds (and uses the site originally designated West Aurora High School North Campus), it is managed independently of Aurora's other public schools. Any Illinois student who meets admission requirements may apply to attend IMSA, tuition free.\n\nAurora is also home to other private schools. Within Aurora, there are three Roman Catholic High Schools, [[Aurora Central Catholic High School|Aurora Central Catholic]] (Diocese of Rockford), [[Rosary High School (Aurora, Illinois)|Rosary]], and [[Marmion Academy]] (Order of St. Benedict), and seven Catholic elementary schools operated by the Diocese of Rockford. Along with these three schools is [[Aurora Christian High School]] and Elementary School and Resurrection Lutheran School,<ref>{{cite web |title=Resurrection Lutheran Church & School |url=https://relcs.org/}}</ref> a Pre-K-8 grade school of the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]].  Aurora is also home to Fox Valley Montessori School, one of the first Montessori schools established in Illinois in 1969, which offers a preschool and elementary program.\n\nThe above-named districts have forty-six public schools within the city limits of Aurora (seventeen for District #131, thirteen for District #129, eleven for District #204, four for Oswego District #308 and the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy).\n\n===Library===\nThe [[Aurora Public Library (Illinois)|Aurora Public Library]] includes the main library, two branches, an express center, a support facility and a bookmobile.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms.

Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn.

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble.

The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish. Greek saffron produced in the town of [[Krokos]] is [[Protected designation of origin|PDO]] protected due to its particularly high-quality colour and strong flavour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/food-farming-fisheries/food-safety-and-quality/certification/quality-labels/eu-quality-food-and-drink/krokos-kozanis|title=Krokos Kozanis PDO |last=Bishop |first=Stephen|date=2018-04-26|website=European Commission|access-date=2018-11-16}}</ref> Various \"boutique\" crops are available from New Zealand, France, Switzerland, England, the United States, and other countries\u2014some of them organically grown.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices. Kashmiri saffron is recognisable by its dark maroon-purple hue; it is among the world's darkest, which hints at strong flavour, aroma, and colouring effect.\n\nAnother type of Saffron is Saffron Cox who is widely known as the cutest girl. She is actually banned from several states in America since she drives all men and women to insanity from her cuteness. It is rumored that perhaps she obtained her cuteness from the devil in exchange for being cursed in ONI, but this has never been confirmed.

Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in [[Derbent]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

According to Chinese herbalist Wan Zhen, \"[t]he habitat of saffron is in Kashmir, where people grow it principally to offer it to the Buddha.\" Wan also reflected on how it was used in his time: \"The flower withers after a few days, and then the saffron is obtained.

With this fall, European saffron cultivation plummeted. Competing theories state that saffron only returned to France with 8th-century AD Moors or with the [[Avignon]] papacy in the 14th century AD.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=63}} Similarly, the spread of Islamic civilisation may have helped reintroduce the crop to Spain and Italy.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=70}}\n\nThe 14th-century [[Black Death]] caused demand for saffron-based [[medicament]]s to peak, and Europe imported large quantities of threads via Venetian and Genoan ships from southern and Mediterranean lands such as Rhodes.

There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] concrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nFrom 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Jewish settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually [[Ariel University]], was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid.\n\nDuring the [[Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s|mass immigration]] of Jews from [[Soviet Union]] that began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom.

In the spring of 1978, some of the group's men erected tents on the chosen hilltop, and in August 1978, a total of forty families came to live in the settlement.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe original members of the group had gone through a screening process in order to put together a mix of skilled adults as well as young families that would be prepared psychologically to withstand starting a new settlement from scratch with little infrastructure and modern comforts. There were no paved roads or paths. Water was supplied periodically by a tanker truck. Electricity was provided by a generator since no electrical network existed in that area. Tents were replaced by [[Prefabrication|prefabricated]] concrete blocks which served as living quarters, schools, and an infirmary. On September 1, 1978, the school year was officially opened.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nFrom 1978 to 1988, Ariel continued to develop, and established itself as the urban center for the nearby Jewish settlements. In 1980, the prefabricated homes were replaced with permanent housing. The College of Judea and Samaria, which would later become the Ariel University Center of Samaria, and eventually [[Ariel University]], was founded in 1982. Three elementary schools, a community center, a sports hall, and a synagogue were built. In May 1982, Ariel was connected to the national power grid.\n\nDuring the [[Russian immigration to Israel in the 1990s|mass immigration]] of Jews from [[Soviet Union]] that began in 1989 and continued throughout the 1990s, Ariel, which had a population of 8,000 in 1990, experienced a population boom. Unlike in Israel proper, apartments in Ariel were plentiful and cheap, which proved attractive to the immigrants.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&dat=19900409&id=v2tXAAAAIBAJ&sjid=c_ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=6971,7983843 Soviet immigrants mark Passover] \u2013 [[The Spokesman Review]]. 9 April 1990</ref> Some 6,000 Soviet immigrants moved to Ariel, almost doubling its population.\n\nIn 2005, the residents of [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]], a former Israeli settlement in the Gaza Strip which had been [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan|evacuated]], found temporary housing in the dormitories of the Ariel University Center of Samaria.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]].

He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off.

Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory.

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

The main responsibility of both governors and local rulers was to collect taxes and support the Samanid ruler with troops if needed. The most important province in the Samanid Empire was Khorasan, which was initially given to a relative of the Samanid ruler or a local Iranian prince (such as the [[Muhtajids]]), but was later given to one of his most trusted slaves. The governor of Khorasan was normally the ''[[sipah-salar]]'' (commander-in-chief).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\nLike in the Abbasid Caliphate, Turkic slaves could rise to high office in the Samanid state, which would sometimes give them enough power to nearly make the ruler their puppet.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=143}}\n\n====The nature of political authority under the Samanids====\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Cultural and religious efforts===\n\n\nThe Samanids revived [[Persian culture]] by patronizing [[Rudaki]],<ref>\"Mihragan\", J.

The mass conversion of the Turks to Islam eventually led to a growing influence of the [[Ghaznavids]], who would later rule the region.\n\nAgriculture and trading were the economic bases of the Samanid State. The Samanids were heavily involved in trading&nbsp;\u2013 even with Europe, as thousands of Samanid coins that have been found in the Baltic and Scandinavian countries testify.<ref>History of Bukhara, By Narshakhi trans. Richard N. Frye, pg. 143</ref>\n\nAnother lasting contribution of the Samanids to the history of Islamic art is the pottery known as Samanid Epigraphic Ware: plates, bowls, and pitchers fired in a white slip and decorated only with calligraphy, often elegantly and rhythmically written.  The Arabic phrases used in this calligraphy are generally more or less generic well wishes, or Islamic admonitions to good table manners.\n\n===Scholarship===\n\n====Avicenna and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni====\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:The Sasanian King Khusraw and Courtiers in a Garden, Page from a manuscript of the Shahnama (Book of Kings) of Firdawsi, late 15th-early 16th century.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] king [[Khosrow II]] and his courtiers in a garden'', page from a manuscript of the [[Shahnameh]], late 15th-early 16th century.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud.

The original home of the Samanids is unclear, for some [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] texts claim that the name was derived from a village near [[Samarkand]], while others assert it was a village near [[Balkh]] or [[Termez|Tirmidh]]. The latter is more probable since the earliest appearance of the Samanid family appears to be in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] rather than [[Transoxiana]].<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\">{{cite book|last1=Frye|first1=Richard N.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=136}}</ref> In some sources the Samanids claimed to be descended from the noble [[House of Mihran|Mihran family]] of [[Bahram Chobin]], whereas one author claimed that they belonged to the Turkish Oghuz tribe, although this is most unlikely.<ref name=\"The Cambridge History of Iran\"/> Originally a [[Zoroastrian]], Saman Khuda converted to [[Islam]] during the governorship of [[Asad ibn Abdallah al-Qasri]] in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]],{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} and named his oldest son as [[Asad ibn Saman|Asad]] in the governor's honour.{{sfn|Gibb|1986|p=685}} In 819, the governor of Khorasan, [[Ghassan ibn Abbad]], rewarded the four sons of Asad for their aid against the rebel [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]; [[Nuh ibn Asad|Nuh]] received [[Samarkand]]; [[Ahmad ibn Asad|Ahmad]] received [[Farghana]]; [[Yahya ibn Asad|Yahya]] received [[Tashkent|Shash]]; and [[Ilyas ibn Asad|Ilyas]] received [[Herat]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} This marked the beginning of the Samanid dynasty.\n\n===Rise===\n\n====The Samanid branch in Herat (819\u2013857)====\n\nIlyas died in 856, and was succeeded by his son [[Ibrahim ibn Ilyas]]\u2014the [[Tahirid dynasty|Tahirid]] governor of Khorasan, [[Muhammad ibn Tahir]], thereafter appointed him as the commander of his army, and sent him on an expedition against the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarid]] ruler [[Ya'qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar]] in [[Sistan]]. He was defeated at a battle near [[Pushang]] in 857, and fled to [[Nishapur]], where he was captured by Ya'qub al-Saffar and sent to Sistan as a hostage.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} The Tahirids thereafter assumed direct control over Herat.\n\n====The Samanid branches in Transoxiana (819\u2013892)====\n{{See Also|Samanid Civil War of 888}}\n[[File:Transoxiana 8th century.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Transoxiana]].]]\nIn 839/40, Nuh seized [[Isfijab]] from the nomadic [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Oghuz Turks|Turks]] living in the [[steppe]]. He thereafter had a wall constructed around the city to protect it from their attacks. He died in 841/2\u2014his two brothers Yahya and Ahmad were then appointed as the joint rulers of the city by the Tahirid governor of Khorasan.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=136}} After Yahya's death in 855, Ahmad took control over Ch\u00e2ch, thus becoming the ruler of most of [[Transoxiana]]. He died in 864/5; his son [[Nasr I]] received Farghana and Samarkand, while his other son [[Ya'qub ibn Ahmad|Ya'qub]] received Ch\u00e2ch (areas around modern Tashkent/Chachkent).{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Meanwhile, the Tahirids' authority had significantly weakened after suffering several defeats by the Saffarid ruler Ya'qub al-Saffar, thus losing their grip over the Samanids, who became more or less independent. Nasr I used this opportunity to strengthen his authority by sending his brother [[Ismail Samani|Ismail]] to [[Bukhara]], which was in an unstable condition after suffering from raids by the [[Afrighids|Afrighid dynasty]] of [[Khwarazm]]. When Ismail reached the city, he was warmly received by its inhabitants, who saw him as one who could restore order.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}} Regardless, the [[Bukhar Khudahs]] continued to autonomously rule in Bukhara for a few more years.\n\nAfter not so long, disagreement over where tax money should be distributed started a conflict between the brothers. Ismail was eventually victorious in the dynastic struggle, and took control of the Samanid state. However, Nasr had been the one who had been invested with Transoxiana, and the Abbasid [[caliph]]s continued to recognize him as the rightful ruler. Because of this, Ismail continued to recognize his brother as well, but Nasr was completely powerless, a situation that would continue until his death in August 892.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=137}}\n\n===Final unification and height of power (892\u2013907)===\n[[File:13 Buhara Mavzolej Ismaila Samanija (2).JPG|thumb|right|300px|Picture of the [[Samanid Mausoleum]], the burial site of [[Ismail Samani]].]]\nA few months later, Ya'qub al-Saffar also died and was succeeded by his brother [[Amr ibn al-Layth]], who saw himself as the heir of the Tahirids, thus claiming Transoxiana, Khorasan and other parts of Iran for himself. He thereafter forced the Abbasid caliph to recognize him as the ruler of those territories. In the spring of 900, he [[Battle of Balkh|clashed]] with Ismail near [[Balkh]], but was defeated and taken to captivity. Ismail thereafter sent him Baghdad, where he was executed.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Ismail was thereafter recognized as the ruler of all of Khorasan and Transoxiana by the caliph.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} Furthermore, he also received the investiture over [[Tabaristan]], [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] and [[Isfahan]].{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}} It was also during this period that the Afrighid dynasty was forced into submission.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=138}}\n\nBefore his major victory against the Saffarids, he had made various expeditions in Transoxiana; in 892, he put an end to the [[Principality of Ushrusana]] by seizing all of its lands. During the same period, he put an end to the Bukhar Khudas in Bukhara. In 893, he invaded the territories of the [[Karluk Turks]], taking [[Taraz|Talas]] and converting the [[Church of the East|Nestorian church]] there into a [[mosque]].<ref>Renee Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', Transl.

The invasion was successful; Muhammad ibn Zayd was killed and Tabaristan was conquered by the Samanids. However, Muhammad ibn Harun shortly revolted, forcing Ismail himself to invade the region the following year.

Furthermore, because of his campaigns in the north, his empire was so safe from enemy incursions that the defences of Bukhara and Samarkand went unused. However, this later had consequences; at the end of the dynasty, the walls--earlier strong, but now falling apart--were greatly missed by the Samanids, who were constantly under attack by the [[Karakhanids]] and other enemies.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=140}}\n\nIsmail died in November 907, and was succeeded by his son [[Ahmad Samani]] (r. 907\u2013914).\n\n===Intermediate period (907\u2013961)===\nNot long after his accession, Ahmad invaded Sistan; by 911, Sistan was under complete Samanid control, and Ahmad's cousin [[Abu Salih Mansur]] was appointed as its governor. Meanwhile, an [[Alids|Alid]] named [[Hasan al-Utrush]] was slowly re-establishing Zaydi over Tabaristan. In 913, Ahmad sent an army under [[Muhammad ibn Sa'luk]] to deal with him. Although the Samanid army was much larger, Hasan managed to emerge victorious. Ahmad, before he could plan another expedition to Tabaristan, was the following year murdered by some of his slaves in a tent near Bukhara.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} During his reign, Ahmad is also said to have replaced the language of the court from Persian to [[Arabic]], which made him unpopular among his subjects, and forced him to change it back to Persian. After Ahmad's death, his eight-year-old son [[Nasr II]] (r. 914\u2013943) succeeded him.\n[[File:NasrIISamanidCoinHistoryofIran.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of [[Nasr II]], minted in [[Nishapur]] (933/4).]]\nDue to Nasr's youth, his prime minister [[Abu 'Abd-Allah al-Jaihani]] took care over most of the state affairs. Jaihani was not only an experienced administrator, but also a prominent geographer and greatly educated man. Almost right after Nasr II had ascended the throne, several revolts erupted, the most dangerous one being under his paternal grand-uncle, [[Ishaq ibn Ahmad]], who seized Samarkand and began minting coins there, while his son Abu Salih Mansur seized [[Nishapur]] and several cities in Khorasan. Ishaq was eventually defeated and captured, while Abu Salih Mansur died of natural causes in 915.{{sfn|Frye|1975|p=141}} Some time later Nasr II once again had to deal with rebels; in 919, the governor of Khorasan, [[Husayn ibn Ali Marvarrudhi]], rebelled against Samanid authority. Nasr responded by sending an army under [[Ahmad ibn Sahl]] to suppress the rebellion, which the latter managed to accomplish. After a few weeks, however, Ahmad shortly rebelled himself at Nishapur, made incursions into Gorgan, and then fortified himself in [[Merv]] to avoid a Samanid counter-attack. Nevertheless, the Samanid general [[Hamuya ibn Ali]] managed to lure Ahmad out of Merv, and defeated him in a battle at [[Marw al-Rudh]]; he was captured and imprisoned in Bukhara, where he remained until his death in 920.\n\nIn the west, Nasr II clashed several times with [[Daylamite]] and [[Gilaki people|Gilite]] rulers; In 921, the Zaydids under the Gilite ruler [[Lili ibn al-Nu'man]] invaded Khorasan, but were defeated by the [[Simjurids|Simjurid]] general [[Simjur al-Dawati]]. Later in 930, a Dailamite military leader, [[Makan ibn Kaki]], seized Tabaristan and Gurgan, and even took possession of Nishapur in western Khorasan. He was, however, forced to withdraw back to Tabaristan one year later, due to the threat that Samanids posed.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref>Madelung (1975), pp. 211\u2013212</ref> Makan then returned to Tabaristan, where he was defeated by the [[Ziyarid]] ruler [[Mardavij]], who managed to conquer the region.<ref name=\"EI2-164\">Nazim (1987), p. 164</ref><ref name=\"Iran212\">Madelung (1975), p. 212</ref> In 935, Nasr II re-established Samanid control in Gurgan and made Mardavij's successor [[Vushmgir]] his vassal. However, in 939 he declared independence, but was defeated the following year at [[Battle of Iskhabad|Iskhabad]].\n\nIn 943 several Samanid army officers, angry at Nasr's support of [[Isma'ili]] missionaries, formed a conspiracy to murder him. Nasr's son [[Nuh I]], however, learned of the conspiracy. He went to a banquet designed to organize the plot and had the head of their leader cut off. To appease the other officers, he promised to stop the Isma'ili missionaries from continuing their activities. He then convinced his father to abdicate, who died of [[tuberculosis]] after a few months.<ref>''A new text on Ismailism at the Samanid court'', Patricia Crone and Luke Treadwell, '''Texts, documents, and artefacts:Islamic Studies in Honour of D.S. Richards''', ed. Chase F. Robinson, (Brill, 2003), 46.</ref>\n\nRight when Nuh I ascended the throne, a revolt erupted in Khwarazm, which he managed to suppress. Later in 945, he had to deal with the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu 'Ali Chaghani]], who refused to relinquish his post as governor of Khorasan to [[Ibrahim ibn Simjur]]. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then rebelled, and was joined by several prominent figures such as [[Abu Mansur Muhammad]], whom he appointed as his commander-in-chief. In 947, he installed Nuh's uncle [[Ibrahim ibn Ahmad]] as ''amir'' in Bukhara. Abu 'Ali Chaghani then returned to his domains in [[Chaghaniyan]]. Ibrahim, however, was unpopular with the people of Bukhara, and Nuh soon retaliated by retaking the city and blinding Ibrahim and two brothers.\n\nWhen Abu Ali Chaghani received the news of the re-capture of Bukhara, he once again marched towards it, but was defeated by an army sent by Nuh and withdrew back to Chaghaniyan. After some time, he left the region and tried to obtain support from other Samanid vassals. Meanwhile, Nuh had Chaghaniyan ravaged{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}} and its capital sacked.{{sfn|Frye|1975|pp=149\u2013151}} Another battle shortly ensued between Abu 'Ali Chaghani and a Samanid army in [[Tukharistan]], which resulted in a Samanid victory. Fortunately for Abu Ali Chaghani, he managed to secure the support of other Samanid vassals, such as the rulers of [[Khuttal]], and the Kumiji [[mountain people]], but in the end made peace with Nuh, who allowed him to keep Chaghaniyan in return for sending his son [[Abu'l Muzaffar Abdallah]] as hostage to Bukhara.{{sfn|Bosworth|2011|p=63}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1984|pp=764\u2013766}}\n[[File:Iran circa 1000AD.png|thumb|right|250px|[[Iran]] in the mid-10th century.]]\n[[Alp Tigin]], nominal vassal of the Samanids, conquered Ghazna in 962 from the Lawik dynasty.<ref>He dispossessed an indigenous family who had ruled in [[Ghazni]], the Lawiks (?), and following him a series of slave commanders, ruled there as nominal vassals of the Samanids; they struck coins but placed the names of the Samanids on them</ref><ref>Gard\u012bz\u012b, ed. \u1e24ab\u012bb\u012b, pp. 161\u201362; J\u016bzj\u0101n\u012b, \u1e6cabaq\u0101t, I, pp. 226\u201327; Ne\u1e93\u0101m-al-Molk, pp. 142\u201358; \u0160ab\u0101nk\u0101ra\u02be\u012b, pp. 29\u201334; Bosworth, 1965, pp. 16\u201321</ref> The fifth of these commanders was Seb\u00fcktigin, who governed \u1e20azna for twenty years till 387 AH/997 CE with the title (as it appears from his tomb inscription<ref>Flury, pp. 62\u201363</ref>) of al-\u1e25\u0101jeb al-ajall (most noble commander).

In 999, Nasr b. Ali, a nephew of Harun, returned and took possession of Bukhara, meeting little resistance. The Samanid domains were split up between the [[Ghaznavids]], who gained [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and [[Afghanistan]], and the Karakhanids, who received Transoxiana; the [[Oxus River]] thus became the boundary between the two rival empires.\n\n===Isma'il Muntasir's attempt to resurrect the Samanid state (1000\u20131005)===\n[[File:Isma'il Muntasir.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Artwork of [[Isma'il Muntasir]] in a battle.]]\n[[Isma'il Muntasir]] was the youngest son of Nuh II\u2014he was imprisoned by the Karakhanids after their conquest of Bukhara in 999. Some time later, Isma'il managed to escape to Khwarazm, where he gained support. Driving the Karakhanids out of Bukhara, he then moved on to and captured Samarkand. The approach of the Karakhanid army, however, forced Isma'il to give up all of his possessions, following which he travelled to Khorasan, where he captured Nishapur. Mahmud's army, however, made its way to the region, and Isma'il decided it necessary to flee again.\n\nIn 1003 Isma'il came back to Transoxiana, where he requested and received assistance from the Oghuz Turks of the [[Zarafshan]] valley. They defeated the Karakhanids in several battles, even when Nasr Khan was involved. For various reasons, however, Isma'il came to feel that he could not rely on the Oghuz to restore him, so he went back to Khorasan. He tried to gain Mahmud's support for a campaign to restore the Samanid state, but failed. Some time afterwards, he returned to the Zarafshan valley, where he gained the support of the Oghuz and others. A Karakhanid army was defeated in May 1004, but subsequently the Oghuz deserted Isma'il during another battle, and his army fell apart.\n\nFleeing to Khorasan yet again, Isma'il attempted to reenter Transoxiana in the end of 1004. The Karakhanids stopped this and Isma'il was nearly killed. Following this, he sought the hospitality of an [[Arab]] tribe near Merv. Their chief, however, killed Isma'il in 1005. His death marked the defeat of the last attempt to restore the Samanid state. Descendants of the Samanid family continued to live in Transoxiana where they were well regarded, but their power was relatively broken.\n\n===Iranian intermezzo===\nAlong with several other states, the Samanid Empire was part of the [[Iranian Intermezzo]], or \"Persian renaissance\". This period has been described as having a key importance in the formation of the Islamic civilization, both politically and culturally. In political terms, it saw an effective break up of the Abbasid power and the rise of several successor states such as the Samanids and Buyids while in cultural terms, it witnessed the rise of new Persian as an administrative and literary language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OeiKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PR19&dq=Medieval+Central+Asia+and+the+Persianate+World,+A.C.S.+Peacock,+D.G.+Tor,+Iranian+Intermezzo#v=onepage&q=Medieval%20Central%20Asia%20and%20the%20Persianate%20World,%20A.C.S.%20Peacock,%20D.G.%20Tor,%20Iranian%20Intermezzo&f=true|title=Medieval Central Asia and the Persianate World: Iranian Tradition and Islamic Civilisation|last=Peacock|first=A.

It was during the Samanid period that [[Persian literature]] appeared in Transoxiana and was formally recognized.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} The advancement of an Islamic New Persian literature thus started in Transoxiana and Khorasan instead of [[Fars Province|Fars]], the homeland of the Persians. The best known poets of the Samanid period were [[Rudaki]] (d. 941), [[Daqiqi]] (d. 977) and [[Ferdowsi]] (d. 1020).{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nAlthough Persian was the most-favored language, Arabic continued to enjoy a high status and was still popular among the members of the Samanid family.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} For example, [[Al-Tha'\u0101lib\u012b|al-Tha'alibi]] wrote an Arabic anthology named Yatimat al-dahr (\"The Unique Pearl\"). The fourth section of the anthology included a detailed account of the poets that lived under the Samanids. It also states that the poets of Khwarazm mostly wrote in Arabic.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}}\n\nThe acknowledged founder of Persian classical poetry, and a man of great perception, was Rudaki, who was born in the village of [[Rudaki, Tajikistan|Panjrudak]], which is today part of the [[Panjakent District]] in [[Tajikistan]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=97}} Rudaki was already becoming popular during his early years, due to his poems, his voice, and his great skill in using the [[Chang (instrument)|chang]] (an Iranian instrument similar to the [[harp]]). He was shortly invited to the Samanid court, where he stayed almost the rest of his life. Fewer than 2,000 lines of his poetry have survived, but are enough to prove his great poetic skills\u2014he perfected every basic verse form of medieval Persian poetry: mathnawi, [[qasida]], [[ghazal]] and [[ruba'i]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\"Look at the cloud, how it cries like a grieving man\n: Thunder moans like a lover with a broken heart.\n: Now and then the sun peeks from behind the clouds\n: Like a prisoner hiding from the guard.\"&nbsp;\u2013 Rudaki\n</div>\n\nAnother prominent poet was [[Shahid Balkhi]], born in the village of Jakhudanak near Balkh. Not much is known about his life, but he is mentioned as being one of the best poets in the court of Nasr II, and one of the best scholars of the age. He was also a student of Rudaki, and had close relations with him. He died in 936, a few years before Rudaki's death. His death saddened Rudaki, who afterwards wrote an emotional [[elegy]] about him.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nDaqiqi, who was a native of [[Tus, Iran|Tus]], began his career at the court of the [[Muhtajids|Muhtajid]] ruler [[Abu'l Muzaffar ibn Muhammad]] in [[Chaghaniyan]], and was later invited to the Samanid court.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}} Under the Samanids, a special interest arose in ancient Iranian legends and heroic traditions, thus inspiring Daqiqi to write the [[Shahnameh]] (\"The Book of Kings\"), a long [[epic poem]] based on the history of the Iranians. However, by his death in 977, he had only managed to complete a small part of it, which was about the conflict between [[Vishtaspa|Gushtasp]] and [[Arjasp]].{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\nHowever, the most prominent poet of that age was Ferdowsi, born in Tus in 940 to a ''dehqan'' family. It was during his youth that there was a period of growth under the Samanids. The rapid growth of interest in ancient Iranian history made him continue the work of Daqiqi, completing the Shahnameh in 994, only a few years before the fall of the Samanid Empire. He later completed a second version of the Shahnameh in 1010, which he presented to the Ghaznavid Sultan Mahmud. However, his work was not as appreciated by the Ghaznavids as it had been by the Samanids.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=98}}\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Empty section|date=January 2016}}\n\n===Population===\nUnder the Samanid Empire, the [[Zarafshan]] valley, [[Qashqadaryo Region|Kashka Darya]] and [[Usrushana]] were populated by [[Sogdia]]ns; [[Tukharistan]] by the Bactrians; [[Khwarezm]] by the Khwarazmians; the [[Fergana Valley|Ferghana valley]] by the Ferghanans; southern [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by Khorasanians; and the [[Pamir mountains]] and its surroundings by the [[Saka]] and other early Iranian peoples.

Scholars, poets, artists and other men of education from many Muslim countries assembled in the Samanid capital of Bukhara, where a rich soil was created for the prosper of creative thought, thus making it one of the most distinguished cultural centres of the Eastern world. An outstanding library known as ''Siw\u0101n al-hikma'' (\"Storehouse of Wisdom\") was put together in Bukhara, known for its various types of books.{{sfn|Litvinsky|1998|p=94}}\n\n=== Arts ===\n[[File:Two Bowls with Figures and a Footed Plate with Birds MET DP258911.jpg|thumb|Example of figural earthenware ceramics from Samanid period.]]\n\n==== Crafts ====\n[[File:Bowl with Arabic Inscription.jpg|thumb|Bowl with Arabic Inscription]]\nDue to extensive excavations at [[Nishapur]], Iran in the mid-twentieth century, Samanid pottery is well-represented in Islamic art collections around the world.

It has a white slip with black slip decoration under a transparent glaze. There is calligraphic decoration all around the bowl. It is elongated at some points and compressed in other areas of the letter to the point where it almost looks abstract. Right in the center of the bowl is a black dot. If the bowl is looked at closely there are cracks and marks that have occurred over time. What would once have been a white bowl is now stained yellow in some areas. The calligraphy looks well thought out and planned. Each letter is well spaced, and the whole saying fits perfectly around the bowl. This may be because the artists used to practice beforehand on paper.

The road has three lanes in each direction for its entire length with full-width [[Shoulder (road)|hard shoulders]] for emergencies and breakdowns. The [[speed limit]] is {{convert|110|km/h|mph}} for most of its length, the highest of any road in Hong Kong.\n\nNorth Lantau Highway is {{convert|12.5|km|mi}} in length, beginning at [[Airport Road, Hong Kong|Airport Road]] on [[Chek Lap Kok]]. The road then crosses onto Lantau Island and bypasses [[Tung Chung|Tung Chung New Town]]. The road then travels along the northern coast of Lantau Island, next to the [[Airport Express (MTR)|Airport Express]] and [[Tung Chung Line (MTR)|Tung Chung Line]] of the [[Mass Transit Railway]] (MTR).

Finally, the road climbs over [[Ta Shui Wan]] and [[Tsing Chau Wan]] to meet the [[Lantau Link]] and its bridges.\n\n==History==\n=== Background===\nThe North Lantau Highway was built as part of the [[Airport Core Programme]] in the 1990s. The ultimate aim of the new motorway was to connect Hong Kong's urban core with the new international airport (opened 1998) as well as associated new town development in Tung Chung.

Koch applied the postulates to describe the [[etiology]] of [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]], but they have been controversially generalized to other diseases. These postulates were generated prior to understanding of modern concepts in microbial pathogenesis that cannot be examined using Koch's postulates, including [[viruses]] (which are obligate cellular parasites) and [[asymptomatic carrier]]s. They have largely been supplanted by other criteria such as the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] for infectious disease causality in modern public health.\n\n==The postulates==\n[[File:Koch's Postulates.svg|thumbnail|300px|Koch's postulates of disease.]]\nKoch's postulates are the following:\n\n# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but  should not be found in healthy organisms.\n# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].\n# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.\n# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.\n\nHowever, Koch later abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of [[cholera]]<ref name=Koch1893>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02284324 |title=Ueber den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |trans-title=About the instantaneous state of the bacteriological diagnosis of cholera |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |volume=14 |pages=319\u201338 |year=1893 |last1=Koch |first1=R.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2077681 }}</ref> and, later, of [[typhoid fever]].

As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.\n\nThe second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419\u201322 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 |access-date=2010-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305231640/http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 |archive-date=2010-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Viruses also require host cells to grow and reproduce and therefore cannot be grown in pure cultures.\n\nThe third postulate specifies \"should\", not \"must\", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,<ref name=Koch1884>{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884  |title=Mitt Kaiser Gesundh |chapter=2 Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |pages=1\u201388 }}</ref><!-- is this?: Conferenz zur Er\u00f6rterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserl.

According to a study done by Oliver A. Todd and Brain M Peters, a newly discovered interaction between the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and \u201cfungal opportunist\u201d Candida albicans is being considered a co-infection that is found in the bodies of sick patients who suffer from different conditions [2019]. This kind of synergism was found to be lethal in a separate study conducted by Carlson on mice. When mice were infected with the two mentioned pathogens above independently, sickness resulted but the mice were able to recover. When infected with both pathogens together, the mice had nearly a 100% mortality rate. This goes to show that some pathogens cannot be as easily isolated, and/ or may need extra techniques and steps that may better prove causation of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Todd |first1=Olivia |last2=Peters |first2=Brian |title=Candida Albicans and Staphylococcus aureus Pathogenicity and Polymicrobial Interactions: Lessons beyond Koch's Postulates |journal=Journal of Fungi |date=3 September 2019 |volume=5 |issue=81}}</ref>\n\n==For the 21st century==\n{{more footnotes|section|date=January 2014}}\nKoch's postulates have played an important role in [[microbiology]], yet they have major limitations. For example, Koch was well aware that in the case of cholera, the causal agent, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', could be found in both sick and healthy people, invalidating his first postulate. Furthermore, viral diseases were not yet discovered when Koch formulated his postulates, and there are many viruses that do not cause illness in all infected individuals, a requirement of the first postulate. Additionally, it was known through experimentation that ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' caused mild inflammation of the gastric lining when ingested. As evident as the inflammation was, it still did not immediately convince skeptics that ''H. pylori ''was associated with ulcers. Eventually, skeptics were silenced when a newly developed antibiotic treatment eliminated the bacteria and ultimately cured the disease. Koch's postulates are also limited in their ability to be effective when evaluating biofilms, Somni cells, and viruses. With biofilms, their cultivation process is very unique because they have to be cultivated by molecular methods rather than traditional methods. The problem with this is that these alternative methods do not detect the cause of infection; which therefore interferes with the third postulate that states microorganisms should cause disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hosainzadegan |first1=Hasan |last2=Rovshan |first2=Khalilov |last3=Gholizadeh |first3=Pourya |title=The necessity to revise Koch's postulates and its application to infectious and non-infectious diseases: a mini-review |journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases |date=12 August 2019 |page=4 |doi=10.1007/s10096-019-03681-1 |pmid=31440916}}</ref> In the case of Somnicells and viruses, they can not be cultured.

Colonization resistance allows an organism to feed off of the host and protect it from pathogens that would have caused disease if the organism was not attached to the host. Their second revision is that a community of microbes could help inhibit pathogens even further, preventing the pathogen of spreading disease like it is supposed to. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrd|first1=Allyson|last2=Segre|first2=Julia|date=15 January 2016|title=Adapting Koch's Postulates|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6270/224|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6270|pages=224-226|doi=10.1126/science.aad6753|pmid=26816362|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>  Similar to Byrd and Segre, Thomas Rivers had revisions to Koch\u2019s Postulates.

If enacted, this postulate would state that sufficient microbial data should allow scientists to treat, cure, or prevent the particular disease. \n\nMore recently, modern nucleic acid-based microbial detection methods have made Koch's original postulates even less relevant. These nucleic acid-based methods make it possible to identify microbes that are associated with a disease, but cannot be cultured. Also, nucleic acid-based detection methods are very sensitive, and can often detect the very low levels of viruses that are found in healthy people without disease.\n\nThe use of these new methods has led to revised versions of Koch's postulates. Fredricks and Relman have suggested the following postulates for the 21st century:<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredericks DN, Relman DA |title= Sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens: a reconsideration of Koch's postulates |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages= 18\u201333 |year= 1996  |pmid=8665474 |doi= 10.1128/CMR.9.1.18| url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/9/1/18 |pmc= 172879}}</ref>\n\n# A nucleic acid sequence belonging to a putative pathogen should be present in most cases of an infectious disease. Microbial nucleic acids should be found preferentially in those organs or gross anatomic sites known to be diseased, and not in those organs that lack pathology.\n# Fewer, or no, copies of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should occur in hosts or tissues without disease.\n# With resolution of disease, the copy number of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should decrease or become undetectable. With [[Relapse|clinical relapse]], the opposite should occur.\n# When sequence detection predates disease, or sequence copy number correlates with severity of disease or pathology, the sequence-disease association is more likely to be a causal relationship.\n# The nature of the microorganism inferred from the available sequence should be consistent with the known biological characteristics of that group of organisms.\n# Tissue-sequence correlates should be sought at the cellular level: efforts should be made to demonstrate specific in situ hybridization of microbial sequence to areas of tissue pathology and to visible microorganisms or to areas where microorganisms are presumed to be located.\n# These sequence-based forms of evidence for microbial causation should be reproducible.\n\nThese modifications are still controversial in that they do not account well for established disease associations, such as [[papillomavirus]] and [[cervical cancer]], nor do they take into account [[prion disease]]s, which have no nucleic acid sequences of their own.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Bradford Hill criteria]]\n* [[Causal inference]]\n* [[Mill's Methods]]\n* [[Molecular Koch's postulates]]\n* [[Willoughby D.

Koch applied the postulates to describe the [[etiology]] of [[cholera]] and [[tuberculosis]], but they have been controversially generalized to other diseases. These postulates were generated prior to understanding of modern concepts in microbial pathogenesis that cannot be examined using Koch's postulates, including [[viruses]] (which are obligate cellular parasites) and [[asymptomatic carrier]]s. They have largely been supplanted by other criteria such as the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] for infectious disease causality in modern public health.\n\n==The postulates==\n[[File:Koch's Postulates.svg|thumbnail|300px|Koch's postulates of disease.]]\nKoch's postulates are the following:\n\n# The microorganism must be found in abundance in all organisms suffering from the disease, but  should not be found in healthy organisms.\n# The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure [[cell culture|culture]].\n# The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.\n# The microorganism must be reisolated from the inoculated, diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the original specific causative agent.\n\nHowever, Koch later abandoned the universalist requirement of the first postulate altogether when he discovered asymptomatic carriers of [[cholera]]<ref name=Koch1893>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF02284324 |title=Ueber den augenblicklichen Stand der bakteriologischen Choleradiagnose |trans-title=About the instantaneous state of the bacteriological diagnosis of cholera |language=German |journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Hygiene und Infektionskrankheiten |volume=14 |pages=319\u201338 |year=1893 |last1=Koch |first1=R.|url=https://zenodo.org/record/2077681 }}</ref> and, later, of [[typhoid fever]]. [[Asymptomatic]] or [[subclinical infection]] carriers are now known to be a common feature of many infectious diseases, especially viral diseases such as [[polio]], [[herpes simplex]], [[HIV/AIDS]], and [[hepatitis C]]. As a specific example, all doctors and virologists agree that [[poliovirus]] causes paralysis in just a few infected subjects, and the success of the [[polio vaccine]] in preventing disease supports the conviction that the poliovirus is the causative agent.\n\nThe second postulate may also be suspended for certain microorganisms or entities that cannot (at the present time) be grown in pure culture.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Inglis TJ |title=Principia aetiologica: taking causality beyond Koch's postulates |journal=Journal of Medical Microbiology |volume=56 |issue=Pt 11 |pages=1419\u201322 |date=November 2007 |pmid=17965339 |doi=10.1099/jmm.0.47179-0 |url=http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 |access-date=2010-07-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305231640/http://jmm.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/full/56/11/1419 |archive-date=2010-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Viruses also require host cells to grow and reproduce and therefore cannot be grown in pure cultures.\n\nThe third postulate specifies \"should\", not \"must\", because as Koch himself proved in regard to both [[tuberculosis]] and cholera,<ref name=Koch1884>{{cite book |author=Koch Robert |year=1884  |title=Mitt Kaiser Gesundh |chapter=2 Die Aetiologie der Tuberkulose |pages=1\u201388 }}</ref><!-- is this?: Conferenz zur Er\u00f6rterung der Cholerafrage im Kaiserl.

According to a study done by Oliver A. Todd and Brain M Peters, a newly discovered interaction between the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and \u201cfungal opportunist\u201d Candida albicans is being considered a co-infection that is found in the bodies of sick patients who suffer from different conditions [2019]. This kind of synergism was found to be lethal in a separate study conducted by Carlson on mice. When mice were infected with the two mentioned pathogens above independently, sickness resulted but the mice were able to recover. When infected with both pathogens together, the mice had nearly a 100% mortality rate. This goes to show that some pathogens cannot be as easily isolated, and/ or may need extra techniques and steps that may better prove causation of the disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Todd |first1=Olivia |last2=Peters |first2=Brian |title=Candida Albicans and Staphylococcus aureus Pathogenicity and Polymicrobial Interactions: Lessons beyond Koch's Postulates |journal=Journal of Fungi |date=3 September 2019 |volume=5 |issue=81}}</ref>\n\n==For the 21st century==\n{{more footnotes|section|date=January 2014}}\nKoch's postulates have played an important role in [[microbiology]], yet they have major limitations. For example, Koch was well aware that in the case of cholera, the causal agent, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'', could be found in both sick and healthy people, invalidating his first postulate. Furthermore, viral diseases were not yet discovered when Koch formulated his postulates, and there are many viruses that do not cause illness in all infected individuals, a requirement of the first postulate. Additionally, it was known through experimentation that ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' caused mild inflammation of the gastric lining when ingested. As evident as the inflammation was, it still did not immediately convince skeptics that ''H. pylori ''was associated with ulcers. Eventually, skeptics were silenced when a newly developed antibiotic treatment eliminated the bacteria and ultimately cured the disease. Koch's postulates are also limited in their ability to be effective when evaluating biofilms, Somni cells, and viruses. With biofilms, their cultivation process is very unique because they have to be cultivated by molecular methods rather than traditional methods. The problem with this is that these alternative methods do not detect the cause of infection; which therefore interferes with the third postulate that states microorganisms should cause disease.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hosainzadegan |first1=Hasan |last2=Rovshan |first2=Khalilov |last3=Gholizadeh |first3=Pourya |title=The necessity to revise Koch's postulates and its application to infectious and non-infectious diseases: a mini-review |journal=European Journal of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases |date=12 August 2019 |page=4 |doi=10.1007/s10096-019-03681-1 |pmid=31440916}}</ref> In the case of Somnicells and viruses, they can not be cultured.

Their revisions have to do with the third postulate; they don\u2019t agree that a pathogen will always cause disease. Their first revision has to do with colonization resistance. Colonization resistance allows an organism to feed off of the host and protect it from pathogens that would have caused disease if the organism was not attached to the host. Their second revision is that a community of microbes could help inhibit pathogens even further, preventing the pathogen of spreading disease like it is supposed to. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Byrd|first1=Allyson|last2=Segre|first2=Julia|date=15 January 2016|title=Adapting Koch's Postulates|url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/351/6270/224|journal=Science|volume=351|issue=6270|pages=224-226|doi=10.1126/science.aad6753|pmid=26816362|accessdate=October 7, 2019}}</ref>  Similar to Byrd and Segre, Thomas Rivers had revisions to Koch\u2019s Postulates. He believed, even though the original postulates were made as a guide, they were actually an obstacle. Rivers wanted to show the link between viruses and diseases. Rivers cultivated his own Postulates; the first one stated that the virus must be connected to disease consistently. Secondly, the outcome of experimentation must indicate that the virus is directly responsible for the disease.<ref name=\"fiftharticle53\">{{cite journal|last1=Fredricks|first1=David|last2=Relman|first2=David|date=January 1996|title=Sequence-Based Identification of Microbial Pathogens: a Reconsideration of Koch's Postulates|url=https://cmr.asm.org/content/cmr/9/1/18.full.pdf|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=9|issue=1|pages=20-21|doi=10.1128/CMR.9.1.18|accessdate=October 7, 2019|pmid=8665474|pmc=172879}}</ref> Contradictions and occurrences such as these have led many to believe that a fifth postulate may be required. If enacted, this postulate would state that sufficient microbial data should allow scientists to treat, cure, or prevent the particular disease. \n\nMore recently, modern nucleic acid-based microbial detection methods have made Koch's original postulates even less relevant. These nucleic acid-based methods make it possible to identify microbes that are associated with a disease, but cannot be cultured. Also, nucleic acid-based detection methods are very sensitive, and can often detect the very low levels of viruses that are found in healthy people without disease.\n\nThe use of these new methods has led to revised versions of Koch's postulates. Fredricks and Relman have suggested the following postulates for the 21st century:<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Fredericks DN, Relman DA |title= Sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens: a reconsideration of Koch's postulates |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages= 18\u201333 |year= 1996  |pmid=8665474 |doi= 10.1128/CMR.9.1.18| url=http://cmr.asm.org/cgi/reprint/9/1/18 |pmc= 172879}}</ref>\n\n# A nucleic acid sequence belonging to a putative pathogen should be present in most cases of an infectious disease. Microbial nucleic acids should be found preferentially in those organs or gross anatomic sites known to be diseased, and not in those organs that lack pathology.\n# Fewer, or no, copies of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should occur in hosts or tissues without disease.\n# With resolution of disease, the copy number of pathogen-associated nucleic acid sequences should decrease or become undetectable. With [[Relapse|clinical relapse]], the opposite should occur.\n# When sequence detection predates disease, or sequence copy number correlates with severity of disease or pathology, the sequence-disease association is more likely to be a causal relationship.\n# The nature of the microorganism inferred from the available sequence should be consistent with the known biological characteristics of that group of organisms.\n# Tissue-sequence correlates should be sought at the cellular level: efforts should be made to demonstrate specific in situ hybridization of microbial sequence to areas of tissue pathology and to visible microorganisms or to areas where microorganisms are presumed to be located.\n# These sequence-based forms of evidence for microbial causation should be reproducible.\n\nThese modifications are still controversial in that they do not account well for established disease associations, such as [[papillomavirus]] and [[cervical cancer]], nor do they take into account [[prion disease]]s, which have no nucleic acid sequences of their own.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Bradford Hill criteria]]\n* [[Causal inference]]\n* [[Mill's Methods]]\n* [[Molecular Koch's postulates]]\n* [[Willoughby D.

This image was published by the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police]]\nThe \u201c[[Irish Crown Jewels]]\u201d were a set of insignia comprising the jewelled Order of St Patrick and a diamond encrusted badge with chain.  The precious stones that made up the pieces came from jewellery previously owned by Queen Charlotte and King George III.  These items had ceremonial significance and were held in Dublin castle under the charge of [[Sir Arthur Vicars]], who was the Ulster King of Arms.  The jewels, kept in a safe in Sir Arthur\u2019s office, were found to be missing on 6 July 1907, and the circumstance led the police to believe that the robbery was an \"inside job\".  Many theories were put forward as to who was involved with the theft; one of those under suspicion at the time was Captain Richard Howard Gorges.  He was publicly named by the Irish Member of Parliament [[Laurence Ginnell]] (1852-1923) in a speech he made in the House of Commons on 20 December 1912, under the protection of [[Parliamentary Privilege]].  He said of Gorges that while in South Africa he had been ''\"a reckless bully, a robber, a murderer, a bugger, and a sod\"''.  He also intimated that Gorges was not being prosecuted in order \"to conceal crimes much worse than theft\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ginnell|first1=Laurence|title=HANSARD|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1912/dec/20/crown-jewels-dublin#S5CV0045P0_19121220_HOC_217|website=UK Parliament website|accessdate=30 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nGorges was never charged, and the crime remains unsolved.

They had also been told by someone who knew Gorges of his threats to shoot any policeman who attempted to lay a hand on him.  When they eventually confronted Gorges they asked if they could talk to him privately; he at first agreed, but then pulled a second revolver and fired almost point blank at Detective Young.  Askew managed to wrestle Gorges to the floor, and with help subdued him.  A doctor later pronounced Detective Young dead at the scene.<ref>{{cite news|title=Shooting of a Detective, Verdict at the Inquest|publisher=The Times|date=July 27, 1915}}</ref>\n\nAt the murder trial, Gorges told of headaches he had been having from the sunstroke he had suffered while fighting in Matabeleland.  He also said that he had consumed large amounts of alcohol on the day of the shooting, a story confirmed by witnesses.  The jury found him guilty of manslaughter, and he was sentenced to twelve years\u2019 imprisonment, being released from jail in 1925.\n\n==Wealthy brother==\n\nIn May 1941, Gorges was arrested and sent to jail for obtaining clothes from [[Simpsons of Piccadilly]] with a worthless cheque. He told the court at the trial that he was waiting for money from his brother, who had married an American millionairess.  Although this seemed improbable, it was actually not far from the truth.
