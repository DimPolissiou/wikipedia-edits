Its first play, ''Charles II'', opened on October 24, 1877.

The theater itself is actually located on the top two floors of the building making for interesting and sometimes difficult scenery and show load-ins.  Scenery is loaded-in from the dock area up a vacant elevator shaft that is now outfitted with a winch system to haul the scenery up to the stage level.  Much care has to be taken in order to get the scenery up the shaft without scratching or ruining the scenery.  One story told around Goodspeed is that while loading in the scenery for Annie's original pre-Broadway run, a strong gust of wind took a large piece of scenery out of the hands of the loaders and blew it into the Connecticut River.\n\n== Goodspeed Musicals ==\n\nGoodspeed Musicals was formed in 1959 by a group of concerned citizens after the state of Connecticut had condemned the building. The state agreed to sell the building to the group for one dollar, provided they acquire enough funding to restore and maintain it. The restoration project took nearly four years, and the Goodspeed Opera House was rededicated on June 8, 1963.  The first performance in the new opera house was ''[[Oh, Lady! Lady!]]'' Under the direction of [[Michael P. Price]] from 1968 to 2014, and Michael Gennaro since 2014, Goodspeed Musicals has sent 19 productions to Broadway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Goodspeed-Opera-House/#.U7LoUbGzmYk|title=Goodspeed Opera House Theatre Credits|publisher=}}</ref>  Goodspeed productions have won more than a dozen [[Tony Award]]s, while Goodspeed Musicals itself has won two special Tonys, one for outstanding contributions to American Musicals and the other for outstanding achievement by a regional theatre.\n\nIn 1984, Goodspeed Musicals added a second performance venue\u2014the [[Norma Terris Theatre]]\u2014in nearby [[Chester, Connecticut]].

Several original plays debuted there or at the opera house before going on to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and winning [[Tony Award]]s.\n\nIn addition to the two theaters, Goodspeed Musicals pursues its mission through the Max Showalter Center for Education in Musical Theatre, which offers internships and new writers' residency programs, as well as the Scherer Library of Musical Theatre, which houses the largest musical theatre research facility in the United States. Goodspeed Musicals has also built state-of-the-art production facilities including scenery shops, costume shops and a large costume storage facility.\n\nCritic fellows from the [[Eugene O'Neill Theater Center]] in Waterford, CT travel to the Goodspeed each summer to practice reviewing full productions.\n\nTours of many of the Goodspeed facilities can be scheduled in advance for a small fee.  Tickets to the opera house or theatre productions should be ordered in advance as most performances in the relatively small theater sell-out quickly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |title=Visit CT |work=Visit CT |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714194527/http://www.ctvisit.com/tours/goodspeed-opera-house-tour/summary/2236 |archivedate=2014-07-14 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Connecticut}}\n*[[National Register of Historic Places listings in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.goodspeed.org/ Goodspeed Musicals official website]\n* {{IBDB name}}\n* [http://www.andrewmcgibbonphotography.com/goodspeed-opera-house Google Virtual Tour of Goodspeed Opera House]\n* [https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/goodspeed-opera-house Goodspeed on Atlas Obscura]\n\n{{TonyAward RegionalTheatre 1976-2000}}\n{{Special Tony Award}}\n\n[[Category:1963 establishments in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:East Haddam, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:League of Resident Theatres]]\n[[Category:Theatres in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Tony Award winners]]\n[[Category:Regional theatre in the United States]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Theatre companies in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Theatres completed in 1877]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Middlesex County, Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Event venues on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Opera houses on the National Register of Historic Places]]\n[[Category:Opera houses in Connecticut]]\n[[Category:Musical theatre companies]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodspeed_Musicals"}

The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy.
