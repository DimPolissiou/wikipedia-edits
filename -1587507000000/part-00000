Representing over 12,000 post-secondary students at four [[university]] campuses across the province, the NBSA works to convey student issues, concerns, and perspectives to the [[province|provincial]], [[Canadian federalism|federal]] and inter-provincial [[government]]. The NBSA works with the province, university administrators and faculty, and other stakeholders toward its goal of an affordable, accessible, and high-quality post-secondary education system in New Brunswick.\n\nThe organization was first established in 1982 as the New Brunswick Coalition of Students. It was founded to better reflect the diversity and needs of New Brunswick post-secondary students than other student organizations that existed in New Brunswick at the time.\n\nIn 1983, the NBCS became the NBSA. The organization continued to develop its identity, governance model, and public image throughout the 1980s. In 1986, the NBSA experienced its first major policy success in the awarding of two student representative seats on the Maritime Provinces Higher Education Commission. Shortly thereafter, the NBSA experienced a decline in participation and folded temporarily.\n\nThe 1990s were marked by major cutbacks to the post-secondary education system in New Brunswick. By 1995, the need for a province-based student advocacy movement had resurged and the NBSA was reassembled. The NBSA gained significant exposure in years that followed. It successfully formed relationships with each of the province\u2019s major political parties, seeing all party leaders sign a pledge to help post-secondary students prior to the 1998 New Brunswick election.\n\nThe NBSA hired its first Executive Director in the mid-2000s. The organization went on to advocate for the creation of a Post-Secondary Education Commission and a separate government ministry for post-secondary education. In 2006, the NBSA embarked on a large scale campaign to raise awareness of student issues by hosting a \u201cDay of Action,\u201d which saw television, radio, and media ads run during the 2006 provincial election.\n\nA new Post-Secondary Education Commission commenced in 2007. The NBSA recommended a debt cap, improved repayment options for student loans, and tuition regulation. In 2008, the NBSA held demonstrations across the province calling for a cap on student loan debt. In that year\u2019s budget, the provincial government announced the creation of the Timely Completion Benefit that capped student debt at $26,000 and introduced a new repayment assistance program for recent graduates.\n\nIn 2010, the Board of Directors eliminated the Executive Director position, electing to operate on a reduced budget without staff support. In 2013, the position was reinstated.\n\nIn recent years, the NBSA has re-emerged as a strong voice for post-secondary students in New Brunswick. It has built upon existing relationships with each of the province\u2019s major political parties, and has successfully forged new relationships with government, university administrators, and faculty associations.

In 2000, the [[Canon EOS D30|D30]] was announced, as the first [[digital photography|digital SLR]] designed and produced entirely by Canon. Since 2005, all newly announced EOS cameras have used digital [[image sensor]]s rather than film. The EOS line is still in production as Canon's current [[digital SLR]] (DSLR) range, and, with the 2012 introduction of the [[Canon EOS M]], Canon's [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC) system. In 2018 the system was further extended with the introduction of the EOS R camera, Canon's first full frame mirrorless interchangeable lens system.\n\nThe development project was called \u201cEOS (Electro Optical System).\u201d The \u201cEOS\u201d is also the name of the goddess of dawn in Greek mythology, even more apropos for the new-generation SLR camera.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|title=View by period - 1987-1991 - Canon Camera Museum|website=global.canon}}</ref>\n\nThe EOS emblem was created using [[Handel Gothic]] typography.\n\nIt competes primarily with the [[Nikon F]] series and its successors, as well as autofocus SLR systems from [[Olympus Corporation]], [[Pentax]], [[Sony]]/[[Minolta]], and [[Panasonic]]/[[Leica Camera|Leica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canonrumors.com/2011/04/canon-destroys-nikon-in-dslr-marketshare/|title=DSLR Worldwide Market Share, 2010|accessdate=2 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426104707/http://www.canonrumors.com/2011/04/canon-destroys-nikon-in-dslr-marketshare/|archive-date=26 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the heart of the system is the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF lens mount]], which replaced the previous [[Canon FD lens mount|FD lens mount]], which mainly supported only manual-focus lenses. The EOS R full frame camera introduced a new lens mount to the system \u2013 the [[Canon RF mount|RF mount]].\n\n==EF lens mount==\n{{main article|Canon EF lens mount}}\n[[File:Canon EF Nomenclature.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Features of EF-lens]]\nThe bayonet-style EF lens mount is at the centre of the EOS camera system. Breaking compatibility with the earlier [[Canon FD|FD mount]], it was designed with no mechanical linkages between moving parts in the lens and in the camera. The aperture and focus are controlled via electrical contacts, with motors in the lens itself.  This was similar in some ways to Canon's earlier attempt at AF with the [[Canon T80|T80]]. Other manufacturers including [[Contax]] (with its G series of interchangeable-lens 35&nbsp;mm rangefinder cameras), [[Nikon]]'s 1983 F3AF, and [[Olympus (company)|Olympus]] (with its [[Four Thirds System]]) have since embraced this type of direct drive system.  It is a large lens mount compared to most of its competition, enabling the use of larger aperture lenses.<ref name=canon>{{cite web|url=http://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|title=Canon History Hall: Birth of New-Generation Autofocus SLR Camera, \"EOS\"|accessdate=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026231954/http://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|archive-date=26 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!--\n{{Cleanup-gallery}}\n<gallery>\nImage:EF-lens-mount.jpg|The bayonet-style mount\nImage:Canon-14mm MG 2029.jpg|[[Canon EF 14mm lens|14mm {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon TS-E24mm F3.5L.jpg|[[TS-E24mm f/3.5L|TS-E 24mm {{f/}}3.5L lens]]\nImage:35L.jpg|[[Canon EF 35mm lens|35mm {{f/}}1.4L lens]]\nImage:Lens Canon EF 50mm f1.4.jpg|[[Canon EF 50mm lens|50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens]]\nImage:85L.jpg|[[Canon EF 85mm lens|85mm {{f/}}1.2L lens]]\nImage:Canon 100mm macro MG 1959.JPG|[[Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM lens|100mm {{f/}}2.8 macro lens]]\nImage:Canon EF 135mm f2L.jpg|[[Canon EF 135mm lens|135mm {{f/}}2L lens]]\nImage:Canon 400mm f28 img 1243.jpg|[[Canon EF 400mm lens|400mm {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon 16-35 L IMG 0157.JPG|[[Canon EF 16-35mm lens|16\u201335 {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon 24-70 mm F2.8 lens side at 70 mm.jpg|[[Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L lens|24\u201370 {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nFile:Canon EF 70-200mm F2.8 IS II USM without hood.jpg|[[Canon EF 70-200mm lens|70-200mm {{f/}}2.8L IS USM II lens]]\nImage:Canon 70-300 DO MG 2020.jpg|[[Canon EF 70-300mm lens|70-300mm {{f/}}4.5-5.6 IS DO lens]]\nImage:CANON35350.jpg|[[Canon EF 35-350mm lens|35-350mm {{f/}}3.5-5.6L lens]]\nFile:Canon EF 24-70mm f2.8 L II USM lens.jpg|[[Canon EF 24-70mm lens|24-70mm {{f/}}2.8L USM II lens]]\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n==EOS flash system==\n{{main article|Canon EOS flash system}}\n[[File:Canon 550EX.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Speedlite 550EX]], an early E-TTL flash from 1998]]\nThe [[flash (photography)|flash]] system in the EOS cameras has gone through a number of evolutions since its first implementation.  The basic EOS flash system was actually developed not for the first EOS camera, but rather for the last high-end [[Canon FD|FD-mount]] manual-focus camera, the [[Canon T90|T90]], launched in 1986.  This was the first Canon camera with [[through-the-lens]] (TTL) flash metering, although other brands had been metering that way for some time.  It also introduced the A-TTL (Advanced TTL) system for better flash exposure in program mode, using infrared preflashes to gauge subject distance.\n\nThis system was carried over into the early EOS cameras wholesale.  A-TTL largely fell out of favor, and was replaced by E-TTL (Evaluative TTL).  This used a pre-flash for advanced metering, and used the [[autofocus]] system to judge where the main subject was for more accurate exposure.  E-TTL II, which was an enhancement in the camera's [[firmware]] only, replaced E-TTL from 2004.\n\nCanon [[Canon Speedlite|Speedlite]]-brand flashes have evolved alongside the cameras.  They are capable of wired and wireless multi-flash setups, the latter using visible or infrared pulses to synchronise. Later models, including RT in their model name, can also communicate via radio links, where up to 16 units can make up a network. Canon also produces Speedlite accessories, including the OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord, which can be used to hand-hold the flash while allowing the camera to control it through the cord. The Off-Camera Shoe Cord is popular among portrait photographers who need to have more control over lighting than a camera mounted flash can offer.\n<!--\n<gallery>\nImage:Canon Speedlite 550EX flash.jpg|[[Speedlite 550EX]]\nImage:Canon speedlite 430ex.jpg|[[Speedlite 430EX]]\nImage:Canon Speedlite 430EX II.jpg|[[Speedlite 430EX II]]\nImage:Canon OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord.jpg|[[OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord]]\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n==EOS cameras==\nAs of 2017, Canon has released no fewer than 70 EOS SLR and DSLR camera models, starting with the introduction of the EOS 650 in 1987.  In the 1990s, Canon worked with Kodak to produce digital camera bodies, starting with the EOS DCS 3 in 1995.  The first digital EOS SLR camera wholly designed and manufactured by Canon was the [[Canon EOS D30|EOS D30]], released in 2000.\n\nCanon sold two EOS cameras designed to use the [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] film format, the [[Canon EOS IX|EOS IX]] and the [[EOS IX Lite]].\n\nCanon also sold a manual-focus camera, the [[Canon EF-M camera|Canon EF-M]], which used the same EF lens mount as the EOS cameras.  It came with all the automatic and manual exposure functions but lacked autofocus.  It came equipped with a split-screen/microprism [[focusing screen]] for precise manual focusing.\n\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:EOS 650D.jpg|Canon EOS 650D, a Canon entry-level DSLR\nFile:EOS M weiss Frontal mit Speedlite 90EX.jpg|Canon EOS M, Canon's first mirrorless system camera\n</gallery>\n\n===Eye-controlled focusing===\n\nThrough the tracking of eyeball movements, EOS cameras equipped with eye-controlled focusing (ECF) (some identifiable by the suffix E) were able to select the desired autofocus point in the scene, based on where the user was looking in the viewfinder frame.  ECF was especially useful in sports photography where the subject may shift its position in the frame rapidly.\n\nEOS cameras equipped with ECF were the [[Canon EOS 5/A2/A2e|EOS A2E]] (U.S. model names are shown; see the table below for equivalents in other countries), EOS Elan IIE, EOS IXe, [[Canon EOS-3|EOS-3]], [[Canon EOS 30|EOS Elan 7E]], and [[Canon EOS 30V|EOS Elan 7NE]].\n\nCanon did not continue its use of eye-controlled focusing in its digital SLRs. The EOS Elan 7NE was the last EOS camera to have this function.\n\n===Quick control dial===\n[[File:Canon 60D Rear View.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rear view of Canon 60D featuring quick control dial to the right of the LCD screen.]]\nMost prosumer and professional level EOS cameras feature a large quick control dial (QCD) on the camera back.  The first consumer-level EOS camera with this feature was the [[Canon EOS 760D|EOS 760D/Rebel T6s]], announced in February 2015. This feature allows easy adjustment of certain parameters using the thumb. The QCD is used for quick access to often-used functions that would otherwise require a more complicated procedure of button presses and dial clicks. Settings such as ISO button, Exposure Compensation button, or menus are all easily available through the QCD\u2248.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Canon EOS Rebel T5 For Dummies|last=Brand|first=Wiley|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-93362-6|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=pg 70}}</ref>\n\nCameras equipped with the QCD can easily be operated with one hand (forefinger on the main dial, thumb on the QCD) without taking the eye off the viewfinder.\n\nA QCD is programmed to perform useful functions, which may include setting exposure compensation, setting of aperture in manual exposure mode, and scrolling of images and menus in digital EOS cameras.\n\n===Multi-point autofocus system===\nCurrently, top-line EOS cameras have either 61 or 65 user-selectable autofocus (AF) points. Autofocus is a camera's ability to focus a lens automatically on an object by pressing down on the shutter button.

The camera generally focuses on the closest object or on human faces, which may not be what the photographer wants, so EOS cameras equipped with a multi-point AF system still allow the photographer to manually select an AF point.\n\nThe EOS-3, [[Canon EOS-1v|EOS-1v]], all EOS-1D models prior to the EOS-1D X, [[Canon EOS 80D|EOS 80D]], [[Canon EOS 77D|EOS 77D]], and [[Canon EOS 800D|EOS 800D/Rebel T7i]] feature a 45-point AF system. Most Canon DSLRs introduced since late 2005, starting from the [[Canon EOS 20D|EOS 20D]] and the [[Canon EOS 400D|Rebel XTi (400D)]], feature a nine-point AF system in a diamond-shape formation. The [[Canon EOS 5D|EOS 5D]], released in 2005, takes this 9-point AF system a step further by introducing six more 'invisible' AF points (i.e., not user selectable) in helping the camera acquire focus faster during subject tracking. There have been several exceptions to Canon's recent rule of a 9-point AF system. The EOS 1000D (Rebel XS) has the 7-point AF system of most older Canon DSLRs.  The EOS 7D, released in 2009, has a 19-point AF layout, fitting essentially within the same diamond-shaped area of the frame as the nine-point layout. The [[Canon EOS 70D|EOS 70D]], released in August 2013, inherited the 7D's 19-point layout, but with fewer AF control options. The 70D system was in turn handed down to the [[Canon EOS 750D|EOS 750D]] (Rebel T6i) and [[Canon EOS 760D|760D]] (Rebel T6s), announced in February 2015. As mentioned above, the EOS 5D Mark III, EOS-1D X, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS-1D X Mark II have 61-point AF layouts. The [[Canon EOS 6D|EOS 6D]], released in October 2012, has an 11-point layout. The EOS 80D, announced in 2016, marked the return of 45-point AF systems to the Canon EOS line, as well as the first appearance of a 45-point system in a non-professional body. This system was brought downmarket in 2017 with its inclusion in the upper-entry-level EOS 77D and mid-entry-level EOS 800D/Rebel T7i.\n\nFor the earlier generation of 45-point AF system, the central column of 1 or 2 sensors (7 in all up to [[Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II|EOS-1Ds Mk II]], [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II|EOS-1D Mk II N]]) are cross-type sensors, which are sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines to offer a high degree of accuracy. The [[Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III|EOS-1Ds Mk III]], replaced by the EOS-1D X, has 19 cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, as well as placing the cross-type sensors to complement the [[Rule of thirds|Rule of Thirds]]. The other Canon professional SLR replaced by the EOS-1D X, the APS-H [[Canon EOS-1D Mark IV|EOS-1D Mk IV]], has 39 cross-type sensors, a major increase from the 19 of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark III|Mk III]]. Of the 61 AF points of the EOS-1D X and 5D MkIII, 21 central points and 20 outer points are cross-type, and five central points are dual-cross-type (sensitive to diagonal lines in addition to horizontal and vertical). All 65 points of the 7D MkII are cross-type, but only the center point is dual-cross-type.\n\nSimilarly, {{as of|2017|lc=on}}, all AF points on later generations of the X0D series (beginning with the 40D and continuing through the current 80D) are cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, and the center sensor is dual-cross-type for even greater accuracy and sensitivity. In June 2012, the [[Canon EOS 650D|EOS 650D]] (Rebel T4i) became the first consumer-level Canon to receive this AF system.\n\n===Naming scheme===\nIdentical Canon models are sometimes marketed under different names in different parts of the world. For example, the ''EOS Rebel 2000'' known in the Americas is also known as ''EOS Kiss III'' in Japan, and ''[[Canon EOS 300|EOS 300]]'' in other parts of the world.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

In 2000, the [[Canon EOS D30|D30]] was announced, as the first [[digital photography|digital SLR]] designed and produced entirely by Canon. Since 2005, all newly announced EOS cameras have used digital [[image sensor]]s rather than film. The EOS line is still in production as Canon's current [[digital SLR]] (DSLR) range, and, with the 2012 introduction of the [[Canon EOS M]], Canon's [[mirrorless interchangeable-lens camera]] (MILC) system. In 2018 the system was further extended with the introduction of the EOS R camera, Canon's first full frame mirrorless interchangeable lens system.\n\nThe development project was called \u201cEOS (Electro Optical System).\u201d The \u201cEOS\u201d is also the name of the goddess of dawn in Greek mythology, even more apropos for the new-generation SLR camera.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|title=View by period - 1987-1991 - Canon Camera Museum|website=global.canon}}</ref>\n\nThe EOS emblem was created using [[Handel Gothic]] typography.\n\nIt competes primarily with the [[Nikon F]] series and its successors, as well as autofocus SLR systems from [[Olympus Corporation]], [[Pentax]], [[Sony]]/[[Minolta]], and [[Panasonic]]/[[Leica Camera|Leica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canonrumors.com/2011/04/canon-destroys-nikon-in-dslr-marketshare/|title=DSLR Worldwide Market Share, 2010|accessdate=2 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426104707/http://www.canonrumors.com/2011/04/canon-destroys-nikon-in-dslr-marketshare/|archive-date=26 April 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAt the heart of the system is the [[Canon EF lens mount|EF lens mount]], which replaced the previous [[Canon FD lens mount|FD lens mount]], which mainly supported only manual-focus lenses. The EOS R full frame camera introduced a new lens mount to the system \u2013 the [[Canon RF mount|RF mount]].\n\n==EF lens mount==\n{{main article|Canon EF lens mount}}\n[[File:Canon EF Nomenclature.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|Features of EF-lens]]\nThe bayonet-style EF lens mount is at the centre of the EOS camera system. Breaking compatibility with the earlier [[Canon FD|FD mount]], it was designed with no mechanical linkages between moving parts in the lens and in the camera. The aperture and focus are controlled via electrical contacts, with motors in the lens itself.  This was similar in some ways to Canon's earlier attempt at AF with the [[Canon T80|T80]]. Other manufacturers including [[Contax]] (with its G series of interchangeable-lens 35&nbsp;mm rangefinder cameras), [[Nikon]]'s 1983 F3AF, and [[Olympus (company)|Olympus]] (with its [[Four Thirds System]]) have since embraced this type of direct drive system.  It is a large lens mount compared to most of its competition, enabling the use of larger aperture lenses.<ref name=canon>{{cite web|url=http://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|title=Canon History Hall: Birth of New-Generation Autofocus SLR Camera, \"EOS\"|accessdate=26 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026231954/http://global.canon/en/c-museum/history/story07.html|archive-date=26 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n<!--\n{{Cleanup-gallery}}\n<gallery>\nImage:EF-lens-mount.jpg|The bayonet-style mount\nImage:Canon-14mm MG 2029.jpg|[[Canon EF 14mm lens|14mm {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon TS-E24mm F3.5L.jpg|[[TS-E24mm f/3.5L|TS-E 24mm {{f/}}3.5L lens]]\nImage:35L.jpg|[[Canon EF 35mm lens|35mm {{f/}}1.4L lens]]\nImage:Lens Canon EF 50mm f1.4.jpg|[[Canon EF 50mm lens|50mm {{f/}}1.4 lens]]\nImage:85L.jpg|[[Canon EF 85mm lens|85mm {{f/}}1.2L lens]]\nImage:Canon 100mm macro MG 1959.JPG|[[Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM lens|100mm {{f/}}2.8 macro lens]]\nImage:Canon EF 135mm f2L.jpg|[[Canon EF 135mm lens|135mm {{f/}}2L lens]]\nImage:Canon 400mm f28 img 1243.jpg|[[Canon EF 400mm lens|400mm {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon 16-35 L IMG 0157.JPG|[[Canon EF 16-35mm lens|16\u201335 {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nImage:Canon 24-70 mm F2.8 lens side at 70 mm.jpg|[[Canon EF 24-70mm f/2.8L lens|24\u201370 {{f/}}2.8L lens]]\nFile:Canon EF 70-200mm F2.8 IS II USM without hood.jpg|[[Canon EF 70-200mm lens|70-200mm {{f/}}2.8L IS USM II lens]]\nImage:Canon 70-300 DO MG 2020.jpg|[[Canon EF 70-300mm lens|70-300mm {{f/}}4.5-5.6 IS DO lens]]\nImage:CANON35350.jpg|[[Canon EF 35-350mm lens|35-350mm {{f/}}3.5-5.6L lens]]\nFile:Canon EF 24-70mm f2.8 L II USM lens.jpg|[[Canon EF 24-70mm lens|24-70mm {{f/}}2.8L USM II lens]]\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n==EOS flash system==\n{{main article|Canon EOS flash system}}\n[[File:Canon 550EX.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Speedlite 550EX]], an early E-TTL flash from 1998]]\nThe [[flash (photography)|flash]] system in the EOS cameras has gone through a number of evolutions since its first implementation.  The basic EOS flash system was actually developed not for the first EOS camera, but rather for the last high-end [[Canon FD|FD-mount]] manual-focus camera, the [[Canon T90|T90]], launched in 1986.  This was the first Canon camera with [[through-the-lens]] (TTL) flash metering, although other brands had been metering that way for some time.  It also introduced the A-TTL (Advanced TTL) system for better flash exposure in program mode, using infrared preflashes to gauge subject distance.\n\nThis system was carried over into the early EOS cameras wholesale.  A-TTL largely fell out of favor, and was replaced by E-TTL (Evaluative TTL).  This used a pre-flash for advanced metering, and used the [[autofocus]] system to judge where the main subject was for more accurate exposure.  E-TTL II, which was an enhancement in the camera's [[firmware]] only, replaced E-TTL from 2004.\n\nCanon [[Canon Speedlite|Speedlite]]-brand flashes have evolved alongside the cameras.  They are capable of wired and wireless multi-flash setups, the latter using visible or infrared pulses to synchronise. Later models, including RT in their model name, can also communicate via radio links, where up to 16 units can make up a network. Canon also produces Speedlite accessories, including the OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord, which can be used to hand-hold the flash while allowing the camera to control it through the cord. The Off-Camera Shoe Cord is popular among portrait photographers who need to have more control over lighting than a camera mounted flash can offer.\n<!--\n<gallery>\nImage:Canon Speedlite 550EX flash.jpg|[[Speedlite 550EX]]\nImage:Canon speedlite 430ex.jpg|[[Speedlite 430EX]]\nImage:Canon Speedlite 430EX II.jpg|[[Speedlite 430EX II]]\nImage:Canon OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord.jpg|[[OC-E3 Off-Camera Shoe Cord]]\n</gallery>\n-->\n\n==EOS cameras==\nAs of 2017, Canon has released no fewer than 70 EOS SLR and DSLR camera models, starting with the introduction of the EOS 650 in 1987.  In the 1990s, Canon worked with Kodak to produce digital camera bodies, starting with the EOS DCS 3 in 1995.  The first digital EOS SLR camera wholly designed and manufactured by Canon was the [[Canon EOS D30|EOS D30]], released in 2000.\n\nCanon sold two EOS cameras designed to use the [[Advanced Photo System|APS]] film format, the [[Canon EOS IX|EOS IX]] and the [[EOS IX Lite]].\n\nCanon also sold a manual-focus camera, the [[Canon EF-M camera|Canon EF-M]], which used the same EF lens mount as the EOS cameras.  It came with all the automatic and manual exposure functions but lacked autofocus.  It came equipped with a split-screen/microprism [[focusing screen]] for precise manual focusing.\n\n<gallery widths=\"220\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:EOS 650D.jpg|Canon EOS 650D, a Canon entry-level DSLR\nFile:EOS M weiss Frontal mit Speedlite 90EX.jpg|Canon EOS M, Canon's first mirrorless system camera\n</gallery>\n\n===Eye-controlled focusing===\n\nThrough the tracking of eyeball movements, EOS cameras equipped with eye-controlled focusing (ECF) (some identifiable by the suffix E) were able to select the desired autofocus point in the scene, based on where the user was looking in the viewfinder frame.  ECF was especially useful in sports photography where the subject may shift its position in the frame rapidly.\n\nEOS cameras equipped with ECF were the [[Canon EOS 5/A2/A2e|EOS A2E]] (U.S. model names are shown; see the table below for equivalents in other countries), EOS Elan IIE, EOS IXe, [[Canon EOS-3|EOS-3]], [[Canon EOS 30|EOS Elan 7E]], and [[Canon EOS 30V|EOS Elan 7NE]].\n\nCanon did not continue its use of eye-controlled focusing in its digital SLRs. The EOS Elan 7NE was the last EOS camera to have this function.\n\n===Quick control dial===\n[[File:Canon 60D Rear View.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Rear view of Canon 60D featuring quick control dial to the right of the LCD screen.]]\nMost prosumer and professional level EOS cameras feature a large quick control dial (QCD) on the camera back.  The first consumer-level EOS camera with this feature was the [[Canon EOS 760D|EOS 760D/Rebel T6s]], announced in February 2015. This feature allows easy adjustment of certain parameters using the thumb. The QCD is used for quick access to often-used functions that would otherwise require a more complicated procedure of button presses and dial clicks. Settings such as ISO button, Exposure Compensation button, or menus are all easily available through the QCD\u2248.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Canon EOS Rebel T5 For Dummies|last=Brand|first=Wiley|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|year=2014|isbn=978-1-118-93362-6|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|pages=pg 70}}</ref>\n\nCameras equipped with the QCD can easily be operated with one hand (forefinger on the main dial, thumb on the QCD) without taking the eye off the viewfinder.\n\nA QCD is programmed to perform useful functions, which may include setting exposure compensation, setting of aperture in manual exposure mode, and scrolling of images and menus in digital EOS cameras.\n\n===Multi-point autofocus system===\nCurrently, top-line EOS cameras have either 61 or 65 user-selectable autofocus (AF) points. Autofocus is a camera's ability to focus a lens automatically on an object by pressing down on the shutter button. Autofocus most often chooses the closest image in the field of view to focus on.<ref name=\":0\" /> The following EOS cameras feature such a system, with 61 points unless otherwise indicated:\n* The [[Canon EOS 5D Mark III|EOS 5D Mark III]], introduced in March 2012.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/about/newsroom/press-releases/press-release-details/2012/20120302_eos5dmarkiii_pressreleasedata/20120302_eos5dmarkiii_pressreleasedata |title=Canon U.S.A.

The camera generally focuses on the closest object or on human faces, which may not be what the photographer wants, so EOS cameras equipped with a multi-point AF system still allow the photographer to manually select an AF point.\n\nThe EOS-3, [[Canon EOS-1v|EOS-1v]], all EOS-1D models prior to the EOS-1D X, [[Canon EOS 80D|EOS 80D]], [[Canon EOS 77D|EOS 77D]], and [[Canon EOS 800D|EOS 800D/Rebel T7i]] feature a 45-point AF system. Most Canon DSLRs introduced since late 2005, starting from the [[Canon EOS 20D|EOS 20D]] and the [[Canon EOS 400D|Rebel XTi (400D)]], feature a nine-point AF system in a diamond-shape formation. The [[Canon EOS 5D|EOS 5D]], released in 2005, takes this 9-point AF system a step further by introducing six more 'invisible' AF points (i.e., not user selectable) in helping the camera acquire focus faster during subject tracking. There have been several exceptions to Canon's recent rule of a 9-point AF system. The EOS 1000D (Rebel XS) has the 7-point AF system of most older Canon DSLRs.  The EOS 7D, released in 2009, has a 19-point AF layout, fitting essentially within the same diamond-shaped area of the frame as the nine-point layout. The [[Canon EOS 70D|EOS 70D]], released in August 2013, inherited the 7D's 19-point layout, but with fewer AF control options. The 70D system was in turn handed down to the [[Canon EOS 750D|EOS 750D]] (Rebel T6i) and [[Canon EOS 760D|760D]] (Rebel T6s), announced in February 2015. As mentioned above, the EOS 5D Mark III, EOS-1D X, EOS 5DS/5DS R, and EOS-1D X Mark II have 61-point AF layouts. The [[Canon EOS 6D|EOS 6D]], released in October 2012, has an 11-point layout. The EOS 80D, announced in 2016, marked the return of 45-point AF systems to the Canon EOS line, as well as the first appearance of a 45-point system in a non-professional body. This system was brought downmarket in 2017 with its inclusion in the upper-entry-level EOS 77D and mid-entry-level EOS 800D/Rebel T7i.\n\nFor the earlier generation of 45-point AF system, the central column of 1 or 2 sensors (7 in all up to [[Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II|EOS-1Ds Mk II]], [[Canon EOS-1D Mark II|EOS-1D Mk II N]]) are cross-type sensors, which are sensitive to both vertical and horizontal lines to offer a high degree of accuracy. The [[Canon EOS-1Ds Mark III|EOS-1Ds Mk III]], replaced by the EOS-1D X, has 19 cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, as well as placing the cross-type sensors to complement the [[Rule of thirds|Rule of Thirds]]. The other Canon professional SLR replaced by the EOS-1D X, the APS-H [[Canon EOS-1D Mark IV|EOS-1D Mk IV]], has 39 cross-type sensors, a major increase from the 19 of the [[Canon EOS-1D Mark III|Mk III]]. Of the 61 AF points of the EOS-1D X and 5D MkIII, 21 central points and 20 outer points are cross-type, and five central points are dual-cross-type (sensitive to diagonal lines in addition to horizontal and vertical). All 65 points of the 7D MkII are cross-type, but only the center point is dual-cross-type.\n\nSimilarly, {{as of|2017|lc=on}}, all AF points on later generations of the X0D series (beginning with the 40D and continuing through the current 80D) are cross-type sensors for higher accuracy, and the center sensor is dual-cross-type for even greater accuracy and sensitivity. In June 2012, the [[Canon EOS 650D|EOS 650D]] (Rebel T4i) became the first consumer-level Canon to receive this AF system.\n\n===Naming scheme===\nIdentical Canon models are sometimes marketed under different names in different parts of the world. For example, the ''EOS Rebel 2000'' known in the Americas is also known as ''EOS Kiss III'' in Japan, and ''[[Canon EOS 300|EOS 300]]'' in other parts of the world.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!
