Guru Gobind Singh on learning this kind and humanitarian approach profusely thanked the Nawab of Malerkotla and blessed him with his [[Hukamnama]], [[Kirpan]], etc. In recognition of this act, the State of Malerkotla did not witness a single incident of violence during partition.<ref name=Tribune2006/> Many local people attribute this peaceful strain to the presence of the shrine of 'Baba Haidar Sheikh', the Sufi saint, who founded the town of Malerkotla more than 500 years ago.<ref>[https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/Store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 The Legend of Malerkotla: A Tale from the Punjab (2004)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019094523/https://www.nationalfilmnetwork.com/store/ProductDetails.aspx?productID=644&Title=The%20Legend%20of%20Malerkotla:%20A%20Tale%20from%20the%20Punjab&RefPage=ProductsList.aspx&CategoryID=79 |date=19 October 2007 }} 48 min, DVD, {{ISBN|978-0-8026-0761-4}}.</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Anna B | last = Bigelow | title = Malerkotla: A heritage going to seed | date = 2 December 2000 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2000/20001202/windows/main1.htm | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | accessdate = 2013-03-24}}</ref>\n\nNawab Sher Mohammed Khan married a lady of [[Guru Gobind Singh|Guru Gobind Singh's]] family who converted to Islam, hence all the succeeding Nawabs descend in the female line from [[Guru Hargobind|Guru Hargobind Singh]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Buyers |first1=Cristopher |title=malerk6 |url=https://www.royalark.net/India/malerk6.htm |website=www.royalark.net}}</ref> \n\nFollowing [[Independence Day (India)|Indian independence]] and the signing of the [[instrument of accession]] to the [[Indian Union]] in 1948, Maler Kotla joined the newly established state of [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] (PEPSU) until its merger with [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] in 1956.\n\n===Rulers===\nThe rulers were titled '[[Nawab]]'.

He reshaped the then-iconic Fisk Tire Boy in late 1929.

Path: R. Atkinson Fox Society's homepage>Links>See More. Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

Some artists created a niche and then stuck with it, such as in drawing comical situations, domestic follies, political satire, pretty women or simple pleasures.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

Its key source was ''[[The Artist's Magazine|American Artist]]'' magazine (1937-2012), June 2006.</ref> Major advancements in printing techniques were then taking place. This included breakthroughs in the [[halftone]] process. It made the printing of images for commercial usage more economical, feasible, and realistic. The reproduction of art from [[wood engraving]]s (time consuming and strenuous), was largely replaced with [[photoengraving|photo-mechanical engravings]] (higher accuracy level).<ref>''Scribner's Magazine''. \"American Illustration and the Reproductive  Arts\" by Carrington, July 1922 pp. 123-28. (Viewable online at www.unz.com.)</ref> These and other methods were utilized by artist, writer, teacher, innovator\u2013[[Howard Pyle]], who is generally regarded as \"The Father of American Illustration.\"<ref>''The New York Times'', Nov. 10, 1911 p. 11. Obit column. Excerpt: \"He was almost [or like] the father of American magazine illustration, as it is known to-day.\"</ref> Others who gained fame in this field included [[Howard Chandler Christy]], [[Harrison Fisher]], [[James Montgomery Flagg]], [[Charles Dana Gibson]], [[John Held Jr.]], [[J. C. Leyendecker]], [[Maxfield Parrish]], [[Coles Phillips]], [[Frederic Remington]], [[Norman Rockwell]], [[Jessie Willcox Smith]] and [[N. C. Wyeth]].\n\nHowever, the vast majority of illustrators received little recognition, compared to the [[fine art]]ists. This was basically due to their artwork being viewed as more commercially, than creatively inspired. Nonetheless, these unheralded illustrators played a powerful role, in communicating the people's aspirations, concerns, customs, humor, labor, morals and social interests.<ref name=\"historical\">''Cover Story: The Art of American Magazine Covers 1900-1950'' by Heller & Fili, 1996.</ref> One of them was Paul Martin, whose work appeared on the covers of ''[[Collier's]]'', ''[[Everybody's Magazine|Everybody's]]'', ''[[Farm & Fireside]]'', ''[[The Farmer's Wife (women's magazine)|The Farmer's Wife]]'', ''[[Liberty (general interest magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]'' and ''[[People's Home Journal]]'' from 1923-31. These seven magazines were once ranked among the most widely circulated. They all went out of business long ago, except for ''[[Parents (magazine)|Parents]]''. Their eventual downfall was caused by the changing times (or taste), emergence of radio and television (more attractive medium for advertisers), and economics (increased cost / decreased revenue). The more specialized ones that targeted specific audiences, tended to fare better. Another point is that major advancements in photographic equipment and technology took place during the 1930s. This brought about the gradual changeover (twenty-five+ year process) from illustrated to photographic covers.<ref name=\"historical\"/> The former still lingered on, for its innovative and enchanting qualities, until succumbing to digital media (especially [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]).\n\n==Collier's==\n[[File:Collier's10-25-24.jpg|thumb|117px|(Calling the play) ''Collier's'' 10-25-1924]]\nGeneral interest magazines (mixture of entertainment, pictures, politics, serials, short stories and sports) were once very popular and appealed to diverse audiences. One of them was the historically significant ''[[Collier's]]'' (founded 1888), which had a revival under new editor [[Collier's#Editors|William L.

There was a nostalgic element to them. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers to make an instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was through the use of various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and [[perspective (graphical)|linear perspective]]. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then).<ref>''Collier's'' usually preferred cover art that conveyed plain and simple thoughts, unlike its main rival in the ''Post''.</ref> Martin mostly hired local boys for the [[photo shoot|photo sessions]].<ref name=\"hard\">''Hard Row to Hoe'' (literary newsletter), V-9 Fall 2005. \"Golden Era of the Illustrations\" pp. 1-3.

He was unwittingly caught up in the famous player-writer dispute of 1924 (overview in reference<ref>''Brooklyn Daily Eagle'', May 11, 1924 pp. 1-2D. The [[United States Tennis Association|USLTA]] adopted the player-writer rule on Feb. 2, 1924. It stated that any active player who received payment for writing on tennis, would be stripped of their amateur status starting Jan. 1, 1925. This resolution was easily approved by its members, who voted in blocks (47,196 to 6,250). It would have most deeply affected Bill Tilden, followed distantly by Vincent Richards. Strong opposition came from the influential [[Stephen Wallis Merrihew|S. Wallis Merrihew]], fans and writers.  A petition was signed by, among others, 12 [not 18] of the top 25 ranked racketmen from the [[New York metropolitan area|NY metro area]]. It rebuked the new rule that redefined amateurism. [[Walter Merrill Hall]] (#11) and Martin (#18) did not sign on with the pro-Tilden forces. They instead wrote a separate letter (full text printed, p. 2D), urging its reconsideration. A special committee of seven was formed, to further study the troubling matter on Nov. 2, 1924. (This was after a months-long selection process, to fill the final three critical spots.) It consisted of Arthur Hellen, Merrihew, Jones Mersereau, [[Devereux Milburn]], Senator [[George W. Pepper|George Pepper]], [[Grantland Rice]] and Tilden. Their report was released on Dec. 13. The USLTA accepted its recommendations, to greatly modify the anti-writing resolution. The alternative was to face continued backlash.</ref>).

A first-hand account by ''New York Times'' sportswriter, [[Allison Danzig]]. Excerpts: \"This afternoon [[Bill Tilden|[Bill] Tilden]] and Strachan advanced from the semi-finals of the doubles, by putting out Alfred D. Hammett and Paul Martin at 6-4, 5-7, 6-1, 6-3. ... It required some of the best tennis that Tilden has played here all week, before the Philadelphians were able to overcome the New York pair. Hammett and Martin were always contenders, except in the third set when they slumped badly; and in order to hold them off, Tilden constantly found it necessary to invade his partner's territory and play the opposing pair single-handed. ... There was nothing to choose between the two teams in the first and second sets. In the third set, Hammett and Martin went to pieces as Tilden became rampant and raked their court with placement drives and volleys. After the Phlladelphians had gained a commanding lead [in that one], the New York pair allowed the set to go without making much effort, preferring to save their strength for the next chapter. But after the rest period, Tilden returned to the courts to play perhaps his best tennis of the match. Both Martin and Hammett fought with everything they had and their team work was splendidly coordinated, but all counted for nought against the individual brilliance of Tilden\" [then ranked [[World number 1 ranked male tennis players|World No. 1]]].<ref name=\"Tilden\"/><ref>''The New York Times'', Sept. 30, 1921 p. 12.

It declared war against the Ottomans, saying it would annex the city. A naval battle fought at Prevesa, Greece, ended in the destruction of three Ottoman ships and the recognition of Italian sovereignty over the Port of Tripoli. The Italians controlled the region until 1943.

In the [[Middle Ages]] the port fell in disuse, but under [[Ottoman rule]] started to grow in importance. In the late 1920s the Italian colonial authorities created the port that exists today. Other important infrastructures added in the 1930s were the enlargement of the port of Tripoli with the addition of a [[seaplane]] facility.<ref>[http://www.ernandes.net/ricordi/rionelido/cap01/tripolimap30.jpg Detailed map of the Port of Tripoli in the 1930s]</ref> The port was severely damaged during [[WWII]].\n[[File:Maydan Jazair Park Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|250px|View of the Maydan Jazair Park from the Safwa Hotel on Baghdad Street in the Italian quarter of Libya's capital Tripoli.

The port also features a yacht club, and a fishing wharf.\n\n{{Quote|''Libya has had a long history of port congestion. In 1977 the average waiting time for ships to be unloaded in Tripoli harbor was 24 days. Consequently, since the mid-1970s, port improvements have been a top priority for the government. These improvements raised Libya's total dry cargo handling capacity from 10.5 million tons in 1976 to 13.7 million tons in 1980.

In the [[Middle Ages]] the port fell in disuse, but under [[Ottoman rule]] started to grow in importance. In the late 1920s the Italian colonial authorities created the port that exists today. Other important infrastructures added in the 1930s were the enlargement of the port of Tripoli with the addition of a [[seaplane]] facility.<ref>[http://www.ernandes.net/ricordi/rionelido/cap01/tripolimap30.jpg Detailed map of the Port of Tripoli in the 1930s]</ref> The port was severely damaged during [[WWII]].\n[[File:Maydan Jazair Park Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|250px|View of the Maydan Jazair Park from the Safwa Hotel on Baghdad Street in the Italian quarter of Libya's capital Tripoli.

However, his inherent attraction to nature and understanding how the earth\u2019s ecosystems operated afforded him the insight that human social systems including their economies operate within parameters of the natural ecology or they destroy it. Catton\u2019s primary contribution is the trailblazing articulation of an environmental sociological framework that challenged existing sociological theories in general from a completely different tack: by synthesizing [[Sociological theory|sociological]] and [[ecological theory]]. He argued that the prevalent idea of human control over nature, instead of being a great achievement, might only be a reflection of exploitation of natural resources that were actually finite.\n\nTo set the tone for his work and the era and intellectual conflicts in which it was published, one of his observations is that, \"Monumental social changes (and troubles) in the 21st century will be misunderstood (and thus worsened, I believe) insofar as people ... continue interpreting events according to a [pre-ecological] worldview that insufficiently recognizes human society\u2019s ultimate dependence on its ecosystem context.\"<ref name=\"Catton-2008\" />{{RP|8}} He originated the formulation of ''Homo colossus'' as a quasi-[[species]] and [[detritivore]], ecologically distinct from ancestral ''Homo sapiens''.<ref>William Catton, ''Overshoot'' (1980), p. 170. \"When the earth's deposits of fossil fuels and mineral resources were being laid down, ''Homo sapiens'' had not yet been prepared by evolution to take advantage of them.

The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognised game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth qualifying round]] for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of their group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their [[Flag of Lebanon|national flag]]. After a steady decline in their [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] from 1998 to 2016, Lebanon jumped 66 places (from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018) and reached their highest rank to date\u201477th\u2014in September 2018.

football]] since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

The son of a rancher, Johnson arrived in Hollywood to deliver a consignment of horses for a film. He did stunt-double work for several years before breaking into acting with the help of [[John Ford]]. Tall and laconic, Johnson brought authenticity to many roles in [[Western (genre)|Westerns]] with his expert horsemanship. An [[elegiac]] portrayal of a former cowboy theater owner in the 1950s coming-of-age drama, ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', won Johnson the 1971 [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role|BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Before filming began, Hughes bought some horses at the Oklahoma ranch that Johnson's father managed, and hired Johnson to get the horses to northern Arizona (for ''The Outlaw'''s location shooting), and then to take them on to Hollywood.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nJohnson liked to say later that he got to Hollywood in a carload of horses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://jwayne.com/1996/05/01/a-tribute-to-ben-johnson/|title=Ben Johnson|publisher=JWayne.com|accessdate=June 24, 2015}}</ref> With his experience wrangling for Hughes during ''The Outlaw'''s location shooting, once in Hollywood, he did stunt work for the 1939 movie [[The Fighting Gringo (1939 film)|''The Fighting Gringo'']], and throughout the 1940s, he found work [[Wrangler (profession)|wrangling horses]] and doing stunt work involving horses.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nHis work as a stuntman caught the eye of [[film director|director]] [[John Ford]]. Ford hired Johnson for stunt work in the 1948 film [[Fort Apache (film)|''Fort Apache'']], and as the riding double for [[Henry Fonda]].<ref name=EricksonH-AM/> During shooting, the horses pulling a wagon with three men in it stampeded. Johnson, who \"happened to be settin' on a horse\", stopped the runaway wagon and saved the men. When Ford promised that he would be rewarded, Johnson hoped it would be with another doubling job, or maybe a small speaking role.<ref name=BrownDG-AC-1995>{{cite journal|author=Brown, David G.|date=September\u2013October 1995|title=Last of a Breed|journal=American Cowboy|publisher=Active Interest Media|page=43|volume= 2|issue=3|issn=1079-3690}}</ref> Instead he received a seven-year acting contract from Ford.<ref>{{cite book|author=McBride, Joseph|year=2003|title=Searching for John Ford: A Life|publisher=Macmillan|page=496|isbn=978-0-312-31011-0}}</ref> Ford called Johnson into his office, handed him an envelope with a contract in it. Johnson started reading it and when he got to the fifth line and it said \"$5,000 a week,\" he stopped reading, grabbed a pen, and signed it, and gave it back to Ford.<ref name=BrownDG-AC-1995/>\n\n[[File:WagonMaster-JohnsonCareyPublicity (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Johnson in ''Wagon Master'' (1950)]]\nHis first credited role was in Ford's ''[[3 Godfathers]]''; the film is notable for the riding skills demonstrated by both Johnson and star [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]]. He later said the film was the most physically challenging of his career. Ford then suggested a starring role  for him in the 1949 film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''; he played \"Gregg\" opposite [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]]. Ford cast him in two of the three films that have come to be known as Ford's cavalry trilogy, all starring [[John Wayne]]: ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), and ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'' (1950); both roles showcased Johnson's riding ability. Ford also cast Johnson as the lead in ''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950), one of Ford's favorites.\n\nIn real life, Johnson did not show any bad temper; his demeanor in tense situations was calm but firm. However, although known for avoiding dramas, he had definite boundaries; during the making of ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'' he defied Ford, who was notorious for browbeating his actors, and reportedly told him to go to hell. Johnson thought the incident had been forgotten, but Ford did not use him in a film for over a decade. Johnson also appeared in four films of [[Sam Peckinpah]] and had a good relationship with the wayward director. Peckinpah appreciated Johnson's authenticity and lack of acting airs.<ref name=\"Jensen\"/>\n\nJohnson played in supporting roles in [[Shane (film)|''Shane'']] (1953), where he appeared as Chris Calloway, a \"bad guy who makes good\" after being beaten senseless by [[Alan Ladd]], and ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961) starring [[Marlon Brando]]. In 1964, he worked with Ford again in ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''. He also appeared in four Peckinpah-directed films: ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965, with [[Charlton Heston]]), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969, with [[William Holden]] and [[Robert Ryan]]), and two back-to-back [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] films, [[The Getaway (1972 film)|''The Getaway'']] and the rodeo film ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (both 1972). In 1973, he co-starred as [[Melvin Purvis]] in [[John Milius]]' [[Dillinger (1973 film)|''Dillinger'']] with [[Warren Oates]]; he also appeared in Milius' 1984 film ''[[Red Dawn]]''. In 1975, he played the character Mister in [[Bite the Bullet (film)|''Bite the Bullet'']], starring [[Gene Hackman]] and [[James Coburn]]. He also appeared with [[Charles Bronson]] in 1975's [[Breakheart Pass (1975 film)|''Breakheart Pass'']]. In 1980, he was cast as Sheriff Isum Gorch in ''Soggy Bottom U.S.A.''\n\nJohnson played Bartlett in the 1962-63 season of ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]'', which featured a short scene of his riding skills. In 1963 Johnson appeared as Spinner on the TV western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the episode titled Duel at Shiloh.\" {{citation needed|date=September 2019}} In the 1966-67 television season, Johnson appeared as the character Sleeve in all 26 episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] family Western [[The Monroes (1966 TV series)|''The Monroes'']] with co-stars [[Michael Anderson, Jr.]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].<ref name=IMDb-TVography>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424565/filmoseries Filmography], imdb.com; accessed June 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nHe teamed up with John Wayne again, and director [[Andrew V. McLaglen]], in two films, appearing with [[Rock Hudson]] in [[The Undefeated (1969 film)|''The Undefeated'']] (1969) and in a fairly prominent role in ''[[Chisum]]'' (1970). The apex of Johnson's career was reached in 1971, with Johnson winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his performance as Sam the Lion in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]].\n\nOn the set of ''[[The Train Robbers]]'', in June 1972, he told Nancy Anderson of [[Copley Press|Copley News Service]] that winning the Oscar for ''The Last Picture Show'' was not going to change him and he would not raise his salary request to studios because of it. He continued, \"I grew up on a ranch and I know livestock, so I like working in Westerns. All my life I've been afraid of failure. To avoid it, I've stuck with doing things I know how to do, and it's made me a good living\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Anderson, Nancy|date=June 4, 1972|title=John Wayne A Father Figure On Movie Set in Durango, Mexico|publisher=[[Copley Press|Copley New Service]]|newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]]}}</ref>\n\nHe played Cap Roundtree in the 1979 miniseries ''[[Sackett#The Sacketts (TV movie)|The Sacketts]]''.

When Ford promised that he would be rewarded, Johnson hoped it would be with another doubling job, or maybe a small speaking role.<ref name=BrownDG-AC-1995>{{cite journal|author=Brown, David G.|date=September\u2013October 1995|title=Last of a Breed|journal=American Cowboy|publisher=Active Interest Media|page=43|volume= 2|issue=3|issn=1079-3690}}</ref> Instead he received a seven-year acting contract from Ford.<ref>{{cite book|author=McBride, Joseph|year=2003|title=Searching for John Ford: A Life|publisher=Macmillan|page=496|isbn=978-0-312-31011-0}}</ref> Ford called Johnson into his office, handed him an envelope with a contract in it. Johnson started reading it and when he got to the fifth line and it said \"$5,000 a week,\" he stopped reading, grabbed a pen, and signed it, and gave it back to Ford.<ref name=BrownDG-AC-1995/>\n\n[[File:WagonMaster-JohnsonCareyPublicity (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Johnson in ''Wagon Master'' (1950)]]\nHis first credited role was in Ford's ''[[3 Godfathers]]''; the film is notable for the riding skills demonstrated by both Johnson and star [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]]. He later said the film was the most physically challenging of his career. Ford then suggested him for a starring role in the 1949 film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]''; he played \"Gregg\" opposite [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]]. Ford cast him in two of the three films that have come to be known as Ford's cavalry trilogy, all starring [[John Wayne]]: ''[[She Wore a Yellow Ribbon]]'' (1949), and ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'' (1950); both roles showcased Johnson's riding ability. Ford also cast Johnson as the lead in ''[[Wagon Master]]'' (1950), one of Ford's favorites.\n\nIn real life, Johnson did not show any bad temper; his demeanor in tense situations was calm but firm. However, although known for avoiding dramas, he had definite boundaries; during the making of ''[[Rio Grande (film)|Rio Grande]]'' he defied Ford, who was notorious for browbeating his actors, and reportedly told him to go to hell. Johnson thought the incident had been forgotten, but Ford did not use him in a film for over a decade. Johnson also appeared in four films of [[Sam Peckinpah]] and had a good relationship with the wayward director. Peckinpah appreciated Johnson's authenticity and lack of acting airs.<ref name=\"Jensen\"/>\n\nJohnson played in supporting roles in [[Shane (film)|''Shane'']] (1953), where he appeared as Chris Calloway, a \"bad guy who makes good\" after being beaten senseless by [[Alan Ladd]], and ''[[One-Eyed Jacks]]'' (1961) starring [[Marlon Brando]]. In 1964, he worked with Ford again in ''[[Cheyenne Autumn]]''. He also appeared in four Peckinpah-directed films: ''[[Major Dundee]]'' (1965, with [[Charlton Heston]]), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969, with [[William Holden]] and [[Robert Ryan]]), and two back-to-back [[Steve McQueen (actor)|Steve McQueen]] films, [[The Getaway (1972 film)|''The Getaway'']] and the rodeo film ''[[Junior Bonner]]'' (both 1972). In 1973, he co-starred as [[Melvin Purvis]] in [[John Milius]]' [[Dillinger (1973 film)|''Dillinger'']] with [[Warren Oates]]; he also appeared in Milius' 1984 film ''[[Red Dawn]]''. In 1975, he played the character Mister in [[Bite the Bullet (film)|''Bite the Bullet'']], starring [[Gene Hackman]] and [[James Coburn]]. He also appeared with [[Charles Bronson]] in 1975's [[Breakheart Pass (1975 film)|''Breakheart Pass'']]. In 1980, he was cast as Sheriff Isum Gorch in ''Soggy Bottom U.S.A.''\n\nJohnson played Bartlett in the 1962-63 season of ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]'', which featured a short scene of his riding skills. In 1963 Johnson appeared as Spinner on the TV western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the episode titled Duel at Shiloh.\" {{citation needed|date=September 2019}} In the 1966-67 television season, Johnson appeared as the character Sleeve in all 26 episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] family Western [[The Monroes (1966 TV series)|''The Monroes'']] with co-stars [[Michael Anderson, Jr.]] and [[Barbara Hershey]].<ref name=IMDb-TVography>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0424565/filmoseries Filmography], imdb.com; accessed June 24, 2015.</ref>\n\nHe teamed up with John Wayne again, and director [[Andrew V. McLaglen]], in two films, appearing with [[Rock Hudson]] in [[The Undefeated (1969 film)|''The Undefeated'']] (1969) and in a fairly prominent role in ''[[Chisum]]'' (1970). The apex of Johnson's career was reached in 1971, with Johnson winning an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for his performance as Sam the Lion in ''[[The Last Picture Show]]'', directed by [[Peter Bogdanovich]].\n\nOn the set of ''[[The Train Robbers]]'', in June 1972, he told Nancy Anderson of [[Copley Press|Copley News Service]] that winning the Oscar for ''The Last Picture Show'' was not going to change him and he would not raise his salary request to studios because of it. He continued, \"I grew up on a ranch and I know livestock, so I like working in Westerns. All my life I've been afraid of failure. To avoid it, I've stuck with doing things I know how to do, and it's made me a good living\".<ref>{{cite news|author=Anderson, Nancy|date=June 4, 1972|title=John Wayne A Father Figure On Movie Set in Durango, Mexico|publisher=[[Copley Press|Copley New Service]]|newspaper=[[The Joplin Globe]]}}</ref>\n\nHe played Cap Roundtree in the 1979 miniseries ''[[Sackett#The Sacketts (TV movie)|The Sacketts]]''.

He co-starred in the 1994 version of ''[[Angels in the Outfield (1994 film)|Angels in the Outfield]]''.\n\nHe continued ranching during the entire time, operating a horse-breeding ranch in [[Sylmar, California]].<ref name=EricksonH-AM/> In addition, he sponsored the Ben Johnson Pro Celebrity Team Roping and Penning competition, held in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]], the proceeds of which are donated to both the Children's Medical Research Inc. and the Children's Hospital of Oklahoma.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nJohnson continued to work almost steadily until his death from a [[heart attack]] at the age of 77.\nOn April 8, 1996, the veteran actor collapsed while visiting his then 96-year-old mother Ollie at Leisure World in [[Mesa, Arizona]], the suburban Phoenix retirement community where they both lived.<ref>{{Citation|title=Actor Ben Johnson dies at 77|newspaper=The Press of Atlantic City|location=Atlantic City, NJ|date=April 9, 1996|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AC&p_theme=ac&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAEAC23EBC095A0&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>  Johnson's body was later transported from Arizona to [[Pawhuska, Oklahoma]], for burial at the Pawhuska City Cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|title=Actor Buried Near Pawhuska|date=April 15, 1996|url=https://www.tulsaworld.com/archives/actor-buried-near-pawhuska/article_558bfc00-f75b-5eba-857c-c6235c9663fb.html|website=Tulsa World|accessdate=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor his contribution to the motion picture industry, Johnson has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7083 Hollywood Boulevard. In 1982, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in Oklahoma City.

Two of the buildings, the Procuratie Vecchie (Old Procuracies) and the Procuratie Nuove (New Procuracies), were constructed in the sixteenth century by the procurators of Saint Mark, the second-highest dignitaries in the government of the [[Republic of Venice]] who were charged with administering the treasury of the [[Saint Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]] as well as the financial affairs of state wards and trust funds established on behalf of religious and charitable institutions. The Procuratie Nuove on the southern side of the square housed the official residences of the procurators whereas the Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side always contained apartments that were rented by the procurators as a source of revenue. Both the official residences and the rental apartments were built above arcades with space on the ground floor that was rented out for stores, workshops, and later coffeehouses, including the historic [[Caff\u00e8 Florian]], [[Caff\u00e8 Quadri]], and [[Caff\u00e8 Lavena]].\n \nThe Procuratie Nuovissime (Newest Procuracies, also known as the Napoleonic Wing) was built during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815) when after the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]], the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into the residence of the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Today, much of the Procuratie Nuove and the Napoleonic Wing house the [[Museo Correr]]. \n\n==Procurators of Saint Mark==\n\n''Main article: [[Procurator of St Mark's|Procurator of Saint Mark]]''\n\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto 087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Portrait of Procurator [[Antonio Cappello]]'' (''c''.1561). One of the major proponents of the urban renewal of Saint Mark's Square, Cappello was elected procurator ''de supra'' in 1523, at the age of only 29, following the payment of 8,000 ducats.]] \nThe office of procurator of Saint Mark, considered second only to that of the [[doge]] in prestige, was one of the few lifetime appointments in the Venetian government.<ref>Cappelletti, ''Relazione storica''..., p. 99 and Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> It was routinely occupied by nobles belonging to the most influential families and typically represented the climax of a distinguished political career, although it was often an intermediate position prior to election as doge.\n\nThe office originated in the ninth century with a single procurator ''operis Sancti Marci'', nominated to assist the doge in the administration of the [[St Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]], the ducal chapel.<ref name=Tiepolo-886>Tiepolo, Maria Francesca (ed.), ''La Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato'', vol IV, 1994, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali, Ufficio centrale per i beni archivistici, p. 886</ref>  But over time the number of procurators increased. By the mid-thirteenth century there were four procurators, two of which, the procurators ''de supra'' retained responsibility for the administration of the Church of Saint Mark and its treasury. The other two procurators, called ''de subtus super commissariis'', administered trust funds established as pious donations on behalf of religious and charitable institutions.<ref name=Tiepolo-886/> In 1319, there were six procurators, and in 1443 they became nine. These were divided into three procuracies: ''de supra'' (responsible for the [[St Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]] and its treasury), ''de citra'' (responsible for trust funds established in the [[sestiere|''sestieri'']] (districts) of [[San Marco (sestiere of Venice)|San Marco]], [[Castello, Venice|Castello]], and [[Cannaregio]]), and ''de ultra'' (responsible for trust funds established in the ''sestieri'' of [[San Polo]], [[Santa Croce (Venice)|Santa Croce]], and [[Dorsoduro]]).<ref name=DaMosto-25>Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> Beginning in 1516, initially to aid in the economic recovery from the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], supernumerary procurators could also be created in moments of financial constraint in exchange for monetary contributions to the treasury.<ref name=DaMosto-25/> This amounted to the periodic sale of the prestigious title. The number of procurators fluctuated thereafter: in 1521, there were eighteen.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 13</ref> At times, the number reached even forty.<ref>Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., p. 26</ref> The effective sale of the position also made it possible for young and ambitious nobles to quickly rise to high office and to consequently exert great influence.\n\nIn addition to the associated public honor, the office of procurator ensured an active role in the political life of Venice by guaranteeing a seat in the Senate after 1453<ref>Cappelletti, Relazione storica..., p. 100 and Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> and exonerating the individual from the obligation to accept other political appointments, including those on the mainland and overseas, and to undertake any but extraordinary embassies to foreign courts.<ref>A deliberation of 1305 required that the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] specifically authorize a procurator to occupy a seat on any council. Subsequently, in 1388, it was established that only one procurator for each procuracy could hold other government office. But beginning in 1569, the procurators were allowed to serve as ''[[Savio Grande]]''. See Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> It also brought economic and financial influence through the management of vast amounts of capital and of investments in commercial and private real estate, in government bonds, and in securities and deposits. With the exception of the [[Doge's Palace]], the procurators ''de supra'' were also specifically responsible for the construction, maintenance, and management of the public buildings around [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark\u2019s Square]], including the shops, food stalls, and apartments that were rented out as a source of revenue.<ref name=Tiepolo-886/>\n\n==Procuratie Vecchie==\n\n===Historical Background===\n[[File:Gentile Bellini-Procession in Piazza san Marco-northern-side.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile Bellini]], ''Processione di Corpus Domini in Piazza san Marco'' (1496). The detail shows the northern side with the twelfth-century building, administered by the procurators ''de supra'', that housed rental apartments and shops.]]\nFollowing the enlargement of Saint Mark's Square in the second half of the twelfth century,<ref>Chronicles date the enlargement of the square alternatively to the reigns of [[Vitale II Michiel]] (1156\u20131172) or of [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172\u20131178). See Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 79.</ref> several buildings and lands in and near the square were donated as rental properties to the Commune of Venice,<ref>The Commune of Venice, rather than the doge, is first mentioned as the representative authority of the State in 1143. See Maranini, Giuseppe, ''La costituzione di Venezia: dalle origini alla serrata del Maggior Consiglio'', 1927, Venezia, La Nuova Italia, Vol. I, p. 102.</ref> principally by Doge [[Sebastiano Ziani]] and his immediate descendants.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., pp. 84\u201386</ref> The intention was to create a steady flow of revenue in order to fund further work on the [[Saint Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]] and provide charitable assistance to the poor, thus avoiding the need to rely upon private pious donations and state financing. The administration of many of the properties was subsequently delegated to the procurators ''de supra'',<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 82. The act is in the Archives in PS b. 70, proc. 155, cc. 17\u201326. See also Todeschini, Francesco, ''Procuratori di san Marco'', BNM, ms. it. VII, 614 (=8471), cc. 298\u2013299.</ref> including the long building erected at Ziani's expense along the northern side of the square.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 84\u201385</ref> This structure, shown in Gentile Bellini's ''Processione di Corpus Domini in Piazza san Marco'' (1496), was a two-story building with a series of rental apartments above and shops on the ground floor that were also leased.\n\nA fire in June of 1512 destroyed one of the apartments near the clock tower and led to the collapse of a portion of the fa\u00e7ade.<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. F. Stefani et. al., 1886, Venezia, vol. 14, col. 305, 10 June 1512</ref> It was subsequently decided that notwithstanding the financial constraints at the time of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508\u20131516), the entire structure would be rebuilt as a statement of Venice's self-confidence. Significantly, [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]] remarked in his diary that the reconstruction was \"in order to make it very beautiful for the glory of the land \u2026 despite the war\" (''\"farle di novo e bellissime, che sar\u00e0 onor di la terra \u2026 ben sia la guerra\"'').<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. F. Stefani et. al., 1886, Venezia, vol. 15, col. 541, February 1513</ref>\n\nThe architect of the Procuratie Vecchie is not known from any official source, and various names have been suggested, primarily on the basis of stylistic considerations and the prominence of the individual architect at the time. These include [[Mauro Codussi]], [[Pietro Lombardo]], and [[Antonio Abbondi]].<ref>Adolfo Venturi, Giulio Lorenzetti, Luigi Angelini, and Lionello Puppi attribute the design to Mauro Codussi who is generally considered to be the architect of the adjacent clock tower. Paolo D\u2019Ancona and Maria Luisa Gengaro attribute the lower two levels to Codussi and the upper floor to Bartolomeo Bon. But Codussi died in 1504, and there is no indication that the substitution of the previous building was planned prior to the fire of 1512. Pietro Selvatico and Julius Baum consider the design of the lower two levels to be the work of Pietro Lombardo, who at the time was over eighty, and attribute the upper level to Bon. Donatella Calabri also suggests Antonio Abbondi, called \u201cScarpagnino\u201d, due to the similarity of his work at Rialto after the fire of 1514. See the discussions in Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''\u2026, pp. 107-108 and Morresi, ''La Piazza san Marco''\u2026, pp. 21-25 and 46, note 40 for bibliographical references.</ref> With regard to the sixteenth-century sources, Marin Sanudo mentions the Tuscan architect Zuan Celestro in his diary (1514),<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. F. Stefani et. al., 1887, Venezia, vol. 18, col. 10, 5 March 1514.</ref> whereas [[Francesco Sansovino]] in his guide to the city (1581) attributes the design to Pietro Bon, the ''proto'' (consultant architect and buildings manager) of the procurators ''de supra''.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''\u2026, 1581, Venetia, Iacopo Sansovino, c. 105r. The name of Bon is confirmed in the witness statement of procurator Melchiorre Michiel in the 1569 case \"Propriet\u00e0 in Campo Russolo\" in the Archives in PS, b. 33, processo 68, fascicolo 2. See also Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', p. 129 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 87. Howard's text identifies the architect as Bartolomeo Bon since it predates Stefano Mariani's archival research on Pietro Bon, consultant architect and buildings manager for the procurators ''de supra'' who was often confused with Bartolomeo Bon, chief consulting architect for the Salt Office. For relative documentation and the attribution of various projects, see Mariani, Stefano, ''Vita e opere dei proti Bon Bartolomeo e Pietro'', tesi di laurea, rel. Donatella Calabi, Istituto Universitario di Architettura \u2013 Venezia, Dipartimento di Storia dell'Architettura, a.a. 1982-83.</ref> But the precise contributions of Bon and Celestro to the design remain unclear.<ref>Deborah Howard suggests that Bon may have simply followed Celestro\u2019s design (see Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 129-130). John McAndrew proposes that the layout may be the design of Celestro whereas the fa\u00e7ade can be attributed to Bon (see  McAndrew, John, ''L\u2019architettura  veneziana del primo Rinascimento'', 1980, Venezia, pp. 348-351. A collaboration between Bon and Celestro also existed at the Great School of San Rocco. See Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 108 and Tafuri, ''Venezia e il Rinascimento''..., pp. 130\u2013131. Manuela Morresi suggests, however, that the Tuscan architect involved in the Procuratie Vecchie and the Great School of San Rocco may be two separate individuals. See Morresi, Piazza san Marco..., pp. 22\u201325.</ref> Bon, as ''proto'', was nevertheless responsible for oversight during construction.\n\n===Construction===\n\n'''Bon's superintendence (''c''.1514\u20131529)'''\n\nConstruction began with the damaged section, adjacent the clock tower, and proceeded gradually. The surviving sections of the previous building were demolished as space was needed to continue and the new shops on the ground floor and apartments above were leased as soon as they were ready in order to limit the loss of revenue to the procurators. By 1517, the first section had progressed far enough to begin work on the fa\u00e7ade with the revetments in [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]]. That same year, the first new apartment was rented out.<ref>Agazzi, ''Plate Sancti Marci''..., p. 103.</ref> \n\nWith respect to the pre-existing structure, the layout of the new building was altered for the first 24 arcades with the insertion of a small street running parallel to the square. In contrast, the earlier layout, characterized by a series of courtyards, was retained for the remainder of the building, further away from the area damaged by the fire. This indicates that, although documents refer to the demolition of the previous structure, certain parts of it were in fact maintained and reutilized, presumably to minimize costs.<ref>See Agazzi, Plarea Sancti Marci..., pp. 108-112 and McAndrew, John, ''L'architettura veneziana del primo Rinascimento'', 1983, Venezia, Marsilio, p. 388. Michela Agazzi specifically notes that a doorway from the previous building was discovered inside a wall of the later construction near the Sottoportego di Corte Maruzzi, confirming that portions of the previous building were not demolished. Manuela Morresi, in contrast, argues that the interruption of the lateral street and the return to the previous layout with the series of courtyards was part of a broader effort on the part of the procurators and the Great Council to requalify Saint Mark's Square and discourage certain commercial activities in order to increase the value of the rental apartments. See Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp. 25\u201335.</ref>\n\n'''Sansovino\u2019s superintendence (1529\u20131538)'''\n\nFollowing the death of Pietro Bon in 1529, [[Jacopo Sansovino]], a refugee from the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]], was nominated in his place as ''proto'' of the procurators ''de supra''.

Also, the number of workshops and stores on the ground floor was increased by inserting a narrow street behind the row of stores that opened onto the square so that each arcade now corresponded to an individual shop.<ref>The narrow street, Calle del Cappello Nero, extends for only twenty-four arcades after which the previous design of the inner courtyards was preserved.</ref> Previously, the stores and workshops behind were accessible through passageways in the square that connected to small, inner courtyards.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 85</ref> On the upper floors, the rooms in the back section, connected by suspended galleries, were destined for servant quarters associated with the principal apartments that looked onto the square.\n\n[[File:Venecia, Italia - panoramio (16).jpg|thumb|Procuratie Vecchie, detail of the fa\u00e7ade]]\n'''Fa\u00e7ade'''\n\nThe Procuratie Vecchie was the first major building erected in Venice in emulation of classical prototypes.<ref>Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', p. 129</ref> Although many aspects of the earlier Veneto-Byzantine structure were maintained, including the [[Merlon|decorative crenellation]] along the roofline and the succession of two window bays over each of the ground-floor arches, the elongated stilted arch,<ref>In the stilted arch, the curve of the arch [[Springer (architecture)|springs]] from a vertical point higher than that of the [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] which carries the thrust of the arch.</ref> characteristic of the Veneto-Byzantine tradition in Venice, was updated with Renaissance semi-circular arches, supported on fluted Corinthian columns. Also, the columns on the ground floor, reminiscent of the Doge's Palace, were replaced with square Doric pillars. This adhered to [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s recommendation in his architectural treatise, ''De Re Aedificatoria'', that in larger structures the column, inherited from Greek architecture, should only support an entablature, whereas the arch, inherited from Roman mural construction, should be supported on square pillars so that the resulting arcade appears to be the residual of \"a wall open and discontinued in several places\".<ref>Alberti, Leon Battista, ''De Re Aedificatoria'', VII, 15.

These included the rent-free apartments erected in the thirteenth century for the procurators as well as their ''ridotti'' (offices) which were located inside a separate building dating back to the reign of [[Pietro I Orseolo]] (976\u2013978). This building, originally constructed as a pilgrim hospice to give aid and shelter to the pilgrims arriving in the city to venerate the relics of Saint Mark, served as an almshouse for indigent women.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 112</ref>\n\nConditions in the outdated and precarious apartments were poor, and expenditures for repairs continued to rise for both the occupants<ref>The excessive repair costs borne by the procurators for their apartments and the misuse of government funds were the subject of a formal inquiry in 1569.

Funds were nevertheless illegally expropriated from other government accounts to finance repairs and improvements. See Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p.18.</ref> Some procurators, despite the obligation imposed by the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] and the [[Council of Forty]], refused to take up residence in the square. Citing the dark and damp conditions and, in some instances, the lack of a view,<ref>The windows on the southern fa\u00e7ade looked onto the public granaries.</ref> they preferred to live in their palatial homes elsewhere in the city. Other procurators sublet their official apartments as a source of personal revenue.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp. 35 and 37</ref> In addition, there were only six official apartments, two for each of the procuracies (''de supra'', ''de citra'', and ''de ultra'') which were assigned to the next senior procurator upon vacancy. This number of apartments was insufficient, and the government incurred the additional expense of a rent allowance to enable the remaining procurators to secure living space near the square.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 14 July 1536, the procurators ''de supra'' consequently commissioned [[Jacopo Sansovino]], their ''proto'' (consultant architect and buildings manager), to present a model for a three-story building that was to substitute the hospice and apartments along the entire southern side of the square and continue in front of the Doge\u2019s Palace where it was to replace the five hostelries for foreign merchants, the lean-to bread shops, and the meat market. No records survive regarding the ensuing internal discussions,<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 15</ref> but the project was radically transformed. On 6 March 1537, it was decided that the construction of the new building, now with only two floors, should begin with the section directly in front of the palace and that the space should be destined for the ''ridotti'' of the procurators as well as the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]], consisting in the precious collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts, entrusted to the care of the procurators, that [[Cardinal Bessarion]] had donated to the Republic in 1468 with the request that a library of public utility be founded.<ref>The act of the procurators is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 125, c. 2) and is published in Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 163.</ref> There was no further reference to a continuation along the southern side of the square until the 1550's when work was nearing completion on the initial construction stage of the library. At that time, it was suggested that the library be extended to the waterfront and that the entire square be lined with new structures. But no action was taken.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp.105-110</ref>\n\nConditions in the buildings on the southern side of the square continued to deteriorate giving rise to concerns for the dignity of the procurators, and on 11 December 1580, the Great Council determined that the time had come to demolish the buildings, citing once again their age and the unsightly appearance.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 177</ref> Three designs were submitted for the building that was to house the new apartments of the procurators, and on 5 April 1582, the design of [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was accepted.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 177</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n''See also: [[Biblioteca Marciana#Sansovino\u2019s superintendence (1537\u2013c.1560)|Biblioteca Marciana \u2013 Construction]]''\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 260\n | header = Saint Mark's Square in 1581\n | image1 = Saint_Mark's_Square-1581.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \u2013 '''(red)''' meat market, demolished in 1581 to continue the construction of the library <br>\u2013 '''(orange)''' hospice and offices of the procurators, demolished beginning in 1581 to build the Procuratie Nuove <br>\u2013 '''(green)''' old apartments of the procurators.

It would also transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid, giving greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and making it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square. Presumably, this had been Sansovino\u2019s intention when in 1537 he began the construction of the library further away from the bell tower.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 15 and Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza San Marco''..., p. 177</ref>\n\nThe decision to replace the dilapidated structures with a new building for the Procurators was in fact the culmination of the vast architectural program begun under Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to reaffirm Venice's international prestige after the earlier defeat at [[Battle of Agnadello|Agnadello]] during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]] and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian peninsula at the end of the War of the League of Cognac. The program, which included the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536), the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]] (begun 1537), and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), called for the radical transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from an antiquated medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. The intent was to invoke the memory of the ancient Roman republic and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scamozzi portrait by Veronese.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Veronese]], ''Portrait of Vincenzo Scamozzi'' (''c''. 1585)]]\nThe building program was strenuously advocated by those wealthy and influential families within the aristocracy, the ''papalisti'', who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose architectural and artistic tastes tended to reflect developments in Rome and central Italy. They saw the transformation of Saint Mark's Square into a classical forum as the means to publicly affirm their own cultural orientation and their superior intellectual understanding of [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian principles]]. Economically, the ''papalisti'' had largely abandoned maritime trade in favor of the administration of agricultural properties on the mainland. In their foreign policy, they tended to support the interests of the Church and of the Holy Roman Empire. But the building program was increasingly opposed by the more traditionalist and pro-French faction within the government, the ''giovani'', who resisted the attempts of the ''papalisti'' to leave a lasting architectural mark. Hence when after the constitutional crisis of 1582-1583<ref>The constitution crisis concerned the nomination of the adjunct committee of the Council of Ten and resulted in the reduction of the powers delegated to the Council of Ten and in a renewed legitimacy of the Senate.</ref> the ''giovani'' found themselves in a position of greater strength vis-\u00e0-vis the ''papalisti'', they actively sought to limit any further change to Saint Mark's Square.<ref>Among the procurators ''de supra'', Antonio Querini, Leonardo Don\u00e0, and Andrea Dolfin were strong opponents. See in general Howard, ''Venice Disputed''..., pp. 178\u2013189 and Tafuri, ''Venezia e il Rinascimento''..., pp. 261\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDisapproval of the magnitude and grandeur of the project was voiced as early as 1589 when the design was criticized for its rich adornment, considered disparagingly more appropriate to a theater in reference to Scamozzi\u2019s work at the [[Teatro Olimpico|Olympic Theater]] in Vicenza.<ref>The remark was by procurator Federico Contarini. See Morolli, ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, p. 31.</ref> But following the death in 1595 of Scamozzi's chief supporter, procurator [[Marcantonio Barbaro]], opposition to the building program intensified with even radical proposals to demolish the part that had already been completed and erect a structure similar to the Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side of the square. It was alternatively suggested that the project be returned to its original two-floor design. Ultimately, the Senate deliberated that the construction would continue with all three floors.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 207</ref> But the design was radically altered, and Scamozzi was dismissed in 1597.\n\n[[File:Scamozzi_apartments.jpg|thumb|left|The only apartment unit, eleven arcades wide, built in accordance with Scamozzi's design is characterized by the [[margent]]s alongside the three central windows.]]\n'''Scamozzi\u2019s superintendence (1583\u20131597)'''\n\nIn March 1581, prior to the definitive selection of Scamozzi's design, demolition of the previous structures began with a portion of the old pilgrim hospice and proceeded gradually as more space was required to continue.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 21</ref> Actual construction began in 1583.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 31</ref> Although Scamozzi was directly involved in every aspect, oversight fell to the ''proto'' (chief building consultant) of the procurators ''de supra'', Simone Sorella, whose own design for the new building had been rejected. In 1584, Scamozzi presented further design proposals that included an additional floor. This would allow for separate apartments on each of the upper floors. It was similarly suggested that a floor be added to the library which was nearing completion. But following the equivocal results of engineering surveys conducted to determine whether the existing foundation of the library could bear the additional weight, it was decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors.<ref>Manuela Morresi suggests that in addition to engineering considerations, the decision to retain the height of the library stemmed from the ascendency of the ''giovani'' faction in the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1582 and its opposition to the aggressive building program. See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 207.</ref> Instead the proposal to raise the height of the Procuratie Nuove was accepted. \n\n[[File:Procuratie Nuove-southern facade.jpg|thumb|Detail of southern fa\u00e7ade, showing the discontinuation of Scamozzi's ornate design.]]\n'''Later periods of superintendence (1597\u2013''c''.1660)'''\n\nBy the time of Scamozzi's dismissal in 1597, only the first ten arcades had been built. The project was thereafter entrusted to Francesco di Bernardin Smeraldi, called Frac\u00e0, who was also nominated ''proto'' in 1600 upon the death of Sorella. That same year, the two single-floor apartments already under construction according to Scamozzzi's design were completed, and the first apartment was assigned the following year.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 54</ref> Smeraldi then radically reconceived the design as a series of narrower, multi-level apartments. He also simplified the overall decoration. By 1611, the building had reached the twentieth arcade and four apartments were completed. Smeraldi was succeeded as ''proto'' by Mario della Carit\u00e0 and subsequently, in 1640, by [[Baldassare Longhena]] who completed the construction of the Procuratie Nuove around 1660, including the seven arcades that reached the Church of San Geminiano on the western side of the square.\n\n===Architecture===\n\n'''Layout'''\n\nDespite the need to increase the number of apartments available to the procurators, Scamozzi's design was for only six apartments. These were divided into three consecutive units, each eleven arcades wide. The two apartments on the upper floors, one atop the other, shared a single courtyard with staircases and entries onto the square and the canal behind. Each apartment consisted in two sections. The forward section, facing the square, had the principal rooms and a study. It was connected by means of two loggias, running alongside the courtyard, to the back section which had rooms for family members and service areas. Only the first two apartments, begun by Scamozzi, follow this original design. Smeraldi's new design was for narrower apartments, only five arcades wide, that were distributed on multiple floors. Each apartment corresponded to four stores on the ground floor, that could be rented out by the procurators, and an archway leading to an inner courtyard that opened to the canal behind. A staircase from the courtyard provided access to the apartment above. By adding another three arcades to the overall project, the number of apartments was also increased to seven. An eighth apartment was added on the western end of the square.\n\n'''Fa\u00e7ade''' \n\n''See also: [[Biblioteca Marciana#Architecture|Biblioteca Marciana \u2013 Architecture]]''\n\n[[File:Juncture between the Biblioteca Marciana and the Procuratie Nuove.jpg|thumb|The juncture between the Ionic entablature of Sansovino's library (left) and the 'corrected' entablature of Scamozzi's Procuratie Nuove (right)]]\nFor the first two floors, Scamozzi was obliged to continue Sansovino's design for the library. But in his architectural treatise ''L\u2019Idea dell\u2019Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture''), he is highly critical. In particular Sansovino\u2019s entablatures are considered excessive in height with respect to the columns. The arches are consequently said to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned.<ref>Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively.  See Scamozzi, Vincenzo, ''L\u2019Idea dell\u2019Architettura Universale'', 1615, Venetiis, expensis auctoris, Lib. VI, Cap. VII, pp. 20-21</ref> In the Procuratie Nuove, Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, corrects the 'error' by reducing the height of the Ionic frieze, without, however, successfully resolving the problem of transitioning between the two buildings.\n\nIn Sansovino\u2019s library, the ground floor  consists in a series of [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, supporting an [[entablature]], that is superimposed on an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]. The ancient prototypes are the [[Theater of Marcellus]] and the [[Colosseum]] in Rome. Similarly, on the upper floor of the library, a row of large [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns is superimposed on a series of [[Venetian window|Serlian]]s. Scamozzi, while acknowledging the existence of both Roman and Renaissance precedents, was critical of such layering. In his design for the additional floor of the Procuratie Nuove, the series of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns consequently rests against a simple wall. As a result, the third level lacks the deep recesses and the strong [[chiaroscuro]] effect of the lower floors. \n\nThe wall between the Corinthian columns is pierced with rectangular aedicule windows, topped by alternating curvilinear and triangular [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]s. The solution of the alternating tympanums had been employed by both [[Bramante]] and [[Raphael]] for residential architecture and by Palladio for [[Palazzo Porto, Vicenza|Palazzo Porto]] and [[Palazzo Chiericati]]. Palladio also proposed the combination in his design for the rebuilding of the Doge's Palace after the fire of 1577, which was likely the immediate source for Scamozzi. The ancient prototype is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] where the altars alternate around the perimeter, in pairs, with curvilinear and triangular pediments.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 104</ref> Scamozzi's design for the upper floor included elaborate carvings and reclining figures atop the tympanums. But these were eliminated from the design by Smeraldi and exist only above the first ten windows, completed during Scamozzi's superintendence.\n\n===Later History===\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]] to Napoleon, the Procuratie Nuove was adapted to serve as the official residence of [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]], during the second period of French domination (1805\u20131815). The former apartments of the procurators were decorated by Giovan Battista Canal and [[Giuseppe Borsato]] between 1807 and 1813, under the influence of the French decorator [[Charles Percier]] who was in Venice in 1807.<ref>Morolli et al., ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> For the decoration of the throne room and the dining room, Pietro Moro and [[Sebastiano Santi]] were also involved. [[Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua]] collaborated in other rooms. Modifications were also made in 1834\u20131836 and 1853\u20131857, during the subsequent period of Austrian domination (1815\u20131866), when the Procuratie Nuove served as an imperial residence.<ref>Morolli et al., ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, pp. 170\u2013173</ref> After the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, the Procuratie Nuove came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919.

In 1591, after the completion of the final five bays of the library by Vincenzo Scamozzi (1588), the offices were moved to the upper floor of the new building when the remaining section of the hospice was demolished in order to continue the construction of the Procuratie Nuove.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., pp. 112\u2013114</ref> The offices of the procurators ''de supra'' were located in the portion of the library completed earlier by Sansovino, directly facing the Piazzetta and the Doge's Palace, whereas the offices of the procurators ''de citra'' and ''de ultra'' were situated in the area built by Scamozzi.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco e Stringa Giovanni, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare'', 1604, Venetia, Altobello Salicato, c. 216v</ref> Curiously, in 1552 when the library was still under construction, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the [[Carnival of Venice|carnival]] celebrations in the Piazzetta.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 202</ref>\n\nThe designated area for the offices, accessible by means of the same entry as the library, consisted in nine rooms, three for each of the procuracies. The rooms utilized by the procurators ''de supra'' were prominently positioned at the top of the monumental staircase as an indication of their prestige. The first of the rooms served as an archive for documents, the second as a room for administrative officials and clerks in attendance, the third for the plenary meetings.\n\nPaintings, primarily portraits of the procurators and devotional works, were transferred from the previous offices and adapted to the new rooms by [[Tintoretto]], under the direction of Scamozzi. In the offices of the procurators ''de supra'', the portraits were hung in double rows, the meeting room being reserved for the portraits of the procurators who had subsequently been elected as doges.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco, ''Venetia citta nobilissima et singolare'', 1581, Venetia, Iacomo Sansovino, cc. 110v-111r. </ref>\n\nFollowing the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]], the art collection of the ''ridotti'' was removed and in part dispersed when the library was annexed to the Procuratie Nuove as the royal apartment for [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. The former ''ridotti'' were decorated by [[Felice Giani]] and [[Giuseppe Borsato]] between 1807 and 1808 with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] motifs, allegorical figures, and mythological scenes that exalt moral and intellectual virtues.\n\n==Procuratie Nuovissime (Napoleonic Wing)==\n\n[[File:Canaletto - Piazza San Marco looking west towards San Geminiano RCIN 405935.jpg|thumb|left|[[Canaletto]], ''Piazza san Marco looking West towards San Geminiano'' (''c''.1723\u20131724)]]\n[[File:Palazzo reale di venezia, salone da ballo, 02.jpg|thumb|Napoleonic Wing, ballroom completed by Lorenzo Santi]]\n===Historical Background===\nWhen during the second period of French domination the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into a royal residence, the former apartments of the procurators were adapted for residential purposes. But the structure lacked a suitably grand entry as well as larger rooms for audiences and entertaining. In 1807, the Church of San Geminiano, located on the western side of the square, was consequently demolished to have the space needed to extend the royal residence and create the necessary rooms.<ref>Morolli, Le Procuratie Nuove\u2026, p. 141.</ref> The church, dating back to the reign of [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172-1178), had been rebuilt in the early sixteenth century by Cristoforo da Legname and then completed by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] in 1557 with the addition of a dome and the fa\u00e7ade.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 123. The relative documents are in the Archives in PS, b. 64, proc, 138, fasc. 1.</ref> It was flanked on both sides by the wings of the Procuratie Vecchie and the Procuratie Nuove, built respectively by Sansovino and Longhena.\n\nProposals for the building that was to replace the church and join the wing of the Procuratie Vecchie with the wing of the Procuratie Nuove varied. Although the imperial French government sought a sense of monumentality, the projects of Grazioso Buttacalice for a [[triumphal arch]] and of Gaetano Pinali for a Corinthian [[portico]] were both deemed too radical and equally incongruous with the overall aspect of Saint Mark's Square. [[Giovanni Antonio Antolini]]\u2019s more modest design for a two-story [[loggia]] with a grand staircase in the rear was accepted.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp. 191\u2013193</ref>\n\n[[File:Ala Napoleonica Procuratie dettaglio centrale.jpg|left|thumb|Napoleonic Wing, fa\u00e7ade]]\n\n===Construction===\nIn 1810, Antolini's project was abandoned and the section of the building already constructed was demolished. The wing of the Procuratie Vecchie was also demolished and replaced by the actual building, designed by Giuseppe Maria Soli, professor of Architecture at the University of Modena, in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] manner.\n\n===Architecture===\nThe first two floors of the Napoleonic Wing continue the repeatable bays of Sansovino's design for the library which Scamozzi had also used for the Procuratie Nuove on the southern side of the square. To then visually link the new building to the northern side, Soli designed an [[Attic style|attic]] floor, the height of which corresponds to the roofline crenellation of the Procuratie Vecchie. The attic was also conceived as a means of concealing the high, vaulted ceiling of the ballroom behind.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the attic is covered in low relief panels with classical motifs. Interspersed with these reliefs are freestanding statues on pedestals by Antonio Bosa and Domenico Banti.<ref>Morolli et al.

Two of the buildings, the Procuratie Vecchie (Old Procuracies) and the Procuratie Nuove (New Procuracies), were constructed in the sixteenth century by the procurators of Saint Mark, the second-highest dignitaries in the government of the [[Republic of Venice]] who were charged with administering the treasury of the [[Saint Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]] as well as the financial affairs of state wards and trust funds established on behalf of religious and charitable institutions. The Procuratie Nuove on the southern side of the square housed the official residences of the procurators whereas the Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side always contained apartments that were rented by the procurators as a source of revenue. Both the official residences and the rental apartments were built above arcades with space on the ground floor that was rented out for stores, workshops, and later coffeehouses, including the historic [[Caff\u00e8 Florian]], [[Caff\u00e8 Quadri]], and [[Caff\u00e8 Lavena]].\n \nThe Procuratie Nuovissime (Newest Procuracies, also known as the Napoleonic Wing) was built during the second period of French occupation (1805\u20131815) when after the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]], the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into the residence of the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Today, much of the Procuratie Nuove and the Napoleonic Wing house the [[Museo Correr]]. \n\n==Procurators of Saint Mark==\n\n''Main article: [[Procurator of St Mark's|Procurator of Saint Mark]]''\n\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto 087.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Portrait of Procurator [[Antonio Cappello]]'' (''c''.1561). One of the major proponents of the urban renewal of Saint Mark's Square, Cappello was elected procurator ''de supra'' in 1523, at the age of only 29, following the payment of 8,000 ducats.]] \nThe office of procurator of Saint Mark, considered second only to that of the [[doge]] in prestige, was one of the few lifetime appointments in the Venetian government.<ref>Cappelletti, ''Relazione storica''..., p. 99 and Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> It was routinely occupied by nobles belonging to the most influential families and typically represented the climax of a distinguished political career, although it was often an intermediate position prior to election as doge.\n\nThe office originated in the ninth century with a single procurator ''operis Sancti Marci'', nominated to assist the doge in the administration of the [[St Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]], the ducal chapel.<ref name=Tiepolo-886>>Tiepolo, Maria Francesca (ed.), ''La Guida generale degli Archivi di Stato'', vol IV, 1994, Roma, Ministero per i beni culturali e ambientali, Ufficio centrale per i beni archivistici, p. 886</ref>  But over time the number of procurators increased. By the mid-thirteenth century there were four procurators, two of which, the procurators ''de supra'' retained responsibility for the administration of the Church of Saint Mark and its treasury. The other two procurators, called ''de subtus super commissariis'', administered trust funds established as pious donations on behalf of religious and charitable institutions.<ref name=Tiepolo-886/> In 1319, there were six procurators, and in 1443 they became nine. These were divided into three procuracies: ''de supra'' (responsible for the [[St Mark's Basilica|Church of Saint Mark]] and its treasury), ''de citra'' (responsible for trust funds established in the [[sestiere|''sestieri'']] (districts) of [[San Marco (sestiere of Venice)|San Marco]], [[Castello, Venice|Castello]], and [[Cannaregio]]), and ''de ultra'' (responsible for trust funds established in the ''sestieri'' of [[San Polo]], [[Santa Croce (Venice)|Santa Croce]], and [[Dorsoduro]]).<ref name=DaMosto-25>Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> Beginning in 1516, initially to aid in the economic recovery from the [[War of the League of Cambrai]], supernumerary procurators could also be created in moments of financial constraint in exchange for monetary contributions to the treasury.<ref name=DaMosto-25/> This amounted to the periodic sale of the prestigious title. The number of procurators fluctuated thereafter: in 1521, there were eighteen.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 13</ref> At times, the number reached even forty.<ref>Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., p. 26</ref> The effective sale of the position also made it possible for young and ambitious nobles to quickly rise to high office and to consequently exert great influence.\n\nIn addition to the associated public honor, the office of procurator ensured an active role in the political life of Venice by guaranteeing a seat in the Senate after 1453<ref>Cappelletti, Relazione storica..., p. 100 and Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> and exonerating the individual from the obligation to accept other political appointments, including those on the mainland and overseas, and to undertake any but extraordinary embassies to foreign courts.<ref>A deliberation of 1305 required that the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]] specifically authorize a procurator to occupy a seat on any council. Subsequently, in 1388, it was established that only one procurator for each procuracy could hold other government office. But beginning in 1569, the procurators were allowed to serve as ''[[Savio Grande]]''. See Da Mosto, ''L'Archivio di Stato di Venezia''..., vol. I, p. 25</ref> It also brought economic and financial influence through the management of vast amounts of capital and of investments in commercial and private real estate, in government bonds, and in securities and deposits. With the exception of the [[Doge's Palace]], the procurators ''de supra'' were also specifically responsible for the construction, maintenance, and management of the public buildings around [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark\u2019s Square]], including the shops, food stalls, and apartments that were rented out as a source of revenue.<ref name=Tiepolo-886/>\n\n==Procuratie Vecchie==\n\n===Historical Background===\n[[File:Gentile Bellini-Procession in Piazza san Marco-northern-side.jpg|thumb|[[Gentile Bellini]], ''Processione di Corpus Domini in Piazza san Marco'' (1496).

F. Stefani et. al., 1886, Venezia, vol. 14, col. 305, 10 June 1512</ref> It was subsequently decided that notwithstanding the financial constraints at the time of the [[War of the League of Cambrai]] (1508\u20131516), the entire structure would be rebuilt as a statement of Venice's self-confidence. Significantly, [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]] remarked in his diary that the reconstruction was \"in order to make it very beautiful for the glory of the land \u2026 despite the war\" (''\"farle di novo e bellissime, che sar\u00e0 onor di la terra \u2026 ben sia la guerra\"'').<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. F. Stefani et. al., 1886, Venezia, vol. 15, col. 541, February 1513</ref>\n\nThe architect of the Procuratie Vecchie is not known from any official source, and various names have been suggested, primarily on the basis of stylistic considerations and the prominence of the individual architect at the time. These include [[Mauro Codussi]], [[Pietro Lombardo]], and [[Antonio Abbondi]].<ref>Adolfo Venturi, Giulio Lorenzetti, Luigi Angelini, and Lionello Puppi attribute the design to Mauro Codussi who is generally considered to be the architect of the adjacent clock tower. Paolo D\u2019Ancona and Maria Luisa Gengaro attribute the lower two levels to Codussi and the upper floor to Bartolomeo Bon. But Codussi died in 1504, and there is no indication that the substitution of the previous building was planned prior to the fire of 1512. Pietro Selvatico and Julius Baum consider the design of the lower two levels to be the work of Pietro Lombardo, who at the time was over eighty, and attribute the upper level to Bon. Donatella Calabri also suggests Antonio Abbondi, called \u201cScarpagnino\u201d, due to the similarity of his work at Rialto after the fire of 1514. See the discussions in Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''\u2026, pp. 107-108 and Morresi, ''La Piazza san Marco''\u2026, pp. 21-25 and 46, note 40 for bibliographical references.</ref> With regard to the sixteenth-century sources, Marin Sanudo mentions the Tuscan architect Zuan Celestro in his diary (1514),<ref>Sanudo, Marin, ''Diari'', ed. F. Stefani et. al., 1887, Venezia, vol. 18, col. 10, 5 March 1514.</ref> whereas [[Francesco Sansovino]] in his guide to the city (1581) attributes the design to Pietro Bon, the ''proto'' (consultant architect and buildings manager) of the procurators ''de supra''.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare''\u2026, 1581, Venetia, Iacopo Sansovino, c. 105r. The name of Bon is confirmed in the witness statement of procurator Melchiorre Michiel in the 1569 case \"Propriet\u00e0 in Campo Russolo\" in the Archives in PS, b. 33, processo 68, fascicolo 2. See also Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', p. 129 and Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 87. Howard's text identifies the architect as Bartolomeo Bon since it predates Stefano Mariani's archival research on Pietro Bon, consultant architect and buildings manager for the procurators ''de supra'' who was often confused with Bartolomeo Bon, chief consulting architect for the Salt Office. For relative documentation and the attribution of various projects, see Mariani, Stefano, ''Vita e opere dei proti Bon Bartolomeo e Pietro'', tesi di laurea, rel. Donatella Calabi, Istituto Universitario di Architettura \u2013 Venezia, Dipartimento di Storia dell'Architettura, a.a. 1982-83.</ref> But the precise contributions of Bon and Celestro to the design remain unclear.<ref>Deborah Howard suggests that Bon may have simply followed Celestro\u2019s design (see Howard, ''The Architectural History of Venice'', pp. 129-130). John McAndrew proposes that the layout may be the design of Celestro whereas the fa\u00e7ade can be attributed to Bon (see  McAndrew, John, ''L\u2019architettura  veneziana del primo Rinascimento'', 1980, Venezia, pp. 348-351. A collaboration between Bon and Celestro also existed at the Great School of San Rocco. See Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 108 and Tafuri, ''Venezia e il Rinascimento''..., pp. 130\u2013131. Manuela Morresi suggests, however, that the Tuscan architect involved in the Procuratie Vecchie and the Great School of San Rocco may be two separate individuals. See Morresi, Piazza san Marco..., pp. 22\u201325.</ref> Bon, as ''proto'', was nevertheless responsible for oversight during construction.\n\n===Construction===\n\n'''Bon's superintendence (''c''.1514\u20131529)'''\n\nConstruction began with the damaged section, adjacent the clock tower, and proceeded gradually. The surviving sections of the previous building were demolished as space was needed to continue and the new shops on the ground floor and apartments above were leased as soon as they were ready in order to limit the loss of revenue to the procurators. By 1517, the first section had progressed far enough to begin work on the fa\u00e7ade with the revetments in [[Istrian stone|Istrian limestone]]. That same year, the first new apartment was rented out.<ref>Agazzi, ''Plate Sancti Marci''..., p. 103.</ref> \n\nWith respect to the pre-existing structure, the layout of the new building was altered for the first 24 arcades with the insertion of a small street running parallel to the square. In contrast, the earlier layout, characterized by a series of courtyards, was retained for the remainder of the building, further away from the area damaged by the fire. This indicates that, although documents refer to the demolition of the previous structure, certain parts of it were in fact maintained and reutilized, presumably to minimize costs.<ref>See Agazzi, Plarea Sancti Marci..., pp. 108-112 and McAndrew, John, ''L'architettura veneziana del primo Rinascimento'', 1983, Venezia, Marsilio, p. 388. Michela Agazzi specifically notes that a doorway from the previous building was discovered inside a wall of the later construction near the Sottoportego di Corte Maruzzi, confirming that portions of the previous building were not demolished. Manuela Morresi, in contrast, argues that the interruption of the lateral street and the return to the previous layout with the series of courtyards was part of a broader effort on the part of the procurators and the Great Council to requalify Saint Mark's Square and discourage certain commercial activities in order to increase the value of the rental apartments.

Also, the columns on the ground floor, reminiscent of the Doge's Palace, were replaced with square Doric pillars. This adhered to [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s recommendation in his architectural treatise, ''De Re Aedificatoria'', that in larger structures the column, inherited from Greek architecture, should only support an entablature, whereas the arch, inherited from Roman mural construction, should be supported on square pillars so that the resulting arcade appears to be the residual of \"a wall open and discontinued in several places\".<ref>Alberti, Leon Battista, ''De Re Aedificatoria'', VII, 15.

These included the rent-free apartments erected in the thirteenth century for the procurators as well as their ''ridotti'' (offices) which were located inside a separate building dating back to the reign of [[Pietro I Orseolo]] (976\u2013978).

Citing the dark and damp conditions and, in some instances, the lack of a view,<ref>The windows on the southern fa\u00e7ade looked onto the public granaries.</ref> they preferred to live in their palatial homes elsewhere in the city. Other procurators sublet their official apartments as a source of personal revenue.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp. 35 and 37</ref> In addition, there were only six official apartments, two for each of the procuracies (''de supra'', ''de citra'', and ''de ultra'') which were assigned to the next senior procurator upon vacancy. This number of apartments was insufficient, and the government incurred the additional expense of a rent allowance to enable the remaining procurators to secure living space near the square.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 17</ref>\n\nOn 14 July 1536, the procurators ''de supra'' consequently commissioned [[Jacopo Sansovino]], their ''proto'' (consultant architect and buildings manager), to present a model for a three-story building that was to substitute the hospice and apartments along the entire southern side of the square and continue in front of the Doge\u2019s Palace where it was to replace the five hostelries for foreign merchants, the lean-to bread shops, and the meat market. No records survive regarding the ensuing internal discussions,<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 15</ref> but the project was radically transformed. On 6 March 1537, it was decided that the construction of the new building, now with only two floors, should begin with the section directly in front of the palace and that the space should be destined for the ''ridotti'' of the procurators as well as the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]], consisting in the precious collection of Greek and Latin manuscripts, entrusted to the care of the procurators, that [[Cardinal Bessarion]] had donated to the Republic in 1468 with the request that a library of public utility be founded.<ref>The act of the procurators is in the Archives (PS, Atti, reg. 125, c. 2) and is published in Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 163.</ref> There was no further reference to a continuation along the southern side of the square until the 1550's when work was nearing completion on the initial construction stage of the library. At that time, it was suggested that the library be extended to the waterfront and that the entire square be lined with new structures. But no action was taken.<ref>Morresi, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp.105-110</ref>\n\nConditions in the buildings on the southern side of the square continued to deteriorate giving rise to concerns for the dignity of the procurators, and on 11 December 1580, the Great Council determined that the time had come to demolish the buildings, citing once again their age and the unsightly appearance.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 177</ref> Three designs were submitted for the building that was to house the new apartments of the procurators, and on 5 April 1582, the design of [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] was accepted.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., p. 177</ref>\n\n===Construction===\n''See also: [[Biblioteca Marciana#Sansovino\u2019s superintendence (1537\u2013c.1560)|Biblioteca Marciana \u2013 Construction]]''\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 260\n | header = Saint Mark's Square in 1581\n | image1 = Saint_Mark's_Square-1581.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = \u2013 '''(red)''' meat market, demolished in 1581 to continue the construction of the library <br>\u2013 '''(orange)''' hospice and offices of the procurators, demolished beginning in 1581 to build the Procuratie Nuove <br>\u2013 '''(green)''' old apartments of the procurators.

It would also transform Saint Mark's Square into a trapezoid, giving greater visual importance to the Basilica of Saint Mark located on the eastern side and making it possible to see the Doge's Palace from anywhere in the square. Presumably, this had been Sansovino\u2019s intention when in 1537 he began the construction of the library further away from the bell tower.<ref>Howard, ''Sansovino''\u2026, p. 15 and Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza San Marco''..., p. 177</ref>\n\nThe decision to replace the dilapidated structures with a new building for the Procurators was in fact the culmination of the vast architectural program begun under Doge [[Andrea Gritti]] to reaffirm Venice's international prestige after the earlier defeat at [[Battle of Agnadello|Agnadello]] during the [[War of the League of Cambrai|War of Cambrai]] and the subsequent Peace of Bologna which sanctioned Habsburg hegemony on the Italian peninsula at the end of the War of the League of Cognac. The program, which included the [[Zecca of Venice|mint]] (begun 1536), the [[Biblioteca Marciana|library]] (begun 1537), and the [[Loggetta del Sansovino|loggia]] of the bell tower (begun 1538), called for the radical transformation of [[Piazza San Marco|Saint Mark's Square]] from an antiquated medieval town center with food vendors, money changers, and even latrines into a classical [[Forum (Roman)|forum]]. The intent was to invoke the memory of the ancient Roman republic and, in the aftermath of the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] in 1527, to present Venice as Rome's true successor.<ref>See in general Chambers, ''The Imperial Age of Venice''..., pp. 12\u201331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Scamozzi portrait by Veronese.jpg|thumb|[[Paolo Veronese]], ''Portrait of Vincenzo Scamozzi'' (''c''. 1585)]]\nThe building program was strenuously advocated by those wealthy and influential families within the aristocracy, the ''papalisti'', who maintained close ties with the papal court and whose architectural and artistic tastes tended to reflect developments in Rome and central Italy. They saw the transformation of Saint Mark's Square into a classical forum as the means to publicly affirm their own cultural orientation and their superior intellectual understanding of [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian principles]]. Economically, the ''papalisti'' had largely abandoned maritime trade in favor of the administration of agricultural properties on the mainland. In their foreign policy, they tended to support the interests of the Church and of the Holy Roman Empire. But the building program was increasingly opposed by the more traditionalist and pro-French faction within the government, the ''giovani'', who resisted the attempts of the ''papalisti'' to leave a lasting architectural mark. Hence when after the constitutional crisis of 1582-1583<ref>The constitution crisis concerned the nomination of the adjunct committee of the Council of Ten and resulted in the reduction of the powers delegated to the Council of Ten and in a renewed legitimacy of the Senate.</ref> the ''giovani'' found themselves in a position of greater strength vis-\u00e0-vis the ''papalisti'', they actively sought to limit any further change to Saint Mark's Square.<ref>Among the procurators ''de supra'', Antonio Querini, Leonardo Don\u00e0, and Andrea Dolfin were strong opponents. See in general Howard, ''Venice Disputed''..., pp. 178\u2013189 and Tafuri, ''Venezia e il Rinascimento''..., pp. 261\u2013271.</ref>\n\nDisapproval of the magnitude and grandeur of the project was voiced as early as 1589 when the design was criticized for its rich adornment, considered disparagingly more appropriate to a theater in reference to Scamozzi\u2019s work at the [[Teatro Olimpico|Olympic Theater]] in Vicenza.<ref>The remark was by procurator Federico Contarini. See Morolli, ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, p. 31.</ref> But following the death in 1595 of Scamozzi's chief supporter, procurator [[Marcantonio Barbaro]], opposition to the building program intensified with even radical proposals to demolish the part that had already been completed and erect a structure similar to the Procuratie Vecchie on the northern side of the square. It was alternatively suggested that the project be returned to its original two-floor design. Ultimately, the Senate deliberated that the construction would continue with all three floors.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 207</ref> But the design was radically altered, and Scamozzi was dismissed in 1597.\n\n[[File:Scamozzi_apartments.jpg|thumb|left|The only apartment unit, eleven arcades wide, built in accordance with Scamozzi's design is characterized by the [[margent]]s alongside the three central windows.]]\n'''Scamozzi\u2019s superintendence (1583\u20131597)'''\n\nIn March 1581, prior to the definitive selection of Scamozzi's design, demolition of the previous structures began with a portion of the old pilgrim hospice and proceeded gradually as more space was required to continue.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 21</ref> Actual construction began in 1583.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 31</ref> Although Scamozzi was directly involved in every aspect, oversight fell to the ''proto'' (chief building consultant) of the procurators ''de supra'', Simone Sorella, whose own design for the new building had been rejected. In 1584, Scamozzi presented further design proposals that included an additional floor. This would allow for separate apartments on each of the upper floors. It was similarly suggested that a floor be added to the library which was nearing completion. But following the equivocal results of engineering surveys conducted to determine whether the existing foundation of the library could bear the additional weight, it was decided in 1588 that the library would remain with only two floors.<ref>Manuela Morresi suggests that in addition to engineering considerations, the decision to retain the height of the library stemmed from the ascendency of the ''giovani'' faction in the aftermath of the constitutional crisis of 1582 and its opposition to the aggressive building program. See Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 207.</ref> Instead the proposal to raise the height of the Procuratie Nuove was accepted. \n\n[[File:Procuratie Nuove-southern facade.jpg|thumb|Detail of southern fa\u00e7ade, showing the discontinuation of Scamozzi's ornate design.]]\n'''Later periods of superintendence (1597\u2013''c''.1660)'''\n\nBy the time of Scamozzi's dismissal in 1597, only the first ten arcades had been built. The project was thereafter entrusted to Francesco di Bernardin Smeraldi, called Frac\u00e0, who was also nominated ''proto'' in 1600 upon the death of Sorella. That same year, the two single-floor apartments already under construction according to Scamozzzi's design were completed, and the first apartment was assigned the following year.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 54</ref> Smeraldi then radically reconceived the design as a series of narrower, multi-level apartments. He also simplified the overall decoration. By 1611, the building had reached the twentieth arcade and four apartments were completed. Smeraldi was succeeded as ''proto'' by Mario della Carit\u00e0 and subsequently, in 1640, by [[Baldassare Longhena]] who completed the construction of the Procuratie Nuove around 1660, including the seven arcades that reached the Church of San Geminiano on the western side of the square.\n\n===Architecture===\n\n'''Layout'''\n\nDespite the need to increase the number of apartments available to the procurators, Scamozzi's design was for only six apartments. These were divided into three consecutive units, each eleven arcades wide. The two apartments on the upper floors, one atop the other, shared a single courtyard with staircases and entries onto the square and the canal behind. Each apartment consisted in two sections. The forward section, facing the square, had the principal rooms and a study. It was connected by means of two loggias, running alongside the courtyard, to the back section which had rooms for family members and service areas. Only the first two apartments, begun by Scamozzi, follow this original design. Smeraldi's new design was for narrower apartments, only five arcades wide, that were distributed on multiple floors. Each apartment corresponded to four stores on the ground floor, that could be rented out by the procurators, and an archway leading to an inner courtyard that opened to the canal behind. A staircase from the courtyard provided access to the apartment above. By adding another three arcades to the overall project, the number of apartments was also increased to seven. An eighth apartment was added on the western end of the square.\n\n'''Fa\u00e7ade''' \n\n''See also: [[Biblioteca Marciana#Architecture|Biblioteca Marciana \u2013 Architecture]]''\n\n[[File:Juncture between the Biblioteca Marciana and the Procuratie Nuove.jpg|thumb|The juncture between the Ionic entablature of Sansovino's library (left) and the 'corrected' entablature of Scamozzi's Procuratie Nuove (right)]]\nFor the first two floors, Scamozzi was obliged to continue Sansovino's design for the library. But in his architectural treatise ''L\u2019Idea dell\u2019Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture''), he is highly critical. In particular Sansovino\u2019s entablatures are considered excessive in height with respect to the columns. The arches are consequently said to be dwarfed and ill-proportioned.<ref>Scamozzi considered appropriate a ratio between the height of the entablature and the column of 1 to 4 for the Doric order and 1 to 5 of the Ionic order, whereas the ratios in the library are 1 to 3 and 1 to 2 respectively.  See Scamozzi, Vincenzo, ''L\u2019Idea dell\u2019Architettura Universale'', 1615, Venetiis, expensis auctoris, Lib. VI, Cap. VII, pp. 20-21</ref> In the Procuratie Nuove, Scamozzi, a rigid classicist, corrects the 'error' by reducing the height of the Ionic frieze, without, however, successfully resolving the problem of transitioning between the two buildings.\n\nIn Sansovino\u2019s library, the ground floor  consists in a series of [[Doric order|Doric]] columns, supporting an [[entablature]], that is superimposed on an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]]. The ancient prototypes are the [[Theater of Marcellus]] and the [[Colosseum]] in Rome. Similarly, on the upper floor of the library, a row of large [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns is superimposed on a series of [[Venetian window|Serlian]]s. Scamozzi, while acknowledging the existence of both Roman and Renaissance precedents, was critical of such layering. In his design for the additional floor of the Procuratie Nuove, the series of [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns consequently rests against a simple wall. As a result, the third level lacks the deep recesses and the strong [[chiaroscuro]] effect of the lower floors. \n\nThe wall between the Corinthian columns is pierced with rectangular aedicule windows, topped by alternating curvilinear and triangular [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]]s. The solution of the alternating tympanums had been employed by both [[Bramante]] and [[Raphael]] for residential architecture and by Palladio for [[Palazzo Porto, Vicenza|Palazzo Porto]] and [[Palazzo Chiericati]]. Palladio also proposed the combination in his design for the rebuilding of the Doge's Palace after the fire of 1577, which was likely the immediate source for Scamozzi. The ancient prototype is the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] where the altars alternate around the perimeter, in pairs, with curvilinear and triangular pediments.<ref>Morolli, ''Le Procuratie Nuove''\u2026, p. 104</ref> Scamozzi's design for the upper floor included elaborate carvings and reclining figures atop the tympanums. But these were eliminated from the design by Smeraldi and exist only above the first ten windows, completed during Scamozzi's superintendence.\n\n===Later History===\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]] to Napoleon, the Procuratie Nuove was adapted to serve as the official residence of [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]], during the second period of French domination (1805\u20131815). The former apartments of the procurators were decorated by Giovan Battista Canal and [[Giuseppe Borsato]] between 1807 and 1813, under the influence of the French decorator [[Charles Percier]] who was in Venice in 1807.<ref>Morolli et al., ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> For the decoration of the throne room and the dining room, Pietro Moro and [[Sebastiano Santi]] were also involved. [[Giovanni Carlo Bevilacqua]] collaborated in other rooms. Modifications were also made in 1834\u20131836 and 1853\u20131857, during the subsequent period of Austrian domination (1815\u20131866), when the Procuratie Nuove served as an imperial residence.<ref>Morolli et al., ''Le procuratie nuove''\u2026, pp. 170\u2013173</ref> After the annexation of Venice to the Kingdom of Italy, the Procuratie Nuove came into the possession of the Italian Crown which ceded ownership to the State in 1919. Since 1922, the building houses the [[Correr Museum]].\n\n=='Ridotti' of the Procurators==\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto 096.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tintoretto]], ''Portrait of Jacopo Soranzo'' (1550).

In 1591, after the completion of the final five bays of the library by Vincenzo Scamozzi (1588), the offices were moved to the upper floor of the new building when the remaining section of the hospice was demolished in order to continue the construction of the Procuratie Nuove.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., pp. 112\u2013114</ref> The offices of the procurators ''de supra'' were located in the portion of the library completed earlier by Sansovino, directly facing the Piazzetta and the Doge's Palace, whereas the offices of the procurators ''de citra'' and ''de ultra'' were situated in the area built by Scamozzi.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco e Stringa Giovanni, ''Venetia citt\u00e0 nobilissima et singolare'', 1604, Venetia, Altobello Salicato, c. 216v</ref> Curiously, in 1552 when the library was still under construction, the practice began of extracting by lot the use of the balconies by the procurators and their guests to observe the [[Carnival of Venice|carnival]] celebrations in the Piazzetta.<ref>Morresi, ''Jacopo Sansovino'', p. 202</ref>\n\nThe designated area for the offices, accessible by means of the same entry as the library, consisted in nine rooms, three for each of the procuracies. The rooms utilized by the procurators ''de supra'' were prominently positioned at the top of the monumental staircase as an indication of their prestige. The first of the rooms served as an archive for documents, the second as a room for administrative officials and clerks in attendance, the third for the plenary meetings.\n\nPaintings, primarily portraits of the procurators and devotional works, were transferred from the previous offices and adapted to the new rooms by [[Tintoretto]], under the direction of Scamozzi. In the offices of the procurators ''de supra'', the portraits were hung in double rows, the meeting room being reserved for the portraits of the procurators who had subsequently been elected as doges.<ref>Sansovino, Francesco, ''Venetia citta nobilissima et singolare'', 1581, Venetia, Iacomo Sansovino, cc. 110v-111r. </ref>\n\nFollowing the [[fall of the Republic of Venice]], the art collection of the ''ridotti'' was removed and in part dispersed when the library was annexed to the Procuratie Nuove as the royal apartment for [[Eug\u00e8ne de Beauharnais]], the viceroy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]]. The former ''ridotti'' were decorated by [[Felice Giani]] and [[Giuseppe Borsato]] between 1807 and 1808 with [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] motifs, allegorical figures, and mythological scenes that exalt moral and intellectual virtues.\n\n==Procuratie Nuovissime (Napoleonic Wing)==\n\n[[File:Canaletto - Piazza San Marco looking west towards San Geminiano RCIN 405935.jpg|thumb|left|[[Canaletto]], ''Piazza san Marco looking West towards San Geminiano'' (''c''.1723\u20131724)]]\n[[File:Palazzo reale di venezia, salone da ballo, 02.jpg|thumb|Napoleonic Wing, ballroom completed by Lorenzo Santi]]\n===Historical Background===\nWhen during the second period of French domination the Procuratie Nuove was transformed into a royal residence, the former apartments of the procurators were adapted for residential purposes. But the structure lacked a suitably grand entry as well as larger rooms for audiences and entertaining. In 1807, the Church of San Geminiano, located on the western side of the square, was consequently demolished to have the space needed to extend the royal residence and create the necessary rooms.<ref>Morolli, Le Procuratie Nuove\u2026, p. 141.</ref> The church, dating back to the reign of [[Sebastiano Ziani]] (1172-1178), had been rebuilt in the early sixteenth century by Cristoforo da Legname and then completed by [[Jacopo Sansovino]] in 1557 with the addition of a dome and the fa\u00e7ade.<ref>Agazzi, ''Platea Sancti Marci''..., p. 123. The relative documents are in the Archives in PS, b. 64, proc, 138, fasc. 1.</ref> It was flanked on both sides by the wings of the Procuratie Vecchie and the Procuratie Nuove, built respectively by Sansovino and Longhena.\n\nProposals for the building that was to replace the church and join the wing of the Procuratie Vecchie with the wing of the Procuratie Nuove varied. Although the imperial French government sought a sense of monumentality, the projects of Grazioso Buttacalice for a [[triumphal arch]] and of Gaetano Pinali for a Corinthian [[portico]] were both deemed too radical and equally incongruous with the overall aspect of Saint Mark's Square. [[Giovanni Antonio Antolini]]\u2019s more modest design for a two-story [[loggia]] with a grand staircase in the rear was accepted.<ref>Samon\u00e0, ''Piazza san Marco''..., pp. 191\u2013193</ref>\n\n[[File:Ala Napoleonica Procuratie dettaglio centrale.jpg|left|thumb|Napoleonic Wing, fa\u00e7ade]]\n\n===Construction===\nIn 1810, Antolini's project was abandoned and the section of the building already constructed was demolished. The wing of the Procuratie Vecchie was also demolished and replaced by the actual building, designed by Giuseppe Maria Soli, professor of Architecture at the University of Modena, in a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] manner.\n\n===Architecture===\nThe first two floors of the Napoleonic Wing continue the repeatable bays of Sansovino's design for the library which Scamozzi had also used for the Procuratie Nuove on the southern side of the square. To then visually link the new building to the northern side, Soli designed an [[Attic style|attic]] floor, the height of which corresponds to the roofline crenellation of the Procuratie Vecchie. The attic was also conceived as a means of concealing the high, vaulted ceiling of the ballroom behind.\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of the attic is covered in low relief panels with classical motifs. Interspersed with these reliefs are freestanding statues on pedestals by Antonio Bosa and Domenico Banti.<ref>Morolli et al.
