Still, the mission spent a week studying the falls, hoping to find a point where an average-sized river boat might be able to pass the cataracts or otherwise, whether the establishment of a lateral channel would be feasible. In spite of the \"determination to put the stream to work, the Mekong was not yet a river to be tamed\".\n\nGarnier found himself on a river that \"would simply not cooperate.\" He concluded that, \"The future of rapid commercial relations on this vast river, the natural route from China to Saigon, of which I had happily dreamt the previous evening, appeared seriously compromised to me from this moment on.\"\n\nOn top of that, Captain Doudart de Lagr\u00e9e had learned at the Cambodian court, that further upstream was another succession of rapids, between ''Pak Moun'' and ''Kemarat'', around a hundred kilometers long, known as the Tang-Ho rapids or the Falls of Kemarat, where the river constitutes the border between modern day [[Ubon Ratchathani Province]] of Thailand and [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-4606322&fid=6044&c=thailand |title=Kemarat: Thailand |website=Geographical Names |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.studylight.org/encyclopedias/bri/view.cgi?n=21982 |title=Mekong |work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.]] |year=1911 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://seasiavisions.library.cornell.edu/catalog/seapage:359_219 |title=A Burmese loneliness: a tale of travel in Burma, the Southern Shan States and Keng Tung |last=Enriquez |first=Colin Metcalfe |publisher=Thacker, Spink and Co. |page=151 |year=1918 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/readbook_text/A_Burmese_Loneliness_a_Tale_of_Travel_in_Burma_the_Southern_Shan_States_1000474540/213 |title=A Burmese loneliness : a tale of travel in Burma, the Southern Shan States and Keng Tung |last=Enriquez |first=Colin Metcalfe |publisher=Thacker, Spink and Co. |pages=150\u2013151 |year=1918 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|Mekong River in Laos (1490866472).jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Mekong River in Laos}}\n\n[[File:Khone Phapheng Falls - 1.jpg|thumb|right|<center>The [[Khone Phapheng Falls|Khone Falls]]<br>in Southern [[Laos]]</center>]]\n\nIn spite of the rapids, which for the moment ended any plans and efforts of establishing a route to China, the expedition continued to ascend upstream into Yunnan, China. The focus had shifted to scientific recordings, surveys and notes on topography, physical geography, demographics and social observations of the river valley. De Carn\u00e9 reflects on the shifting of motivations for the expedition:\n<blockquote>The principal results which were expected from the exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the [[Chao Phraya River|Me\u00efnam]] and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was the first part of the programme the commission had to carry out.[sic]</blockquote>\n\nIn April, the mission arrived in [[Luang Prabang]], where the exhausted men rested for four weeks and obtained their passports for China. However, the difficult territories ahead and the region's politically unstable principalities affected appropriate future travel plans and the men's confidence. After much debate over the further route, the expedition left on 25 May 1867. \n\n===From Burma to China===\n\nOn 18 June 1867 the men, whose health and condition had begun to seriously deteriorate and among whom [[malaria]] was widespread, left Siamese controlled territory and entered the Upper Mekong sector under Burmese rule. Shortly after the expedition left the Mekong and proceeded - on a much slower pace - on foot and oxcarts, that had been hired from local merchants. Progress, though was dragged even more by uncooperative official agents and the unpredictable local lords, who sporadically denied or granted permission to set foot on their lands. \n\nIn August de Lagr\u00e9e left the by now seriously disease-ridden and feverish men behind at the village of ''Mong Yawng'' in order to seek diplomatic support from the influential [[Shan States]] who might help with the mission's progress.<ref name=\"Osborne2007\">{{cite book|author=Milton Osborne|title=The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxF2kH04WKgC&pg=PT166|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9609-5|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>       \n\nReunited after three weeks the expedition progressed and reached the borderlands to China by the end of September. On 7 October 1867 they crossed the Mekong via ferry, seeing the river for the last time. Once in China desperately needed clothes, shoes and equipment could be acquired and herbal remedies improved the men's health. At Ssu-Mao, [[Yunnan]] the travellers were yet again halted, this time by the [[Panthay Rebellion]]. \n\nThey now pondered over the dilemma of whether to continue exploring the Mekong, or to conduct a commercial survey of southern China and abandon the river. Carn\u00e9 wrote: \"We were compelled by the Mussulman revolt to leave the Mekong, in order to gain the Sonkoi; to abandon geography, and solve a problem of more practical and immediate importance\" and \"At this moment, the commercial question won out as the impracticalities of continuing the scientific mapping of the Mekong became apparent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/cjw/cjwlog.html |title=History of Muslims under Chinese Rule, since 1839 |last=Choi |first=Jiwon |date=June 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>  \n \nAfter several months strenuous march in torrential rains, through thick jungle, over rugged and mountainous terrain on {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high narrow rocky paths, the men arrived at the [[Yangtze]] River in January 1868. \n\nAt Hui-tse, south of [[Dali City|Dali]] the mission reached a tragic climax in the death of the expedition's leader, de Lagr\u00e9e, who succumbed to an abscess of the liver on 12 March 1868.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121138/http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015 |title=Explorations in Cambodia |journal=[[The Friend (Quaker)|The Friend]] |volume=33 |issue=10 |edition=1 |date=October 2, 1876 |accessdate=April 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFrancis Garnier took command of the mission after de Lagr\u00e9e's death and safely led the expedition to Shanghai and the Chinese coast via the [[Yangtze]] River and finally set sail for the [[South China Sea]] towards Saigon, where they arrived on 29 June 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226122/Francis-Garnier |title=Francis Garnier |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/garnier.htm   |title=Exploration Travel Indochina | publisher= Vorasith Online |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences and conclusions==\n\n[[File:Map of Siam and French Indochina.svg|thumb|right|<center>French and British colonial expansion in Southeast-Asia</center>]]\n[[File:The French Wolf and The Siamese Lamb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cartoon showing the \"French wolf\" looking across the Mekong towards the \"Siamese lamb\"]]\n[[File:Voyage d'exploration en Indo-Chine - 1885 Francis Garmier 14.jpg|thumb|<center>The ancient city of [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] with a rhinoceros roaming the ruins (Delaporte) </center>]]\nThe records made over the course of two years were published in four large volumes.

Still, the mission spent a week studying the falls, hoping to find a point where an average-sized river boat might be able to pass the cataracts or otherwise, whether the establishment of a lateral channel would be feasible.

The focus had shifted to scientific recordings, surveys and notes on topography, physical geography, demographics and social observations of the river valley. De Carn\u00e9 reflects on the shifting of motivations for the expedition:\n<blockquote>The principal results which were expected from the exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words. It was desired, first, that the old maps should be rectified, and the navigability of the river tried, it being our hope that we might bind together French Cochin-China and the western provinces of China by means of it. Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty? Was there any truth in the opinion of geographers who, believed that there was a communication between the [[Chao Phraya River|Me\u00efnam]] and the Mekong? To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was the first part of the programme the commission had to carry out.[sic]</blockquote>\n\nIn April, the mission arrived in [[Luang Prabang]], where the exhausted men rested for four weeks and obtained their passports for China. However, the difficult territories ahead and the region's politically unstable principalities affected appropriate future travel plans and the men's confidence. After much debate over the further route, the expedition left on 25 May 1867. \n\n===From Burma to China===\n\nOn 18 June 1867 the men, whose health and condition had begun to seriously deteriorate and among whom [[malaria]] was widespread, left Siamese controlled territory and entered the Upper Mekong sector under Burmese rule. Shortly after the expedition left the Mekong and proceeded - on a much slower pace - on foot and oxcarts, that had been hired from local merchants. Progress, though was dragged even more by uncooperative official agents and the unpredictable local lords, who sporadically denied or granted permission to set foot on their lands. \n\nIn August de Lagr\u00e9e left the by now seriously disease-ridden and feverish men behind at the village of ''Mong Yawng'' in order to seek diplomatic support from the influential [[Shan States]] who might help with the mission's progress.<ref name=\"Osborne2007\">{{cite book|author=Milton Osborne|title=The Mekong: Turbulent Past, Uncertain Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uxF2kH04WKgC&pg=PT166|date=1 December 2007|publisher=Open Road + Grove/Atlantic|isbn=978-0-8021-9609-5|pages=166\u2013}}</ref>       \n\nReunited after three weeks the expedition progressed and reached the borderlands to China by the end of September. On 7 October 1867 they crossed the Mekong via ferry, seeing the river for the last time. Once in China desperately needed clothes, shoes and equipment could be acquired and herbal remedies improved the men's health. At Ssu-Mao, [[Yunnan]] the travellers were yet again halted, this time by the [[Panthay Rebellion]]. \n\nThey now pondered over the dilemma of whether to continue exploring the Mekong, or to conduct a commercial survey of southern China and abandon the river. Carn\u00e9 wrote: \"We were compelled by the Mussulman revolt to leave the Mekong, in order to gain the Sonkoi; to abandon geography, and solve a problem of more practical and immediate importance\" and \"At this moment, the commercial question won out as the impracticalities of continuing the scientific mapping of the Mekong became apparent.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/sp/0910/cjw/cjwlog.html |title=History of Muslims under Chinese Rule, since 1839 |last=Choi |first=Jiwon |date=June 2009 |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref>  \n \nAfter several months strenuous march in torrential rains, through thick jungle, over rugged and mountainous terrain on {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}} high narrow rocky paths, the men arrived at the [[Yangtze]] River in January 1868. \n\nAt Hui-tse, south of [[Dali City|Dali]] the mission reached a tragic climax in the death of the expedition's leader, de Lagr\u00e9e, who succumbed to [[Dysentery]] on 12 March 1868.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121138/http://server2.honweb.com/mhm-friend/cgi-bin/mhm-friend?a=d&d=Friend18761002-01.2.16&cl=&srpos=0&dliv=none&st=1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- |url-status=dead|archive-date=April 2, 2015 |title=Explorations in Cambodia |journal=[[The Friend (Quaker)|The Friend]] |volume=33 |issue=10 |edition=1 |date=October 2, 1876 |accessdate=April 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nFrancis Garnier took command of the mission after de Lagr\u00e9e's death and safely led the expedition to Shanghai and the Chinese coast via the [[Yangtze]] River and finally set sail for the [[South China Sea]] towards Saigon, where they arrived on 29 June 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226122/Francis-Garnier |title=Francis Garnier |website=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] |publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (company)|Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://vorasith.online.fr/cambodge/livres/garnier.htm   |title=Exploration Travel Indochina | publisher= Vorasith Online |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences and conclusions==\n\n[[File:Map of Siam and French Indochina.svg|thumb|right|<center>French and British colonial expansion in Southeast-Asia</center>]]\n[[File:The French Wolf and The Siamese Lamb.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cartoon showing the \"French wolf\" looking across the Mekong towards the \"Siamese lamb\"]]\n[[File:Voyage d'exploration en Indo-Chine - 1885 Francis Garmier 14.jpg|thumb|<center>The ancient city of [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] with a rhinoceros roaming the ruins (Delaporte) </center>]]\nThe records made over the course of two years were published in four large volumes.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy.

As used in [[Ancient Greek]], it is also called '''vrachy''', or '''brachy'''.

It is often used that way in dictionaries and textbooks of [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] and other languages. However, there is a frequent convention of indicating only the long vowels. It is then understood that a vowel with no [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] is short. If the vowel length is unknown, a breve as well as a macron are used in historical linguistics (\u0100\u0306 \u0101\u0306 \u0112\u0306 \u0113\u0306  \u012a\u0306 \u012b\u0306 \u014c\u0306 \u014d\u0306 \u016a\u0306 \u016b\u0306).\n[[File:PT Serif cyrillic and latin letters difference.svg|alt=Some typefaces differentiate Cyrillic style (top) and Latin style breve (bottom)|left|thumb|[[PT Fonts|Some typefaces]] differentiate Cyrillic style (top) and Latin style breve (bottom)]]\nIn [[Cyrillic script]], a breve is used for ''[[\u0419]]''. In [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], it is used for both the Cyrillic ''[[\u040e]]'' (semivowel U) and in the Latin ([[Lacinka|\u0141acinka]]) ''\u016c''. ''\u040e'' was also used in Cyrillic [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] under the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] uses a breve on ''[[\u04c1]]'' to represent a [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} (corresponding to {{angbr|g}} before a front vowel in the Latin script for [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]). In [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], a breve is used for Cyrillic letters \u04d0 (''A''-breve) and \u04d6 (''E''-breve). In [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]] orthography, it is used for \u04d0, [[O with breve (Cyrillic)|\u041e\u0306]] and \u040e. The traditional Cyrillic breve differs in shape and is thicker on the edges of the curve and thinner in the middle, compared to the Latin one. In Latin types, the shape looks like ears.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fonts.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=591|script-title=ru:\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, \"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\"|publisher=ParaType|language=Russian|trans-title=Cyrillic breve (\"kratka\")}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u0115 \u014f'' are used to represent {{IPA|[\u025b, \u0254]}} in dialects where also long {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0]}} occur.\n\nIn [[Esperanto]], ''u'' with breve (\u016d) represents a [[semivowel|non-syllabic]] ''u'' in [[diphthong]]s {{IPAslink|u\u032f}}, analogous to Belarusian ''[[\u045e]]''.\n\nIn the transcription of [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the breve over an ''m'' or an ''n'' indicates a [[prenasalized consonant]]; for example, ''n\u0306da'' is used to represent {{IPA|[\u207fda]}}.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], a breve over a phonetic symbol is used to indicate [[extra-shortness]].\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn other languages, it is used for other purposes.\n\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''A'' with breve represents /[[Mid central vowel|\u0259]]/, as in ''m\u0103r'' (apple).\n* [[G-breve]] appears in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] alphabets. In Turkish, ''\u011f'' lengthens the preceding vowel. It is thus placed between two vowels and is silent in standard Turkish but may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0270]}} in some regional dialects or varieties closer to [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].\n* The breve, together with the [[circumflex]] and [[horn (diacritic)|horn]], are used in the [[Vietnamese language]] to represent additional vowels.\n* The [[McCune-Reischauer]] romanization system of the [[hangul|Korean alphabet]]'s script uses breves over ''o'' and ''u'' to represent the vowels \u3153 (\u014f) and \u3161 (\u016d).<ref>For example, that word \ud55c\uae00 han-geul is romanized in [[McCune-Reischauer]] as ''han'g\u016dl''. The spelling ''han-geul'' is based on [[South Korea]]'s [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] adopted in 2000 in part for ease in computer use, not on [[McCune-Reischauer]]. It is common, for convenience, to omit writing all diacritical marks in McCune-Reishchauer including breves, in which case the word is spelled ''hangul'' not ''han'g\u016dl''. [[North Korea]] uses a variant of McCune-Reischauer that also utilizes breves for those two vowels.</ref>\n* [[\u1e2a|H-breve below]] \u1e2a \u1e2b is used to transliterate the [[Arabic]] character [[\u1e2a\u0101\u02be]] ({{lang|ar|\u062e}}) in [[DIN 31635]]. It is also used to transliterate [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Hittite cuneiform]], and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].\n*On [[German language]] maps, a double breve is often used in abbreviated placenames that end in ''-b\u035dg.,'' short for ''-burg,'' a common suffix originally meaning \u201ccastle\u201d. This prevents misinterpretation as ''-berg,'' another common suffix in placenames (meaning \u201cmountain\u201d).

It is often used that way in dictionaries and textbooks of [[Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], [[Tuareg languages|Tuareg]] and other languages. However, there is a frequent convention of indicating only the long vowels. It is then understood that a vowel with no [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]] is short. If the vowel length is unknown, a breve as well as a macron are used in historical linguistics (\u0100\u0306 \u0101\u0306 \u0112\u0306 \u0113\u0306  \u012a\u0306 \u012b\u0306 \u014c\u0306 \u014d\u0306 \u016a\u0306 \u016b\u0306).\n[[File:PT Serif cyrillic and latin letters difference.svg|alt=Some typefaces differentiate Cyrillic style (top) and Latin style breve (bottom)|left|thumb|[[PT Fonts|Some typefaces]] differentiate Cyrillic style (top) and Latin style breve (bottom)]]\nIn [[Cyrillic script]], a breve is used for ''[[\u0419]]''. In [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], it is used for both the Cyrillic ''[[\u040e]]'' (semivowel U) and in the Latin ([[Lacinka|\u0141acinka]]) ''\u016c''. ''\u040e'' was also used in Cyrillic [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] under the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet]] uses a breve on ''[[\u04c1]]'' to represent a [[voiced postalveolar affricate]] {{IPA|/d\u0361\u0292/}} (corresponding to {{angbr|g}} before a front vowel in the Latin script for [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]). In [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]], a breve is used for Cyrillic letters \u04d0 (''A''-breve) and \u04d6 (''E''-breve). In [[Itelmen language|Itelmen]] orthography, it is used for \u04d0, [[O with breve (Cyrillic)|\u041e\u0306]] and \u040e. The traditional Cyrillic breve differs in shape and is thicker on the edges of the curve and thinner in the middle, compared to the Latin one. In Latin types, the shape looks like ears.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fonts.ru/help/term/terms.asp?code=591|script-title=ru:\u0411\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0435 \u043a\u0438\u0440\u0438\u043b\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435, \"\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430\"|publisher=ParaType|language=Russian|trans-title=Cyrillic breve (\"kratka\")}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Emilian dialect|Emilian]], ''\u0115 \u014f'' are used to represent {{IPA|[\u025b, \u0254]}} in dialects where also long {{IPA|[\u025b\u02d0, \u0254\u02d0]}} occur.\n\nIn [[Esperanto]], ''u'' with breve (\u016d) represents a [[semivowel|non-syllabic]] ''u'' in [[diphthong]]s {{IPAslink|u\u032f}}, analogous to Belarusian ''[[\u045e]]''.\n\nIn the transcription of [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]], the breve over an ''m'' or an ''n'' indicates a [[prenasalized consonant]]; for example, ''n\u0306da'' is used to represent {{IPA|[\u207fda]}}.\n\nIn the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], a breve over a phonetic symbol is used to indicate [[extra-shortness]].\n\n== Other uses ==\nIn other languages, it is used for other purposes.\n\n* In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], ''A'' with breve represents /[[Mid central vowel|\u0259]]/, as in ''m\u0103r'' (apple).\n* [[G-breve]] appears in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Crimean Tatar language|Crimean Tatar]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] alphabets. In Turkish, ''\u011f'' lengthens the preceding vowel. It is thus placed between two vowels and is silent in standard Turkish but may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0270]}} in some regional dialects or varieties closer to [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]].\n* The breve, together with the [[circumflex]] and [[horn (diacritic)|horn]], are used in the [[Vietnamese language]] to represent additional vowels.\n* The [[McCune-Reischauer]] romanization system of the [[hangul|Korean alphabet]]'s script uses breves over ''o'' and ''u'' to represent the vowels \u3153 (\u014f) and \u3161 (\u016d).<ref>For example, that word \ud55c\uae00 han-geul is romanized in [[McCune-Reischauer]] as ''han'g\u016dl''. The spelling ''han-geul'' is based on [[South Korea]]'s [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] adopted in 2000 in part for ease in computer use, not on [[McCune-Reischauer]]. It is common, for convenience, to omit writing all diacritical marks in McCune-Reishchauer including breves, in which case the word is spelled ''hangul'' not ''han'g\u016dl''. [[North Korea]] uses a variant of McCune-Reischauer that also utilizes breves for those two vowels.</ref>\n* [[\u1e2a|H-breve below]] \u1e2a \u1e2b is used to transliterate the [[Arabic]] character [[\u1e2a\u0101\u02be]] ({{lang|ar|\u062e}}) in [[DIN 31635]]. It is also used to transliterate [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], [[Hittite cuneiform]], and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]].\n*On [[German language]] maps, a double breve is often used in abbreviated placenames that end in ''-b\u035dg.,'' short for ''-burg,'' a common suffix originally meaning \u201ccastle\u201d. This prevents misinterpretation as ''-berg,'' another common suffix in placenames (meaning \u201cmountain\u201d). Thus, for example, ''Freib\u035dg.'' stands for ''[[Freiburg (disambiguation)|Freiburg]],'' not ''[[Freiberg (disambiguation)|Freiberg]].''\n*Certain transcription systems for certain [[varieties of Chinese]] employ the breve to represent one of the [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], including [[Foochow Romanized]] for the [[Fuzhou dialect]] of [[Eastern Min]], and [[Kienning Colloquial Romanized]] for  the [[Jian'ou dialect]] of [[Northern Min]] (which also uses the [[caron]]).\n* I-breve (\u01cf, \u01d0) is used in the [[Tatars of Romania|dialects]] of [[Crimean Tatar language]] spoken in Romania.\n*In [[Khmer language|Khmer]], \u0103 and \u0115 used in Khmer romanization, e.g. ''si\u0115m re\u0103p'' (Siem Reap).\n* In the [[Syriac language]]s, ''\u0115'' is used to denote an \"eh\" or /\u02c8\u025b/ sound.\n\n== Encoding ==\n[[Unicode]] and [[HTML]] code (decimal [[numeric character reference]]) for breve characters.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It replaced [[Formula C (SCCA)|Formula C]] as an [[SCCA]] racing class. Formula Continental includes three types of cars.\n\nThe first are the traditional 1100cc Formula C cars (which have large wings, are allowed aerodynamic tunnels, and full race engines).\n\nThe second type is the [[Formula Ford#Related Formulae|Formula Ford 2000]] (FF2000), which is a flat bottomed, steel tube frame open wheel car with smaller wings and a 2-litre engine derived from the steel blocked [[Ford Pinto]] or [[Ford Zetec]] engine.\n\nThe third type is the air-cooled variant of the [[Formula Super Vee]], which used a 1600cc [[Volkswagen]] engine.\n\nCurrently, the vast majority of Formula Continental entrants are FF2000 cars.\n\n==Formula Continental at the [[SCCA National Championship Runoffs]]==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
