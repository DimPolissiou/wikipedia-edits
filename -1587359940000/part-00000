These towns were inter-connected by a system of roads crossing semi-arid regions or deserts. The routes were traveled by convoys, and slaves formed part of this [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] traffic.\n\nIn contrast to the Atlantic slave trade, where the male-female ratio was 2:1 or 3:1, the Arab slave trade instead usually had a higher female-to-male ratio. This suggests a general preference for female slaves.

In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from [[Takrur]] (near the [[Senegal River]]) brought 1,700 slaves with them to [[Mecca]]. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]] and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in [[Souq|souks]].\n\nPotential buyers made a careful examination of the \"merchandise\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving [[eunuch]]s and [[concubine]]s happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship ''Ternate'', visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description:\n{{quote|'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and ages from 6 to 60, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.\n\nThus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is every reasons to believe that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of.

Archival material for the transatlantic trade in the 16th to 18th centuries may seem useful as a source, yet these record books were often falsified.

These towns were inter-connected by a system of roads crossing semi-arid regions or deserts. The routes were traveled by convoys, and slaves formed part of this [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]] traffic.\n\nIn contrast to the Atlantic slave trade, where the male-female ratio was 2:1 or 3:1, the Arab slave trade instead usually had a higher female-to-male ratio. This suggests a general preference for female slaves.

In 1416, al-Maqrizi told how pilgrims coming from [[Takrur]] (near the [[Senegal River]]) brought 1,700 slaves with them to [[Mecca]]. In North Africa, the main slave markets were in Morocco, [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]] and Cairo. Sales were held in public places or in [[Souq|souks]].\n\nPotential buyers made a careful examination of the \"merchandise\": they checked the state of health of a person who was often standing naked with wrists bound together. In Cairo, transactions involving [[eunuch]]s and [[concubine]]s happened in private houses. Prices varied according to the slave's quality. Thomas Smee, the commander of the British research ship ''Ternate'', visited such a market in Zanzibar in 1811 and gave a detailed description:\n{{quote|'The show' commences about four o'clock in the afternoon. The slaves, set off to the best advantage by having their skins cleaned and burnished with cocoa-nut oil, their faces painted with red and white stripes and the hands, noses, ears and feet ornamented with a profusion of bracelets of gold and silver and jewels, are ranged in a line, commencing with the youngest, and increasing to the rear according to their size and age. At the head of this file, which is composed of all sexes and ages from 6 to 60, walks the person who owns them; behind and at each side, two or three of his domestic slaves, armed with swords and spears, serve as guard.\n\nThus ordered the procession begins, and passes through the market-place and the principle streets... when any of them strikes a spectator's fancy the line immediately stops, and a process of examination ensues, which, for minuteness, is unequalled in any cattle market in Europe. The intending purchaser having ascertained there is no defect in the faculties of speech, hearing, etc., that there is no disease present, next proceeds to examine the person; the mouth and the teeth are first inspected and afterwards every part of the body in succession, not even excepting the breasts, etc., of the girls, many of whom I have seen handled in the most indecent manner in the public market by their purchasers; indeed there is every reasons to believe that the slave-dealers almost universally force the young girls to submit to their lust previous to their being disposed of.

Archival material for the transatlantic trade in the 16th to 18th centuries may seem useful as a source, yet these record books were often falsified.
