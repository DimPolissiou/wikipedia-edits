It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the\n\u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa. The university has two campuses \u2013 one in Bloemfontein, the judicial capital of South Africa, and one in Welkom, in the heart of the Free State goldfields. The two campuses offer education opportunities in a number of technological fields, including science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); management sciences; humanities; and education.<ref name=\"auto\">https://www.cut.ac.za/cut-at-a-glance</ref>\n\n===Faculties===\n* <ref name=\"Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology\">https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/faculty-of-engineering-information-technology</ref>\n* <ref name=\"Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences\">https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/health-and-environmental-sciences</ref>\n* <ref name=\"Faculty of Humanities\">https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/humanities</ref>\n* <ref name=\"Faculty of Management Sciences\">https://www.cut.ac.za/faculty/management-sciences</ref>\n\n===Student enrollment===\nThe Central University of Technology offers contact and distance learning.

He convinced [[Decca Records]] to sign for the leftover space, and began a career as a \"speculative builder.\" This field was a new concept in property development, one in which builders typically designed construction to meet the expressed needs of one specific company, then leased the entire space to that company after the building was in place.<ref name=\"lessons\"/>\n\nHe continued from his start with a single-story warehouse on the banks of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in the late 1940s.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]. The song was McCartney's attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible. The Beatles' recording is considered to be a key influence in the early development of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In 1976, the song was released as the B-side of \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" in the United States, to promote the [[Capitol Records]] compilation ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]''.\n\nAlong with other tracks from the White Album, \"Helter Skelter\" was interpreted by cult leader [[Charles Manson]] as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US. Manson titled his [[Helter Skelter (scenario)|vision of this uprising]] after the song. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked \"Helter Skelter\" 52nd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs\". [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Aerosmith]], [[U2]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] are among the artists who have covered the track, and McCartney has frequently performed it in concert.\n\n==Background and inspiration==\n[[File:Clacton Pier helter-skelter.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Helter skelter at [[Clacton Pier]], in the English county of [[Essex]]]]\n[[Paul McCartney]] was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" after reading an interview with [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] where he described their September 1967 single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. He said he then wrote \"Helter Skelter\" \"to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=487\u201388}} On 20 November 1968, two days before the release of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\"),{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=314}} McCartney gave [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] an exclusive interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=224}} Speaking of \"Helter Skelter\", he said:\n\n{{quote|Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, \"and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.\" And I just remember thinking, \"Oh, it'd be great to do one.

As a result, Capitol planned to issue \"Helter Skelter\" as the A-side of the single from ''Rock 'n' Roll Music'' but relented, realising that to exploit its association with Manson would be in poor taste.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=187}} In the final interview he gave before his [[Murder of John Lennon|murder in December 1980]], Lennon dismissed Manson as \"just an extreme version\" of the type of listener who read false messages in the Beatles' lyrics, such as those behind the 1969 \"[[Paul is dead]]\" rumour.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=88}} Lennon also said: \"All that Manson stuff was built around George's song about pigs ['[[Piggies]]'] and this one, Paul's song about an English fairground.

Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\"). It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]]. The song was McCartney's attempt to create a sound as loud and dirty as possible. The Beatles' recording is considered to be a key influence in the early development of [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]. In 1976, the song was released as the B-side of \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\" in the United States, to promote the [[Capitol Records]] compilation ''[[Rock 'n' Roll Music (album)|Rock 'n' Roll Music]]''.\n\nAlong with other tracks from the White Album, \"Helter Skelter\" was interpreted by cult leader [[Charles Manson]] as a message predicting inter-racial war in the US. Manson titled his [[Helter Skelter (scenario)|vision of this uprising]] after the song. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked \"Helter Skelter\" 52nd on its list of \"The 100 Greatest Beatles Songs\". [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]], [[Aerosmith]], [[U2]] and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] are among the artists who have covered the track, and McCartney has frequently performed it in concert.\n\n==Background and inspiration==\n[[File:Clacton Pier helter-skelter.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Helter skelter at [[Clacton Pier]], in the English county of [[Essex]]]]\n[[Paul McCartney]] was inspired to write \"Helter Skelter\" after reading an interview with [[the Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] where he described their September 1967 single, \"[[I Can See for Miles]]\", as the loudest, rawest, dirtiest song the Who had ever recorded. He said he then wrote \"Helter Skelter\" \"to be the most raucous vocal, the loudest drums, et cetera\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=487\u201388}} On 20 November 1968, two days before the release of ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as \"the White Album\"),{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=314}} McCartney gave [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]] an exclusive interview, in which he commented on several of the album's songs.{{sfn|Winn|2009|p=224}} Speaking of \"Helter Skelter\", he said:\n\n{{quote|Umm, that came about just 'cause I'd read a review of a record which said, \"and this group really got us wild, there's echo on everything, they're screaming their heads off.\" And I just remember thinking, \"Oh, it'd be great to do one. Pity they've done it. Must be great \u2013 really screaming record.\" And then I heard their record and it was quite straight, and it was very sort of sophisticated. It wasn't rough and screaming and tape echo at all. So I thought, \"Oh well, we'll do one like that, then.\" And I had this song called \"Helter Skelter,\" which is just a ridiculous song.

He says that whereas Lennon \"submerges in scatalogical contradictions\" in his song, \"Helter Skelter\" \"ignites a scathing, almost violent disorder\".{{sfn|Riley|2002|p=261}} In Everett's view, rather than the Who's contemporaneous music, the song \"sounds more like an answer to <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Yoko Ono]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>\", the Japanese performance artist who, as Lennon's new romantic partner, was a constant presence at the White Album sessions and a source of tension within the band.{{sfn|Everett|1999|pp=165, 347}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Helter Skelter\" was sequenced as the penultimate track on side three of ''The Beatles'', between \"[[Sexy Sadie]]\" and \"[[Long, Long, Long]]\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=319}}{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=164}} The segue from \"Sexy Sadie\" was a rare example of a gap (or \"rill\") being used to separate the album's tracks, and the brief silence served to heighten the song's abrupt arrival.{{sfn|McKinney|2003|p=238}} In Riley's description, the opening guitar figure \"demolishes the silence ... from a high, piercing vantage point\" while, at the end of \"Helter Skelter\", the meditative \"Long, Long, Long\" begins as \"the smoke and ash are still settling\".{{sfn|Riley|2002|pp=281, 282}} The double LP was released by [[Apple Records]] on 22 November 1968.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=314}}{{sfn|Lewisohn|2005|p=163}}\n\nIn his contemporary review for ''[[International Times]]'', [[Barry Miles]] described \"Helter Skelter\" as \"probably the heaviest rocker on plastic today\",<ref>{{cite news|title=Multi-Purpose Beatles Music|last=Miles|first=Barry|newspaper=[[International Times]]|date=29 November 1968|p=10}}</ref> while the ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s Alan Smith found it \"low on melody but high on atmosphere\" and \"frenetically sexual\", adding that its pace was \"so fast they all only just about keep up with themselves\".<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Alan|last=Smith|title=Beatles Double-LP in Full|magazine=[[NME]]|date=9 November 1968|p=5}}</ref> ''[[Record Mirror]]''{{'}}s reviewer said the track contained \"screaming pained vocals, ear splitting buzz guitar and general instrumental confusion, but [a] rather typical pattern\", and concluded: \"Ends sounding like five thousand large electric flies out for a good time.

The film's popularity in the US ensured that the song, and the White Album generally, received a new wave of attention. As a result, Capitol planned to issue \"Helter Skelter\" as the A-side of the single from ''Rock 'n' Roll Music'' but relented, realising that to exploit its association with Manson would be in poor taste.{{sfn|Schaffner|1978|p=187}} In the final interview he gave before his [[Murder of John Lennon|murder in December 1980]], Lennon dismissed Manson as \"just an extreme version\" of the type of listener who read false messages in the Beatles' lyrics, such as those behind the 1969 \"[[Paul is dead]]\" rumour.{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=88}} Lennon also said: \"All that Manson stuff was built around George's song about pigs ['[[Piggies]]'] and this one, Paul's song about an English fairground. It has nothing to do with anything, and least of all to do with ''me''.\"{{sfn|Sheff|2000|p=200}}\n\nReflecting on \"Helter Skelter\" and its appropriation by the Manson Family in his 1997 authorised biography, ''[[Many Years from Now]]'', McCartney said, \"Unfortunately, it inspired people to do evil deeds\" and that the song had acquired \"all sorts of ominous overtones because Manson picked it up as an anthem\".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=488}} Author Devin McKinney describes the White Album as \"also a black album\" in that it is \"haunted by race\".{{sfn|McKinney|2003|p=232}} He writes that, in spite of McCartney's comments about the song's meaning, the recording conveys a violent subtext typical of much of the album and that \"Here as ever in Beatle music, performance determines meaning; and as the adrenalized guitars run riot, the meaning is simple, dreadful, inarticulate, and instantly understood: ''She's coming down fast.''\"{{sfn|McKinney|2003|p=231}} In her 1979 collection of essays about the 1960s, titled ''The White Album'', [[Joan Didion]] wrote that many people in Los Angeles cite the moment that news arrived of the Manson Family's killing spree in August 1969 as having marked the end of the decade.{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=509\u201310, 595}} According to author Doyle Greene, the Beatles' \"Helter Skelter\" effectively captured the \"crises of 1968\", which contrasted sharply with the previous year's [[Summer of Love]] ethos. He adds: \"While '[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]' posited a forthcoming unity as far as social change, 'Helter Skelter' signified a chaotic and overwhelming sense of falling apart occurring throughout the world politically and, not unrelated, the falling apart of the Beatles as a working band and the counterculture dream they represented.\"{{sfn|Greene|2016|pp=51\u201352}}\n\n==Retrospective reviews and legacy==\nWriting for [[MusicHound]] in 1999, ''[[Guitar World]]'' editor Christopher Scapelliti grouped \"Helter Skelter\" with \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\" and \"[[Happiness Is a Warm Gun]]\" as the White Album's three \"fascinating standouts\".{{sfn|Graff|Durchholz|1999|p=88}} The song was noted for its \"proto-metal roar\" by [[AllMusic]] reviewer [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=The Beatles ''The Beatles'' <nowiki>[</nowiki>White Album<nowiki>]</nowiki>|website=[[AllMusic]]|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-beatles-white-album-r1523/review|accessdate=3 April 2019}}</ref> Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the album's release, Jacob Stolworthy of ''[[The Independent]]'' listed the same three songs as its best tracks, with \"Helter Skelter\" ranked at number 3.

Professional camel racing, like [[horse racing]], is an event for [[betting]] and tourist attraction. [[Camel]]s can run at speeds up to 65&nbsp;km/h (18&nbsp;m/s; 40&nbsp;mph) in short sprints and they can maintain a speed of 40&nbsp;km/h (11&nbsp;m/s; 25&nbsp;mph) for an hour.\nCamels are often controlled by child jockeys, but allegations of human rights abuses have led to nationwide bans on underage labor in the [[UAE]] and [[Qatar]]. In modern camel racing, camels are often controlled by [[Robot jockey|remote controlled robotic whips]].\n\nA major camel race is the [[Camel Cup]] held at [[Alice Springs, Northern Territory|Alice Springs]] which is the second biggest prize purse camel race in Australia. It is held annually and includes not only the camel races themselves, but also a collection of market stalls and other entertainment.\n\nThe biggest [[prize money]] camel race in Australia is \"The Boulia desert Sands\" with a A$500,000 prize purse in Queensland.\n\n==Child jockeys==\nChildren are often favored as jockeys because of their light weight.
