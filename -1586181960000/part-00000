It is called ''thuvaram paruppu'' in Tamil Nadu, ''thuvara parippu'' in Kerala and is the main ingredient for the dish ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]''. In Karnataka it is called ''togari bele'' and is an important ingredient in ''[[Bisi Bele Bath|bisi bele bath]]''. It is called ''kandi pappu'' in Telugu and is used in the preparation of a staple dish ''pappu charu''. It is also known as Arhar dal in northern India.\n*''Chana dal'' is produced by removing the outer layer of black [[chickpeas]] and then splitting the kernel''.'' Although machines can do this, it can be done at home by soaking the whole chickpeas and removing the loose skins by rubbing.  In Karnataka it is called ''kadle bele.'' [[Chickpea#Types|Other varieties of chickpea]] may be used, e.g., ''[[kabuli chana|kabuli]] dal''.\n[[File:A thali with daal roti bhindi ki sabzi and mango pickle.jpg|thumb|plain dal served with roti, sauteed okra and green-mango pickle.]]\n*[[Yellow split peas]] are very prevalent in the Indian communities of [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]], [[South Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and are popular amongst Indians in the United States as well as [[India]]. There, it is referred to generically as dal and is the most popular dal. It is prepared similarly to dals found in India, but may be used in recipes. The whole dried pea is called ''matar'' or ''matar dal'' in India. The whole dried yellow pea is the main ingredient in the common [[Bengalis|Bengali]] street food ''[[ghugni]]''.\n*Split [[mung bean]]s (''mung dal'') is by far the most popular in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]] (''moog dal'', (\u09ae\u09c1\u0997 \u09a1\u09be\u09b2)). It is used in parts of South India, such as in the Tamil dish ''[[Pongal (dish)#Ven pongal|ven pongal]]''. Roasted and lightly salted or spiced mung bean is a popular snack in most parts of India.\n*''[[Vigna mungo|Urad dal]]'', sometimes referred to as \"black gram\", is a primary ingredient of the south Indian dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]]''. It is one of the main ingredients of East Indian ([[Oriya cuisine|''oriya'']] and [[Bengali cuisine|Bengali]] or [[Assamese people|Assamese]]) ''[[Bori (food)|bori]]'', sun-dried dumplings. The [[Punjabi cuisine|Punjabi]] version is ''[[dal makhani]]''. It is called ''uddina bele'' in Karnataka, ''biulir dal'' in Bengali. It is rich in protein.\n* ''Masoor dal:'' split red [[lentil]]s.

The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some [[turmeric]], salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process. In some recipes, tomatoes, [[kokum]], unripe [[mango]], [[jaggery]], or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sweet-sour flavour.\n\nThe fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including ''[[chaunk]]'', ''tadka'' and ''tarka''. The ingredients in the ''chaunk'' for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly [[cumin seed]]s, [[mustard seed]]s, [[asafoetida]], and sometimes [[fenugreek seed]]s and dried [[chili pepper|red chili pepper]]) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by [[ginger]], garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices ([[turmeric]], [[coriander]], [[chili powder|red chili powder]], ''[[garam masala]]'', etc.) are added. The ''chaunk'' is then poured over the cooked dal.\nDal fry a veg restaurant-style recipe is the best Indian recipe made with tomato, cumin seeds, Tur dal, and other ingredients. It is a popular Indian lentil recipe. And the taste of this dal fry recipe is more like what is served in restaurants. You can also use a mix of tur ([[pigeon pea lentil]]).\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n\n* ''[[Chaunk]]''/''Tarka'' (in Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu)\n* ''[[Dal bati churma]]''\n* ''[[Dal biji]]''\n*[[Lentil]]\n* [[Ezogelin soup]]\n* [[Lentil soup]]\n* [[Pea soup]]\n* [[Vada (food)|''Vada'']]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |author1=Salma Husain |author2=Vijay Thukral |title=Pull of Pulses: Full of Beans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHKQtAEACAAJ |year=2018 |publisher=Niyogi |isbn=978-93-86906-19-9}}\n\n{{Indian Dishes}}\n{{Pakistani dishes}}\n{{Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n{{Legume dishes}}\n\n[[Category:Andhra cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bihari cuisine]]\n[[Category:Indian soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Lentil dishes]]\n[[Category:Muhajir cuisine]]\n[[Category:Nepalese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pakistani soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Plant common names]]\n[[Category:Punjabi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Rajasthani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Uttar Pradeshi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Gujarati cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kutchi cuisine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2019}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2013}}\n{{Infobox food\n| name             = Dal\n| image            = 3 types of lentil.png\n| caption          = Lentils are a staple ingredient in cuisines from the [[Indian subcontinent]].

It is called ''thuvaram paruppu'' in Tamil Nadu, ''thuvara parippu'' in Kerala and is the main ingredient for the dish ''[[Sambar (dish)|sambar]]''. In Karnataka it is called ''togari bele'' and is an important ingredient in ''[[Bisi Bele Bath|bisi bele bath]]''. It is called ''kandi pappu'' in Telugu and is used in the preparation of a staple dish ''pappu charu''. It is also known as Arhar dal in northern India.\n*''Chana dal'' is produced by removing the outer layer of black [[chickpeas]] and then splitting the kernel''.'' Although machines can do this, it can be done at home by soaking the whole chickpeas and removing the loose skins by rubbing.  In Karnataka it is called ''kadle bele.'' [[Chickpea#Types|Other varieties of chickpea]] may be used, e.g., ''[[kabuli chana|kabuli]] dal''.\n[[File:A thali with daal roti bhindi ki sabzi and mango pickle.jpg|thumb|plain dal served with roti, sauteed okra and green-mango pickle.]]\n*[[Yellow split peas]] are very prevalent in the Indian communities of [[Guyana]], [[Fiji]], [[Suriname]], [[South Africa]], [[Mauritius]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and are popular amongst Indians in the United States as well as [[India]]. There, it is referred to generically as dal and is the most popular dal. It is prepared similarly to dals found in India, but may be used in recipes. The whole dried pea is called ''matar'' or ''matar dal'' in India. The whole dried yellow pea is the main ingredient in the common [[Bengalis|Bengali]] street food ''[[ghugni]]''.\n*Split [[mung bean]]s (''mung dal'') is by far the most popular in [[Bangladesh]] and [[West Bengal]] (''moog dal'', (\u09ae\u09c1\u0997 \u09a1\u09be\u09b2)). It is used in parts of South India, such as in the Tamil dish ''[[Pongal (dish)#Ven pongal|ven pongal]]''. Roasted and lightly salted or spiced mung bean is a popular snack in most parts of India.\n*''[[Vigna mungo|Urad dal]]'', sometimes referred to as \"black gram\", is a primary ingredient of the south Indian dishes ''[[idli]]'' and ''[[dosa]]''. It is one of the main ingredients of East Indian ([[Oriya cuisine|''oriya'']] and [[Bengali cuisine|Bengali]] or [[Assamese people|Assamese]]) ''[[Bori (food)|bori]]'', sun-dried dumplings. The [[Punjabi cuisine|Punjabi]] version is ''[[dal makhani]]''. It is called ''uddina bele'' in Karnataka, ''biulir dal'' in Bengali. It is rich in protein.\n* ''Masoor dal:'' split red [[lentil]]s. In Karnataka, it is called ''kempu'' (red)'' togari bele''.\n*''Rajma dal'': split [[kidney bean]]s.\n* ''[[Mussyang]]'' is from dals of various colours found in various hilly regions of Nepal.\n* ''[[Panchratna Dal|Panchratna dal]]'' (Hindi/Urdu) (\"five jewels\") is a mixture of five varieties of dal, which produces a dish with unique flavour.\n* Pulses may be split but not hulled; they are distinguished from hulled dals by adding the word ''chilka'' (skin).\n\n==Split and whole pulses==\n[[File:Split Red Lentil.jpg|thumb|Split red lentil seeds (size 6&nbsp;mm)]]\nAlthough dal generally refers to split pulses, whole pulses can be referred to as ''sabut dhal'' and split pulses as ''dhuli dhal''.<ref>Mehta, Nita (2006).

The standard preparation begins with boiling a variety of dal (or a mix) in water with some [[turmeric]], salt to taste, and then adding a fried garnish at the end of the cooking process. In some recipes, tomatoes, [[kokum]], unripe [[mango]], [[jaggery]], or other ingredients are added while cooking the dal, often to impart a sweet-sour flavour.\n\nThe fried garnish for dal goes by many names, including ''[[chaunk]]'', ''tadka'' and ''tarka''. The ingredients in the ''chaunk'' for each variety of dal vary by region and individual tastes. The raw spices (more commonly [[cumin seed]]s, [[mustard seed]]s, [[asafoetida]], and sometimes [[fenugreek seed]]s and dried [[chili pepper|red chili pepper]]) are first fried for a few seconds in the hot oil on medium/low heat. This is generally followed by [[ginger]], garlic, and onion, which are generally fried for 10 minutes. After the onion turns golden brown, ground spices ([[turmeric]], [[coriander]], [[chili powder|red chili powder]], ''[[garam masala]]'', etc.) are added. The ''chaunk'' is then poured over the cooked dal.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Food}}\n\n* ''[[Chaunk]]''/''Tarka'' (in Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu)\n* ''[[Dal bati churma]]''\n* ''[[Dal biji]]''\n*[[Lentil]]\n* [[Ezogelin soup]]\n* [[Lentil soup]]\n* [[Pea soup]]\n* [[Vada (food)|''Vada'']]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book |author1=Salma Husain |author2=Vijay Thukral |title=Pull of Pulses: Full of Beans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fHKQtAEACAAJ |year=2018 |publisher=Niyogi |isbn=978-93-86906-19-9}}\n\n{{Indian Dishes}}\n{{Pakistani dishes}}\n{{Sri Lankan cuisine}}\n{{Legume dishes}}\n\n[[Category:Andhra cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bangladeshi soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Bengali cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bihari cuisine]]\n[[Category:Indian soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Lentil dishes]]\n[[Category:Muhajir cuisine]]\n[[Category:Nepalese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Pakistani soups and stews]]\n[[Category:Plant common names]]\n[[Category:Punjabi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Rajasthani cuisine]]\n[[Category:Uttar Pradeshi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sri Lankan legume dishes]]\n[[Category:Gujarati cuisine]]\n[[Category:Kutchi cuisine]]\n", "name_user": "Nipanebhushanwd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200e{{anchor|DAL Tadka}}Preparation", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dal"}

'''Roll clouds''' and '''shelf clouds''' are the two main types of arcus. Arcus clouds most frequently form along the leading edge or \"gust fronts\" of [[thunderstorm]] [[outflow boundary|outflow]]; some of the most dramatic arcus formations mark the gust fronts of [[derecho]]-producing convective systems. Roll clouds also may arise in the absence of thunderstorms, forming along the shallow cold air currents of some [[sea breeze]] boundaries and [[cold front]]s.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Shelf cloud ===\nA '''shelf cloud''' is a low, horizontal, wedge-shaped arcus cloud. A shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent [[cloud]], which is usually a thunderstorm cumulonimbus, but could form on any type of convective clouds. Rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading (outer) part of the shelf cloud, while the underside often appears [[Turbulence|turbulent]] and wind-torn. Cool, sinking air from a [[thunderstorm|storm cloud]]'s [[downdraft]] spreads out across the land surface, with the leading edge called a [[gust front]]. This outflow cuts under warm air being drawn into the storm's [[updraft]]. As the lower cooler air lifts the warm moist air, its water condenses, creating a cloud which often rolls with the different winds above and below ([[wind shear]]).\n\nPeople seeing a shelf cloud may believe they have seen a [[wall cloud]]. This is likely a mistake, since an approaching shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of cloud.  A shelf cloud usually appears on the leading edge of a storm, and a wall cloud will usually be at the rear of the storm.\n\nA sharp, strong gust front will cause the lowest part of the leading edge of a shelf cloud to be ragged and lined with rising [[fractus cloud]]s.

'''Roll clouds''' and '''shelf clouds''' are the two main types of arcus. Arcus clouds most frequently form along the leading edge or \"gust fronts\" of [[thunderstorm]] [[outflow boundary|outflow]]; some of the most dramatic arcus formations mark the gust fronts of [[derecho]]-producing convective systems. Roll clouds also may arise in the absence of thunderstorms, forming along the shallow cold air currents of some [[sea breeze]] boundaries and [[cold front]]s.\n\n== Types ==\n\n=== Shelf cloud ===\nA '''shelf cloud''' is a low, horizontal, wedge-shaped arcus cloud. A shelf cloud is attached to the base of the parent [[cloud]], which is usually a thunderstorm cumulonimbus, but could form on any type of convective clouds. Rising cloud motion often can be seen in the leading (outer) part of the shelf cloud, while the underside often appears [[Turbulence|turbulent]] and wind-torn. Cool, sinking air from a [[thunderstorm|storm cloud]]'s [[downdraft]] spreads out across the land surface, with the leading edge called a [[gust front]]. This outflow cuts under warm air being drawn into the storm's [[updraft]]. As the lower cooler air lifts the warm moist air, its water condenses, creating a cloud which often rolls with the different winds above and below ([[wind shear]]).\n\nPeople seeing a shelf cloud may believe they have seen a [[wall cloud]]. This is likely a mistake, since an approaching shelf cloud appears to form a wall made of cloud.  A shelf cloud usually appears on the leading edge of a storm, and a wall cloud will usually be at the rear of the storm.\n\nA sharp, strong gust front will cause the lowest part of the leading edge of a shelf cloud to be ragged and lined with rising [[fractus cloud]]s. In a severe case there will be [[Vortex|vortices]] along the edge, with twisting masses of [[Scud (cloud)|scud]] that may reach to the ground or be accompanied by rising dust. A very low shelf cloud accompanied by these signs is the best indicator that a potentially violent wind [[squall]] is approaching. An extreme example of this phenomenon looks almost like a tornado and is known as a [[gustnado]].<ref name=\"EC\">{{Cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623053833/http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/education/severe_weather/page19_e.cfm| archivedate=June 23, 2006 |url=http://www.msc-smc.ec.gc.ca/education/severe_weather/page19_e.cfm? |title=Gust fronts and wind squalls |work=Severe Weather Watcher Handbook |author=Meteorological Service of Canada |publisher=[[Environment Canada]] |date=December 19, 2002 |accessdate=2008-06-22| author-link=Meteorological Service of Canada }}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Shelf cloud pano oct07 ver4.jpg|Underside of a weak shelf cloud.\nFile:Shelf clouds gif.gif|A [[time-lapse photography]] of shelf cloud just before a [[thunderstorm]] in [[Pondicherry]], [[Puducherry]], [[India]].\nFile:Shelf cloud over Asprovalta.jpg|Shelf cloud over [[Asprovalta]]\n</gallery>\n\n=== {{anchor|volutus|Volutus}}Roll cloud ===\nA '''roll cloud''' (''Cloud Atlas'' name '' '''volutus''''') is a low, horizontal, tube-shaped, and relatively rare type of arcus cloud.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a last man standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. \n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to the December 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering to a [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) entrance and in nWo gear, acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] with Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of ''[[The A.V.

In the end, Owens performed a Stunner on Rollins to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn a small segment, [[WWE 24/7 Championship|24/7 Champion]] [[R-Truth]] joined Gronkowski and Rawley, who were standing atop a viewing podium. Gronkowski attempted to pin Truth to win the title, however, Rawley moved Gronkowski and pinned Truth instead to win the 24/7 title for the seventh time.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\nIn the penultimate match, Goldberg defended the Universal Championship against Braun Strowman. As Strowman attempted a Running Powerslam on Goldberg, Goldberg countered and performed three Spears for a near fall. Goldberg then performed the fourth Spear on Strowman. As Goldberg attempted a Jackhammer on Strowman, Strowman countered and performed four Running Powerslams on Goldberg to win the title for the first time, as well as his first world championship.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 1, The Undertaker faced AJ Styles in a Boneyard match, which was a [[Buried Alive match]] set at an undisclosed [[cemetery]] and warehouse in the Orlando area. A hearse arrived at the cemetery to The Undertaker's theme music, however, Styles emerged from the casket. The Undertaker then arrived riding a motorcycle (reminiscent of his [[The Undertaker#American Bad Ass (2000\u20132001)|\"American Bad Ass\" gimmick]]) to the tune of [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Now That We're Dead]]\". Halfway through the match, Styles' O.C. teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson appeared in an attempt to assist Styles, but The Undertaker fought them off. The Undertaker then fought a group of druids before Styles gained the upper hand again. Styles attacked Undertaker with a spade which caused Undertaker to fall in the grave. As Styles was preparing to drop dirt on Undertaker to bury him and win, Undertaker appeared behind Styles and started to attack him. Undertaker and Styles fought all over the graveyard and atop the warehouse rooftop. Undertaker then fought Gallows and Anderson on the rooftop. He then threw Gallows off the rooftop, performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Anderson, and threw Styles off the rooftop. Undertaker then threw Styles into the grave, started the tractor, and dumped all the dirt in the grave to win the match. Following the match, as the camera panned on the grave, Styles' hand was sticking out from the dirt, while Undertaker then departed on his motorcycle, again to the Metallica song.<ref name=\"WM36Part1\"/>\n\n===<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->Part 2<!--This is the official listing on the WWE Network-->===\n{|class=wikitable style=\"margin: 0.5em 0 0.5em 1em; float: right; clear: right;\"\n|+Other on-screen personnel (Part 2)\n!|Role\n!|Name\n|-\n|Host\n|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" |English Commentators\n|[[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[John Layfield|John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield]] {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Tom Phillips (wrestling)|Tom Phillips]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n|[[Byron Saxton]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Spanish commentators\n|[[Carlos Cabrera]]\n|-\n|[[Marcelo Rodr\u00edguez]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Ring announcers\n|Greg Hamilton {{small|(SmackDown)}}\n|-\n|[[Mike Rome]] {{small|(Raw/NXT Women's Championship match)}}\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |Referees\n|Danilo Anfibio\n|-\n|Shawn Bennett\n|-\n|[[John Cone]]\n|-\n|Darrick Moore\n|-\n|Eddie Orengo\n|-\n|[[Charles Robinson (referee)|Charles Robinson]]\n|-\n|[[Drake Younger|Drake Wuertz]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Interviewers\n|Charly Caruso\n|-\n|Kayla Braxton\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |Pre-show panel\n|[[Corey Graves]]\n|-\n|[[Peter Rosenberg]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |Pre-show correspondents\n|[[Renee Young]]\n|-\n|[[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]\n|-\n|[[Christian (wrestler)|Christian]]\n|}\n\n====Pre-show====\nDuring the WrestleMania 36 Kickoff Part 2 pre-show, [[Liv Morgan]] faced [[Natalya Neidhart|Natalya]]. In the end, Morgan pinned Natalya with a roll-up to win the match.<ref name=\"preWM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Preliminary matches====\nThe actual pay-per-view of Part 2 opened with Rhea Ripley defending the NXT Women's Championship against Charlotte Flair. In the climax, After a back-and-forth match, Flair forced Ripley to tap out to the Figure-Eight Leglock to win the title for a second time \u2013 and the first time since [[NXT TakeOver (2014)|NXT TakeOver]] in 2014. Flair also became the first wrestler to win an NXT championship before and after NXT became one of WWE's three main brands.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nNext, Aleister Black faced [[Bobby Lashley]] (accompanied by [[Lana (wrestler)|Lana]]). In the end, as Lashley attempted a Spear on Black, Black performed a Black Mass on Lashley to win the match.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nAfter that, Otis faced Dolph Ziggler (accompanied by Sonya Deville). In the closing moments, as Otis attempted to perform the Caterpillar on Ziggler, Deville distracted Otis on the ring apron, which allowed Ziggler to attack Otis with a low blow from behind. Deville's tag team partner, Mandy Rose, came out and attacked Deville. Otis then performed the Caterpillar on Ziggler to win the match. Following the match, Otis and Rose shared a kiss in the ring.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\nIn the fourth match, Edge faced Randy Orton in a last man standing match. As Edge was waiting for Orton to make his entrance, Orton who was disguised as a cameraman appeared and performed an ''RKO'' on Edge. Orton attacked Edge with a second ''RKO'' and a camera, but Edge rose to his feet. Edge and Orton then fought in the Performance Centres' gym area, where Orton placed Edge's arms in a sling and proceeded to attack him. As Orton attempted to attack Edge with a weight, Edge performed a dropkick on him. The two then fought back to the ringside area, where Orton threw Edge into a barricade off a raised platform. \n\nThe Firefly Fun House match between John Cena and \"The Fiend\" Bray Wyatt was billed by Wyatt as a fight between Cena and himself. Cena made his entrance in the Performance Center, but was then transported to the fun house. Cena was then transported to spots referencing time periods of his career (such as his debut on ''SmackDown'' and his early \"Doctor of Thuganomics\" gimmick), and a spoof of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', interspersed with promos accusing Cena of being a bully who did not have to work for his achievements like Wyatt did. After reminiscing about his defeat against Cena at WrestleMania XXX, with Wyatt appearing as his old [[The Wyatt Family|Wyatt Family]] self, Cena and Wyatt suddenly appeared in a ring, where Cena reversed out of an attempted Sister Abigail by Wyatt, and was (as in that previous match) coerced into using a chair against him. However, as he did so, Wyatt disappeared, and Cena was suddenly transported to the December 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]''\u2014entering to a [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]] (nWo) entrance and in nWo gear, acting as [[Hulk Hogan|\"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan]] with Wyatt acting as [[Eric Bischoff]]. In the ring, Cena tackled Wyatt, but after a fury of fists, Wyatt suddenly disappeared and was replaced by the Huskus the Pig Boy puppet. The Fiend then snuck up from behind, and finished Cena with a Sister Abigail and the Mandible Claw, with Wyatt's normal self counting the pin.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n\n====Main event====\nIn the main event of Part 2, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by [[Paul Heyman]]) defended the WWE Championship against Drew McIntyre. McIntyre started off with a Claymore Kick on Lesnar for a nearfall. Lesnar performed three German suplexes and an F-5, but McIntyre kicked out at one. Lesnar then performed two more F-5's, both of which again resulted in nearfalls. In the end, McIntyre countered a fourth F-5 attempt with three more Claymore Kicks on Lesnar to win the title.<ref name=\"WM36Part2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=April 2020}}\nRandall Colburn of [[The A.

Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of [[Brand licensing|licensed merchandise]], including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. [[Pendleton Ward]], the series' creator, describes Finn as a \"fiery little kid with strong morals\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, [[Bill Murray]]'s character in ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''. This means while Jake is somewhat care-free, he will \"sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs it\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic [[nuclear war]] a thousand years before the series' events.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;... I only liked the temp one!\"<ref name=aotmusicrev/> Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. According to Ward, much of the series' music has similar \"hiss and grit\" because one of the show's original composers, Casey James Basichis, \"lives in a pirate ship he's built inside of an apartment [and] you can hear floorboards squeak and lots of other weird sounds\".<ref name=aotmusicrev/> As the show progressed, Basichis's friend Tim Kiefer joined the show as an additional composer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seibert |first=Fred |title=Manlerette Party Song |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |publisher=[[Frederator]] |date=September 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000204/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The two now work together on its music.<ref name=music>{{cite interview |last=Basichis |first=Casey James |interviewer= |title='''Adventure Time'' Music With Time + Casey' [Featurette] |url= |publisher=[[Cartoon Network]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |date=2012 |work=Adventure Time: The Complete First Season }}</ref>\n\nThe show's title sequence and theme song have stayed mostly consistent throughout its run, with seven exceptions.

Produced by [[Frederator Studios]] and [[Cartoon Network Studios]], the series follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human|Finn]] (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]) and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog|Jake]] ([[John DiMaggio]]){{em dash}}a dog with the magical power to change size and shape at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, where they interact with [[Princess Bubblegum]] ([[Hynden Walch]]), the [[Ice King]] ([[Tom Kenny]]), [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]] ([[Olivia Olson]]), [[BMO (character)|BMO]] ([[Niki Yang]]), and others. The series is based on a 2007 [[Adventure Time (pilot)|short]] produced for [[Nicktoons (American TV channel)|Nicktoons]] and Frederator Studios' animation [[:wikt:incubation|incubator]] series ''[[Random! Cartoons]]''. After the short became a [[viral video|viral hit]] on the Internet, Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show officially premiered on April 5, 2010, and ended on September 3, 2018.\n\nThe series drew inspiration from a variety of sources, including the fantasy [[role-playing game]] ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' and video games. It was produced using hand-drawn animation; action and dialogue for [[List of Adventure Time episodes|episodes]] are decided by [[storyboard]]ing artists based on rough outlines. Because each episode took roughly eight to nine months to complete, multiple episodes were worked on concurrently. The cast members recorded their lines in group recordings, and the series regularly employed guest actors for minor and recurring characters. Each episode runs for about eleven minutes; pairs of episodes are often telecast to fill half-hour program slots. Cartoon Network announced on September 29, 2016, that the series would conclude in 2018, after the airing of its tenth season. The [[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|series finale]] aired on September 3, 2018. On October 23, 2019, four specials, collectively called ''[[Adventure Time: Distant Lands]]'', were announced, which will air exclusively on [[HBO Max]] starting with two in 2020.\n\n''Adventure Time'' has been a ratings success for Cartoon Network and some episodes have attracted over three million viewers; despite being aimed primarily at children, it has developed a following among teenagers and adults. The show has received positive reviews from critics and won awards including: eight [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], three [[Annie Award]]s, two [[British Academy Children's Awards]], a [[Motion Picture Sound Editors|Motion Picture Sound Editors Award]], and a [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Award]]. The series has also been nominated for three [[Critics' Choice Television Award]]s, two [[Annecy International Animated Film Festival|Annecy Festival Awards]], a [[TCA Awards|TCA Award]], and a [[Sundance Film Festival|Sundance Film Festival Award]], among others. Of the many comic book spin-offs based on the series, one received an [[Eisner Award]] and two [[Harvey Awards]]. The series has also spawned various forms of licensed merchandise, including books, video games and clothing.\n\n== Premise ==\n{{Further|List of Adventure Time characters}}\n\n''Adventure Time'' follows the adventures of a boy named [[Finn the Human]]{{efn|name=note13|Also known as Finn Mertens.}} (voiced by [[Jeremy Shada]]), and his best friend and adoptive brother [[Jake the Dog]] ([[John DiMaggio]]), who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. [[Pendleton Ward]], the series' creator, describes Finn as a \"fiery little kid with strong morals\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Jake, on the other hand, is based on Tripper Harrison, [[Bill Murray]]'s character in ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]''. This means while Jake is somewhat care-free, he will \"sit [Finn] down and give him some decent advice if he really needs it\".<ref name=\"awn\"/> Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic [[nuclear war]] a thousand years before the series' events.

Inspired by the title sequences of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'', Ward developed a new title sequence featuring a panning sweep of the Land of Ooo while a synthesizer note rose slowly until the main theme was played. Ward's draft for this idea was handed to layout animators, who then finalized the timing for the sequence. From there, the sequence evolved; while Ward added \"silly character stuff\", Patrick McHale focused his attention on the Ice King's shot and gave him a \"high school [year]book\" smile. The crew also struggled to get the shadows in the shot featuring Marceline correct.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> After the panning sweep, the sequence cuts to the theme song, which plays while shots of Finn and Jake adventuring are shown. For this part of the sequence, Ward was inspired by the \"simple\" aspects of the introduction to the 2007 comedy film ''[[Superbad (film)|Superbad]]''. When the theme mentions \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Finn the Human\", the characters' names are displayed next to their heads, with a solid color in the background.<ref name=aotmusicrev/> The sequence was finalized immediately before the series aired.<ref name=aotmusicrev/>\n\nThe show's eponymous theme song is sung by Ward, accompanied by a [[ukulele]]. It is first heard in the pilot episode; in that version Ward is accompanied by an acoustic guitar. For the version used in the series, Ward sung in a higher register to match with the higher range of the ukulele.<ref name=aotmusicrev>{{cite web|last=Ulloa |first=Alexander |title=Adventure Time (2010) |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time/ |website=Art of the Title  |year=2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320084120/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/adventure-time |archivedate=March 20, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The finalized version of the theme song was originally supposed to be a [[Temp track|temporary version]]. Ward said, \"I recorded the lyrics for the opening title in the animatics room where we have this little crummy microphone just so that we could add it to the titles and submit it to the network. Later, we tried re-recording it and I didn't like it&nbsp;... I only liked the temp one!\"<ref name=aotmusicrev/> Because the series' finalized theme song was originally recorded as a temp track, ambient noises can be heard throughout. For instance, the sound of Derek Drymon typing can be heard while Jake is walking through the Ice Kingdom. According to Ward, much of the series' music has similar \"hiss and grit\" because one of the show's original composers, Casey James Basichis, \"lives in a pirate ship he's built inside of an apartment [and] you can hear floorboards squeak and lots of other weird sounds\".<ref name=aotmusicrev/> As the show progressed, Basichis's friend Tim Kiefer joined the show as an additional composer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Seibert |first=Fred |title=Manlerette Party Song |url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |publisher=[[Frederator]] |date=September 30, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000204/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/adventure_time/2010/09/30/manlerette-party-song/ |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref> The two now work together on its music.<ref name=music>{{cite interview |last=Basichis |first=Casey James |interviewer= |title='''Adventure Time'' Music With Time + Casey' [Featurette] |url= |publisher=[[Cartoon Network]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |date=2012 |work=Adventure Time: The Complete First Season }}</ref>\n\nThe show's title sequence and theme song have stayed mostly consistent throughout its run, with seven exceptions.
