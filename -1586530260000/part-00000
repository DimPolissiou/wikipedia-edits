In 1974, CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air.

The fledgling network soon needed additional investors, and the Columbia Phonograph Company, manufacturers of [[Columbia Records]], rescued it in April 1927. Now the \"Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System\", the network went to air under its new name on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard L.

None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H. Grebe]]'s [[Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) for a small Brooklyn station, [[WCBS (AM)|WABC]] (no relation to the current [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56. The station changed frequencies again, to 880 kHz, in the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC)'s 1941 reassignment of stations ([[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement|NARBA]]); in 1946, WABC was renamed [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]].</ref> The physical plant was relocated also&nbsp;\u2013 to [[Steinway Hall]] on West 57th Street in [[Manhattan]], where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.<ref name=berg/>\n\nPaley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years.... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\"<ref name=berg61/> The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932.<ref name=bartow251>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 261</ref> In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4&nbsp;million to $4.7&nbsp;million.<ref name=halfirst>[[David Halberstam|Halberstam, David]] (1979).

There were two types of program at the time: ''sponsored'' and ''sustaining'', i.e., unsponsored.

Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible:<ref name=halfirst/> he would ''give'' the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so.<ref name=bargoldfirst/> CBS soon had more affiliates than either [[NBC Red Network|NBC Red]] or [[Blue Network|NBC Blue]].<ref>In 1943, the FCC would force NBC to sell off its Blue network, which thereupon became ABC. Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 190</ref>\n\nPaley was a man who valued style and taste,<ref name=hal26>Halberstam, pp. 26\u201327</ref> and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his concern to sleek, new 485 [[Madison Avenue]], the \"heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be\"<ref name=berg60>Bergreen, p. 60</ref> and where it would stay until its move to its own [[Eero Saarinen]]-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>\n\n====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====\n[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his&nbsp;\u2013 and his affiliates'&nbsp;\u2013 success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> wrote [[David Halberstam]]. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\"<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]], (\"Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist\"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] & [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign [[Bing Crosby]] immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;\u2013 and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.<ref name=berg63>Bergreen, p. 63</ref> Starting in 1930, astrologer [[Evangeline Adams]] would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems&nbsp;\u2013 and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.<ref name=bartow240>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 240</ref> The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\"<ref name=bartow2401>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 240\u2013241</ref> on behalf of the [[R.

Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand figures were usually older.\"<ref name=bargol96>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 96</ref> At CBS, ''[[Just Plain Bill]]'' brought human insight and [[Anacin]] pain reliever into households; ''[[Your Family and Mine]]'' came courtesy of [[Sealtest Dairy]] products; ''[[Bachelor's Children]]'' first hawked Old Dutch Cleanser, then [[Wonder Bread]]; ''[[Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories]]'' was sponsored by [[Spry Vegetable Shortening]]. ''[[Our Gal Sunday]]'' (Anacin again), ''[[The Romance of Helen Trent]]'' (Ang\u00e9lus cosmetics), ''[[Big Sister (radio)|Big Sister]]'' ([[Rinso]] laundry soap) and many others filled the daytime ether.<ref>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 94n9</ref>\n\n[[File:CBS radio hollywood.JPG|thumb|CBS west coast headquarters reflected its industry stature while hosting its top Hollywood talent.]]\nThanks to its daytime and primetime schedules, CBS prospered in the 1930s.

By 1933 they fought back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, or allowing \"their\" news to be read on the air for radio's profit.<ref name=bargol18>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 18</ref> Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to withhold their ads from print.<ref name=bargol22>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 22</ref> A short-lived attempted truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 9:30&nbsp;a.m., and then only after 9:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old.<ref name=bargol21>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:CBSNewsRemote1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[CBS News]] engineers prepare a remote: Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s 1937 denial of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] ties.]]\nIt was in this climate that Paley set out to \"enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network\".<ref name=berg90>Bergreen, p. 90</ref> He did it through sustaining programming like the [[New York Philharmonic]], the thoughtful drama of [[Norman Corwin]]&nbsp;\u2013 and an in-house news division to gather and present news, free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and [[wire service]]s.<ref name=berg90/> In the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in its first years by Paley's vice-president, former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Ed Klauber, and [[news director]] [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]]. Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245\u2013246</ref> to bring live feeds of [[Europe]]an events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was [[Edward R.

He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to [[London]] as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists&nbsp;\u2013 including [[William L. Shirer]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Bill Downs]], and [[Eric Sevareid]]&nbsp;\u2013 who would become known as the \"[[Murrow Boys]]\".

He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples.\"<ref name=hal39>Halberstam, p. 39</ref> With his \"manly, tormented voice\",<ref name=berg112>Bergreen, p. 112</ref> Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience.<ref name=berg112/> Using his trademark self-reference \"This reporter\",<ref name=bargol140>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 140</ref> he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance.<ref name=berg112/> Murrow himself said he tried \"to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor\".<ref name=berg112/> When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an \"extraordinarily elaborate reception\"<ref name=berg114>Bergreen, p. 114</ref> for Murrow at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. Of course, its goal was more than just honoring CBS's latest \"star\"&nbsp;\u2013 it was an announcement to the world that Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.<ref name=berg1145>Bergreen, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nOnce the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as \"a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company\".<ref name=hal40>Halberstam, p. 40</ref> He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] first, then eventually William S.

The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on ''faux'' news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''&nbsp;\u2013 the former sustaining program became ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>\n\n====CBS recruits Edmund A.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, [[game show]]s and amateur hours to wither for the duration.<ref name=bargol156/>\n\nSurprising was \"the granite permanence\" of the shows at the top of the ratings.<ref name=bargol284>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 284</ref> The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, [[Burns and Allen]], and [[Edgar Bergen]] all had been on the radio almost as long as there had ''been'' network radio.<ref name=bargol285>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 285</ref> A notable exception to this was relative newcomer [[Arthur Godfrey]] who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=berg179>Bergreen, p. 179</ref> Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an ''individual'', with a singular \"you\" rather than phrases like \"Now, folks...\" or \"Yes, friends...\".<ref name=berg180>Bergreen, p. 180</ref> His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of ''all'' CBS revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.<ref name=berg179/>\n\nIn 1947, Paley, still the undisputed \"head talent scout\" of CBS,<ref name=berg169/> led a much-publicized \"talent raid\" on NBC. One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Shortly after ruling in favor of NBC, FCC chairman Charles Denny resigned from the FCC to become vice president and general counsel of NBC: Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 243</ref> In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3&nbsp;million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg1589>Bergreen, pp. 158\u2013159</ref> 64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had one.<ref name=bargol295>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 295</ref>\n\nRadio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in the ''early'' 1950s, but it was \"a strange, twilight period\" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities (such as Denver and Portland, Oregon) had no television stations at all.  In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole, nationally broadcast service.<ref name=bargol285/> NBC's venerable [[Fred Allen]] saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show ''Stop The Music!''; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor [[Ford Motor Company]] and was shortly gone from the scene.<ref name=bargol2878>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 287\u2013288</ref> Radio powerhouse [[Bob Hope]]'s ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953.<ref name=bargol288>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 288</ref> By 1952, \"death seemed imminent for network radio\" in its familiar form;<ref name=bargol290>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 290</ref> most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.\n\nGradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera ''[[Guiding Light|The Guiding Light]]'' moved to television in 1952 and would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back \"home\" from NBC, made the move in 1950; [[Lucille Ball]] a year later; ''[[Our Miss Brooks]]'' in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated ''[[The Jack Benny Program|Jack Benny Program]]'' ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money,<ref name=berg230>Bergreen, p. 230</ref> it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera ''[[Ma Perkins]]'' went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series remained. Prime time radio ended on September 30, 1962, when ''[[Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar]]'' and ''[[Suspense (radio program)|Suspense]]'' aired for the final time.<ref name=dun742>{{cite book|title=On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio|author=[[John Dunning (radio historian)|John Dunning]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York City|year=1998|page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742 742]|isbn=0-19-507678-8|url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/742}}</ref>\n\n====CBS's radio programming after 1972====\nThe retirement of Arthur Godfrey in April 1972 marked the end of long-form programming on CBS radio; programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries and news features, known in the 1970s as ''Dimension'', and commentaries, including the ''Spectrum'' series that evolved into the \"Point/Counterpoint\" feature on the television network's ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and ''First Line Report'', a news and analysis feature delivered by CBS correspondents. The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly ''[[CBS Radio Mystery Theater]]'', the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the ''[[General Mills Radio Adventure Theater]]'' and the ''[[Sears Radio Theater]]'' in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations.<ref name=dun143>Dunning, p. 143</ref> The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece ''CBS World News Roundup'' in the morning and evening, weekend sister program ''[[CBS News Weekend Roundup]]'', the news-related feature segment ''[[Charles Osgood|The Osgood File]]'', ''What's In the News'', a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality [[Dave Ross]], tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from [[CBS Interactive]] property [[CNET]].\n\n{{anchor|Big Four}}\nOn November 17, 2017 CBS Radio was sold to Entercom becoming the last of the original Big Four radio network to be owned by its founding company.<ref name=\"entercom-8k-20171116\">{{cite web | url = https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | title = Form 8-K | author = Entercom Communications Corp. | publisher = Securities and Exchange Commission | date = 2017-11-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-17 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072029/https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067837/000119312517344727/d460737d8k.htm | archive-date = January 22, 2018 | url-status = live }}</ref> Although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS Radio continued to be run by CBS until its sale to Entercom.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018041706/http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.

CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]).

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|Major League Baseball]] from [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to [[NBC]] after the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]].\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''; ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''; ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]; [[Picket Fences]]''; and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman'' during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period.<ref name=\"tvtropes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025436/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|archive-date=February 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].\n\nDespite having success with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever.{{dubious|date=April 2020}}{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with [[Major League Baseball]] (after losing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with [[The Baseball Network|NBC and ABC]].

In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906063204/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|archive-date=September 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002233035/http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first=Colin |last=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327203550/http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152333/http://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901192756/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-date = September 1, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the US trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]]. Cassell was sold in a management buyout.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Philip Sturrock| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = http://www.philipsturrock.com/experience.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180822234057/http://philipsturrock.com/experience.html| archive-date = August 22, 2018| url-status = dead}}</ref> CBS exited the magazine business through the sale of the unit to its executive Peter Diamandis, who later sold the magazines to [[Hachette Filipacchi M\u00e9dias]] in 1988, forming [[Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.]]\n\n===CBS Musical Instruments division===\nForming the CBS Musical Instruments division, the company also acquired Fender (1965\u20131983), Electro-Music Inc. ([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165839/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]]. The New World deal resulted in CBS affiliating with UHF stations in [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]]&nbsp;\u2013 former Fox affiliate [[WOIO]] and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now [[WWJ-TV]]), the latter of which was purchased by the network&nbsp;\u2013 after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, [[WXYZ-TV]] and [[WEWS-TV]] (the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) to respectively replace departing affiliates [[WJBK]] and [[WJW (TV)|WJW-TV]], a situation that the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.<ref>{{cite news|title=COMPANY NEWS; TV Stations Shift to ABC|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=June 17, 1994|accessdate=October 21, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111215200/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/17/business/company-news-tv-stations-shift-to-abc.html|archive-date=November 11, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=ABC pre-empts CBS in Cleveland, Detroit|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-06-20.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=June 20, 1994|page=7}}</ref>\n\nIncluded in the Scripps deal was [[Baltimore]] NBC affiliate [[WMAR-TV]] (which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC affiliate [[WJZ-TV]], despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its [[broadcast license|license]] in 1991.<ref>{{cite news|title=Smith family seeks to take Channel 2; WBFF owners' move could shift WMAR|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|author=David Zurawik|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|date=September 13, 1991|accessdate=March 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213185614/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-13/business/1991256061_1_wbff-smith-family-channel|archive-date=December 13, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Media Business; Group W's Negotiations|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|page=8|date=July 11, 1994}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with CBS.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS to Add Three Affiliates in Deal With Westinghouse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=July 15, 1994|accessdate=July 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023121452/http://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/15/business/the-media-business-cbs-to-add-three-affiliates-in-deal-with-westinghouse.html|archive-date=October 23, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, Group W Form Historic Alliance|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1994/BC-1994-07-18.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting and Cable]]|date=July 18, 1994|page=14}}</ref> Of the other four stations, two of the stations ([[KPIX]] in [[San Francisco]] and [[KDKA-TV]] in [[Pittsburgh]]) were already longtime affiliates of the network, while two others ([[KYW-TV]] in [[Philadelphia]] and [[WBZ-TV]] in [[Boston]]) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000255/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995. NBC traded [[KCNC-TV]] in [[Denver]] and [[KUTV]] in [[Salt Lake City]] to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in [[Miami]], with NBC-owned [[WTVJ]] moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as [[WFOR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS, NBC changing channels.|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|author=Tom Jicha|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel|South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|location=[[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]]|date=November 22, 1994|accessdate=March 12, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703093638/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1994-11-22/news/9411210600_1_wcix-nbc-programs-stations|archive-date=July 3, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn August 1, 1995, [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] acquired CBS outright for $5.4&nbsp;billion.<ref name=\"Westinghouse-CBS\">{{cite news|title=CBS Agrees to Buyout Bid by Westinghouse : Entertainment: $5.4-billion merger would create biggest TV, radio empire.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815051557/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|archive-date=August 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165956/https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern and Pacific (7:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain) and Sunday from 7:00\u201311:00&nbsp;p.m. (6:00\u201310:00&nbsp;p.m. Central/Mountain).\n\nDaytime programming is also provided between 10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. weekdays (including a half-hour break for local news) featuring the game shows ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', [[soap opera]]s ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' and ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'', and talk show ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]''.\n\n[[CBS News]] programming includes ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' from 7:00 to 9:00&nbsp;a.m. weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', the [[Sunday morning talk shows|Sunday political talk show]] ''[[Face the Nation]]'', early morning news program ''[[CBS Morning News]]''. and the newsmagazines ''[[60 Minutes]]'', ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'', and ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]''. Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include ''Match Game'', ''[[Tattletales]]'', ''[[Pyramid (game show)|The $10/25,000 Pyramid]]'', ''[[Press Your Luck]]'', ''[[Card Sharks]]'', ''Family Feud'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include ''[[Beat the Clock]]'', ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'' and ''Password''. Two long-running prime time-only games were the panel shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''.\n\nThe network is also home to ''[[The Talk (talk show)|The Talk]]'', a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's ''[[The View (American TV series)|The View]]'', which debuted in October 2010 ({{as of|2018|lc=y}}, the program is hosted by moderator [[Julie Chen]], series creator/executive producer [[Sara Gilbert]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Sheryl Underwood]]).\n\n{{As of|2019|09}}, CBS Daytime airs two daytime [[soap operas]] each weekday: the hour-long series ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' (debuted in 1973) and half-hour series ''[[The Bold and the Beautiful]]'' (debuted in 1987). CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying 3{{frac|1|2}} hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than ''Guiding Light'', notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include ''[[As the World Turns]]'', ''[[Love of Life]]'', ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'', ''[[The Secret Storm]]'', ''[[The Edge of Night]]'' and ''[[Capitol (TV series)|Capitol]]''.\n\n===Children's programming===\n{{Main|Children's programming on CBS}}\nCBS broadcast the live-action series ''[[Captain Kangaroo]]'' on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']].

Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family's Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608084708/https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].\n\nThe Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996.

That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]\u2013[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts.

This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126183721/http://pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|archive-date=November 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003809/http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom, [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru, [[Fuji Television]] in Japan, [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil, and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703103325/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018081239/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\n\n===Bermuda===\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]-based [[ZBM-TV]], locally owned by [[Bermuda Broadcasting|Bermuda Broadcasting Company]].\n\n===Mexico===\nCBS programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]];

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.

In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as '''CBS, Inc.''' The [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]] acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current '''CBS Broadcasting, Inc.''' in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become [[CBS Corporation]]. In 2000 CBS came under the control of [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|the first Viacom]], which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the [[corporate spin-off|spin-off]] of its broadcast television, radio, and select [[cable television]] and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by [[Sumner Redstone]] through [[National Amusements]], which also controlled [[Viacom (2005\u20132019)|the second Viacom]] until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies [[2019 merger of CBS and Viacom|agreed to re-merge]] to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the [[CBS Radio]] network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with [[Entercom]]. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio [[owned-and-operated station|owned-and-operated radio stations]] in large and mid-sized markets, and [[network affiliate|affiliated]] radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in [[Canada\u2013United States border|border areas]] over-the-air.

With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\".<ref name=bartow223/> He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio.<ref name=bartow224>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 224</ref> By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.<ref name=berg>{{cite book|title=Look Now, Pay Later: The Rise of Network Broadcasting|url=https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg|url-access=registration|author=[[Laurence Bergreen]]|year=1980|publisher=Doubleday and Co.|location=New York City|page=[https://archive.org/details/looknowpaylaterr00berg/page/59 59]|isbn=978-0-451-61966-2}} Page numbers in this article refer to the first paperback edition, May 1981</ref>\n\n====Turnaround: Paley's first year====\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to [[Alfred H.

WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 [[Hertz|kHz]].<ref name=berg56>Bergreen, p. 56.

In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with [[Adolph Zukor]] of [[Paramount Pictures]], who planned to move into radio in response to [[RCA]]'s forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies.<ref name=berg61>Bergreen, p. 61</ref> The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8&nbsp;million at the time.<ref name=bartow224/> The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5&nbsp;million, provided CBS had earned $2&nbsp;million during 1931 and 1932.<ref name=berg61/> For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 stock market crash]] sent all stock value tumbling.

When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5&nbsp;million.<ref name=berg60/>\n\n====CBS takes on the Red and the Blue (1930s)====\n[[File:Kate Smith.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Wholesome [[Kate Smith]], Paley's choice for ''La Palina Hour'', was unthreatening to home and hearth]]\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief [[David Sarnoff]] approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"[[clear-channel station|clear channel]]\" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his&nbsp;\u2013 and his affiliates'&nbsp;\u2013 success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.<ref name=halfirst/>\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\",<ref name=hal26a>Halberstam, p. 26</ref> wrote [[David Halberstam]]. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\"<ref name=hal24>Halberstam, p. 24</ref> As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them [[Jack Benny]], (\"Your [[Canada Dry]] Humorist\"), [[Al Jolson]], [[George Burns]] & [[Gracie Allen]], and [[Kate Smith]], whom Paley personally selected for his family's ''[[La Palina]] Hour'' because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives.<ref name=berg69>Bergreen, p. 69</ref> When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign [[Bing Crosby]] immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.<ref>Halberstam, p. 26, and Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 273</ref>\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes&nbsp;\u2013 and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products.<ref name=berg63>Bergreen, p. 63</ref> Starting in 1930, astrologer [[Evangeline Adams]] would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems&nbsp;\u2013 and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste.<ref name=bartow240>Barnouw, ''Tower'', p. 240</ref> The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\"<ref name=bartow2401>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 240\u2013241</ref> on behalf of the [[R.

Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble.

By 1933 they fought back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, or allowing \"their\" news to be read on the air for radio's profit.<ref name=bargol18>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 18</ref> Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to withhold their ads from print.<ref name=bargol22>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 22</ref> A short-lived attempted truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 9:30&nbsp;a.m., and then only after 9:00&nbsp;p.m.&nbsp;\u2013 and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old.<ref name=bargol21>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 21</ref>\n\n[[File:CBSNewsRemote1937.jpg|thumb|left|[[CBS News]] engineers prepare a remote: Justice [[Hugo Black]]'s 1937 denial of [[Ku Klux Klan|Klan]] ties.]]\nIt was in this climate that Paley set out to \"enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network\".<ref name=berg90>Bergreen, p. 90</ref> He did it through sustaining programming like the [[New York Philharmonic]], the thoughtful drama of [[Norman Corwin]]&nbsp;\u2013 and an in-house news division to gather and present news, free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and [[wire service]]s.<ref name=berg90/> In the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in its first years by Paley's vice-president, former ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' columnist Ed Klauber, and [[news director]] [[Paul White (journalist)|Paul White]]. Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years<ref name=bartow2456>Barnouw, ''Tower'', pp. 245\u2013246</ref> to bring live feeds of [[Europe]]an events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was [[Edward R. Murrow]] in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. He was mentored in microphone technique by [[Robert Trout]], the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White.<ref name=berg107>Bergreen, p. 107</ref> Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\"<ref name=berg109>Bergreen, p. 109</ref> when he was dispatched to [[London]] as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\".<ref name=hal38>Halberstam, p. 38</ref> Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists&nbsp;\u2013 including [[William L. Shirer]], [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]], [[Bill Downs]], and [[Eric Sevareid]]&nbsp;\u2013 who would become known as the \"[[Murrow Boys]]\". They were \"in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\".<ref name=berg110>Bergreen, p. 110</ref> They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly [[Anschluss|annexed nearby Austria]] and Murrow and Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, [[Edgar Ansel Mowrer]] in Paris, [[Pierre Huss]] in [[Berlin]], [[Frank Gervasi]] in [[Rome]] and Trout in New York.<ref name=bargol78>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 78</ref> This bore the ''[[CBS World News Roundup|News Round-Up]]'' format, which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news.\n\nMurrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the [[The Blitz|London Blitz]] galvanized American listeners: even before [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], the conflict became \"the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples.\"<ref name=hal39>Halberstam, p. 39</ref> With his \"manly, tormented voice\",<ref name=berg112>Bergreen, p. 112</ref> Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience.<ref name=berg112/> Using his trademark self-reference \"This reporter\",<ref name=bargol140>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 140</ref> he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance.<ref name=berg112/> Murrow himself said he tried \"to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor\".<ref name=berg112/> When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an \"extraordinarily elaborate reception\"<ref name=berg114>Bergreen, p. 114</ref> for Murrow at the [[Waldorf-Astoria]]. Of course, its goal was more than just honoring CBS's latest \"star\"&nbsp;\u2013 it was an announcement to the world that Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.<ref name=berg1145>Bergreen, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nOnce the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as \"a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company\".<ref name=hal40>Halberstam, p. 40</ref> He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] first, then eventually William S. Paley himself,<ref name=bargol276>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 276</ref> and with a foe that formidable, even the vast Murrow account would soon run dry.\n\n====Panic: ''The War of the Worlds'' radio broadcast====\n[[File:Orson Welles 1937.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Enfant terrible]]'' Orson Welles's \"Hallowe'en joke\" frightened the country and snared a sponsor.]]\nOn October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'' broadcast a [[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|radio adaptation]] of [[H.

Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of ''faux'' news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from [[Mars]] were actually invading and devastating [[Grover's Mill, New Jersey]], despite ''three'' disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on ''faux'' news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air''&nbsp;\u2013 the former sustaining program became ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]'' to sell soup.<ref name=bargol88>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 88</ref> Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the [[Mercury Theatre]]'s own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"<ref name=berg96>Bergreen, p. 96</ref>\n\n====CBS recruits Edmund A.

Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines.<ref name=bargol138>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 138</ref> Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers&nbsp;\u2013 and effectively advertisements&nbsp;\u2013 and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship.<ref name=bargol165>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 165</ref> A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit<ref name=bargol165/> and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production&nbsp;\u2013 scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio.<ref name=bargol166>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 166</ref> In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped&nbsp;\u2013 two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.<ref name=berg167>Bergreen, p. 167</ref>\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network.<ref name=berg168>Bergreen, p.168</ref> No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\".<ref name=berg168/> He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\".<ref name=berg168/> His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.<ref name=hal31>Halberstam, p. 31</ref>\n\n[[File:FrankStantonCBSPrez.jpg|thumb|right|Dr. Frank Stanton, second only to Paley in his impact on CBS, president 1946\u20131971.]]\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]]. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\".<ref name=berg169>Bergreen, p. 169</ref> He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer.<ref name=berg170>Bergreen, p. 170</ref> He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors.<ref name=berg170/> In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe&nbsp;\u2013 slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron&nbsp;\u2013 made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".<ref name=berg171>Bergreen, p. 171</ref>\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's ''chain broadcasting investigation''&nbsp;\u2013 the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called.<ref name=bargol168>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 168</ref> Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman [[James L. Fly]].<ref name=bargol1689>Barnouw, ''Golden'', pp. 168\u2013169</ref> By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time&nbsp;\u2013 the ''network option''&nbsp;\u2013 came under attack as being restrictive to local programming.<ref name=bargol171>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 171</ref> The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money.<ref name=bargol171/> Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to [[Music Corporation of America]] and it became Management Corporation of America.<ref name=bargol172>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:GodfreyCBS1938.jpg|thumb|upright|Arthur Godfrey spoke directly to listeners individually, making him the foremost pitchman in his era.]]\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was [[Irving Berlin]]'s \"[[God Bless America]]\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith.<ref name=bargol155>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 155</ref> Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not.<ref name=bargol156>Barnouw, ''Golden'', p. 156</ref> The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews.

One day, while [[Freeman Gosden]] and [[Charles Correll]] were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable ''[[Amos and Andy]]'' show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\"<ref name=berg181>Bergreen, p. 181</ref> Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a ''coup'', but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, [[Charlie McCarthy]] and [[Red Skelton]], as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS.<ref name=berg181/> CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary.<ref name=bargol245>Barnouw, p. 245</ref> The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.<ref name=berg181/>\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings.<ref name=berg183>Bergreen, p. 183</ref> But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s&nbsp;\u2013 television.\n\n====Prime time radio gives way to television (1950s)====\n\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system.<ref name=berg153>Bergreen, p. 153.

Its initial broadcast featured [[list of mayors of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Jimmy Walker]], [[Kate Smith]], and [[George Gershwin]]. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single [[shortwave]] channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in [[Grand Central Terminal|Grand Central Station]] and a transmitter atop the [[Chrysler Building]], broadcasting on channel 2.<ref>{{cite web|title=W2XAB \u2013 CBS, New York|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|publisher=Earlytelevision.org|accessdate=October 22, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018041706/http://www.earlytelevision.org/w2xab.html|archive-date=October 18, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Color Television System Chronology|url=http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|publisher=Novia.net|accessdate=October 22, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922013759/http://www.novia.net/~ereitan/CBS_Chronology_rev_h_edit.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial [[Broadcasting construction permit|construction permit]] and program authorization as '''WCBW'''. The station went on the air at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now [[WNBC]]), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]]). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish [[Television network|networks]] and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite [[Federal Communications Commission#\"Freeze\" of 1948|\"freeze\"]] on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as [[KTTV]] in Los Angeles, which CBS&nbsp;\u2013 as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market&nbsp;\u2013 quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become [[KCBS-TV]]. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to [[WBBM-TV]], moving the CBS affiliation away from [[WGN-TV]].\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station ({{as of|2013|lc=y}}) built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now [[WUSA (TV)|WUSA]]) in a joint venture with ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1950, only to sell its stake to the ''Post'' in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in [[Milwaukee]] (now [[The CW|CW]] affiliate [[WVTV]]) and WHCT in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] (now [[Univision]] affiliate [[WUVN]]), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] and WTIC-TV (now [[WFSB]]), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, [[WCAN-TV]] (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on [[WTMJ-TV]], an NBC affiliate since 1947.  In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier.  In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station.  The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to [[WISN-TV]] on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup.  CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in  December 1994 to join Fox]]; it is now affiliated with [[WDJT-TV]] in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (25 years, as of the end of 2019).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in [[Philadelphia]] ([[WCAU]], now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now [[KMOV]]), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now [[KPLR-TV]].<ref>{{cite news|title=St. Louis Handshake|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1957/1957-09-09-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=September 9, 1957|page=5}}</ref>\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in [[Pittsburgh]] after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day [[WPGH-TV]] and [[WINP-TV]]) or [[Public broadcasting|public television]] ([[WQED (TV)|WQED]]). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby [[Steubenville, Ohio]] and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate [[WTOV-TV]]), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled [[KDKA-TV]] with CBS instead of NBC (like [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA radio]]) due to NBC [[Extortion|extorting]] and [[coercion|coercing]] Westinghouse to trade [[KYW (AM)|KYW radio]] and WPTZ (now [[KYW-TV]]) for [[Cleveland]] stations [[WTAM]], WTAM-FM (now [[WMJI]]), and WNBK (now [[WKYC]]); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the [[United States Department of Justice]] after an eight-year investigation.<ref>{{cite news|title=Philadelphia Circle is Complete/Nine-year history of that trade in Philadelphia|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1964/1964-08-03-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting]] |date=August 3, 1964|pages=23\u201325}}</ref>\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now [[WPXI]]) once it signed on in 1957 instead.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pittsburgh Ch. 11 Grantee to be CBS-TV Primary Outlet|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1955/1955-06-20-BC.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2017|work=[[Broadcasting (magazine)|Broadcasting Telecasting]]|date=June 20, 1955|pages=89\u201390}}</ref> This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\n====Programming (1945\u20131970)====\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well.

The 2{{frac|1|2}}-hour [[Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen|series finale]], in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125&nbsp;million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the [[Super Bowl]], which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of [[spin-off (media)|spinning new shows off]] from established hit series while at CBS, with ''[[Rhoda]]'' and ''[[Phyllis (TV series)|Phyllis]]'' spun from ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'', ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' and ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' spun from ''[[All in the Family]]'' and ''[[Good Times]]'' from ''Maude''. After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the [[1976\u201377 United States network television schedule|1976\u201377 season]], but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: ''[[One Day at a Time (1975 TV series)|One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'', ''[[Lou Grant (TV series)|Lou Grant]]'', ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'', the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-[[series finale]] single U.S. television episode&nbsp;\u2013 the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the [[Who Done It (Dallas)|resolution episode]] of the internationally prominent \"[[Who Shot J.R.?]]\" [[cliffhanger]].\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of ''Dallas'' (and its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]''), as well as hits in ''[[Falcon Crest]]'', ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'', ''[[Simon & Simon]]'' and ''60 Minutes''. CBS also acquired the [[College Basketball on CBS|broadcast rights]] to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] in 1982 (taking over for [[College Basketball on NBC|NBC]]), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a  new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years&nbsp;\u2013 namely ''[[Kate & Allie]]'', ''[[Newhart]]'', ''[[Cagney & Lacey]]'', ''[[Scarecrow and Mrs. King]]'', and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''&nbsp;\u2013 however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by [[Ted Turner]], which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by [[Loews Corporation|Loew's Inc.]] chairman [[Laurence Tisch]]. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as [[chief operating officer]], and Paley returning as chairman.<ref name=\"Sterling, C.

Law]]'', and ''[[227 (TV series)|227]]''). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'', ''[[Who's the Boss?]]'', ''[[Hotel (American TV series)|Hotel]]'', ''[[Growing Pains]]'', ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', and ''[[Roseanne]]''.\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits ''Simon & Simon'', ''Falcon Crest'', ''Murder, She Wrote'', ''Kate & Allie'', and ''Newhart'' still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future{{needs update|date=April 2020}} hits ''[[Designing Women]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', ''[[Jake and the Fatman]]'', and the newsmagazine ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'', all having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for ''60 Minutes'', ''Dallas'' and ''Knots Landing''; however, the ratings for ''Dallas'' were a far cry{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to [[Major League Baseball on CBS|Major League Baseball]] from [[Major League Baseball on ABC|ABC]] and [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] and the [[Olympics on CBS|Winter Olympics]] from [[Olympics on ABC|ABC]] despite losing the [[National Basketball Association]] to [[NBC]] after the [[1989\u201390 NBA season]].\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows ''[[Diagnosis: Murder]]''; ''[[Touched by an Angel]]''; ''[[Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman]]''; ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]; [[Picket Fences]]''; and a resurgent ''Jake and the Fatman'' during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the [[1992\u201393 United States network television schedule|1992\u201393 season]]; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC, or even the fledgling Fox network, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period.<ref name=\"tvtropes.org\">{{cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|title=CBS (Creator) - TV Tropes|publisher=|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025436/http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/CBS|archive-date=February 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful [[Late Show (CBS TV series)|late-night talk show]] franchise to compete with NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' when it signed [[David Letterman]] away from NBC after the ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'' host was passed over as [[Johnny Carson]]'s successor on ''Tonight'' in favor of [[Jay Leno]].\n\nDespite having success with ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever.{{dubious|date=April 2020}}{{lopsided|date=April 2020}} The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with [[Major League Baseball]] (after losing approximately [[United States dollar|US$]]500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with [[The Baseball Network|NBC and ABC]].

One of the shows that was affected was the ''Late Show with David Letterman'', which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's ''[[Nightline]]''; as a result, NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', which the ''Late Show'' often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman in London, Seeking Boost at Home|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|last=Carter|first=Bill|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 15, 1995|accessdate=July 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822063316/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/15/arts/letterman-in-london-seeking-boost-at-home.html|archive-date=August 22, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[JAG (TV series)|JAG]]'' (which moved to the network from NBC), ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', ''[[Cosby (TV series)|Cosby]]'', ''[[Cybill (TV series)|Cybill]]'', ''[[Touched by an Angel]]'', and ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''.\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"[[CBS Block Party]]\", in the [[1997\u201398 United States network television schedule|1997\u201398 season]] (consisting of ''[[Family Matters]]'', ''[[Step by Step (TV series)|Step by Step]]'', ''[[Meego (TV series)|Meego]]'', and ''[[The Gregory Hines Show]]'', all but the latter coming from [[Miller-Boyett Productions]], which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"[[TGIF (ABC)|TGIF]]\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): ''Meego'' and ''Hines'' were cancelled by November, while ''Family Matters'' and ''Step by Step'' were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the [[1998 Winter Olympics|1998 Winter Games]] in [[Nagano (city)|Nagano]]; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since [[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the [[2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Games]].\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the [[American Football Conference]] (stripping that package from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] after 32 years), effective with the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS mood positively 'electric' after reconnecting with NFL Intercepting AFC games caps network's comeback from rights turnover in '94|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|last=Kent|first=Milton|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]]|date=September 4, 1998|accessdate=June 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502212451/http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-09-04/sports/1998247169_1_cbs-wolff-football|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the [[New England Patriots]] in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the [[1998\u20131999 United States network television schedule|1998\u20131999 season]]; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as ''[[The King of Queens]]'', ''[[Nash Bridges]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and ''[[Yes, Dear]]''.\n\n====Programming: Return to first place and rivalry with Fox (2002\u2013present)====\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows ''[[Survivor (American TV series)|Survivor]]'' and ''[[Big Brother (US)|Big Brother]]'', which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the [[Survivor: The Australian Outback|second season]] of ''Survivor'' after its broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXV]] and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot) to follow ''Survivor'' at 9:00&nbsp;p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) including ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'', ''[[Without a Trace]]'', ''[[Criminal Minds]]'', ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' and ''[[The Mentalist]]'', along with ''CSI'' spinoffs ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' and ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like ''[[Still Standing (TV series)|Still Standing]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[The New Adventures of Old Christine]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'' and ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', as well as the reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of ''CSI'', briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the [[2002\u201303 United States network television schedule|2002\u201303 season]]. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]'' and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]''.\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u201306 season]], an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u201312 season]]). This lasted until the [[2007\u201308 United States network television schedule|2007\u201308 season]], when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-[[Big Three television networks|Big Three]] network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on ''[[American Idol]]'' (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the [[2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike]]. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the [[2008\u201309 United States network television schedule|2008\u201309 season]], where it has remained every season since.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nielsen Television (TV) Ratings: Network Primetime Averages|url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|work=[[Zap2It]]|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090330023543/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/ratings/network.html|archivedate=March 30, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18\u201334, 18\u201349 and 25\u201354 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. ''NCIS'', which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007\u201308 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series ''[[The Good Wife]]''; police procedurals ''[[Person of Interest (TV series)|Person of Interest]]'', ''[[Blue Bloods (TV series)|Blue Bloods]]'', ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' and ''NCIS'' spin-off ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''; reality series ''[[Undercover Boss (American TV series)|Undercover Boss]]''; and sitcoms ''[[2 Broke Girls]]'' and ''[[Mike & Molly]]''. ''The Big Bang Theory'', one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer [[Chuck Lorre]], started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17&nbsp;million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the [[2010\u201311 United States network television schedule|2010\u201311 season]], as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314 season]], when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, ''Two and a Half Men'', saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star [[Charlie Sheen]] (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of [[Ashton Kutcher]] as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18\u201349, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the [[2012\u201313 United States network television schedule|2012\u201313 fall season]], the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012\u201313 season, the [[NCIS (TV series)|tenth season of ''NCIS'']] took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after ''American Idol'' ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football]]'' taking over the top spot from ''Idol'' the year before and from ''NCIS'' the year after), for the first time since the 2002\u201303 season (when ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its [[2013\u201314 United States network television schedule|2013\u201314]] slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's [[2014\u201315 United States network television schedule|2014\u201315 schedule]], with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in ''[[Madam Secretary (TV series)|Madam Secretary]]'', ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' and ''[[Scorpion (TV series)|Scorpion]]''. Also, midseason hits ''[[The Odd Couple (2015 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' reboot and ''CSI'' spinoff ''[[CSI: Cyber]]''. The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with [[NFL Network]] to carry ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.<ref>{{cite

Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45&nbsp;p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by [[Ned Calmer]], and then by Everett Holles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Everett Holles 1944 WCBW Newscast|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|work=Indiana University Archives|access-date=March 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906063204/http://newsinfo.iu.edu/pub/libs/images/usr/7533_h.jpg|archive-date=September 6, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to [[WCBS-TV]] in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule&nbsp;\u2013 first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by [[Douglas Edwards]]. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring ''CBS Television News'', a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30&nbsp;p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly [[Lowell Thomas]] NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now [[WNBC]]) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time ''NBC Television Newsreel'' (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled ''Douglas Edwards with the News'', and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new [[coaxial cable]] connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' when [[Walter Cronkite]] replaced Edwards in 1962.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins Of Television News In America|chapter=The Birth of CBS-TV News: Columbia's Ambitious Experiment at the Advent of U.S. Commercial Television|author=Mike Conway|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York City}}</ref> Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\n====Color technology (1953\u20131967)====\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA&nbsp;\u2013 then-parent company of NBC&nbsp;\u2013 made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the ''[[Ford Star Jubilee]]'' programs (which included the first telecast ever of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM)'s 1939 film classic ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'') as well as the 1957 telecast of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Cinderella (musical)|Cinderella]]''; [[Cole Porter]]'s musical version of ''[[Aladdin (TV special)|Aladdin]]''; and ''[[Playhouse 90]]''{{'}}s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'', featuring choreography by [[George Balanchine]]. The ''Nutcracker'' telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by [[Eddie Albert]], shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to [[PBS]]).\n\nBeginning in 1959, ''The Wizard of Oz'', now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of ''Ford Star Jubilee''), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', starring [[Mary Martin]], the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast ''The Wizard of Oz'', ''Cinderella'' and ''Aladdin''.\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as ''The Wizard of Oz'', and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis#White House restoration|White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy]], which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, ''[[The Lucy Show]]'', began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the [[1964\u201365 United States network television schedule|1964\u201365 season]]. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the [[1965\u201366 United States network television schedule|1965\u201366]] season and complete the transition to the format during the [[1966\u201367 United States network television schedule|1966\u201367 season]]. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was ''[[The Twentieth Century (TV series)|The Twentieth Century]]'', which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from [[Philips]] which bore the [[Norelco]] brand name at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|title=Norelco Cameras \u2013 Eyes Of A Generation\u2026Television's Living History|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191002233035/http://eyesofageneration.com/cameras-page/norelco-television-cameras-eyes-of-a-generation/|archive-date=October 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella''. This version, starring [[Lesley Ann Warren]] and [[Stuart Damon]] in the roles formerly played by [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Jon Cypher]], was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of ''The Wizard of Oz'', with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired ''The Wizard of Oz'' twice in 1991, in March and again the night before [[Thanksgiving]]. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\n==Conglomerate==\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio [[Terrytoons]] Inc. from its founder [[Paul Terry (cartoonist)|Paul Terry]], not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for [[20th Century Fox]] well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] from [[Leo Fender]], who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the [[New York Yankees]] baseball club), book and magazine publishers ([[Fawcett Publications]] including ''[[Woman's Day]]'', and [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]), map-makers and toy manufacturers ([[Gabriel Toys]], Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), [[X-Acto]] knives,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of The House of Miniatures Brand |url=http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |accessdate= |first=Colin |last=Michael |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327203550/http://www.houseofminiatures.info/history.php |archive-date=March 27, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> and distributors of educational films and [[film strips]], Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early [[home video]] system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the [[CBS Laboratories|CBS Technology Center]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]], which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its [[CBS Productions]] unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's ''[[Caroline in the City]]''.\n\n===Columbia Records===\n{{main|Columbia Records}}\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched [[CBS Records International]] to market Columbia recordings outside of [[North America]], where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Lieverson to Helm Group; Other Changes Made in the CBS Guard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media Inc.|pages=1, 10|date=June 18, 1966|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122152333/http://books.google.com/books?id=0igEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA1|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS sold the CBS Records Group to [[Sony]] on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as [[MCA Inc.|MCA]], [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach Co.]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and the [[Empire State Building]]) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from [[EMI]] its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with [[Bertelsmann]] subsidiary [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] in 2004 as [[Sony BMG]], co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] in 2006.\n\n===Publishing===\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring [[Holt, Rinehart & Winston]], a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine ''[[Field & Stream]]''. The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company [[Saunders (publisher)|Saunders]] and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of ''[[Road & Track]]'' and ''[[Cycle World]]''. CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as ''Woman's Day''. In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher [[Cassell (publisher)|Cassell]] from [[Macmillan Inc.]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Macmillan Unit Acquired by CBS| accessdate = 2018-03-24| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190901192756/https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/18/business/macmillan-unit-acquired-by-cbs.html| archive-date = September 1, 2019| url-status = live}}</ref> In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by [[Ziff Davis]].\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]]; the US trade book division, renamed [[Henry Holt and Company]], was sold to the West German publisher [[Georg von Holtzbrinck Publishing Group|Holtzbrinck]].

([[Leslie speaker]]s) (1965\u20131980), [[Rogers Drums]] (1966\u20131983), [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos (1972\u20131985), [[Gemeinhardt]] flutes, [[Lyon & Healy]] harps (in the late 1970s), [[Rodgers Instruments|Rodgers]] (institutional) organs, and [[Gulbransen]] home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP Instruments]], a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\n===Film production===\n{{Main|CBS Films}}\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of [[Cinema Center Films]]. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via [[CBS Home Entertainment]]) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 [[Steve McQueen]] drama ''[[The Reivers (film)|The Reivers]]'' and the 1970 [[Albert Finney]] musical ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''.\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a [[joint venture]] with [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[HBO]] called [[TriStar Pictures]]. Despite releasing such box office successes as ''[[The Natural]]'', ''[[Places in the Heart]]'' and ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]'', CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent [[The Coca-Cola Company]].<ref>{{cite news|title=CBS Sells Stake In Tri-Star Inc.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=November 16, 1985|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125165839/http://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/16/business/cbs-sells-stake-in-tri-star-inc.html|archive-date=January 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\n===Home video===\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form [[MGM/CBS Home Video]] in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased [[United Artists]]. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form [[CBS/Fox Video]]. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\n===Gabriel Toys===\nCBS entered the [[video game]] market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the [[Atari 2600]], and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first [[karaoke]] recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all [[Coleco]]-related video game products in Canada, including the [[ColecoVision]]. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to [[View-Master]], which eventually ended up as part of [[Mattel]].\n\n===New owners===\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States ([[KDFX-CD|KDFX]] in [[Palm Springs, California]], and [[KECY-TV|KECY]] in [[Yuma, Arizona]], were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\n[[File:Ed sullivan theater.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|CBS's [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] in Manhattan, former home of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''. Now houses ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]''.]]\n\n====Westinghouse Electric Corporation====\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an [[1994 United States broadcast TV realignment|affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994]].

The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, [[WCAU (TV)|WCAU]], which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia \u2013 Ken Matz|url=http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|accessdate=January 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423000255/http://www.broadcastpioneers.com/kenmatz.html|archive-date=April 23, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995.

Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to [[Four Points Media Group]] in 2007, and is now owned by the [[Sinclair Broadcast Group]]), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's [[all-news radio]] stations in New York City ([[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] and [[WINS (AM)|WINS]]) and Los Angeles ([[KNX (AM)|KNX]] and [[KFWB]]) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core [[Borough (New York City)|New York City boroughs]] and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's [[WMAQ (AM)|WMAQ]] beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from [[WBBM (AM)|WBBM]] until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports [[WSCR]] to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the [[Infinity Broadcasting Corporation]], owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9&nbsp;billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the [[Gaylord Entertainment Company]] ([[The Nashville Network]] (now [[Spike (TV channel)|Spike]]) and [[Country Music Television]]) and starting a new one ([[Discovery People|CBS Eye on People]], which was later sold to [[Discovery Communications]]). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network [[Telemundo Puerto Rico (TV channel)|CBS Telenoticias]].\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]], NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. {{As of|2008}}, Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6&nbsp;billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5&nbsp;billion to acquire [[King World Productions]], a television syndication company whose programs included ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' and ''[[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''. By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for [[brand licensing]] purposes) were gone.\n\n====Viacom====\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate [[Viacom (original)|Viacom]]&nbsp;\u2013 a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as [[CBS Films, Inc.]] to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971&nbsp;\u2013 announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37&nbsp;billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\n====CBS Corporation, ViacomCBS, and CBS Studios====\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities.<ref>{{cite news|title=Moonves ready to play hardball in Viacom split|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|author=Phil Rosenthal|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|date=September 16, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130815051557/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-09-16/business/0509160202_1_leslie-moonves-cbs-and-upn-radio-division-infinity-broadcasting|archive-date=August 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and [[UPN]], the latter of which later merged with [[Time Warner]]-owned the [[The WB|WB]] to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became [[CBS Television Stations]]; and CBS Radio); [[Paramount Television]]'s production operations (now known as [[CBS Television Studios]]); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]]); [[Showtime Networks]]; [[Simon & Schuster]]; and [[Paramount Parks]], which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted [[MTV Networks]], [[Black Entertainment Television|BET Networks]], and [[Famous Music]] (the latter of which was sold to [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, ''I Love Lucy'', ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' (both the original and current remake), ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', ''[[Little House on the Prairie (TV series)|Little House on the Prairie]]'' (U.S. television rights only), ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', ''[[Family Ties]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs, ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'', ''[[Star Trek]]'', ''[[The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles]]'' (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder [[Lucasfilm]]), ''[[Evening Shade]]'', ''[[Duckman]]'', ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' and ''[[Scrooge (1970 film)|Scrooge]]''), and the entire [[Terrytoons]] library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"[[Star Trek]]\" and \"[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission: Impossible]]\" franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|title=CBS, Viacom to Reunite as Media Giants Bulk Up for Streaming|date=2019-08-13|website=KTLA|language=en|access-date=2019-12-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218165956/https://ktla.com/2019/08/13/cbs-viacom-to-reunite-as-media-giants-bulk-up-for-streaming/|archive-date=December 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by CBS|CBS News|CBS Sports}}\n{{As of|2013}}, CBS provides 87{{frac|1|2}} hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week.

Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.\n\n[[CBS Sports]] programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] season. In addition to rights to sports events from the [[National Football League|NFL]], [[Professional Golfers' Association of America|PGA]] and [[National Collegiate Athletics Association|NCAA]] among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the ''[[CBS Sports Spectacular]]'', a sports [[anthology series]] which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to&nbsp;\u2013 or in some cases, in lieu of&nbsp;\u2013 a major sporting event.\n\n===Daytime===\n{{main|CBS Daytime}}\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4{{frac|1|2}} hours. It is the home of the long-running game show ''The Price Is Right'', which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by [[Bob Barker]] for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian [[Drew Carey]]. The network is also home to the current incarnation of ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'', hosted by singer/comedian [[Wayne Brady]].\n\n{{As of|2020}}, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows.

From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled ''[[In the News]]'', which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of ''[[Mighty Mouse]]'', ''[[Bugs Bunny]]'' and ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoons, as well as the original version of ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids]]'', ''[[Jim Henson's Muppet Babies]]'', ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', and the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 ''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'']].

The Litton-produced \"CBS Dream Team\" block, which is aimed at teenagers 13 to 16 years old, debuted on September 28, 2013, replacing ''Cookie Jar TV''.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS partners with Litton Entertainment for Saturday teen block|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|last=James|first=Meg|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=July 24, 2013|accessdate=July 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725124635/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-cbs-litton-entertainment-saturday-teen-block-20130724,0,7010894.story|archive-date=July 25, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Specials===\n\n====Animated primetime holiday specials====\nCBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the ''[[Peanuts]]'' comic strip, beginning with ''[[A Charlie Brown Christmas]]'' in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as [[Halloween]]) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of [[Dr. Seuss]] (Theodor Geisel), beginning with ''[[How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (TV special)|How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]'' in 1966, as well as several specials based on the ''[[Garfield]]'' comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own [[Saturday morning cartoon]] on the network, ''Garfield and Friends'', which ran from 1988 to 1995). ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'', produced in [[stop motion]] by the [[Rankin/Bass]] studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. {{as of|2011}}, ''Rudolph'' and ''[[Frosty the Snowman (film)|Frosty the Snowman]]'' were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the ''Charlie Brown'' specials are now held by ABC, ''The Grinch'' rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the ''Garfield'' specials are now held by [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|title=Boomerang &#124; Full Episodes of Your Family's Favorite Cartoons|website=Boomerang|accessdate=Apr 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608084708/https://watch.boomerang.com/movies|archive-date=June 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the [[ITC Avant Garde]] typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in [[all caps]] and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama ''Hawaii Five-O'', titled \"Call to Danger\" on the [[Capitol Records]] soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the [[Miss USA]] pageants and the annual presentation of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]]), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director [[Lou Dorfsman]], who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing [[William Golden (graphic designer)|William Golden]], who died in 1959).<ref>{{cite web |title=TDC Medal Winner\u2014 Lou Dorfsman |url=https://www.tdc.org/profiles/lou-dorfsman/ |website=tdc.org |publisher=The Type Directors Club |accessdate=14 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n====Classical music specials====\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of ''[[Young People's Concerts]]'' conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to [[classical music]] through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several [[Emmy Award]]s including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966,<ref>{{Citation|title=New York Philharmonic Young People's Concerts|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|accessdate=August 12, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018015418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3776668/awards|archive-date=October 18, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and were among the first programs ever broadcast from [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]].\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet ''The Nutcracker''&nbsp;\u2013 two live telecasts of the George Balanchine [[New York City Ballet]] production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred [[Edward Villella]], [[Patricia McBride]] and [[Melissa Hayden (actress)|Melissa Hayden]]), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with [[Gelsey Kirkland]]&nbsp;\u2013 a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of ''Horowitz in Moscow'', a live piano recital by legendary pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]], which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of ''CBS News Sunday Morning'' (televised at 9:00&nbsp;a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00&nbsp;p.m. in [[Russia]]). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by [[Charles Kuralt]], but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast ''Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening'' in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and [[A&E (TV network)|A&E]] by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of [[Carnegie Hall]] after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as [[Frank Sinatra]].\n\n====''Cinderella''====\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the [[Mary Martin]] Broadway production of ''[[Peter Pan (1954 musical)|Peter Pan]]'', CBS responded with a musical production of ''Cinderella'', with music composed by [[Richard Rodgers]] and a book and lyrics by [[Oscar Hammerstein II]]. Based upon the [[Cinderella|classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title]], it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100&nbsp;million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, [[Ginger Rogers]] and [[Walter Pidgeon]] among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', but was not performed in that musical.<ref name=recreates>{{cite news|title=Richard Rodgers recreates a ''Cinderella'' to be remembered|newspaper=[[San Mateo Times]]|date=February 19, 1966|edition=TV Week|page=54}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0057950|Cinderella (1965, TV)}}.

The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS&nbsp;\u2013 under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED&nbsp;\u2013 in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as [[Louis Leakey]], [[Jacques Cousteau]] and [[Jane Goodall]], that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably [[Alexander Scourby]] during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the [[National Geographic Channel]], a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and [[Fox Cable Networks]]. The specials' distinctive theme music, by [[Elmer Bernstein]], was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\n====Other notable specials====\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the [[Pillsbury Bake-Off]], an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included [[Arthur Godfrey]], [[Art Linkletter]], [[Bob Barker]], [[Gary Collins (actor)|Gary Collins]], [[Willard Scott]] (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and [[Alex Trebek]].\n\nThe Miss USA [[beauty pageant]] aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. [[John Charles Daly]] hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an [[animal rights activist]] who eventually convinced producers of ''The Price Is Right'' to cease offering [[fur coat]]s as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), [[Alan Thicke]] in 1988, [[Dick Clark]] from 1989 to 1993, and [[Bob Goen]] from 1994 to 1996. The pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. pulchritude tops TV charts|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|page=P15|date=May 21, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Pageant tops Nielsen ratings|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|page=P15|date=May 19, 1982}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Beauty pageant most-watched show|publisher=The Globe and Mail Associated Press|page=P15|date=May 18, 1983}}</ref> Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20&nbsp;million to an average of 7&nbsp;million from 2000 to 2001.<ref>{{cite news|title=There She Goes: Pageants Move to NBC|author=Lisa de Moraes|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]]|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> In 2002, [[Donald Trump]] (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, the [[Miss Universe Organization]]) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract,<ref>{{cite news|title=Trump moves pageants from CBS to NBC|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|page=2B|date=June 22, 2002}}</ref> which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination]].<ref>{{cite web|title=NBC: Done With Donald Trump, Miss USA, Miss Universe \u2013 Update|url=https://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|date=June 29, 2015|accessdate=July 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630174133/http://deadline.com/2015/06/nbc-donald-trump-cancels-miss-usa-miss-universe-1201461913/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn June 1, 1977, it was announced that [[Elvis Presley]] had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special.

In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is [[KHNL|KOGG]] in [[Wailuku, Hawaii]], which serves as a repeater of [[Honolulu]] affiliate [[KGMB]] (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).\n\n[[Nexstar Media Group]] is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites);

That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the [[1998 New York Jets season|New York Jets]]\u2013[[1998 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]] to high definition beginning with the [[2000\u201301 United States network television schedule|2000\u201301 season]], with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts.

This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs. Litton Entertainment continues to frame the graphical elements in their programs for ''Dream Team'' within a 4:3 frame due to them being positioned for future syndicated sales, though all of its programming has been in high definition.\n\n==Brand identity {{anchor|Logos and slogans}}==\n\n===Logos===\n[[File:CBS Eye Ad Dec 1951.jpg|thumb|right|A 1951 advertisement for the CBS Television Network introduced the Eye logo.]]\n[[File:CBS Eyemark.svg|upright=0.7|thumb|CBS Eyemark]]\n[[File:CBS Eye (Didot).svg|thumb|The classic CBS corporate logo, using CBS Didot typeface.]]\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\".<ref>See an illustration of this early logo at {{cite web|title=cbs-1949.jpg|url=http://www.pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|publisher=Chuck Pharis Web Page|format=[[JPEG]]|accessdate=February 16, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126183721/http://pharis-video.com/cbs-1949.jpg|archive-date=November 26, 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] [[hex sign]] as well as a [[Shakers|Shaker]] drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, [[Georg Olden (graphic designer)|Georg Olden]], one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Search for Georg Olden|author=Julie Lasky (editors: Steven Heller and Georgette Ballance)|journal=Graphic Design History|publisher=Allworth Press|location=New York City|pages=121\u2013122|year=2001}}</ref> The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Logo: Design and History|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo/|work=FamousLogos.net|accessdate=May 2, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018003809/http://www.famouslogos.net/cbs-logo|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollb\u00e4ck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the ''Eyemark'', which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has served as inspiration for the logos of [[Associated Television]] (ATV) in the United Kingdom, [[Frecuencia Latina]] in Peru, [[Fuji Television]] in Japan, [[Rede Bandeirantes]] and [[Rede Globo]] in Brazil, and [[Saeta TV Channel 10]] in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.<ref>{{cite web|title=The CBS Eye turns 60|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|work=[[CBS News]]|date=October 19, 2011|accessdate=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170703103325/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-cbs-eye-turns-60/|archive-date=July 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is ''[[Didot (typeface)|Didot]]'', a close relative to ''[[Bodoni]]''.  Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by [[Herb Lubalin]] of [[International Typeface Corporation]], an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include ''Avant Garde'', ''Lubalin Graph'', and ''Serif Gothic''.\n\n===Image campaigns===\n\n====1980s====\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the [[1981\u201382 United States network television schedule|1981\u201382 season]] feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle [[Columbia (space shuttle)|Columbia]]. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as ''I Love Lucy'' with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as ''Dallas'' and ''M*A*S*H''. From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by [[Richie Havens]] (1983\u201384; one occasion in 1984\u201385) and [[Kenny Rogers]] (1985\u201386).\n\nThe [[1986\u201387 United States network television schedule|1986\u201387 season]] ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and [[Digital video effect|DVE]] effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987\u201388 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the [[1988\u201389 United States network television schedule|1988\u201389 season]], CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the [[1989\u201390 United States network television schedule|1989\u201390 season]]. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, [[Kmart]]) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\n====1990s====\nFor the [[1990\u201391 United States network television schedule|1990\u201391 season]], the campaign featured a new jingle performed by [[The Temptations]], which offered an altered version of their hit \"[[Get Ready (The Temptations song)|Get Ready]]\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996\u20131997), simplified to ''Welcome Home'' (1997\u20131999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999\u20132000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\n====2000s====\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with [[Don LaFontaine]] providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS, America's Most Watched Network, Also Posts The Largest Live Plus 7-Day DVR Lift During The 2010\u20132011 Season|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=June 13, 2011|accessdate=May 14, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018081239/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/06/13/cbs-americas-most-watched-network-also-posts-the-largest-live-plus-7-day-dvr-lift-during-the-2010-2011-season/95448/|archive-date=October 18, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Promos===\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules.

Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to [[simultaneous substitution]]s, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\n\n===Bermuda===\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with [[Hamilton, Bermuda|Hamilton]]-based [[ZBM-TV]], locally owned by [[Bermuda Broadcasting|Bermuda Broadcasting Company]].\n\n===Mexico===\nCBS programming is available in [[Mexico]] through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the [[Mexico\u2013United States border]] (such as [[KYMA-DT]]/[[Yuma, Arizona]];

To this effect, he commissioned various rural sitcoms for the network (although he personally hated this genre) and, in 1967, he canceled all of the network's profitable, but low-rated, game shows. He believed in the notions of [[hammocking]] and [[tent-pole programming]], in which a new or struggling sitcom could be made more successful by putting more successful shows before and after it.\n|-\n| [[Fred Silverman]] || 1970\u20131975 || In 1970, Silverman was promoted from vice-president of program planning and development to Vice President, Programs&nbsp;\u2013 heading the network's entire programming department.<ref name=\"BarberaAutoBio\">{{cite book|title=My Life in \"Toons\": From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century|author=[[Joseph Barbera]]|publisher=[[Turner Publishing]]|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163 163\u2013173]|year=1994|isbn=1-57036-042-1|url=https://archive.org/details/mylifeintoonsfro00barb/page/163}}</ref> Silverman was the chief architect of the \"[[rural purge]]\" of 1971, which eventually eliminated many popular country-oriented shows (such as ''[[Green Acres]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', ''[[Hee Haw]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'') from the CBS schedule. In their place, however, came a new wave of classics aimed at the upscale [[baby boomer]] generation (such as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[The Waltons]]'', ''Cannon'', ''Barnaby Jones'', ''[[Kojak]]'' and ''[[The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour]]''). Silverman had an uncanny ability to spot burgeoning hit material, especially in the form of [[spin-off (media)|spin-offs]], new television series developed with characters originating on an existing series. For example, he spun off ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' from ''All in the Family'', and ''Rhoda'' from ''Mary Tyler Moore'' (as well as ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' from ''MTM''{{'}}s writers). In early 1974, Silverman ordered a ''Maude'' spin-off titled ''[[Good Times]]''; that show's success led Silverman to schedule it against ABC's new hit, ''[[Happy Days]]'', the following fall. In other dayparts, Silverman also reintroduced game shows to the network's daytime lineup in 1972 after a four-year absence; among the shows Silverman introduced was an updated version of the 1950s game show ''The Price Is Right'', which remains on the air nearly four decades later. After the success of ''The Price Is Right'', Silverman would establish a working relationship with [[Mark Goodson]] and [[Bill Todman]] in which most of their game shows would air on CBS, including a revival of ''Match Game''. Under Silverman's tenure, CBS also ended the practice of [[wiping]] and saved as much of its recorded content as possible, while other networks recycled tapes constantly to save money. On Saturday mornings, Silverman commissioned [[Hanna-Barbera]] to produce the animated series ''[[Scooby-Doo, Where Are You?]]'' (one of the show's main characters, [[Fred Jones (Scooby-Doo)|Fred Jones]], is named after Silverman). The success of ''Scooby-Doo'' led to several other Hanna-Barbera series airing on CBS in the early 1970s.\n|-\n| [[Arthur R.

[[Opioid epidemic|Opioid-related deaths]] often involve alcohol.]]\nPoly drug use often carries with it more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. The potentiating effect of one drug on another is sometimes considerable and here the licit drugs and medicines \u2013 such as [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[nicotine]] and [[antidepressant]]s \u2013 have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances. The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances. If the drugs taken are illegal, they have a chance of being mixed (also known as \"cutting\") with other substances which dealers are reported to do to increase the perceived quantity when selling to others to increase their returns. This is particularly common with powdered drugs such as [[cocaine]] or [[MDMA]] which can be mixed with relative ease by adding another white powdery substance  to the drug. This cumulative effect can lead to further unintended harm to health dependent on what is being covertly added. Concerns also exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] or [[amphetamines]] also result in additional acute toxicity.<ref name=\"EEM\"/> [[Benzodiazepines]] can cause death when mixed with other [[CNS depressant]]s such as [[opioids]], alcohol, or [[barbiturate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Serfaty M, Masterton G |title=Fatal poisonings attributed to benzodiazepines in Britain during the 1980s |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue= 3|pages=386\u201393 |year=1993 |pmid=8104653 |doi=10.1192/bjp.163.3.386}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid12474705\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Whyte IM, O'Connell DL |title=[Relative toxicity of benzodiazepines in overdose.] |journal=BMJ |volume=310 |issue= 6974|pages=219\u201321 |year=1995 |pmid=7866122 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.310.6974.219|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6974/219 |pmc=2548618}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Drummer OH |author2=Ranson DL |date=December 1996 |title=Sudden death and benzodiazepines |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=336\u201342 |pmid=8947361 |doi=10.1097/00000433-199612000-00012}}</ref>\n[[File:Coughsyrup-promethcode.jpg|thumb|left|A spoonful of promethazine/{{zwsp}}codeine syrup showing the characteristic purple color that gave rise to the name [[purple drank]].|alt=Close-up photo of a metal spoon filled with a viscous, clear purple fluid]]\n\n==Scheduling==\nWithin the general concept of multiple drug use, several specific meanings of the term must be considered. At one extreme is planned use, where the effects of more than one drug are taken for a desired effect.  Another type is when other drugs are used to counteract the negative side effects of a different drug (e.g. depressants are used to counteract anxiety and restlessness from taking stimulants).

[[Opioid epidemic|Opioid-related deaths]] often involve alcohol.]]\nPoly drug use often carries with it more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. The potentiating effect of one drug on another is sometimes considerable and here the licit drugs and medicines \u2013 such as [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], [[nicotine]] and [[antidepressant]]s \u2013 have to be considered in conjunction with the controlled psychoactive substances. The risk level will depend on the dosage level of both substances. If the drugs taken are illegal, they have a chance of being mixed (also known as \"cutting\") with other substances which dealers are reported to do to increase the perceived quantity when selling to others to increase their returns. This is particularly common with powdered drugs such as [[cocaine]] or [[MDMA]] which can be mixed with relative ease by adding another white powdery substance  to the drug. This cumulative effect can lead to further unintended harm to health dependent on what is being covertly added. Concerns also exist about a number of pharmacological pairings: [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and [[cocaine]] increase cardiovascular toxicity; alcohol or depressant drugs, when taken with opioids, lead to an increased risk of overdose; and opioids or cocaine taken with [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]] or [[amphetamines]] also result in additional acute toxicity.<ref name=\"EEM\"/> [[Benzodiazepines]] can cause death when mixed with other [[CNS depressant]]s such as [[opioids]], alcohol, or [[barbiturate]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Serfaty M, Masterton G |title=Fatal poisonings attributed to benzodiazepines in Britain during the 1980s |journal=Br J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue= 3|pages=386\u201393 |year=1993 |pmid=8104653 |doi=10.1192/bjp.163.3.386}}</ref><ref name=\"pmid12474705\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Buckley NA, Dawson AH, Whyte IM, O'Connell DL |title=[Relative toxicity of benzodiazepines in overdose.] |journal=BMJ |volume=310 |issue= 6974|pages=219\u201321 |year=1995 |pmid=7866122 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.310.6974.219|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/310/6974/219 |pmc=2548618}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Drummer OH |author2=Ranson DL |date=December 1996 |title=Sudden death and benzodiazepines |journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=336\u201342 |pmid=8947361 |doi=10.1097/00000433-199612000-00012}}</ref>\n[[File:Coughsyrup-promethcode.jpg|thumb|left|A spoonful of promethazine/{{zwsp}}codeine syrup showing the characteristic purple color that gave rise to the name [[purple drank]].|alt=Close-up photo of a metal spoon filled with a viscous, clear purple fluid]]\n\n==Scheduling==\nWithin the general concept of multiple drug use, several specific meanings of the term must be considered. At one extreme is planned use, where the effects of more than one drug are taken for a desired effect.  Another type is when other drugs are used to counteract the negative side effects of a different drug (e.g. depressants are used to counteract anxiety and restlessness from taking stimulants).

It is known for its jewelry and watch-making industry, and as such has gained the nickname \"Goldstadt\" (\"Golden City\"). With an area of 97.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (38&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is situated between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]] at the confluence of three rivers ([[Enz]], [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] and [[W\u00fcrm (Nagold)|W\u00fcrm]]). It marks the frontier between [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the [[Margraves of Baden]]-Pforzheim.\n\nThe City of Pforzheim does not belong to any administrative district (''Kreis''), although it hosts the administrative offices of the [[Enz (district)|Enz]] district that surrounds the town.\n\nDuring World War II, Pforzheim was bombed by the Allies a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating [[area bombardment]]s of World War II, was carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town's population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops. The story of the bombardment is dramatically recounted in the history by [[Giles Milton]], titled ''[[Giles Milton#Non-fiction|Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War]]'' (2011).\n\nIn the twenty years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the postwar period and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.\n\n==Geography==\nPforzheim is located at the northern rim of the eastern part of the [[Black Forest]] (Schwarzwald) and the rim of the hilly country of the [[Kraichgau]], in an open valley at the confluences of the rivers [[W\u00fcrm]] and [[Nagold]] and the rivers Nagold and [[Enz]]. Due to its location, this city is also called the \"three-valleys town\" (''Drei-T\u00e4ler Stadt'') or the \"Gateway to the Black Forest\" (''Pforte zum Schwarzwald / Porta Hercynia'').\n\nPforzheim and its surrounding area belongs to the \"Densely Populated Area Karlsruhe/Pforzheim\". Pforzheim has the functions of a regional center (Mittelzentrum) for the towns and municipalities [[Birkenfeld (Enz)]], [[Eisingen]], [[Engelsbrand]],\n[[Friolzheim]], [[Heimsheim]], [[Ispringen]], [[K\u00e4mpfelbach]], [[Keltern]], [[Kieselbronn]], [[K\u00f6nigsbach-Stein]], [[M\u00f6nsheim]], [[Neuenb\u00fcrg]], [[Neuhausen (Enz)|Neuhausen]], [[Neulingen]], [[Niefern-\u00d6schelbronn]], [[\u00d6lbronn-D\u00fcrrn]], [[Remchingen]], [[Straubenhardt]], [[Tiefenbronn]], [[Wiernsheim]], [[Wimsheim]] and [[Wurmberg]].{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nThe following towns and communities share borderlines with the City of Pforzheim.

The communities B\u00fcchenbronn, [[Eutingen an der Enz]], Hohenwart, Huchenfeld and W\u00fcrm, which by way of the latest regional administrative reform during the 1970s were incorporated into Pforzheim's [[Local government|administration]], are represented by independent [[Local government|community councils]] and community administrations according to \u00a7 8 and following paragraphs of the main city-ordinance of Pforzheim. In important matters concerning any of these communities the opinions of the respective community councils must be taken into consideration.

These colonists constructed a [[Ford (river)|ford]] through the river, shortly past the confluence of the three rivers, for their military highway. Due to this strategic location, Pforzheim later became a center for the [[timber rafting|timber-rafting]] trade, which transported timber from the Black Forest via the rivers Wuerm, Nagold, Enz and down the [[Neckar]] and [[Rhine]] to, among other markets, the Netherlands for use in shipbuilding. Their timbers were also used to construct the foundations for [[Amsterdam]], which was built in a swamp.\n\n'''Since 90:''' A settlement was established by Roman citizens at the Enz River near the modern ''Altst\u00e4dter Br\u00fccke'' (old town bridge). Archeological surveys have unearthed several artifacts of that period which are kept and displayed in the Kappelhof Museum. The settlement was located where the Roman military road connecting the military camp [[Argentoratum]] (nowadays [[Strasbourg]] in France) and the military camp at [[Cannstatt]] (now a suburb of [[Stuttgart]]) at the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] crossed the [[Enz]] river. This place was known as ''Portus'' (meaning \"river crossing, harbor\"), which is believed to be the origin of the first part of the city's name \"Pforzheim\". A Roman milestone (the so-called 'Leugenstein') from the year 245 was excavated in modern times at present-day [[Friolzheim]]; it is marked with the exact distance to 'Portus' and is the first documented evidence of the settlement.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist6}}\n\n'''259/260''': The Roman settlement 'Portus' was destroyed completely, as the [[Franks|Frank]] and [[Alemanni]] tribes overran the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] and conquered the Roman administered area west of the [[Rhine]] River. From then on, over an extended period of time, historical records about the settlement were not available.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''6th/7th century''': Graves from this period indicate that the settlement had been continued.{{ref|hist2}}\n\n'''1067:''' The settlement was mentioned as \"Phorzheim\" for the first time, in a document by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Visits to Pforzheim by Heinrich IV in 1067 and 1074 are documented.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist2}}\n\n'''Before 1080:''' The \"old town\" of Pforzheim was awarded [[market rights]] (''Marktrecht''). At that time Pforzheim belonged to the estate of [[Hirsau]] [[Monastery]], according to monastery documents.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''From 1150:''' Establishment of the \"new town\" west of the \"old town\" at the foot of the Schlossberg (palais hill) under Margrave [[Hermann V, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Hermann V]].{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1200:''' The town charter of the \"new town\" was mentioned for the first time in a document. The \"old town\" continued to exist as a legally independent entity.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1220''': The [[Rulers of Baden|Margraves of Baden]] selected Pforzheim as their residence. This resulted in the \"new town\" becoming prominent.\n\n'''1240:''' A mayor of Pforzheim was mentioned in a document for the first time.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''13th/14th century:''' Pforzheim enjoyed its first period of flourishing. A group of influential [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] emerged. They developed the financial markets of those days. The town drew its income from the wood trade, [[timber rafting]], the [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] trade, [[textile]] manufacturing, and other crafts. Documents mention ''mayor, judge, council and citizens''. The town walls surrounding the new town were completed about 1290. During this era, three [[Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Orders|orders]] established their [[convents]] in town (the [[Franciscan]] order established their domicile within the town wall at present-day ''Barfuesserkirche'' (the choir of which remains), the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[nun|sisters]] order established their domicile outside the walls of the old town near Auer Bridge, and the Prediger cloister was located east of the Schlossberg, probably inside the town walls). Outside the town wall and across the Enz river, the suburb ''Fl\u00f6sser Quarters'' (the home of the timber-floating trade) was established. Next to the western town wall, the suburb of ''Br\u00f6tzingen'' gradually developed. The Margraves of Baden considered Pforzheim as their most important power base up to the first half of the 14th century. Under Margrave [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I), Pforzheim became one of the administrative centers of the margraviate.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist3}}{{ref|hist14}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n'''1322:''' Holy Ghost Hospital was founded at Tr\u00e4nk Street (present-day Deimling Street).{{ref|hist4}}\n\n'''15th century:''' Various [[Guild|fraternities]], also known as guilds, among people working in the same trade were established: The fraternity of [[tailor]]s in 1410, the fraternity of [[baker]]s on 14 May 1422, the fraternity of the [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] in 1469, the fraternity of the [[wine-grower]]s in 1491, the fraternity of the [[skipper (boating)|skippers]] and [[timber raftsmen]] in 1501, and the fraternity of the [[carting business|carters]] in 1512. Members of the same fraternity assisted each other in various ways, for example with [[funerals]] and in cases of sickness. In a sense, the fraternities were early forms of health and [[life insurance]].{{ref|hist4}}\n\n''' 8\u20139 August 1418:''' [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] visits [[Margrave]] [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I) in Pforzheim. On this occasion the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] of the Margraves of Baden in Pforzheim was mentioned. Mint master was Jakob Broeglin between 1414\u20131431. The emperor appointed the master of the Pforzheim mint, Jakob Br\u00f6glin, and Bois von der Winterbach for five years as Royal Mint Masters of the mints of [[Frankfurt]] and [[N\u00f6rdlingen]]. The Margrave was appointed as their patron.{{ref|hist5}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n'''1447:''' The wedding of [[Margrave]] [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles I]] (Karl I) of Baden with [[Katharina]] of Austria, the sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Friedrich III), was celebrated in Pforzheim with great pomp (including [[tournaments]] and [[dances]]).{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist7}}{{ref|hist12}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n[[File:Reuchlin-Gymnasium Pforzheim.jpg|thumb|''Reuchlin-Gymnasium'' (Reuchlin-Highschool) today near the water tower]]\n'''1455:''' [[Johannes Reuchlin]], the great German [[Humanism|humanist]], was born in Pforzheim on 29 January (he died in Stuttgart on 30 June 1522). He attended the [[Latin school|Latin School]] section of the monastery school run by the Dominican order of Pforzheim in the late 1460s. Later, partly due to Reuchlin's efforts, the [[Latin school|Latin School]] of Pforzheim developed into one of the most prominent schools in southwestern Germany, named ''[[Reuchlin-Gymnasium]]''. The school's teachers and pupils played an outstanding role in the dissemination of the ideas of [[humanism]] and the [[protestant reformation]] movement. The most famous pupils included Reuchlin himself, Reuchlin's nephew [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Simon Grynaeus]].{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist8}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1460:''' Margrave Charles I established a kind of monastery (Kollegialstift) at the site of Schlosskirche St. Michael, turning the church into a [[collegiate church]]. There were also plans to establish a university in Pforzheim, but this plan had to be abandoned because Margrave Charles I lost the [[Battle of Seckenheim]].{{ref|hist9}}{{ref|hist10}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1463:''' Margrave Charles I was forced to transfer the palace and the town of Pforzheim as a [[fiefdom]] to the [[Elector Palatine]] after losing the Battle of Seckenheim. He then began to build a new palace in modern [[Baden-Baden]]. [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] finally moved the residence of the margraves to Baden-Baden. This gradually ended the first period of Pforzheim's flourishment. The rich merchants gradually left the town, which declined to the status of a country town of mostly small traders. {{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist10}}{{ref|hist3}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1486:''' The ''Weavers Ordinance'' (''Wollweberordnung'') for the towns Pforzheim und [[Ettlingen]] was approved by [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]]. This was a contract concerning the town privileges of Pforzheim. This regulation of the weaving trade did not allow the formation of a regular [[guild]] (Zunft).{{ref|hist11}}{{ref|hist3}}\n\n'''1491:''' A contract between [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] and the citizens of Pforzheim was concluded, granting the town of Pforzheim several privileges concerning taxes and business.{{ref|hist11}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1496:''' Foundation of the first printer's shop by [[Thomas Anshelm]].

The single timber logs that were floated from the deeper Black Forest areas down the Enz, Nagold and Wuerm rivers were bound together in the Au area to form larger timber rafts. Those rafts were then floated down the lower Enz, Neckar and Rhine rivers. The timber rafting stations of Weissenstein, Dillstein and Pforzheim were well known in the profession.{{ref|hist12}}\n\n1501 was also the year for which an outbreak of the plague (probably the [[bubonic plague]]) is recorded in the [[Swabia]]n [[chronicle]] ''Annalium Suevicorum'' by [[Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen]] professor Martin Grusius, published 1596. It is not known how many of Pforzheim's citizens died in that year, but there are reports of 500 deceased in the close-by city of [[Calw]] and about 4000 in [[Stuttgart]], which accounted for approximately one quarter to one half of the populations of those towns. Outbreaks of the disease were reported for many places in southwestern Germany, [[Bohemia]], the [[Alsace]] region in nowadays France, Switzerland, and Italy. [[Mass grave|Common graves]] with massive numbers of human bones at the cemetery of St. Michael Church and the cemetery on the estate of the Dominican order near nowadays Waisenhausplatz found during the last century may indicate that hundreds of citizens became the victims of the plague. There are indications that a [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternity]] for taking care of the sick and removing the bodies of the deceased from houses was formed in 1501, whose members later on stayed together and became known as the [[choral society]] ''Singergesellschaft'', which is still active today as the ''Loebliche Singergesellschaft of 1501''.

He decided to use the Schlosskirche St. Michael as the entombment site for his family line.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1549:''' A large fire caused severe damage to the town.\n\n'''1556:''' After the conclusion of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, [[Margrave]] [[Karl II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Karl II]] introduced ''Lutherism'' ([[protestantism]]) as the state religion in the district [[Baden-Durlach]], which included Pforzheim. The (Catholic) monasteries were gradually shut down.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1565:''' Margrave Karl II chose Durlach as the new residential town. Pforzheim stayed one of the administrative centers of Baden.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1618''': At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the number of inhabitants of Pforzheim is estimated to have been between 2500 and 3000. This was the largest town among all towns in Baden, even though at that time it had already declined somewhat.\n[[File:pf meria.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Pforzheim in the early 17th century. It shows all significant landmarks including the city wall, the rivers Enz and Nagold, the three monastery churches and the Margrave's residence on Schlossberg hill.]]\n\n'''1645''': Toward the end of the Thirty Years' War the \"old town\" was burned down by [[Bavaria]]n (i.e. Catholic) troops. It was rebuilt, but without the former [[fortifications]], which gave it the status of a village-like settlement. It soon vanished from historical records. The \"new town\" had survived.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1688\u20131697:''' The \"[[War of the Palatinian Succession]]\" (also called the [[Nine Years War]]) caused tremendous destruction in Southwestern Germany. The French \"sun king\" [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s efforts to expand the territory of France up to the Upper Rhine river and to put the [[Elector Palatine]] under pressure to severe its ties with the [[League of Augsburg]] included the ''[[Br\u00fblez le Palatinat!]]'' tactics of destroying major towns on both sides of the Rhine river. These tactics seem to have been mainly the idea of the French war minister, Fran\u00e7ois Michel le Tellier, [[Marquis de Louvois]].\n\nPforzheim was occupied by French troops on 10 October 1688. Commanding officer is said to have been [[Joseph de Montclar]]. The town was forced to accommodate a large number of soldiers and had to pay a large amount of \"contributions\" to the French. When the army unit was about to depart early in the morning of 21 January 1689 (obviously because an army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had been approaching), they set many major buildings on fire, including the palais, the city hall, and vicarages. About 70 houses (i.e. one quarter of all houses) and part of the town's fortifications were reportedly destroyed.\n\nBetween 2 and 4 August, the French army under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras]] again crossed the Rhine river and began the destruction of major towns in Baden. On 10 August 1689, a French army unit under the command of General [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]] appeared in front of Pforzheims town gates, but this time the town refused to surrender. In response, the French army began shelling the town with cannons from the Rod hill located southwest of the town, and the several hundred soldiers of the German imperial command, who were defending the town, were forced to surrender. After a short period of looting, the French troops set the inner town area on fire on 15 August, which made that area uninhabitable for several weeks. Then the French moved on.\n\nDuring the following two years, French troops stayed away from Pforzheim, but the economic situation of the town was miserable. In addition to this, the reconstruction of the town and the repairs of the fortifications under the supervision of Johann Matthaeus Faulhaber, the chief construction officer of the Margraviate Baden, required a lot of efforts. The accommodation of an imperial garrison under the command of (then) colonel Count [[Palffy]] also was a heavy burden.\n\nIn 1691, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]] instructed his marshals to destroy those towns which were to serve as winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river under the command of Marshal [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]] at [[Philippsburg]] on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' residential town of [[Durlach]] and 1,200 [[cavalry]] men, 300 [[dragoons]] and 1,200 [[infantry]] men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.\n\nOn 20 September 1692, again crossed the Rhine river under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]], and advanced toward [[Durlach]] and Pforzheim. On 24 September, 2,000 cavalry soldiers and 1,200 infantry and artillery troops under the command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[No\u00ebl Bouton de Chamilly]], moved to Pforzheim, where the town and 600 soldiers of the imperial German army in town surrendered without any military engagements. The rest of the French army arrived on 27 September under the command of Marshal de Lorges. On the same day, the French army moved on to Oetisheim near [[M\u00fchlacker]] and attacked an imperial army unit of 4,000 cavalry men under the command of Duke [[Frederick Charles of W\u00fcrttemberg-Winnental]] in their camp. As they were taken by surprise, they withdrew hastily and lost several hundred men, either killed or captured by the French. (The Duke himself was among the French prisoners.) On 28 September, the French army returned to Pforzheim and established a camp. It was reported that the entire [[Enz]] valley between the village of Eutingen east of Pforzheim and the village of Birkenfeld west of Pforzheim was occupied by the 30,000 French soldiers' camps. From their base in Pforzheim, French army units obviously under the leadership of Marshal de Chamilly advanced along the river valleys of [[Nagold]] and [[W\u00fcrm (Nagold)|W\u00fcrm]] and looted and destroyed the villages and towns of Huchenfeld, [[Calw]], [[Hirsau]], [[Liebenzell]] and [[Zavelstein]]. They also destroyed [[Liebeneck castle]] about 10&nbsp;kilometres from Pforzheim towering above the W\u00fcrm valley, where part of the Pforzheim town archives were hidden. The archive was burned. Another part of the town archive as well as documents of Baden administrative office had been brought to Calw, where they went up in flames, too.\n\nWhen the French troops left after about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim and put it on fire. This time, all houses which had survived the two previous fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and a large part of the Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches' clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring's sowing season. Every tree and [[grape]]vine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood. The French army reached their camp in [[Philippsburg]] on 5 October 1692.{{ref|hist15}}\n\n===1700s===\n'''1718:''' Inauguration of the \"institution for orphans, the mad, the sick, for discipline and work\" in a building of the former [[Dominican order]] [[Convent]] by the Enz river.

The town was put on the target list for bombardments in November 1944 because it was thought by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to be producing precision instruments for use in the German war effort and as transport centre{{ref|station}} for the movement of German troops.{{ref|hist27}}\n\nThere were also several minor raids in 1944 and 1945.{{ref|hist26}}\n\nAfter the main attack, about 30,000 people had to be fed by makeshift public kitchens because their housing had been destroyed. Almost 90% of the buildings in the core city area had been destroyed. Many Pforzheim citizens were buried in mass graves at Pforzheim's main cemetery because they could not be identified. There are also many graves of complete families. Among the dead were several hundred foreigners who had been in Pforzheim as [[forced labor]] workers.\nThe inner-city districts were severely depopulated. According to the State Statistics Bureau (Statistisches Landesamt), in the Market Square area (Marktplatzviertel) in 1939 there were 4,112 registered inhabitants, in 1945 none (0). In the Old Town area (Altstadtviertel) in 1939 there were 5,109 inhabitants, in 1945 only 2 persons were still living there.

Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Wei\u00dfenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an [[armored vehicle]] unit) moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German [[infantry]] unit using [[artillery]]. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an [[Algeria]]n and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine [[Dorance]]. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the [[Volkssturm]]) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud residential town of the Baden Margraves.{{ref|hist24}}{{ref|hist25}}{{ref|hist1}}\n\nThe three months of French [[Military occupation|occupation]] were reportedly marked by hostile attitudes on both the French army side and the Pforzheim population side; incidents of rape and looting, mainly by Moroccan soldiers, were also reported.

This high population growth period coincided with the period of intensive [[industrialisation]] of Germany. Population growth weakened due to the effects of World War I and World War II. The population declined sharply due to the destruction on 23 February 1945, and increased sharply in the post-World War II era due to high economic growth levels in West-Germany and the rapid rebuilding efforts in Pforzheim. Earlier setbacks were recorded during the [[Thirty Years' War]] period in the 17th century.\n\n\n Largest immigrant groups by nationality (31.12.2018)\n\n{|\n|-\n|{{Flag|Turkey}}||4,952\n|-\n|{{Flag|Romania}}||4,129\n|-\n|{{Flag|Italy}}||3,939\n|-\n|{{Flag|Iraq}}||3,653\n|-\n|{{Flag|Croatia}}||2,173\n|-\n|{{Flag|Hungary}}||1,735\n|-\n|{{Flag|Poland}}||1,392\n|-\n|{{Flag|Syria}}||1,062\n|-\n|{{Flag|Portugal}}||993\n|-\n|{{Flag|Bulgaria}}||895\n|-\n|{{Flag|Kosovo}}||845\n|-\n|{{Flag|Serbia}}||754\n|-\n|{{Flag|Russia}}||710\n|-\n|{{Flag|Greece}}||691\n|-\n|{{Flag|Slovakia}}||397\n|-\n|{{Flag|Spain}}||332\n|-\n|{{Flag|North Macedonia}}||322\n|-\n|{{Flag|Ukraine}}||278\n|-\n|{{Flag|France}}||242\n|-\n|{{Flag|Vietnam}}||212\n|}\n\n===Religions===\nAfter margrave [[Karl II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Karl II of Baden]] in 1556 installed the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the [[Margraviate of Baden]], of which Pforzheim was the capital in those days, Pforzheim continued to be a Protestant town for several centuries. The congregations in Pforzheim were affiliated with the deanery (Dekanat) of Pforzheim of the Protestant [[National Church of Baden]], unless they were members of one of the independent churches ([[Freikirche]]).\n\nSince the 19th century at the latest [[Catholics]] settled in Pforzheim again. They are affiliated with the deanery of Pforzheim, which belongs to the [[Archdiocese of Freiburg]].\n\nOther denominations and religious sects in Pforzheim are:\n* [[Israelite Congregation]]\n* [[Islamic Congregation]]\n* [[Adventism|Adventist Congregation]]\n* [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]\n* [[Baptist Church]]\n* [[Salvation Army]]\n* [[Methodist Church]]\n* [[Church of Christ, Scientist]]{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n==Politics==\n\n===City council===\nThe city council of Pforzheim consists of the Lord Mayor as its president and 40 elected (part-time) councillors.

The city flag is white-blue.\n\nThe inclined bar can be traced back to the 13th century as the symbol of the lords (owners) of Pforzheim, which later on also became the National Coat of Arms of Baden, but its meaning is unknown. Since 1489 the coat of arms in its entire form can be verified, but its meaning is not known, either. Current coloring has been used only since 1853; in earlier times the coloring was different.{{ref|wikipedia}}{{ref|coat_of_arms}}\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\nPforzheim is one of the [[regional center]]s (Oberzentrum) in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] and has one of the highest densities of industrial activity in the state.\n\nPforzheim is historically an important jewelry and watch-making centre in Germany. Due to this reason, Pforzheim is nicknamed as Golden City. Jewelry and watch-making industry is first set up by [[Jean Fran\u00e7ois Autran]] after receiving an edict from then overlord [[Margrave Karl Friedrich von Baden]].<ref name=\"invest1\">{{cite web|author=Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.

Pforzheim accounts for just under 70 percent of the total sales of the German jewelry and silverware industry and around 80 percent of all the pieces of jewelry exported by Germany come from Pforzheim.\n\nHowever, a smaller fraction of the economy nowadays is dedicated to producing the traditional products of [[watches]] and [[jewellery]]. Only 11,000 people are employed in the jewelry and watch-making industries.<ref name=\"invest1\"/> Two thirds of all employment positions are made available in the areas of metal processing, dental industry electronics and [[electro-technology]]. The [[mail order]] companies (Bader, Klingel, Wenz) with their sales volumes in the order of millions of Euros occupies a leading position in Germany. [[Tourism]] is gaining importance. In this respect the city benefits from its favorable Three-Valleys location at the gateway to the Black Forest, and related to this, from the starting points of a large number of hiking, cycling and waterway routes. The [[European long-distance paths|European long-distance trail]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] passes through Pforzheim. It is also the starting point of the [[Black Forest Hiking Routes]] [[Westweg]], [[Mittelweg]] and [[Ostweg]].{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===Traffic===\nThe [[Bundesautobahn 8|Federal Freeway A8]] ([[Perl, Germany|Perl]]\u2013[[Bad Reichenhall]]) runs by just to the north of the city. The city can be accessed via four freeway exits. The [[Interstate Road B10]] ([[Lebach]]\u2013[[Augsburg]]) and [[B294]] ([[Gundelfingen]]\u2013[[Bretten]]) run through the city. The [[B463 Interstate Road]] running toward [[Nagold]] has its starting point here.\n\n[[Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) is located on the [[Karlsruhe\u2013M\u00fchlacker railway|Karlsruhe\u2013M\u00fchlacker line]], connecting to Stuttgart. In addition there are two railway lines into the [[Black Forest]]: the [[Enz Valley Railway]] to [[Bad Wildbad]] and the [[Nagold Valley Railway]] to Nagold. Pforzheim is connected to the [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Light Rail network]]. Other public transportation services in the city area are provided by buses of the [[Pforzheim Municipal Transport]], subsidiary of Veolia Transport Company (SVP) and several other transportation companies. They all offer unified fares within the framework of the ''Pforzheim-Enzkreis Verkehrsverbund''.\n\nBetween 1931 and 1968 a [[light rail]] connection existed between [[Ittersbach]] and Pforzheim, operated by Pforzheim Municipal Transportation Company (''SVP''). Before that (''since 1899'') the railroad belonged to the BLEAG (Baden Local Railway Inc., Badische-Lokaleisenbahn-Aktiengesellschaft). The only remaining [[light rail]] service \"S 5\" connecting Pforzheim to [[Bietigheim-Bissingen]], [[Karlsruhe]] and [[W\u00f6rth am Rhein]] is operated by [[Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft]] (Albtal Transportation Company), which since 2002 also operates the Enz Valley Light Rail route to Bad Wildbad.{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===Major local enterprises===\n* [[Wellendorff|Wellendorff Gold-Creationen GmbH & Co.

It was formed in 1992 by way of merging the former Pforzheim School of Design (Fachhochschule fuer Gestaltung) and Pforzheim Business School (Fachhochschule fuer Wirtschaft) and additionally establishing the Faculty of Engineering. The Pforzheim School of Design had its roots in the '''Ducal Academy of Arts and Crafts and Technical School for the Metal Processing Industry''', established 1877. The Pforzheim Business School was the successor institution of the '''National Business College''', which was established in 1963. The campuses of the Faculty of Design and the Faculties of Economics and Engineering are located at separate sites in the city area. The '''Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences''' fosters international exchange. Among other relationships, it is affiliated with the NIEBES Association and has close academic ties to [[Osijek]] University of [[Croatia]] and academic exchange programs with many institutions abroad, among them [[Auburn University]], the [[University of Wyoming]], [[Brigham Young University]] and the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], in Chicago, of the United States of America.\n* The '''Goldsmith and Watchmaking Vocational School''' is the one of the two schools of its kind in Europe. It is attended by many students from abroad.\n* The general qualification for university admission (Abitur) can be obtained through an education at the '''[[Reuchlin-Gymnasium|Reuchlin-Highschool]]''', the '''Kepler-Highschool''', the '''Hebel-Highschool''', the '''Theodor-Heuss-Highschool''', the '''Hilda-Highschool''', the '''Schiller-Highschool''', the '''Fritz-Erler-Highschool''' (economics-oriented highschool), the '''Heinrich-Wieland-Highschool''' (technology-oriented highschool), the '''Johanna-Wittum-Highschool''' (home economics-oriented highschool), as well as the '''Waldorfschule'''.\n* Pforzheim also has many schools providing the mandatory general elementary and secondary education ('''Grundschule''', '''Realschule''') as well an institution which is dedicated to further education of grown-ups ('''Volkshochschule''').

([[Talk:Pforzheim]] Draft of text: On the reason for the Pforzheim bombardment.)\n# {{note|station}} Pforzheim is situated in a valley and also spread out across the adjacent hill slopes. On the northern slope there is a level, narrow plateau that is about 100&nbsp;meters wide and about 2&nbsp;kilometers in length. The railway facilities, including the main station and what used to be the freight loading facilities, are located on this plateau. This is the only level space that can possibly be used for railway facilities there. If the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] would have been only aiming at destroying the railway facilities, a few aircraft would have sufficed to finish this job in a short time. There was no need to bomb an area that was wider than one kilometer ({{convert|1|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) and had a length of more than three kilometers ({{convert|3|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) using more than 360 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]], as was the case in the big raid on 23 February. The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the map showing the destroyed city area. (refer to [[#References|References]] Map of destroyed town area). And besides that, the area bombardment obviously was not even effective in destroying the railway facilities, because less than one month after the big raid in mid-March the railway facilities were bombed again several times by the [[USAF]], this time focussing mainly on the suspected military target, not civilian estates (refer to [[#References|References]] Pforzheimer Zeitung of 4 March 2005).\n# {{note|council}} [[#References|References]] Web page of the City of Pforzheim: City Council; in German.\n# {{note|admin}} [[#References|References]] Web page of the City of Pforzheim: City Administration; in German.\n# {{note|coat_of_arms}} [[#References|References]] Hans-Peter Becht: Pforzheim im Mittelalter, chapter \"Wappen und Siegel der Stadt Pforzheim\". pp.&nbsp;221\u2013238.\n# {{note|wikipedia}} The core of this section was translated from the corresponding section of the article about Pforzheim in the [[#References|References]] German language Wikipedia, as of May 2005.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Pforzheim}}\n{{wikivoyage|Pforzheim}}\n* [https://www.pforzheim.de/ Homepage of the city administration]\n* {{Wikisource-inline|list=\n** {{Cite Americana|wstitle=Pforzheim|short=x |noicon=x}}\n** {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Pforzheim|short=x |noicon=x}}\n** {{Cite Nuttall|wstitle=Pforzheim|short=x |noicon=x}}\n** {{Cite NIE|wstitle=Pforzheim|year=1905|short=x |noicon=x}}\n** {{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Pforzheim|short=x |noicon=x}}\n}}\n\n{{Cities in Germany}}\n{{Germany districts Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Pforzheim| ]]\n[[Category:Karlsruhe (region)]]\n[[Category:Cities in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n[[Category:Holocaust locations in Germany]]\n[[Category:Baden]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2017}}\n{{citation style|date=January 2013}}\n{{Infobox German location\n|type               = Stadt\n|image_coa          = Wappen Pforzheim.svg\n|image_photo        = Panorama Nagold, Stadtkirche und Enz (1).jpg\n|coordinates        = {{coord|48|53|42|N|08|42|18|E|display=inline,title}}\n|Karte              = Karte pforzheim in deutschland.png \n|image_plan         = \n|state              = Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n|region             = Karlsruhe\n|district           = Stadtkreis\n|elevation          = 273\n|area               = 98.03\n|population         = 119156<!-- Please do not update manually/Bitte nicht per Hand aktualisieren: [[Wikipedia:WikiProjekt Kommunen und Landkreise in Deutschland/Einwohnerzahlen]] -->\n|Stand              = 2006-12-31\n|postal_code        = 75172\u201375181\n|PLZ-alt            = 7530\n|area_code          = 07231, 07234, 07041\n|licence            = PF\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel  = 08 2 31 000\n|LOCODE             = DE PFO\n|divisions          = 16 [[Stadtteil]]e\n|Adresse            = Marktplatz 1<br />75175 Pforzheim\n|website            = [https://www.pforzheim.de/ www.pforzheim.de]\n|mayor              = [[Peter Boch]]\n|B\u00fcrgermeistertitel = Oberb\u00fcrgermeister\n|party              = [[Christliche Demokratische Union Deutschland|CDU]]\n}}\n\n'''Pforzheim''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8pf\u0254\u0281tsha\u026am|-|Pforzheim.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] of over 120,000 inhabitants in the federal state of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], in the southwest of [[Germany]]. It is known for its jewelry and watch-making industry, and as such has gained the nickname \"Goldstadt\" (\"Golden City\"). With an area of 97.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (38&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), it is situated between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]] at the confluence of three rivers ([[Enz]], [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] and [[W\u00fcrm (Nagold)|W\u00fcrm]]). It marks the frontier between [[Baden]] and [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the [[Margraves of Baden]]-Pforzheim.\n\nThe City of Pforzheim does not belong to any administrative district (''Kreis''), although it hosts the administrative offices of the [[Enz (district)|Enz]] district that surrounds the town.\n\nDuring World War II, Pforzheim was bombed by the Allies a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating [[area bombardment]]s of World War II, was carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town's population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops. The story of the bombardment is dramatically recounted in the history by [[Giles Milton]], titled ''[[Giles Milton#Non-fiction|Wolfram: The Boy Who Went To War]]'' (2011).\n\nIn the twenty years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the postwar period and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.\n\n==Geography==\nPforzheim is located at the northern rim of the eastern part of the [[Black Forest]] (Schwarzwald) and the rim of the hilly country of the [[Kraichgau]], in an open valley at the confluences of the rivers [[W\u00fcrm]] and [[Nagold]] and the rivers Nagold and [[Enz]]. Due to its location, this city is also called the \"three-valleys town\" (''Drei-T\u00e4ler Stadt'') or the \"Gateway to the Black Forest\" (''Pforte zum Schwarzwald / Porta Hercynia'').\n\nPforzheim and its surrounding area belongs to the \"Densely Populated Area Karlsruhe/Pforzheim\". Pforzheim has the functions of a regional center (Mittelzentrum) for the towns and municipalities [[Birkenfeld (Enz)]], [[Eisingen]], [[Engelsbrand]],\n[[Friolzheim]], [[Heimsheim]], [[Ispringen]], [[K\u00e4mpfelbach]], [[Keltern]], [[Kieselbronn]], [[K\u00f6nigsbach-Stein]], [[M\u00f6nsheim]], [[Neuenb\u00fcrg]], [[Neuhausen (Enz)|Neuhausen]], [[Neulingen]], [[Niefern-\u00d6schelbronn]], [[\u00d6lbronn-D\u00fcrrn]], [[Remchingen]], [[Straubenhardt]], [[Tiefenbronn]], [[Wiernsheim]], [[Wimsheim]] and [[Wurmberg]].{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===Neighbouring communities===\nThe following towns and communities share borderlines with the City of Pforzheim. Below they are mentioned in clockwise order, beginning to the north of the city. Except for Unterreichenbach, which belongs to the district of [[Calw (district)|Calw]], all of them are included in the [[Enz (district)|Enz]] district.\n\n[[Ispringen]], [[Neulingen]], [[Kieselbronn]], [[Niefern-\u00d6schelbronn]], [[Wurmberg]], [[Wimsheim]], [[Friolzheim]], [[Tiefenbronn]], [[Neuhausen (Enz)]], [[Unterreichenbach]], [[Engelsbrand]], [[Birkenfeld (Enz)]], [[Keltern (Baden)|Keltern]] and [[K\u00e4mpfelbach]]{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===City wards===\nThe city of Pforzheim consists of '''16 city wards'''.

These colonists constructed a [[Ford (river)|ford]] through the river, shortly past the confluence of the three rivers, for their military highway. Due to this strategic location, Pforzheim later became a center for the [[timber rafting|timber-rafting]] trade, which transported timber from the Black Forest via the rivers Wuerm, Nagold, Enz and down the [[Neckar]] and [[Rhine]] to, among other markets, the Netherlands for use in shipbuilding. Their timbers were also used to construct the foundations for [[Amsterdam]], which was built in a swamp.\n\n'''Since 90:''' A settlement was established by Roman citizens at the Enz River near the modern ''Altst\u00e4dter Br\u00fccke'' (old town bridge). Archeological surveys have unearthed several artifacts of that period which are kept and displayed in the Kappelhof Museum. The settlement was located where the Roman military road connecting the military camp [[Argentoratum]] (nowadays [[Strasbourg]] in France) and the military camp at [[Cannstatt]] (now a suburb of [[Stuttgart]]) at the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] crossed the [[Enz]] river. This place was known as ''Portus'' (meaning \"river crossing, harbor\"), which is believed to be the origin of the first part of the city's name \"Pforzheim\". A Roman milestone (the so-called 'Leugenstein') from the year 245 was excavated in modern times at present-day [[Friolzheim]]; it is marked with the exact distance to 'Portus' and is the first documented evidence of the settlement.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist6}}\n\n'''259/260''': The Roman settlement 'Portus' was destroyed completely, as the [[Franks|Frank]] and [[Alemanni]] tribes overran the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] and conquered the Roman administered area west of the [[Rhine]] River. From then on, over an extended period of time, historical records about the settlement were not available.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''6th/7th century''': Graves from this period indicate that the settlement had been continued.{{ref|hist2}}\n\n'''1067:''' The settlement was mentioned as \"Phorzheim\" for the first time, in a document by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Visits to Pforzheim by Heinrich IV in 1067 and 1074 are documented.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist2}}\n\n'''Before 1080:''' The \"old town\" of Pforzheim was awarded [[market rights]] (''Marktrecht''). At that time Pforzheim belonged to the estate of [[Hirsau]] [[Monastery]], according to monastery documents.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''From 1150:''' Establishment of the \"new town\" west of the \"old town\" at the foot of the Schlossberg (palais hill) under Margrave [[Hermann V, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Hermann V]].{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1200:''' The town charter of the \"new town\" was mentioned for the first time in a document.

This resulted in the \"new town\" becoming prominent.\n\n'''1240:''' A mayor of Pforzheim was mentioned in a document for the first time.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''13th/14th century:''' Pforzheim enjoyed its first period of flourishing. A group of influential [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] emerged. They developed the financial markets of those days. The town drew its income from the wood trade, [[timber rafting]], the [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] trade, [[textile]] manufacturing, and other crafts. Documents mention ''mayor, judge, council and citizens''. The town walls surrounding the new town were completed about 1290. During this era, three [[Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Orders|orders]] established their [[convents]] in town (the [[Franciscan]] order established their domicile within the town wall at present-day ''Barfuesserkirche'' (the choir of which remains), the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[nun|sisters]] order established their domicile outside the walls of the old town near Auer Bridge, and the Prediger cloister was located east of the Schlossberg, probably inside the town walls). Outside the town wall and across the Enz river, the suburb ''Fl\u00f6sser Quarters'' (the home of the timber-floating trade) was established. Next to the western town wall, the suburb of ''Br\u00f6tzingen'' gradually developed. The Margraves of Baden considered Pforzheim as their most important power base up to the first half of the 14th century. Under Margrave [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I), Pforzheim became one of the administrative centers of the margraviate.{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist3}}{{ref|hist14}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n'''1322:''' Holy Ghost Hospital was founded at Tr\u00e4nk Street (present-day Deimling Street).{{ref|hist4}}\n\n'''15th century:''' Various [[Guild|fraternities]], also known as guilds, among people working in the same trade were established: The fraternity of [[tailor]]s in 1410, the fraternity of [[baker]]s on 14 May 1422, the fraternity of the [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] in 1469, the fraternity of the [[wine-grower]]s in 1491, the fraternity of the [[skipper (boating)|skippers]] and [[timber raftsmen]] in 1501, and the fraternity of the [[carting business|carters]] in 1512. Members of the same fraternity assisted each other in various ways, for example with [[funerals]] and in cases of sickness. In a sense, the fraternities were early forms of health and [[life insurance]].{{ref|hist4}}\n\n''' 8\u20139 August 1418:''' [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] visits [[Margrave]] [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I) in Pforzheim. On this occasion the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] of the Margraves of Baden in Pforzheim was mentioned. Mint master was Jakob Broeglin between 1414\u20131431. The emperor appointed the master of the Pforzheim mint, Jakob Br\u00f6glin, and Bois von der Winterbach for five years as Royal Mint Masters of the mints of [[Frankfurt]] and [[N\u00f6rdlingen]]. The Margrave was appointed as their patron.{{ref|hist5}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n'''1447:''' The wedding of [[Margrave]] [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles I]] (Karl I) of Baden with [[Katharina]] of Austria, the sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Friedrich III), was celebrated in Pforzheim with great pomp (including [[tournaments]] and [[dances]]).{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist7}}{{ref|hist12}}{{ref|hist13}}\n\n[[File:Reuchlin-Gymnasium Pforzheim.jpg|thumb|''Reuchlin-Gymnasium'' (Reuchlin-Highschool) today near the water tower]]\n'''1455:''' [[Johannes Reuchlin]], the great German [[Humanism|humanist]], was born in Pforzheim on 29 January (he died in Stuttgart on 30 June 1522). He attended the [[Latin school|Latin School]] section of the monastery school run by the Dominican order of Pforzheim in the late 1460s. Later, partly due to Reuchlin's efforts, the [[Latin school|Latin School]] of Pforzheim developed into one of the most prominent schools in southwestern Germany, named ''[[Reuchlin-Gymnasium]]''. The school's teachers and pupils played an outstanding role in the dissemination of the ideas of [[humanism]] and the [[protestant reformation]] movement. The most famous pupils included Reuchlin himself, Reuchlin's nephew [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Simon Grynaeus]].{{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist8}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1460:''' Margrave Charles I established a kind of monastery (Kollegialstift) at the site of Schlosskirche St. Michael, turning the church into a [[collegiate church]]. There were also plans to establish a university in Pforzheim, but this plan had to be abandoned because Margrave Charles I lost the [[Battle of Seckenheim]].{{ref|hist9}}{{ref|hist10}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1463:''' Margrave Charles I was forced to transfer the palace and the town of Pforzheim as a [[fiefdom]] to the [[Elector Palatine]] after losing the Battle of Seckenheim. He then began to build a new palace in modern [[Baden-Baden]]. [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] finally moved the residence of the margraves to Baden-Baden. This gradually ended the first period of Pforzheim's flourishment. The rich merchants gradually left the town, which declined to the status of a country town of mostly small traders. {{ref|hist1}}{{ref|hist10}}{{ref|hist3}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1486:''' The ''Weavers Ordinance'' (''Wollweberordnung'') for the towns Pforzheim und [[Ettlingen]] was approved by [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]]. This was a contract concerning the town privileges of Pforzheim. This regulation of the weaving trade did not allow the formation of a regular [[guild]] (Zunft).{{ref|hist11}}{{ref|hist3}}\n\n'''1491:''' A contract between [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] and the citizens of Pforzheim was concluded, granting the town of Pforzheim several privileges concerning taxes and business.{{ref|hist11}}{{ref|hist12}}\n\n'''1496:''' Foundation of the first printer's shop by [[Thomas Anshelm]]. During the first half of the 16th century Pforzheim's printers contributed significantly to the establishment of this (in those days) new medium.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1501''': [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] enacted the \"[[local ordinance|Ordinance]] on the timber rafting profession in Pforzheim\". The single timber logs that were floated from the deeper Black Forest areas down the Enz, Nagold and Wuerm rivers were bound together in the Au area to form larger timber rafts. Those rafts were then floated down the lower Enz, Neckar and Rhine rivers. The timber rafting stations of Weissenstein, Dillstein and Pforzheim were well known in the profession.{{ref|hist12}}\n\n1501 was also the year for which an outbreak of the plague (probably the [[bubonic plague]]) is recorded in the [[Swabia]]n [[chronicle]] ''Annalium Suevicorum'' by [[Eberhard Karls University of T\u00fcbingen]] professor Martin Grusius, published 1596. It is not known how many of Pforzheim's citizens died in that year, but there are reports of 500 deceased in the close-by city of [[Calw]] and about 4000 in [[Stuttgart]], which accounted for approximately one quarter to one half of the populations of those towns. Outbreaks of the disease were reported for many places in southwestern Germany, [[Bohemia]], the [[Alsace]] region in nowadays France, Switzerland, and Italy. [[Mass grave|Common graves]] with massive numbers of human bones at the cemetery of St. Michael Church and the cemetery on the estate of the Dominican order near nowadays Waisenhausplatz found during the last century may indicate that hundreds of citizens became the victims of the plague. There are indications that a [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternity]] for taking care of the sick and removing the bodies of the deceased from houses was formed in 1501, whose members later on stayed together and became known as the [[choral society]] ''Singergesellschaft'', which is still active today as the ''Loebliche Singergesellschaft of 1501''. (They are probably one of the oldest clubs in Europe).{{ref|hist4}}\n\n'''1520s:''' The ideas of the [[protestant]] [[religious]] movement advanced by [[Martin Luther]] spread rapidly in Pforzheim. Its most prominent promoters were Johannes Schwebel, a preacher at Holy Ghost church (Heiliggeistkirche), and Johannes Unger, the principal of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[Latin school]].{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1535\u20131565:''' Due to the [[inheritance|heritage]] division of the clan of the Margraves of Baden, [[Margrave]] [[Ernest, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Ernst of Baden]] made Pforzheim the residential town of his family line. He decided to use the Schlosskirche St. Michael as the entombment site for his family line.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1549:''' A large fire caused severe damage to the town.\n\n'''1556:''' After the conclusion of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, [[Margrave]] [[Karl II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Karl II]] introduced ''Lutherism'' ([[protestantism]]) as the state religion in the district [[Baden-Durlach]], which included Pforzheim. The (Catholic) monasteries were gradually shut down.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1565:''' Margrave Karl II chose Durlach as the new residential town. Pforzheim stayed one of the administrative centers of Baden.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1618''': At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the number of inhabitants of Pforzheim is estimated to have been between 2500 and 3000. This was the largest town among all towns in Baden, even though at that time it had already declined somewhat.\n[[File:pf meria.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Pforzheim in the early 17th century. It shows all significant landmarks including the city wall, the rivers Enz and Nagold, the three monastery churches and the Margrave's residence on Schlossberg hill.]]\n\n'''1645''': Toward the end of the Thirty Years' War the \"old town\" was burned down by [[Bavaria]]n (i.e. Catholic) troops. It was rebuilt, but without the former [[fortifications]], which gave it the status of a village-like settlement. It soon vanished from historical records. The \"new town\" had survived.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1688\u20131697:''' The \"[[War of the Palatinian Succession]]\" (also called the [[Nine Years War]]) caused tremendous destruction in Southwestern Germany. The French \"sun king\" [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s efforts to expand the territory of France up to the Upper Rhine river and to put the [[Elector Palatine]] under pressure to severe its ties with the [[League of Augsburg]] included the ''[[Br\u00fblez le Palatinat!]]'' tactics of destroying major towns on both sides of the Rhine river. These tactics seem to have been mainly the idea of the French war minister, Fran\u00e7ois Michel le Tellier, [[Marquis de Louvois]].\n\nPforzheim was occupied by French troops on 10 October 1688. Commanding officer is said to have been [[Joseph de Montclar]]. The town was forced to accommodate a large number of soldiers and had to pay a large amount of \"contributions\" to the French. When the army unit was about to depart early in the morning of 21 January 1689 (obviously because an army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had been approaching), they set many major buildings on fire, including the palais, the city hall, and vicarages. About 70 houses (i.e. one quarter of all houses) and part of the town's fortifications were reportedly destroyed.\n\nBetween 2 and 4 August, the French army under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras]] again crossed the Rhine river and began the destruction of major towns in Baden. On 10 August 1689, a French army unit under the command of General [[Ez\u00e9chiel du Mas, Comte de M\u00e9lac]] appeared in front of Pforzheims town gates, but this time the town refused to surrender. In response, the French army began shelling the town with cannons from the Rod hill located southwest of the town, and the several hundred soldiers of the German imperial command, who were defending the town, were forced to surrender. After a short period of looting, the French troops set the inner town area on fire on 15 August, which made that area uninhabitable for several weeks. Then the French moved on.\n\nDuring the following two years, French troops stayed away from Pforzheim, but the economic situation of the town was miserable. In addition to this, the reconstruction of the town and the repairs of the fortifications under the supervision of Johann Matthaeus Faulhaber, the chief construction officer of the Margraviate Baden, required a lot of efforts. The accommodation of an imperial garrison under the command of (then) colonel Count [[Palffy]] also was a heavy burden.\n\nIn 1691, [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]] instructed his marshals to destroy those towns which were to serve as winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river under the command of Marshal [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]] at [[Philippsburg]] on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' residential town of [[Durlach]] and 1,200 [[cavalry]] men, 300 [[dragoons]] and 1,200 [[infantry]] men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.\n\nOn 20 September 1692, again crossed the Rhine river under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]], and advanced toward [[Durlach]] and Pforzheim. On 24 September, 2,000 cavalry soldiers and 1,200 infantry and artillery troops under the command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[No\u00ebl Bouton de Chamilly]], moved to Pforzheim, where the town and 600 soldiers of the imperial German army in town surrendered without any military engagements. The rest of the French army arrived on 27 September under the command of Marshal de Lorges. On the same day, the French army moved on to Oetisheim near [[M\u00fchlacker]] and attacked an imperial army unit of 4,000 cavalry men under the command of Duke [[Frederick Charles of W\u00fcrttemberg-Winnental]] in their camp. As they were taken by surprise, they withdrew hastily and lost several hundred men, either killed or captured by the French. (The Duke himself was among the French prisoners.) On 28 September, the French army returned to Pforzheim and established a camp. It was reported that the entire [[Enz]] valley between the village of Eutingen east of Pforzheim and the village of Birkenfeld west of Pforzheim was occupied by the 30,000 French soldiers' camps. From their base in Pforzheim, French army units obviously under the leadership of Marshal de Chamilly advanced along the river valleys of [[Nagold]] and [[W\u00fcrm (Nagold)|W\u00fcrm]] and looted and destroyed the villages and towns of Huchenfeld, [[Calw]], [[Hirsau]], [[Liebenzell]] and [[Zavelstein]]. They also destroyed [[Liebeneck castle]] about 10&nbsp;kilometres from Pforzheim towering above the W\u00fcrm valley, where part of the Pforzheim town archives were hidden. The archive was burned. Another part of the town archive as well as documents of Baden administrative office had been brought to Calw, where they went up in flames, too.\n\nWhen the French troops left after about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim and put it on fire. This time, all houses which had survived the two previous fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and a large part of the Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches' clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring's sowing season. Every tree and [[grape]]vine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood.

It was carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945.{{ref|hist1}} About one quarter of the town's population, over 17,000 people, was killed in the air raid,{{ref|hist18}} and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed.{{ref|hist19}} The mission order to bomb Pforzheim issued by [[RAF Bomber Command]] states as the intention of the raid on Pforzheim \"to destroy built up area and associated industries and rail facilities\".{{ref|hist18}} The bombardment was carried out as part of the British [[carpet bombing]] campaign. The town was put on the target list for bombardments in November 1944 because it was thought by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to be producing precision instruments for use in the German war effort and as transport centre{{ref|station}} for the movement of German troops.{{ref|hist27}}\n\nThere were also several minor raids in 1944 and 1945.{{ref|hist26}}\n\nAfter the main attack, about 30,000 people had to be fed by makeshift public kitchens because their housing had been destroyed. Almost 90% of the buildings in the core city area had been destroyed. Many Pforzheim citizens were buried in mass graves at Pforzheim's main cemetery because they could not be identified. There are also many graves of complete families. Among the dead were several hundred foreigners who had been in Pforzheim as [[forced labor]] workers.\nThe inner-city districts were severely depopulated. According to the State Statistics Bureau (Statistisches Landesamt), in the Market Square area (Marktplatzviertel) in 1939 there were 4,112 registered inhabitants, in 1945 none (0). In the Old Town area (Altstadtviertel) in 1939 there were 5,109 inhabitants, in 1945 only 2 persons were still living there. In the Leopold Square area, in 1939 there were 4,416 inhabitants, in 1945 only 13.{{ref|hist20}}{{ref|hist21}}{{ref|hist22}}\n\nThe German Army Report of 24 February 1945 devoted only two lines to reporting the bombardment: \"In the early evening hours of February 23, a forceful British attack was directed at Pforzheim.\" [[RAF Bomber Command]] later assessed the bombing raid as the one with \"probably the greatest proportion (of destroyed built-up area) (of any target) in one raid during the war\".{{ref|hist23}}\n\nIn early April as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and notably the [[French Army]] advanced toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders to destroy the electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but citizens succeeded in persuading the [[staff sergeant]] in charge of the operation to refrain from this absurd endeavor in the face of the imminent and inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Wei\u00dfenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuze]] wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an [[armored vehicle]] unit) moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German [[infantry]] unit using [[artillery]]. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an [[Algeria]]n and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine [[Dorance]]. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the [[Volkssturm]]) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud residential town of the Baden Margraves.{{ref|hist24}}{{ref|hist25}}{{ref|hist1}}\n\nThe three months of French [[Military occupation|occupation]] were reportedly marked by hostile attitudes on both the French army side and the Pforzheim population side; incidents of rape and looting, mainly by Moroccan soldiers, were also reported. Au Bridge (Auerbruecke) and Wuerm Bridge received makeshift repairs by the French military. The [[United States Army|US Army]], which replaced the French troops on 8 July 1945, helped repair Goethe Bridge, Benckiser Bridge, Old Town Bridge (Altst\u00e4dterbr\u00fccke) and Horse Bridge (Ro\u00dfbr\u00fccke) in 1945 and the following year. The relationship between the population and the US military was reportedly more relaxed than had been the case with the French army.{{ref|hist25}}{{ref|hist1}}\n\n====Post-World War II====\n'''1945\u20131965:''' Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt, giving Pforzheim a quite modern look. In September 1951 the Northern Town Bridge (Nordstadtbr\u00fccke) was inaugurated (the ceremony was attended by then Federal President Prof. Dr. [[Theodor Heuss]]).

Across the town between Buechenbronn ward and the village of Wurmberg the storm caused severe damage to forest areas (i.e. most trees fell to the ground). During the first night and the following days the soldiers of the French 3rd Husar Regiment and the US Army Unit, which were still stationed at the Buckenberg Barracks, helped clear the streets of a lot of fallen trees (especially in the Buckenberg/Haidach area). It took about four weeks to carry out the most necessary repairs on buildings. The overhead electric contact wires for the electric [[tram|trolley]] buses then still operating in town and the [[streetcar]] transport system to the village of Ittersbach were never repaired; those transport systems were retired.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1971\u20131975:''' The townships of W\u00fcrm, Hohenwart, Buechenbronn, Huchenfeld and Eutingen were incorporated into the city administration.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1973:''' Inauguration of the new Pforzheim City Hall.{{ref|hist1}}\n\n'''1973''' As part of the reform of administrative districts, the rural district of Pforzheim was incorporated into the newly established [[Enz (district)|Enz]] rural district, which has its administration in Pforzheim.

This high population growth period coincided with the period of intensive [[industrialisation]] of Germany. Population growth weakened due to the effects of World War I and World War II. The population declined sharply due to the destruction on 23 February 1945, and increased sharply in the post-World War II era due to high economic growth levels in West-Germany and the rapid rebuilding efforts in Pforzheim.

Pforzheim accounts for just under 70 percent of the total sales of the German jewelry and silverware industry and around 80 percent of all the pieces of jewelry exported by Germany come from Pforzheim.\n\nHowever, a smaller fraction of the economy nowadays is dedicated to producing the traditional products of [[watches]] and [[jewellery]]. Only 11,000 people are employed in the jewelry and watch-making industries.<ref name=\"invest1\"/> Two thirds of all employment positions are made available in the areas of metal processing, dental industry electronics and [[electro-technology]]. The [[mail order]] companies (Bader, Klingel, Wenz) with their sales volumes in the order of millions of Euros occupies a leading position in Germany. [[Tourism]] is gaining importance. In this respect the city benefits from its favorable Three-Valleys location at the gateway to the Black Forest, and related to this, from the starting points of a large number of hiking, cycling and waterway routes. The [[European long-distance paths|European long-distance trail]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] passes through Pforzheim. It is also the starting point of the [[Black Forest Hiking Routes]] [[Westweg]], [[Mittelweg]] and [[Ostweg]].{{ref|wikipedia}}\n\n===Traffic===\nThe [[Bundesautobahn 8|Federal Freeway A8]] ([[Perl, Germany|Perl]]\u2013[[Bad Reichenhall]]) runs by just to the north of the city. The city can be accessed via four freeway exits. The [[Interstate Road B10]] ([[Lebach]]\u2013[[Augsburg]]) and [[B294]] ([[Gundelfingen]]\u2013[[Bretten]]) run through the city. The [[B463 Interstate Road]] running toward [[Nagold]] has its starting point here.\n\n[[Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) is located on the [[Karlsruhe\u2013M\u00fchlacker railway|Karlsruhe\u2013M\u00fchlacker line]], connecting to Stuttgart. In addition there are two railway lines into the [[Black Forest]]: the [[Enz Valley Railway]] to [[Bad Wildbad]] and the [[Nagold Valley Railway]] to Nagold. Pforzheim is connected to the [[Stadtbahn Karlsruhe|Karlsruhe Light Rail network]]. Other public transportation services in the city area are provided by buses of the [[Pforzheim Municipal Transport]], subsidiary of Veolia Transport Company (SVP) and several other transportation companies.

([[Talk:Pforzheim]] Draft of text: On the reason for the Pforzheim bombardment.)\n# {{note|station}} Pforzheim is situated in a valley and also spread out across the adjacent hill slopes. On the northern slope there is a level, narrow plateau that is about 100&nbsp;meters wide and about 2&nbsp;kilometers in length. The railway facilities, including the main station and what used to be the freight loading facilities, are located on this plateau. This is the only level space that can possibly be used for railway facilities there. If the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] would have been only aiming at destroying the railway facilities, a few aircraft would have sufficed to finish this job in a short time. There was no need to bomb an area that was wider than one kilometer ({{convert|1|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) and had a length of more than three kilometers ({{convert|3|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) using more than 360 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]], as was the case in the big raid on 23 February. The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the map showing the destroyed city area.

During his career, he played for [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]], [[Internazionale]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[RAEC Mons]], as well as the [[Italian national football team|Italy Under-21 national team]], whom he represented in the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early career===\nPistone was born in [[Milan]], Italy. He started his career at [[Solbiatese Arno Calcio|Solbiatese]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|AC Crevalcore|it|3=Associazione Calcio Crevalcore}}, two small Italian teams who in recent years have slid to the lowest tier of professional Italian football, before moving to [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] for the duration of the 1995\u201396 season. Whilst at Vicenza, Pistone caught the eye of [[Roy Hodgson]], who was manager of [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] at that time.\n\n===Internazionale===\nPistone transferred to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] for the 1996\u201397 season, fulfilling a childhood ambition by signing for his home town club. By now an Under-21 international, Pistone made 45 appearances for Inter. Pistone also featured in the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final]], which Inter lost to [[Schalke 04]].\n\n===Newcastle United===\nAfter an impressive single season at Internazionale, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] signed Pistone for a fee of \u00a34.5 million in July 1997. Despite primarily being a full-back, Pistone made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday as a central defender (a position which he appeared in on a number of occasions in his first season with the Magpies). Pistone played in the [[1998 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], which Newcastle United lost.\n\nAfter only two games into his second season with the club, Pistone was injured whilst playing away at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. This game proved to be Dalglish's last for Newcastle United, and he was subsequently sacked, Pistone was subsequently frozen out of the team by Dalglish's replacement, [[Ruud Gullit]]. Pistone was not allocated a squad number and was forced to train with the reserve team, along with former club captain [[Rob Lee]]. During this time, Pistone was sent out on loan to [[S.S.C. Venezia|Venezia]] for four months, where he made 10 appearances. However, after Gullit was sacked, Pistone was restored to the first team by new manager [[Bobby Robson]],<ref>{{cite news |date=21 November 1999 |url=http://www.nufc.com/html/times_pistone.html |title=Alessandro Pistone \u2013 Interview |publisher=The Times |accessdate=2 June 2008}}</ref> and once again became a first team regular.\n\nIn his time at Newcastle he scored one league goal, against Middlesbrough in May 2000, in what proved to be his penultimate appearance for the club.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/03/match.sport1 |title=Festa has final word in Tyne-Tees drama |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=2 May 2000 |accessdate=9 November 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Wardle}}</ref>\n\n===Everton===\nIn July 2000, Pistone was transferred to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a fee in the region of \u00a33 million. He appeared in the first match of the 2000\u201301 season before being beset by a succession of injuries (including a six-month layoff for a knee injury). As a result, Pistone only managed to make 8 appearances for the Toffees during his first season.\n\nThroughout the 2001-02 season, Pistone again suffered a major injury, which resulted in him missing most of the campaign. However, during the 2001-02 season Pistone did score his first goal for the club against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1900942.stm |title=Everton leave Bolton struggling |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nPistone overcame a succession of injuries, and he featured in the vast majority of Everton's games throughout the 2004-05 season. However, his contract was due to expire at the end of this season, and with manager [[David Moyes]] having doubts about Pistone's ability to remain injury-free, he was only offered a one-year contract. Pistone refused to sign, and looked to be heading out of Goodison Park at the end of the 2004-05 season. However, with Everton qualifying for the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the 2005-06 season, the club were short of defensive cover. As such, he was subsequently offered a new two-year contract, to which he agreed.\n\nPistone returned to Everton's first-team line up for the 2005\u201306 season. However, he only managed to feature in 3 games before suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury, ending his season prematurely. Following this, Pistone failed to make a further first-team appearance for Everton, and did not feature at all during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.\n\nAfter making 103 appearance for Everton in 7 years, Pistone was eventually released by the club on 14 May 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/6655123.stm |title=Everton release Pistone & Wright |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Free agent===\nAfter being released by Everton, on 31 August 2007 it was confirmed by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Gareth Southgate]] that Pistone was having a trial at the Premier League club and, as Pistone was a free agent, he could be signed after the transfer deadline, giving Southgate more time to decide. It was reported on 9 September 2007 that Southgate had decided against offering Pistone a contract.\n\nPistone also went on trial with Championship side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] but he could not convince [[Aidy Boothroyd]] to offer him a contract.<ref>http://www.watford.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=83675</ref>\n\n===RAEC Mons===\nAfter failing to secure a contract with a club in England, Pistone spent a week on trial with Belgian club [[R.A.E.C. Mons|RAEC Mons]]. After impressing manager [[Geo Van Pyperzeele]], Pistone signed for the club on 6 December 2007 until the end of the season, and was given the number 4 jersey. After signing for the club, Pistone was quoted as saying ''\"I signed here because I felt that the club immediately believed in me. R.A.E.C. Mons gives me the opportunity to play at a certain level and, very importantly, I felt the confidence of the club and the direction towards me\"''. However, after only making four appearances, Pistone left the club at the end of the 2007\u201308 season.\n\n===International career===\nAs part of the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian Under-21 national team]], Pistone won the [[1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under-21 Championships]] in 1996. Pistone also played for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] Game[[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|s]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n==Coaching career==\nSince retiring, Pistone has coached youth players at Aldini Bariviera and Varese Calcio. In September 2015, he managed the first team of Oggiono in Italy's fifth tier, the [[Eccellenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Si ricomincia subito con il botto Oggiono-Nibionno super derby|url=http://www.laprovinciadilecco.it/stories/Sport/si-ricomincia-subito-con-il-botto-oggiono-nibionno-super-derby_1139202_11/|publisher=laprovinciadilecco.it|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=it|date=5 September 2015}}</ref> He departed Oggiono in November 2016 due to the club's financial position.<ref>{{cite book|title=Everton Magazine - Issue 45|date=June 2017|publisher=Trinity Mirror|pages=48}}</ref> The club merged with local rivals Nibiono to become A.S.D. NibionnOggiono.\n\n==After football==\nSince retiring from football, Pistone has made a number of appearances on the Italian Poker Circuit, and participated in the eight Annual Night of Aces event in 2010.

During his career, he played for [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]], [[Internazionale]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[RAEC Mons]], as well as the [[Italian national football team|Italy Under-21 national team]], whom he represented in the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Early career===\n\nPistone started his career at [[Solbiatese Arno Calcio|Solbiatese]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|AC Crevalcore|it|3=Associazione Calcio Crevalcore}}, two small Italian teams who in recent years have slid to the lowest tier of professional Italian football, before moving to [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] for the duration of the 1995\u201396 season. Whilst at Vicenza, Pistone caught the eye of [[Roy Hodgson]], who was manager of [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] at that time.\n\n===Internazionale===\n\nPistone transferred to [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] for the 1996\u201397 season, fulfilling a childhood ambition by signing for his home town club. By now an Under-21 international, Pistone made 45 appearances for Inter. Pistone also featured in the [[1997 UEFA Cup Final]], which Inter lost to [[Schalke 04]].\n\n===Newcastle United===\n\nAfter an impressive single season at Internazionale, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] signed Pistone for a fee of \u00a34.5 million in July 1997. Despite primarily being a full-back, Pistone made his debut against Sheffield Wednesday as a central defender (a position which he appeared in on a number of occasions in his first season with the Magpies). Pistone played in the [[1998 FA Cup Final]] against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], which Newcastle United lost.\n\nAfter only two games into his second season with the club, Pistone was injured whilst playing away at [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. This game proved to be Dalglish's last for Newcastle United, and he was subsequently sacked, Pistone was subsequently frozen out of the team by Dalglish's replacement, [[Ruud Gullit]]. Pistone was not allocated a squad number and was forced to train with the reserve team, along with former club captain [[Rob Lee]]. During this time, Pistone was sent out on loan to [[S.S.C. Venezia|Venezia]] for four months, where he made 10 appearances. However, after Gullit was sacked, Pistone was restored to the first team by new manager [[Bobby Robson]],<ref>{{cite news\n|date=21 November 1999\n|url=http://www.nufc.com/html/times_pistone.html\n|title=Alessandro Pistone \u2013 Interview\n|publisher=The Times\n|accessdate=2 June 2008}}</ref> and once again became a first team regular.\n\nIn his time at Newcastle he scored one league goal, against Middlesbrough in May 2000, in what proved to be his penultimate appearance for the club.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/03/match.sport1\n|title=Festa has final word in Tyne-Tees drama\n|publisher=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=2 May 2000 |accessdate=9 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=John\n| last=Wardle}}</ref>\n\n===Everton===\n\nIn July 2000, Pistone was transferred to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] for a fee in the region of \u00a33 million. He appeared in the first match of the 2000\u201301 season before being beset by a succession of injuries (including a six-month layoff for a knee injury). As a result, Pistone only managed to make 8 appearances for the Toffees during his first season.\n\nThroughout the 2001-02 season, Pistone again suffered a major injury, which resulted in him missing most of the campaign. However, during the 2001-02 season Pistone did score his first goal for the club against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/1900942.stm\n|title=Everton leave Bolton struggling\n|publisher=[[BBC]]\n|date=1 April 2002 |accessdate=9 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nPistone overcame a succession of injuries, and he featured in the vast majority of Everton's games throughout the 2004-05 season. However, his contract was due to expire at the end of this season, and with manager [[David Moyes]] having doubts about Pistone's ability to remain injury-free, he was only offered a one-year contract. Pistone refused to sign, and looked to be heading out of Goodison Park at the end of the 2004-05 season. However, with Everton qualifying for the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] for the 2005-06 season, the club were short of defensive cover. As such, he was subsequently offered a new two-year contract, to which he agreed.\n\nPistone returned to Everton's first-team line up for the 2005\u201306 season. However, he only managed to feature in 3 games before suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury, ending his season prematurely. Following this, Pistone failed to make a further first-team appearance for Everton, and did not feature at all during the [[2006-07 in English football|2006\u201307]] season.\n\nAfter making 103 appearance for Everton in 7 years, Pistone was eventually released by the club on 14 May 2007.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/e/everton/6655123.stm |title=Everton release Pistone & Wright |publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=14 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Free Agent===\n\nAfter being released by Everton, on 31 August 2007 it was confirmed by [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Gareth Southgate]] that Pistone was having a trial at the Premier League club and, as Pistone was a free agent, he could be signed after the transfer deadline, giving Southgate more time to decide. It was reported on 9 September 2007 that Southgate had decided against offering Pistone a contract.\n\nPistone also went on trial with Championship side [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] but he could not convince [[Aidy Boothroyd]] to offer him a contract.<ref>http://www.watford.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=83675</ref>\n\n===RAEC Mons===\n\nAfter failing to secure a contract with a club in England, Pistone spent a week on trial with Belgian club [[R.A.E.C. Mons|RAEC Mons]]. After impressing manager [[Geo Van Pyperzeele]], Pistone signed for the club on 6 December 2007 until the end of the season, and was given the number 4 jersey. After signing for the club, Pistone was quoted as saying ''\"I signed here because I felt that the club immediately believed in me. R.A.E.C. Mons gives me the opportunity to play at a certain level and, very importantly, I felt the confidence of the club and the direction towards me\"''. However, after only making four appearances, Pistone left the club at the end of the 2007\u20132008 season.\n\n===International career===\nAs part of the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italian Under-21 national team]], Pistone won the [[1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Under-21 Championships]] in 1996. Pistone also played for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] at the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympic]] Game[[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|s]] in [[Atlanta]].\n\n==Coaching career==\n\nSince retiring, Pistone has coached youth players at Aldini Bariviera and Varese Calcio. In September 2015, he managed the first team of Oggiono in Italy's fifth tier, the [[Eccellenza]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Si ricomincia subito con il botto Oggiono-Nibionno super derby|url=http://www.laprovinciadilecco.it/stories/Sport/si-ricomincia-subito-con-il-botto-oggiono-nibionno-super-derby_1139202_11/|publisher=laprovinciadilecco.it|accessdate=10 May 2017|language=it|date=5 September 2015}}</ref> He departed Oggiono in November 2016 due to the club's financial position.<ref>{{cite book|title=Everton Magazine - Issue 45|date=June 2017|publisher=Trinity Mirror|pages=48}}</ref> The club merged with local rivals Nibiono to become A.S.D.

{"title_page": "Christianity in the modern era", "text_new": "{{See also|History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Protestant Reformation}}\n{{broader|History of Christianity}}\n[[File:AFM on azusa street.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The mission at [[Azusa Street Revival|312 Azusa Street]] in 1907, [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], the [[United States]], considered to be the birthplace of [[Pentecostalism]].]]\n\nThe '''history of modern Christianity''' concerns the [[Christianity|Christian religion]] from the beginning of the 15th century to the end of World War II. It can be divided in the early modern period and the late modern period. The history of Christianity in the early modern period coincides with the [[Age of Exploration]], and is usually taken to begin with the [[Protestant Reformation]] {{circa|1517\u20131525}} (usually rounded down to 1500) and ending in the late 18th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the events leading up to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. It includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery]]. Christianity expanded throughout the world during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Christianity has thus become the [[major religious groups|world's largest religion]].<ref>Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']</ref>\n\n==Early modern period (c.1500 - c.1750)==\n\n===Orthodoxy under Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire}}\n\nIn 1453, Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under Ottoman rule, the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] acquired substantial power as an autonomous ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]''. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \"Greek Orthodox nation\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. As a result of the Ottoman conquest and the [[fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West.\n\nFor the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. This is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in sixteenth-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\nThe new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] that arose from the ashes of Byzantine civilisation was neither primitive nor barbaric. [[Islam]] not only recognised Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organisation significantly disrupted. Its administration continued to function. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were, admittedly, converted into mosques, yet countless other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Moreover, it is striking that the patriarch's and the hierarchy's position was considerably strengthened and their power increased. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these rights and privileges (see [[Dhimmitude]]), including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as little more than second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Moslems was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n====Corruption====\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. Nor was the patriarchal throne ever secure. Few patriarchs between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's. The hanging of patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops.\n\n====Devshirmeh====\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered [[Christians|Christian]] lands by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]]s as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===The Reformation (1520\u20131641)===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}\n\n===Age of Enlightenment (1640\u20131740)===\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|150px|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642\u20131645]]\n{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the [[Protestant Reformation]], which questioned certain Christian doctrines, the Enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human [[reason]] above  divine [[revelation]] and down-graded religious authorities such as the [[papacy]] based on it<ref>Lortz, IV, 7-11</ref>\n\n====Puritan movement====\n{{See also|History of the Puritans from 1649}}\n\nThe [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritan]] party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the [[Elizabethan Age]], although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to that which its neighbours had suffered some generations before.\n\nThe early ''Puritan movement'' (late 16th century-17th century) was [[Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and was a movement for reform in the [[Church of England]]. Its origins lay in the discontent with the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially [[Geneva]]. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as \"[[popish]] pomp and rags\". (See [[Vestments controversy]].) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.\n\nThe later Puritan movement were often referred to as [[Dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s and eventually led to the formation of various [[Reformed]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]].\n\nThe most famous and well-known emigration to [[United States|America]] was the migration of the Puritans, or [[pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, so with hopes of a Puritan utopia, they set out to establish the English colonies of [[New England]], which later became the [[United States]].\n\nThese Puritan separatists were also known as \"[[Pilgrims|the pilgrims]]\". After establishing a colony at Plymouth (in what would become later Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the [[King of England]] which legitimized their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of [[mercantilism]]. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and [[economic freedom]], to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.\n\nThe original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the Native American Indians and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas.\n\nThe most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540</ref>\n\n====Roman Catholic missions====\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such those from [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China was relatively peaceful and focused on adopted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among others the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called [[Chinese Rites controversy]] in 1692 and 1742. The expansion of the [[Catholic]] [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] with a significant roled played by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] led to the Christianization of the indigenous populations of the Americas such as the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca]]s, but, until the 19th century, missions had to work under the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] governments and military.<ref>Franzen, 362</ref>\n\n==Late modern period (c.1750 - c.1945)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century|Christianity in the 20th century}}\n\n===Revivalism (1720\u20131906)===\n{{Main|Revivalism}}\n\nRevivalism refers to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and Wesleyan revival, called the [[Great Awakening]], in North America which saw the development of evangelical [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], and new [[Methodist]] churches. When the movement eventually waned, it gave rise to new [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationist]] movements.\n\n====Great Awakenings (18th-19th century)====\n{{Main|First Great Awakening|Second Great Awakening|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies ''c''. 1730\u20131740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in [[Germany]], the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in [[England]].<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263</ref> It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800&ndash;1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of the [[Restoration Movement]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Adventism]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].\n\n====French Revolution and worship of Reason====\n{{Main|French Revolution}}\n\nMatters grew still worse with the violent anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Edward\">Edward, ''The Cambridge Modern History'' (1908), p. 25</ref> Direct attacks on the wealth of the Catholic Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church.<ref name=\"Bokenkotter285\"/> Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], leading to the Catholic Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of \"[[Reason]]\"<ref name=\"Bokenkotter285\"/> along with a new [[French Republican Calendar]].

[[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]] developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation,<ref>Ahlstrom's summary is as follows: Restorationism has its genesis with Thomas and Alexander Campbell, whose movement is connected to the German Reformed Church through Otterbein, Albright, and Winebrenner (p. 212). American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, produced certain groups such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (p. 387, 501\u20139), the Jehovah's Witness movement (p. 807), and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, Seventh Day Adventism (p. 381); Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972)</ref> but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. The name Restoration is also used to describe the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]].\n\n=====Latter Day Saints=====\n[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|right|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]].<ref>Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division</ref>]]\n{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}\nThe driving force behind and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], and to a lesser extent, during the movement's first two years, [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having [[First Vision|seen God the Father and Jesus Christ]] as two separate beings, who told him that the true church had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. Smith and Cowdery also explained that the [[angels]] [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] visited them in 1829 and gave them authority to reestablish the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] and in 1838 Joseph Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God officially expanding the common name to the ''[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]''.<ref name = MHC>''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in [[Dean C.

Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.</ref>\n\nSmith first published the [[Book of Mormon]] in March 1830, which LDS members believe was translated from [[Golden Plates]] buried in [[Hill Cumorah|the ground]], and contains a [[Book of Mormon chronology|record of Americas between about 600 BC and 400 AD]] and an original church of Jesus therein.\n\nIn 1844, [[William Law (Mormonism)|William Law]] and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith's secret practice of [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamy]] in the controversial ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', and formed [[True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|their own church]]. The city council of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] subsequently had the printing press of the ''Expositor'' destroyed. In spite of Smith's later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed. Following [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith's assassination]] by a mob in [[Carthage, Illinois]], some prominent members of the church claimed to be Smith's legitimate successor.\n\nThese various claims resulted in a [[Succession Crisis (Mormon)|succession crisis]], in which the majority of church members followed [[Brigham Young]], he being the senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] of the church; others followed [[Sidney Rigdon]] or [[James Strang]]. The crisis resulted in several permanent schisms as well as the formation of occasional splinter groups, some of which no longer exist. These various groups are occasionally referred to under two geographical headings: \"Prairie Saints\" (those that remained in the Midwest United States) and \"Rocky Mountain Saints\" (those who followed Brigham Young to what would later become the state of [[Utah]]). Today, there are many [[Schism (religion)|schism]] organizations who regard themselves as a part of the Latter Day Saint movement, though in most cases they do not acknowledge the other branches as valid and regard their own tradition as the only correct and authorized version of the church Smith founded. The vast majority of Latter Day Saints belong to the largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which claims 13 million members worldwide. The second-largest denomination is the [[Community of Christ]], which reports over 250,000 members.\n\n===Russian Orthodoxy===\nOrthodoxy was very strong in [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], which had recently acquired an [[autocephalous]] status, and as the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire; [[Moscow]] called itself the [[New Rome|Third Rome]], as the heir of Constantinople. In 1721 Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] abolished completely the patriarchate and so the Russian Orthodox Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Tsar himself. This continued until the 20th century.\n\n====Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire====\n[[File:2003-04-18 Moscow Kremlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Churches of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], as seen from the [[Balchug]] ]]\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the [[Russian Empire]], expressed in the motto, [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism]], of the late Russian Empire. At the same time, it was placed under the control of the [[Tsar]] by the [[Church reform of Peter I]] in the 18th century. Its governing body was [[Most Holy Synod]], which was run by an official (titled [[Ober-Procurator]]) appointed by the Tsar himself.\n\nThe church was involved in the various campaigns of [[russification]],<ref>Natalia Shlikhta (2004) \"'Greek Catholic'-'Orthodox'-'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?\" in ''Religion, State & Society'', Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge)</ref> and accused of the involvement in [[anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]].<ref>Shlomo Lambroza, John D.

This may have further strengthened the Bolshevik animus against the church.\n\nAfter the October Revolution of 7 November 1917 (October 25 Old Calendar) there was a movement within the [[Soviet Union]] to unite all of the people of the world under Communist rule (see [[Communist International]]). This included the Eastern European bloc countries as well as the Balkan States.

Toward that end, the Communist regime confiscated church property, ridiculed religion, harassed believers, and propagated atheism in the schools. Actions toward particular religions, however, were determined by State interests, and most organised religions were never outlawed.\nSome actions against Orthodox priests and believers along with [[execution]] included [[torture]] being sent to [[gulags|prison camps]], [[sharashka|labour camps]] or [[Psikhushka|mental hospitals]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Father Arseny 1893\u20131973 Priest, Prisoner, Spiritual Father.

In the first five years after the Bolshevik revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were executed.<ref>[[Richard Ostling|Ostling, Richard]]. \"Cross meets Kremlin\" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html</ref> This included people like the [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna]] who was at this point a monastic. Along with her murder was [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich]] Romanov; the Princes [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia|Ioann Konstantinovich]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Konstantin Konstantinovich]], [[Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Igor Konstantinovich]] and [[Vladimir Paley|Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]]; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and [[Varvara Yakovleva]], a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Church of Maria Magdalene]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Christ the Saviour Cathedral Moscow]] after reconstruction]]\nThe main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death, executed by firing squad.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Father [[Pavel Florensky]] was one of the [[New-martyr]]s of this particular period.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref>Ostling, Richard. \"Cross meets Kremlin\" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html</ref> Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many [[New-martyr]]s added as Saints from the yoke of atheism.\n\n====Diaspora emigration to the West====\nOne of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically \"eastern\" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice.\n\n===Western Christianity in the 20th century===\n{{See also|Christianity in the 20th century}}\n\n====Fascism====\nFascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th-century Europe, especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler, the Fascist Italy of Mussolini and the falangist Spain of Franco. About Italian Fascism [[Pope Pius XI]] is said to have been moderately sceptic{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and [[G. K.

His declaration that \"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCatholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed.  A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37.</ref> Many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876\u20131958).  The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005),  p. 332.</ref> A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, was complex. Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\n\n====Ecumenism====\n{{Main|Ecumenism}}\n\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"''Ecumenism''\" is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness.\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\n\n=====Catholic ecumenism=====\n{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}\n\nOver the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]].  Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.\n\nOn 30 November 1895, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the Apostolic Letter ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm Orientalium Dignitas]'' (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\n\nSome of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. [[Filioque]], [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.\n\nWith respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.\n\n=====Ecumenism within Protestantism=====\nEcumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church.\" Obviously, this ecclesiology is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church.\" The \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the Trinity, belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and eternal life, and that He died and rose again bodily.\n\n===Trends in western theology===\n\n====Modernism and liberal Christianity====\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\n\n[[Liberal Christianity]], sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically-informed religious movements and moods within late 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. The word \"liberal\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\n====Fundamentalism====\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\n\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and [[United States of America|American]] [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian.\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"[[fundamentalism|fundamentals]]\": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ.\n\n==Contemporary Christianity (1945 - present)==\n\n===Second Vatican Council===\n{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}\nOn 11 October 1962  [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was \"pastoral\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History|Bible}}\n\n{{div col}}\n*[[History of Christian theology]]\n*[[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n*[[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[History of Protestantism]]\n*[[Christianization]]\n*[[Timeline of Christianity]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Church]]\n*[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[Protestantism]]\n*[[Timeline of Christian missions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Christianity by century\n| period = <br />Modern Christianity\n| preceded = [[Protestant Reformation|The<br />Reformation]]\n| years = Modern<br />Christianity\n| next =[[Contemporary Christianity]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Resources==\n* {{cite book |last = Gonz\u00e1lez |first = Justo L. |title = The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day |location = San Francisco |publisher = Harper |year = 1985 |isbn = 0-06-063316-6 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz }}\n* {{cite book |last = Hastings|first = Adrian |year = 1999 |title = A World History of Christianity |publisher = Wm.

It can be divided in the early modern period and the late modern period. The history of Christianity in the early modern period coincides with the [[Age of Exploration]], and is usually taken to begin with the [[Protestant Reformation]] {{circa|1517\u20131525}} (usually rounded down to 1500) and ending in the late 18th century with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the events leading up to the [[French Revolution]] of 1789. It includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and the [[Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery]]. Christianity expanded throughout the world during the [[Age of Exploration]]. Christianity has thus become the [[major religious groups|world's largest religion]].<ref>Adherents.com, [http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html ''Religions by Adherents'']</ref>\n\n==Early modern period (c.1500 - c.1750)==\n\n===Orthodoxy under Ottoman rule===\n{{See also|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church under the Ottoman Empire}}\n\nIn 1453, Constantinople fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Under Ottoman rule, the [[Orthodox Church of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] acquired substantial power as an autonomous ''[[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]''. The ecumenical patriarch was the religious and administrative ruler of the entire \"Greek Orthodox nation\" (Ottoman administrative unit), which encompassed all the Eastern Orthodox subjects of the Empire. As a result of the Ottoman conquest and the [[fall of Constantinople]], the entire Orthodox communion of the Balkans and the Near East became suddenly isolated from the West.\n\nFor the next four hundred years, it would be confined within a hostile Islamic world, with which it had little in common religiously or culturally. This is, in part, due to this geographical and intellectual confinement that the voice of Eastern Orthodoxy was not heard during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in sixteenth-century Europe. As a result, this important theological debate often seems strange and distorted to the Orthodox. They never took part in it and thus neither Reformation nor [[Counter-Reformation]] is part of their theological framework.\n\nThe new [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman government]] that arose from the ashes of Byzantine civilisation was neither primitive nor barbaric. [[Islam]] not only recognised Jesus as a great prophet, but tolerated Christians as another [[People of the Book]]. As such, the Church was not extinguished nor was its canonical and hierarchical organisation significantly disrupted. Its administration continued to function. One of the first things that [[Mehmed II|Mehmet the Conqueror]] did was to allow the Church to elect a new patriarch, [[Gennadius Scholarius]]. The [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Parthenon]], which had been Christian churches for nearly a millennium were, admittedly, converted into mosques, yet countless other churches, both in Constantinople and elsewhere, remained in Christian hands. Moreover, it is striking that the patriarch's and the hierarchy's position was considerably strengthened and their power increased. They were endowed with civil as well as ecclesiastical power over all Christians in Ottoman territories. Because [[Sharia|Islamic law]] makes no distinction between nationality and religion, all Christians, regardless of their language or nationality, were considered a single [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]], or nation. The patriarch, as the highest ranking hierarch, was thus invested with civil and religious authority and made [[ethnarch]], head of the entire Christian Orthodox population. Practically, this meant that all Orthodox Churches within Ottoman territory were under the control of Constantinople. Thus, the authority and jurisdictional frontiers of the patriarch were enormously enlarged.\n\nHowever, these rights and privileges (see [[Dhimmitude]]), including freedom of worship and religious organisation, were often established in principle but seldom corresponded to reality. The legal privileges of the patriarch and the Church depended, in fact, on the whim and mercy of the [[Sultan]] and the [[Sublime Porte]], while all Christians were viewed as little more than second-class citizens. Moreover, Turkish corruption and brutality were not a myth. That it was the \"infidel\" Christian who experienced this more than anyone else is not in doubt. Nor were pogroms of Christians in these centuries unknown (see [[Greco-Turkish relations]]).<ref name=AIHG-NYT>[http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm The Australian Institute for Holocaust and Genocide Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607184704/http://www.aihgs.com/New%20York%20Times.htm |date=2007-06-07 }} ''The New York Times''.</ref><ref>http://www.helleniccomserve.com/pdf/BlkBkPontusPrinceton.pdf</ref> Devastating, too, for the Church was the fact that it could not bear witness to Christ. Missionary work among Moslems was dangerous and indeed impossible, whereas conversion to Islam was entirely legal and permissible. Converts to Islam who returned to Orthodoxy were put to death as apostates. No new churches could be built and even the ringing of church bells was prohibited. Education of the clergy and the Christian population either ceased altogether or was reduced to the most rudimentary elements.\n\n====Corruption====\nThe Orthodox Church found itself subject to the Turkish system of corruption. The patriarchal throne was frequently sold to the highest bidder, while new patriarchal investiture was accompanied by heavy payment to the government. In order to recoup their losses, patriarchs and bishops taxed the local parishes and their clergy. Nor was the patriarchal throne ever secure. Few patriarchs between the fifteenth and the nineteenth centuries died a natural death while in office. The forced abdications, exiles, hangings, drownings, and poisonings of patriarchs are well documented. But if the patriarch's position was precarious so was the hierarchy's. The hanging of patriarch [[Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]] from the gate of the patriarchate on Easter Sunday 1821 was accompanied by the execution of two metropolitans and twelve bishops.\n\n====Devshirmeh====\n[[Devshirmeh]] was the system of the collection of young boys from conquered [[Christians|Christian]] lands by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[sultan]]s as a form of regular taxation in order to build a loyal  army (formerly largely composed of war captives) and the class of (military) administrators called the \"[[Janissary|Janissaries]]\", or other servants such as tellak in hamams. The word ''dev\u015firme'' means \"collecting, gathering\" in [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]. Boys delivered to the Ottomans in this way were called ''[[ghilm\u00e1n]]'' or ''acemi oglanlar'' (\"novice boys\").\n\n===The Reformation (1520\u20131641)===\n{{Main|Protestant Reformation|Counter-Reformation}}\n{{See also|Christianity in the 16th century|Catholic Church and the Age of Discovery}}\n\n===Age of Enlightenment (1640\u20131740)===\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|150px|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (green), 1642\u20131645]]\n{{See also|Christianity in the 17th century|Christianity in the 18th century}}\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] constituted a new challenge of the Church. Unlike the [[Protestant Reformation]], which questioned certain Christian doctrines, the Enlightenment questioned Christianity as a whole. Generally, it elevated human [[reason]] above  divine [[revelation]] and down-graded religious authorities such as the [[papacy]] based on it<ref>Lortz, IV, 7-11</ref>\n\n====Puritan movement====\n{{See also|History of the Puritans from 1649}}\n\nThe [[Counter-Reformation]] on the Continent and the growth of a [[Puritan]] party dedicated to further Protestant reform polarized the [[Elizabethan Age]], although it was not until the 1640s that England underwent religious strife comparable to that which its neighbours had suffered some generations before.\n\nThe early ''Puritan movement'' (late 16th century-17th century) was [[Reformed]] or [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and was a movement for reform in the [[Church of England]]. Its origins lay in the discontent with the [[Elizabethan Religious Settlement]]. The desire was for the Church of England to resemble more closely the Protestant churches of Europe, especially [[Geneva]]. The Puritans objected to ornaments and ritual in the churches as [[idolatry|idolatrous]] (vestments, surplices, organs, genuflection), which they castigated as \"[[popish]] pomp and rags\". (See [[Vestments controversy]].) They also objected to ecclesiastical courts. They refused to endorse completely all of the ritual directions and formulas of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''; the imposition of its liturgical order by legal force and inspection sharpened Puritanism into a definite opposition movement.\n\nThe later Puritan movement were often referred to as [[Dissenters]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s and eventually led to the formation of various [[Reformed]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]].\n\nThe most famous and well-known emigration to [[United States|America]] was the migration of the Puritans, or [[pilgrims]], left England so that they could live in an area with Puritanism established as the exclusive civic religion. Though they had left England because of the suppression of their religious practice, most Puritans had thereafter originally settled in the [[Low Countries]] but found the licentiousness there, where the state hesitated from enforcing religious practice, as unacceptable, so with hopes of a Puritan utopia, they set out to establish the English colonies of [[New England]], which later became the [[United States]].\n\nThese Puritan separatists were also known as \"[[Pilgrims|the pilgrims]]\". After establishing a colony at Plymouth (in what would become later Massachusetts) in 1620, the Puritan pilgrims received a charter from the [[King of England]] which legitimized their colony, allowing them to do trade and commerce with merchants in England, in accordance with the principles of [[mercantilism]]. This successful, though initially quite difficult, colony marked the beginning of the Protestant presence in America (the earlier French, Spanish and Portuguese settlements had been Catholic), and became a kind of oasis of spiritual and [[economic freedom]], to which persecuted Protestants and other minorities from the British Isles and Europe (and later, from all over the world) fled to for peace, freedom and opportunity.\n\nThe original intent of the colonists was to establish spiritual Puritanism, which had been denied to them in England and the rest of Europe to engage in peaceful commerce with England and the Native American Indians and to Christianize the peoples of the Americas.\n\nThe most famous colonisation by Protestants in the New World was that of English [[Puritan]]s in North America. Unlike the Spanish or French, the English colonists made surprisingly little effort to evangelise the native peoples.<ref>MacCulloch, Diarmaid, ''The Reformation: A History'' (New York: Penguin Books, 2004) p. 540</ref>\n\n====Roman Catholic missions====\nThe [[Roman Catholic Church]] established a number of [[Mission (Christian)|Missions]] to convert the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]. At the same time, missionaries such those from [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], [[Augustinians]], [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] were moving into Asia and the Far East. The Portuguese sent missions into Africa. [[Matteo Ricci]]'s [[Jesuit]] mission to China was relatively peaceful and focused on adopted the Catholic faith to Chinese thinking, permitting among others the veneration of the dead. The Vatican disagreed and forbade any adaptation in the so-called [[Chinese Rites controversy]] in 1692 and 1742. The expansion of the [[Catholic]] [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] with a significant roled played by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] led to the Christianization of the indigenous populations of the Americas such as the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca]]s, but, until the 19th century, missions had to work under the [[Spain|Spanish]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] governments and military.<ref>Franzen, 362</ref>\n\n==Late modern period (c.1750 - c.1945)==\n{{See also|Christianity in the 18th century|Christianity in the 19th century|Christianity in the 20th century}}\n\n===Revivalism (1720\u20131906)===\n{{Main|Revivalism}}\n\nRevivalism refers to the [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] and Wesleyan revival, called the [[Great Awakening]], in North America which saw the development of evangelical [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Baptist]], and new [[Methodist]] churches. When the movement eventually waned, it gave rise to new [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationist]] movements.\n\n====Great Awakenings (18th-19th century)====\n{{Main|First Great Awakening|Second Great Awakening|Third Great Awakening}}\nThe [[First Great Awakening]] was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants in the American colonies ''c''. 1730\u20131740, emphasising the traditional Reformed virtues of Godly preaching, rudimentary liturgy, and a deep sense of personal guilt and redemption by Christ Jesus. Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom saw it as part of a \"great international Protestant upheaval\" that also created [[Pietism]] in [[Germany]], the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Revival]], and [[Methodism]] in [[England]].<ref>Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972) p. 263</ref> It centred on reviving the spirituality of established congregations, and mostly affected [[Congregational church|Congregational]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Dutch Reformed Church|Dutch Reformed]], German Reformed, [[Baptist]], and [[Methodism|Methodist]] churches, while also spreading within the slave population. The Second Great Awakening (1800&ndash;1830s), unlike the first, focused on the unchurched and sought to instil in them a deep sense of personal salvation as experienced in revival meetings. It also sparked the beginnings of the [[Restoration Movement]], the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Adventism]] and the [[Holiness movement]]. The [[Third Great Awakening]] began from 1857 and was most notable for taking the movement throughout the world, especially in English speaking countries. The final group to emerge from the \"great awakenings\" in North America was [[Pentecostalism]], which had its roots in the Methodist, Wesleyan, and Holiness movements, and began in 1906 on [[Azusa Street Revival|Azusa Street]], in Los Angeles. Pentecostalism would later lead to the [[Charismatic movement]].\n\n====French Revolution and worship of Reason====\n{{Main|French Revolution}}\n\nMatters grew still worse with the violent anti-clericalism of the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=\"Edward\">Edward, ''The Cambridge Modern History'' (1908), p. 25</ref> Direct attacks on the wealth of the Catholic Church and associated grievances led to the wholesale nationalisation of church property and attempts to establish a state-run church.<ref name=\"Bokenkotter285\"/> Large numbers of priests refused to take an oath of compliance to the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], leading to the Catholic Church being outlawed and replaced by a new religion of the worship of \"[[Reason]]\"<ref name=\"Bokenkotter285\"/> along with a new [[French Republican Calendar]]. In this period, all monasteries were destroyed, 30,000&nbsp;priests were exiled and hundreds more were killed.<ref name=\"Bokenkotter285\">Bokenkotter, ''A Concise History of the Catholic Church'' (2004), pp. 283&ndash;5</ref>\n\nWhen [[Pope Pius VI]] sided against the revolution in the [[First Coalition]], [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded Italy. The 82-year-old pope was taken as a prisoner to France in February 1799 and died in [[Valence, Dr\u00f4me|Valence]] August 29, 1799 after six months of captivity. To win popular support for his rule, Napoleon re-established the Catholic Church in France through the [[Concordat of 1801]].<ref name=\"Collins176\">Collins, ''The Story of Christianity'' (1999), p. 176</ref> All over Europe, the end of the Napoleonic wars signaled by the [[Congress of Vienna]], brought Catholic revival, renewed enthusiasm, and new respect for the papacy following the depredations of the previous era.<ref name=\"Duffy216\">Duffy, ''Saints and Sinners'' (1997), pp. 214&ndash;6</ref>\n\n====Restorationism====\n{{Main|Restorationism (Christian primitivism)}}\n{{See also|Dispensationalism}}\n\nRestorationism refers to various unaffiliated movements that considered contemporary Christianity, in all its forms, to be a deviation from the true, original Christianity, which these groups then attempted to \"Reconstruct\", often using the [[Acts of the Apostles|Book of Acts]] as a \"guidebook\" of sorts. [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|Restorationism]] developed out of the Second Great Awakening and is historically connected to the Protestant Reformation,<ref>Ahlstrom's summary is as follows: Restorationism has its genesis with Thomas and Alexander Campbell, whose movement is connected to the German Reformed Church through Otterbein, Albright, and Winebrenner (p. 212). American Millennialism and Adventism, which arose from Evangelical Protestantism, produced certain groups such as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (p. 387, 501\u20139), the Jehovah's Witness movement (p. 807), and, as a reaction specifically to William Miller, Seventh Day Adventism (p. 381); Sydney E. Ahlstrom, ''A Religious History of the American People''. (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1972)</ref> but differs in that Restorationists do not usually describe themselves as \"reforming\" a Christian church continuously existing from the time of Jesus, but as ''restoring'' the Church that they believe was lost at some point. The name Restoration is also used to describe the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons) and the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness Movement]].\n\n=====Latter Day Saints=====\n[[File:The Book of Mormon- An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi.jpg|thumb|right|Cover page of The Book of Mormon from an original 1830 edition, by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]].<ref>Image from the U.S. Library of Congress ''Rare Book and Special Collections Division</ref>]]\n{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement}}\nThe driving force behind and founder of the Latter Day Saint movement was [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], and to a lesser extent, during the movement's first two years, [[Oliver Cowdery]]. Throughout his life, Smith told of an experience he had as a boy having [[First Vision|seen God the Father and Jesus Christ]] as two separate beings, who told him that the true church had been lost and would be restored through him, and that he would be given the authority to organize and lead the true [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]]. Smith and Cowdery also explained that the [[angels]] [[John the Baptist]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], [[James, son of Zebedee|James]] and [[John the Apostle|John]] visited them in 1829 and gave them authority to reestablish the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] and in 1838 Joseph Smith announced that he had received a revelation from God officially expanding the common name to the ''[[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]''.<ref name = MHC>''Manuscript History of the Church'', LDS Church Archives, book A-1, p. 37; reproduced in [[Dean C.

Michael Marquardt and Wesley P. Walters (1994). ''Inventing Mormonism: Tradition and the Historical Record'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 160.</ref>\n\nSmith first published the [[Book of Mormon]] in March 1830, which LDS members believe was translated from [[Golden Plates]] buried in [[Hill Cumorah|the ground]], and contains a [[Book of Mormon chronology|record of Americas between about 600 BC and 400 AD]] and an original church of Jesus therein.\n\nIn 1844, [[William Law (Mormonism)|William Law]] and several other Latter Day Saints in church leadership positions publicly denounced Smith's secret practice of [[Polygamy and the Latter Day Saint movement|polygamy]] in the controversial ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', and formed [[True Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints|their own church]]. The city council of [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] subsequently had the printing press of the ''Expositor'' destroyed. In spite of Smith's later offer to pay damages for destroyed property, critics of Smith and the church considered the destruction heavy-handed. Some called for the Latter Day Saints to be either expelled or destroyed. Following [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith's assassination]] by a mob in [[Carthage, Illinois]], some prominent members of the church claimed to be Smith's legitimate successor.\n\nThese various claims resulted in a [[Succession Crisis (Mormon)|succession crisis]], in which the majority of church members followed [[Brigham Young]], he being the senior [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostle]] of the church; others followed [[Sidney Rigdon]] or [[James Strang]]. The crisis resulted in several permanent schisms as well as the formation of occasional splinter groups, some of which no longer exist. These various groups are occasionally referred to under two geographical headings: \"Prairie Saints\" (those that remained in the Midwest United States) and \"Rocky Mountain Saints\" (those who followed Brigham Young to what would later become the state of [[Utah]]). Today, there are many [[Schism (religion)|schism]] organizations who regard themselves as a part of the Latter Day Saint movement, though in most cases they do not acknowledge the other branches as valid and regard their own tradition as the only correct and authorized version of the church Smith founded. The vast majority of Latter Day Saints belong to the largest denomination, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) which claims 13 million members worldwide. The second-largest denomination is the [[Community of Christ]], which reports over 250,000 members.\n\n===Russian Orthodoxy===\nOrthodoxy was very strong in [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]], which had recently acquired an [[autocephalous]] status, and as the only part of the Orthodox communion which remained outside the control of the Ottoman Empire; [[Moscow]] called itself the [[New Rome|Third Rome]], as the heir of Constantinople. In 1721 Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] abolished completely the patriarchate and so the Russian Orthodox Church effectively became a department of the government, ruled by a Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the Tsar himself. This continued until the 20th century.\n\n====Russian Orthodox Church in the Russian Empire====\n[[File:2003-04-18 Moscow Kremlin.jpg|thumb|300px|Churches of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], as seen from the [[Balchug]] ]]\n\nThe Russian Orthodox Church held a privileged position in the [[Russian Empire]], expressed in the motto, [[Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Populism]], of the late Russian Empire. At the same time, it was placed under the control of the [[Tsar]] by the [[Church reform of Peter I]] in the 18th century. Its governing body was [[Most Holy Synod]], which was run by an official (titled [[Ober-Procurator]]) appointed by the Tsar himself.\n\nThe church was involved in the various campaigns of [[russification]],<ref>Natalia Shlikhta (2004) \"'Greek Catholic'-'Orthodox'-'Soviet': a symbiosis or a conflict of identities?\" in ''Religion, State & Society'', Volume 32, Number 3 (Routledge)</ref> and accused of the involvement in [[anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]].<ref>Shlomo Lambroza, John D.

Along with her murder was [[Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich]] Romanov; the Princes [[Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia|Ioann Konstantinovich]], [[Prince Constantine Constantinovich of Russia|Konstantin Konstantinovich]], [[Igor Konstantinovich of Russia|Igor Konstantinovich]] and [[Vladimir Paley|Vladimir Pavlovich Paley]]; Grand Duke Sergei's secretary, Fyodor Remez; and [[Varvara Yakovleva]], a sister from the Grand Duchess Elizabeth's convent. They were herded into the forest, pushed into an abandoned mineshaft and grenades were then hurled into the mineshaft. Her remains were buried in [[Jerusalem]], in the [[Church of Maria Magdalene]].\n\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-3.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Christ the Saviour Cathedral Moscow]] after reconstruction]]\nThe main target of the anti-religious campaign in the 1920s and 1930s was the Russian Orthodox Church, which had the largest number of faithful. Nearly its entire clergy, and many of its believers, were shot or sent to labor camps. Theological schools were closed, and church publications were prohibited. In the period between 1927 and 1940, the number of Orthodox Churches in the Russian Republic fell from 29,584 to less than 500. Between 1917 and 1940, 130,000 Orthodox priests were arrested. Of these, 95,000 were put to death, executed by firing squad.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Father [[Pavel Florensky]] was one of the [[New-martyr]]s of this particular period.\n\nAfter Nazi Germany's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, Joseph Stalin revived the Russian Orthodox Church to intensify patriotic support for the war effort. By 1957 about 22,000 Russian Orthodox churches had become active. But in 1959 Nikita Khrushchev initiated his own campaign against the Russian Orthodox Church and forced the closure of about 12,000 churches. By 1985 fewer than 7,000 churches remained active.<ref>Ostling, Richard. \"Cross meets Kremlin\" TIME Magazine, 2001-06-24. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,150718,00.html</ref> Members of the church hierarchy were jailed or forced out, their places taken by docile clergy, many of whom had ties with the KGB. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nIn the Soviet Union, in addition to the methodical closing and destruction of churches, the charitable and social work formerly done by ecclesiastical authorities was taken over by the state. As with all private property, Church owned property was confiscated into public use. The few places of worship left to the Church were legally viewed as state property which the government permitted the church to use. After the advent of state funded universal education, the Church was not permitted to carry on educational, instructional activity for children. For adults, only training for church-related occupations was allowed. Outside of sermons during the celebration of the divine liturgy it could not instruct or evangelise to the faithful or its youth. Catechism classes, religious schools, study groups, Sunday schools and religious publications were all illegal and or banned. This persecution continued, even after the death of Stalin until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. This caused many religious tracts to be circulated as illegal literature or [[samizdat]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\nSince the fall of the Soviet Union there have been many [[New-martyr]]s added as Saints from the yoke of atheism.\n\n====Diaspora emigration to the West====\nOne of the most striking developments in modern historical Orthodoxy is the dispersion of Orthodox Christians to the West. Emigration from Greece and the Near East in the last hundred years has created a sizable Orthodox diaspora in Western Europe, North and South America, and Australia. In addition, the Bolshevik Revolution forced thousands of Russian exiles westward. As a result, Orthodoxy's traditional frontiers have been profoundly modified. Millions of Orthodox are no longer geographically \"eastern\" since they live permanently in their newly adopted countries in the West. Nonetheless, they remain Eastern Orthodox in their faith and practice.\n\n===Western Christianity in the 20th century===\n{{See also|Christianity in the 20th century}}\n\n====Fascism====\nFascism describes certain related political regimes in 20th-century Europe, especially the Nazi Germany of Hitler, the Fascist Italy of Mussolini and the falangist Spain of Franco. About Italian Fascism [[Pope Pius XI]] is said to have been moderately sceptic{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} and [[G. K. Chesterton]] friendly but critical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} In the Spanish Civil War Roman Catholics internationally were mainly in support of either [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gil-Robles y Qui\u00f1ones|neutral]] or on [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] side, due to [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a|Aza\u00f1a's]] de facto toleration of anti-clerical violence in and just before [[Spanish Civil War|this conflict]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Dollfuss in Austria was the [[Engelbert Dollfuss|ideal politician]] realising Pope Pius XI's ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]''.\n\n====Nazism====\nThe position of Christians in Nazi Fascism is highly complex.\n\nRegarding the matter, historian Derek Holmes wrote, \"There is no doubt that the Catholic districts, resisted the lure of National Socialism [Nazism] far better than the Protestant ones.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 102.</ref>  [[Pope Pius XI]] declared - ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' - that Fascist governments had hidden \"pagan intentions\" and expressed the irreconcilability of the Catholic position and Totalitarian Fascist State Worship, which placed the nation above God and fundamental human rights and dignity.  His declaration that \"Spiritually, [Christians] are all Semites\" prompted the Nazis to give him the title \"Chief Rabbi of the Christian World.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 116.</ref>\n\nCatholic priests were executed in concentration camps alongside Jews; for example, 2,600 Catholic Priests were imprisoned in Dachau, and 2,000 of them were executed.  A further 2,700 Polish priests were executed (a quarter of all Polish priests), and 5,350 Polish nuns were either displaced, imprisoned, or executed.<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005), p. 332 & n. 37.</ref> Many Catholic laypeople and clergy played notable roles in sheltering [[Jew]]s during [[the Holocaust]], including [[Pope Pius XII]] (1876\u20131958).  The head rabbi of Rome became a Catholic in 1945 and, in honour of the actions the Pope undertook to save Jewish lives, he took the name Eugenio (the pope's first name).<ref>John Vidmar, The Catholic Church Through the Ages: A History (New York: Paulist Press, 2005),  p. 332.</ref> A former Israeli consul in Italy claimed: \"The Catholic Church saved more Jewish lives during the war than all the other churches, religious institutions, and rescue organisations put together.\"<ref>Derek Holmes, History of the Papacy, p. 158.</ref>\n\nThe relationship between Nazism and Protestantism, especially the German Lutheran Church, was complex. Though the majority of Protestant church leaders in Germany supported the Nazis' growing anti-Jewish activities, some, such as [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] (a Lutheran pastor) were strongly opposed to the Nazis. Bonhoeffer was later found guilty in the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler and executed.\n\n====Ecumenism====\n{{Main|Ecumenism}}\n\nEcumenism broadly refers to movements between Christian groups to establish a degree of unity through dialogue. \"''Ecumenism''\" is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f30\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7}} ([[oikoumene]]), which means \"the inhabited world\", but more figuratively something like \"universal oneness.\" The movement can be distinguished into Catholic and Protestant movements, with the latter characterised by a redefined ecclesiology of \"denominationalism\" (which the Catholic Church, among others, rejects).\n\n=====Catholic ecumenism=====\n{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}\n\nOver the last century, a number of moves have been made to reconcile the [[East-West Schism|schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches]].  Although progress has been made, concerns over papal primacy and the independence of the smaller Orthodox churches has blocked a final resolution of the schism.\n\nOn 30 November 1895, [[Pope Leo XIII]] published the Apostolic Letter ''[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm Orientalium Dignitas]'' (On the Churches of the East) safeguarding the importance and continuance of the Eastern traditions for the whole Church. On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the [[Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras I]] was issued lifting the mutual excommunications of 1054.\n\nSome of the most difficult questions in relations with the ancient [[Eastern Churches]] concern some doctrine (i.e. [[Filioque]], [[Scholasticism]], functional purposes of asceticism, the [[Essence-Energies distinction|essence]] of God, [[Hesychasm]], [[Fourth Crusade]], establishment of the [[Latin Empire]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Uniatism]] to note but a few) as well as practical matters such as the concrete exercise of the claim to papal primacy and how to ensure that ecclesiastical union would not mean mere absorption of the smaller Churches by the Latin component of the much larger Catholic Church (the most numerous single religious denomination in the world), and the stifling or abandonment of their own rich theological, liturgical and cultural heritage.\n\nWith respect to Catholic relations with Protestant communities, certain commissions were established to foster dialogue and documents have been produced aimed at identifying points of doctrinal unity, such as the [[Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification]] produced with the [[Lutheran World Federation]] in 1999.\n\n=====Ecumenism within Protestantism=====\nEcumenical movements within Protestantism have focused on determining a list of doctrines and practices essential to being Christian and thus extending to all groups which fulfil these basic criteria a (more or less) co-equal status, with perhaps one's own group still retaining a \"first among equal\" standing. This process involved a redefinition of the idea of \"the Church\" from traditional theology. This ecclesiology, known as denominationalism, contends that each group (which fulfils the essential criteria of \"being Christian\") is a sub-group of a greater \"Christian Church\", itself a purely abstract concept with no direct representation, i.e., no group, or \"denomination\", claims to be \"the Church.\" Obviously, this ecclesiology is at variance with other groups that indeed consider themselves to be \"the Church.\" The \"essential criteria\" generally consist of belief in the Trinity, belief that Jesus Christ is the only way to have forgiveness and eternal life, and that He died and rose again bodily.\n\n===Trends in western theology===\n\n====Modernism and liberal Christianity====\n{{Main|Liberal Christianity}}\n\n[[Liberal Christianity]], sometimes called liberal theology, is an umbrella term covering diverse, philosophically-informed religious movements and moods within late 18th-, 19th- and 20th-century Christianity. The word \"liberal\" in liberal Christianity does not refer to a [[leftist]] ''political'' agenda or set of beliefs, but rather to the freedom of [[dialectic]] process associated with [[continental philosophy]] and other philosophical and religious paradigms developed during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].\n\n====Fundamentalism====\n{{Main|Christian fundamentalism}}\n\nFundamentalist Christianity, is a movement that arose mainly within British and [[United States of America|American]] [[Protestantism]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in reaction to [[Modernist Christianity|modernism]] and certain liberal Protestant groups that denied doctrines considered fundamental to Christianity yet still called themselves \"Christian.\" Thus, fundamentalism sought to re-establish tenets that could not be denied without relinquishing a Christian identity, the \"[[fundamentalism|fundamentals]]\": [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]] of the [[Bible]], [[Sola Scriptura]], the [[Virgin Birth of Jesus]], the doctrine of [[substitutionary atonement]], the bodily [[Resurrection]] of Jesus, and the imminent return of Jesus Christ.\n\n==Contemporary Christianity (1945 - present)==\n\n===Second Vatican Council===\n{{Main|Second Vatican Council}}\nOn 11 October 1962  [[Pope John XXIII]] opened the [[Second Vatican Council]], the 21st [[ecumenical council]] of the Catholic Church. The council was \"pastoral\" in nature, emphasising and clarifying already defined dogma, revising liturgical practices, and providing guidance for articulating traditional Church teachings in contemporary times. The council is perhaps best known for its instructions that the Mass may be celebrated in the vernacular as well as in Latin\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Christianity|History|Bible}}\n\n{{div col}}\n*[[History of Christian theology]]\n*[[History of the Roman Catholic Church]]\n*[[History of the Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[History of Protestantism]]\n*[[Christianization]]\n*[[Timeline of Christianity]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Church]]\n*[[Eastern Orthodox Church]]\n*[[Protestantism]]\n*[[Timeline of Christian missions]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{Christianity by century\n| period = <br />Modern Christianity\n| preceded = [[Protestant Reformation|The<br />Reformation]]\n| years = Modern<br />Christianity\n| next =[[Contemporary Christianity]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Resources==\n* {{cite book |last = Gonz\u00e1lez |first = Justo L. |title = The Story of Christianity, Vol. 2: The Reformation to the Present Day |location = San Francisco |publisher = Harper |year = 1985 |isbn = 0-06-063316-6 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/storyofchristian01gonz }}\n* {{cite book |last = Hastings|first = Adrian |year = 1999 |title = A World History of Christianity |publisher = Wm.
