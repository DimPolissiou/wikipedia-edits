The most widely read of these works is probably ''A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism'', but other notable works include ''The Experience of the Inner Worlds'', which grew out of an association with Christian priest Anthony Duncan, and a new edition of [[Dion Fortune]]'s ''An Introduction to Ritual Magic'', to which Knight contributed a companion chapter for each of Fortune's original chapters.\n\nKnight continues to be active in the occult community both through his writing and his involvement in the Society of the Inner Light.\n\n==Works==\n\nA complete list of the works of Gareth Knight, including Skylight Press reissues and new editions after 2010.<ref>http://www.angelfire.com/az/garethknight/books.html</ref>\n\n{{Unbulleted list| A Practical Guide to Qabalistic Symbolism (1965) | Occult Exercises and Practices (1969) | The Practice of Ritual Magic (1969) | Experience of the Inner Worlds (1975) | The Occult, an Introduction (1975) | A History of White Magic / Magic and the Western Mind (1978) | The Secret Tradition in Arthurian Legend (1983) | The Gareth Knight Tarot Deck (1984) | The Rose Cross and the Goddess / Evoking the Goddess (1985) | The Treasure House of Images / Tarot and Magic (1986) | The Magical World of the Inklings (1990) | The Magical World of the Tarot (1991) | Dion Fortune's Magical Battle of Britain (1993) | An Introduction to Ritual Magic (1997) | The Circuit of Force (1998) | Magical Images and the Magical Imagination (1998) | Principles of Hermetic Philosophy & The Esoteric Philosophy of Astrology (1999) | Spiritualism and Occultism (1999) | Merlin and the Grail Tradition (1999) | Dion Fortune and the Inner Light (2000) | Principles of Esoteric Healing (2000) | Pythoness: the Life and Work of Margaret Lumley Brown (2000) | Esoteric Training in Everyday Life (2001) | Practical Occultism (2002) | The Abbey Papers (2002) | Dion Fortune and the Threefold Way (2002) | The Wells of Vision (2002) | Granny's Magic Cards (2004) | Dion Fortune and the Lost Secrets of the West (2006) | The Arthurian Formula (2006) |The Occult Fiction of Dion Fortune (2007) | Magic and the Power of the Goddess (2008) | The Faery Gates of Avalon (2008) | To the Heart of the Rainbow (New Edition of 'Granny's Magic Cards') (2010) | Melusine of Lusignan and the Cult of the Faery Woman (2010) | The Magical World of the Inklings (New Edition) (2010) | Yours Very Truly Gareth Knight: Selected Letters 1969-2010 (2010) |Experience of the Inner Worlds (New Edition) (2011) | A History of White Magic (New Edition) (2011) | The Romance of the Faery Melusine (2011) | The Abbey Papers (New Expanded Edition with Rebecca Wilby) (2011) | I Called It Magic (2011) | Merlin and the Grail Tradition (New Expanded Edition) (2011) |Faery Loves and Faery Lais (2012) | Tarot & Magic: The Treasure House of Images (New Expanded Edition) (2012) | The Secret Tradition in Arthurian Legend (2012) |Magical Images and the Magical Imagination (New Edition) (2012) |The Book of Melsuine of Lusignan in History, Legend & Romance (2013) |The Faery Gates of Avalon (2013) |Dion Fortune's Rites of Isis and of Pan (2013) |Christ and Qabalah (with Anthony Duncan) (2013) | Esoteric Training in Everyday Life (2013) | Melusine of Lusignan and the Cult of the Faery Woman (New Edition) (2013) | Initiations: Translation of the classic work by Paul S\u00e9dir (2014)}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\nFairholm, Rebecca (2004).

The emblem portrays two [[elephant]]s guarding the state and national [[National emblem|insignias]].\n\n==Description==\n\nThe official Kerala emblem is a derivative version of the Royal coat of arms of the [[Kingdom of Travancore]]. The state emblem symbolizes two elephants guarding the Royal [[Padmanabhaswamy temple|Sri Padmanabha's]] [[Shankha|Shanku]] (''Conch'') in its imperial crest. The crest is garlanded with a wreath over which India's national emblem-[[Sarnath Lion Capital]] is found, as common to most Indian states. The current emblem of Kerala was adopted in 1960 when [[Pattom A. Thanu Pillai]]'s government came to power after removal of [[E. M. S.

The changes, as per the recommendation of a committee that looked into the issue, were made to make the state emblem in tune with the national emblem as the Government of India uses the phrase \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 below the four lions standing back-to-back, an official release said.\n\nIn the former version, \u2018Satyameva Jayate\u2019 was written below the two saluting elephants, after the words \u2018Government of Kerala\u2019. Apart from this, the committee has also suggested increasing the size of the fonts for writing Government of Kerala in both Malayalam and English.\n\nIn an order issued on 3 January 2011, the general administration department shifted the national motto from the base of the emblem to the base of the national emblem on top in accordance with the National Emblem. The order was based on the recommendation of the Official Language (Legislative) Commission. Though the Commission also suggested keeping only the Malayalam version \u2018Kerala Sarkar\u2019, it was not accepted based on the fact that the emblem is also used for the official communication with Centre and various state governments.\n\nThe government had asked all departments to incorporate the changes when they use the symbol in future, the release said. However, many departments are still using the old logo despite the circular issued to all department heads and others.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/130617/kerala-departments-obsessed-with-old-emblem.html | title=Kerala: Departments obsessed with old emblem! | newspaper=Deccan Chronicle | date=13 June 2017 | accessdate=22 January 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient Kerala===\n\nThe earliest references of a national emblem in Kerala can be traced to times of [[Chera Dynasty|Imperial Cheras]] who ruled much of the modern Kerala until 1102 AD.\n\n===Medieval Kerala===\n\nMuch of the medieval period started after partition of Chera Empire by last Chera Emperor, [[Rama Varma Kulashekhara|Cheraman Perumal]] in 1102 AD, forming a numerous small feudal states and larger kingdoms like Kochi, Zamorin, Venad etc.\n\n====Malabar====\n\nThe Malabar region comprised primarily two major kingdoms. The first and oldest among them was [[Kolathiri|Kolathunadu (Chirakkal)]], ruled by powerful Mooshika dynasty, who believes to direct descent of first line of Chera Emperors. There emblem a chained oil lamp (changalavattam) above it, further above a vertically placed the Great Sword of Nandakam, followed on either adjacent sides by a Vaakapoovu, a red flower known for its fragrance. The first large empire to be formed in post Chera period under the suzerainty of [[Nair|Nair Kings]], the [[Saamoothiri|Zamorins]] of [[History of Kozhikode|Calicut]]. The Zamorins was the first state to mark use of a formal state emblem, that can be regularly used as identification of the state in all its official correspondences.\n\nThe legend says, that during partition of Kerala, the last Chera Emperor did not give any land to his most trusted Nair lieutenant. Due to the feel of guilt, the emperor gave his personal sword (Odaval) and his favourite prayer [[Shankha|conch]] which was broken, to his general and asked him to occupy as much as land he can with his might. The general established the state of [[Kozhikode]] and created an empire for himself. As a token of his respect to the Chera Emperor, the Zamorins adopted the logo of 2 swords crossed each other, with a broken [[Shankha|conch]] in middle and a lighted lamp above it. Soon this became the official emblem of Malabar until 1766 AD, when [[Kingdom of Mysore#Under Haider and Tipu|Mysore state]] under leadership of [[Hyder Ali]] defeated the Zamorins and annexed the state into it.\n\n===Colonial Kerala===\n\n====Portuguese Cochin====\n\n[[File:Blason of Goa (ancient).svg|thumb|right|100px|The oldest emblem of Portuguese Cochin]] The Portuguese, after issues with Zamorin, soon made [[Fort Kochi]] as its capital, after gaining extra-terrotorial rights from Kochi King.

The original logo, though designed in Kochi to represent the new state, was formally unveiled in 1510 after transferring the capital to [[Portuguese Goa State]].\n\n====Dutch Cochin====\n[[File:VOC.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Emblem of Dutch Cochin]]\nThe Dutch under [[Dutch East India Company]], soon came to Kochi and took over the Fort Immanuel from Portuguese after the Battle of Kochi in 1510. With this Kochi came under Dutch protection.\n\nThe Dutch Cochin shared the emblem of [[Dutch East India Company]] as its formal state emblem. The emblem was just a monogram carrying ''VOC'', an abbreviation of ''Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie''. The remains of the official emblem of Dutch Cochin, can be still seen on top of VOC Gate in [[Fort Kochi]], which was the main office of Dutch establishment in India.\n\n====Kingdom of Kochi====\n\nWhile Portuguese, Dutch and British were fighting each other over Fort Kochi and allied possessions, the Kingdom of Kochi retained its autonomy and maintained its administration separately. The Kingdom of Kochi has its traditional emblem derived its traditional family - the [[Cochin Royal Family|Perumpadappu Swaroopam]].

The new emblem was recognized by British Government as official emblem of the Kingdom of Kochi and regularly used in all correspondences and decrees of the state.\n\nIn 1902, [[Sir Sri Rama Varma|H.H Rajarishi Rama Varma Maharaja]] modified the state emblem to suit to his western tastes. 2 guarding elephants were added, in addition to a banner below the original emblem carrying the official motto in English along with addition of Kochi Crown Image to its crest. The emblem continued to represent the Kingdom until 1947 when the state merged with [[Travancore]] to form a new state of Travancore-Kochi.\n\n====Kingdom of Travancore====\n[[File:Travancore Emblem.jpg|thumb|Right|The 4th Royal Coat of Arms of Kingdom of Travancore until 1948.]]\n[[Travancore]] was formed in 1729, under leadership of H.H [[Marthanda Varma]]. Since the days of Venad, the family emblem of Thrippapur Swaroopam namely a [[Shankha|right swelled Conch]] was used to represent the state. As the family deity was Lord [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple|Sri Padmanabha]], the emblem of conch was widely used. Marthanda Varma added two [[laurel wreath]]s to it, to decorate the image which was used extensively in banners, flags, personal standards and coins until 1948.\n\nIn 1939, the Government of Travancore unveiled its new emblem with 2 elephants guarding the imperial crest of Shanku with a banner below to its crest carrying the words \"Sri Padmanabha\" in devanagiri script. The new coat of arms was the fourth revision of the emblem of the Kingdom of Travancore.\n\nIn addition, the Travancore had a western styled coat of arms, awarded by British Government during [[Delhi Durbar]] as well as individual Royal Cypher during reigns of each monarch, which will abbreviation of name of the reigning monarch in English with emblem of Shanku on top of it.\n\n===Modern Kerala===\n\n====Travancore-Cochin====\n\nIn 1948, the Kingdoms of Travancore and Cochin merged to form the state of [[Travancore-Cochin]] within the [[Dominion of India]], after deciding to accede to the Indian Union soon after [[Independence of India|Indian independence]].\n\nThe newly formed government, under leadership of [[Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai]] decided to adopt a new emblem for the state. The emblem was mixture of Travancore Coat of Arms along with Indian Union, 2 elephants in guarding position with an Indian [[Ashoka Chakra|Dharma Chakra]] in middle and the Sri Padmanabha's Shanku on top of it with a banner carrying words \"Government of Travancore-Kochi\" written in English. The emblem was in use until 1956.\n\n====Communist Kerala====\n[[File:Communist Govt.jpg|thumb|right|The Communist Government of Kerala's Emblem from 1957\u20131959.]]\nWith passing of States Reorganization Act of 1956 by Indian Parliament, the state of Kerala was formed merging Travancore-Cochin with Malabar. After the elections of 1957, the communists led by [[E. M. S. Namboodiripad]] came to power. The newly formed Communist Government decided to adopt a different state emblem as the emblem in use was an inherited legacy of monarchy days. The state emblem with the Communist Government adopted in 1957 featured an Indian elephant representing Cochin, 2 [[Shankha|Shanku]] on its crest representing Northern and Southern Travancore respectively and two palm-trees for the Northern and Southern Malabar, encircled in a crest with Indian National emblem on top.\n\nHowever much of the public was against the move to adopt new emblem and opposed it vigorously.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n====Present====\n\nWith the [[Vimochana samaram|removal of communist government]] from power in 1959, the newly formed Congress led coalition government adopted the current emblem with slight modifications from original Travancore Coat of Arms. The emblem devised by Communist Government was later adopted by [[Kerala Police]] with slight modifications to represent the force.\n\n==Other versions==\n\nThough the official state emblem is governed as per Government Order passed in 1960, a slight modified versions are used by certain Government departments. For example, Industries Department uses a cog wheel around the Shanku emblem as the shield, whereas local self governments like Panchyats etc. uses an Ashoka Chakra as the shield around the Shanku. Kerala Sports Council replaces traditional laurel as shield as well as Indian emblem as its emblem leaving just 2 elephants and Shanku. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, also uses the state emblem in a different shade and replaces the banner with KSRTC lettering.\n\nThe [[Travancore Royal Family]] uses the erstwhile Royal Coat of Arms of Travancore today for its official purposes, though commonly the Imperial Insignia of Shanku is used more commonly.whereas [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple|Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] of Trivandrum uses only the Imperial Conch crest as its coat of arms.\n\n==Government banner==\nThe Government of Kerala can be represented by a banner displaying the emblem of the state on a white field.<ref>https://www.dreamstime.com/kerala-state-india-flag-textile-cloth-fabric-waving-top-sunrise-mist-fog-kerala-state-india-flag-textile-cloth-fabric-image127909936</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:..Kerala Flag(INDIA).png|Banner of Kerala\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Emblem of India]]\n* [[List of Indian state emblems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Seals of Kerala}}\n* [http://www.hubert-herald.nl/BhaKerala.htm Kerala at National Arms and Emblems]\n* [https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/130617/kerala-departments-obsessed-with-old-emblem.html Kerala: Departments obsessed with old emblem!

For example, Industries Department uses a cog wheel around the Shanku emblem as the shield, whereas local self governments like Panchyats etc. uses an Ashoka Chakra as the shield around the Shanku. Kerala Sports Council replaces traditional laurel as shield as well as Indian emblem as its emblem leaving just 2 elephants and Shanku. Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, also uses the state emblem in a different shade and replaces the banner with KSRTC lettering.\n\nThe [[Travancore Royal Family]] uses the erstwhile Royal Coat of Arms of Travancore today for its official purposes, though commonly the Imperial Insignia of Shanku is used more commonly.whereas [[Padmanabhaswamy Temple|Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple]] of Trivandrum uses only the Imperial Conch crest as its coat of arms.\n\n==Government banner==\nThe Government of Kerala can be represented by a banner displaying the emblem of the state on a white field. <ref>https://www.dreamstime.com/kerala-state-india-flag-textile-cloth-fabric-waving-top-sunrise-mist-fog-kerala-state-india-flag-textile-cloth-fabric-image127909936</ref>\n<gallery>\nFile:..Kerala Flag(INDIA).png|Banner of Kerala\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[National Emblem of India]]\n* [[List of Indian state emblems]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Seals of Kerala}}\n* [http://www.hubert-herald.nl/BhaKerala.htm Kerala at National Arms and Emblems]\n* [https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/130617/kerala-departments-obsessed-with-old-emblem.html Kerala: Departments obsessed with old emblem!
