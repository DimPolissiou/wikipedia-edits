Chand Bardai was a court poet of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], the famous ruler of [[Delhi]] and [[Ajmer]] during the invasion of [[Muhammad of Ghor]].\n\nJayachand, the last ruler of Kannauj belonging to the [[Rathore]] [[Rajput]] clan, gave more patronage to [[Sanskrit]] rather than local dialects. Harsha, the author of ''Naishdhiya Charitra'', was his court poet. Jagnayak (sometimes Jagnik), the royal poet in [[Mahoba]], and Nalha, the royal poet in [[Ajmer]], were the other prominent literary figures in this period. However, after Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat in the [[Second Battle of Tarain]], most literary works belonging to this period were destroyed by the army of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. Very few scriptures and manuscripts from this period are available and their genuineness is also doubted.\n\nSome [[Siddha]] and Nathpanthi poetical works belonging to this period are also found, but their genuineness is again, doubted. The Siddhas belonged to the [[Vajrayana]], a later [[Buddhist|Buddhist sect]]. Some scholars argue that the language of Siddha poetry is not an earlier form of Hindi, but [[Magadhi]] [[Prakrit]]. Nathpanthis were [[yoga|yogis]] who practised the [[Hatha yoga]]. Some [[Jainism|Jain]] and ''Rasau'' (heroic poets) poetry works are also available from this period.\n\nIn the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region in South India, [[Dakkhini]] or Hindavi was used. It flourished under the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later under the [[Nizam]]s of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. It was written in the [[Persian language|Persian]] script. Nevertheless, the Hindavi literature can be considered as proto-Hindi literature. Many Deccani experts like Sheikh Ashraf or Mulla Vajahi used the word ''Hindavi'' to describe this dialect. Others such as Roustami, Nishati etc. preferred to call it Deccani. Shah Buharnuddin Janam Bijapuri used to call it Hindi. The first Deccani author was Khwaja Bandanawaz Gesudaraz Muhammad Hasan. He wrote three prose works \u2013 Mirazul Aashkini, Hidayatnama and Risala Sehwara. His grandson Abdulla Hussaini wrote ''Nishatul Ishq''. The first Deccani poet was Nizami.\n\nDuring the later part of this period and early Bhakti Kala, many saint-poets like [[Ramanand]] and [[Gorakhnath]] became famous. The earliest form of Hindi can also be seen in some of [[Vidyapati]]'s [[Maithili language#Literature|Maithili]] works.\n\n=== Bhakti kaal (c. 1375 to 1700) ===\nThe medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of [[Bhakti]] movement and composition of long, epic poems.\n\n[[Awadhi]] and [[Braj Bhasha]] were the dialects in which literature was developed. The main works in Avadhi are [[Malik Muhammad Jayasi]]'s ''Padmavat'' and [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Ramacharitamanas]]''. The major works in Braj dialect are [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Vinaya Patrika]]'' and [[Surdas]]'s ''[[Sur Sagar]]''. [[Sadhukaddi]] was also a language commonly used, especially by [[Kabir]] in his poetry and dohas.<ref>[http://www.crl.edu/focus/Spr05litGems.asp?issID=3 Mystic poet Kabir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925005457/http://www.crl.edu/focus/Spr05litGems.asp?issID=3 |date=25 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Bhakti period also marked great theoretical development in poetry forms chiefly from a mixture of older forms of poetry. These included Verse Patterns like ''[[Doha (Indian literature)|Doha]]'' (two-liners), ''Sortha'', ''Chaupaya'' (four-liners) etc. This was also the age when Poetry was characterised under the various [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasas]]. Unlike the [[Adi Kaal]] (also called the [[Vir Gatha Kaal]]) which was characterised by an overdose of Poetry in the ''Vir Rasa'' (Heroic Poetry), the Bhakti Yug marked a much more diverse and vibrant form of poetry which spanned the whole gamut of [http://wapedia.mobi/hi/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8_(%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0) rasas]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from ''Shringara rasa'' (love), ''Vir Rasa'' (Heroism).\n\nBhakti poetry had two schools \u2013 the ''Nirguna'' school (the believers of a formless God or an abstract name) and the ''Saguna'' school (the believers of a God with attributes and worshippers of Vishnu's incarnations). [[Kabir]] and [[Guru Nanak]] belong to the Nirguna school, and their philosophy was greatly influenced by the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Adi Sankaracharya]]. They believed in the concept of [[Nirgun Nirakaar Bramh]] or the Shapeless Formless One. The [[Saguna]] school was represented by mainly [[Vaishnava]] poets like [[Surdas]], [[Tulsidas]] and others and was a logical extension of the Dvaita and Vishishta Advaita Philosophy propounded by the likes of Madhavacharya etc. This school was chiefly [[Vaishnava]] in orientation as in seen in the main compositions like [[Ramacharitamanas]], [[Sur Saravali]], [[Sur Sagar]] extoling [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].\n\nThis was also the age of tremendous integration between the Hindu and the Islamic elements in the Arts with the advent of many Muslim Bhakti poets like [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana]] who was a court poet to [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] and was a great devotee of Krishna. The Nirgun School of Bhakti Poetry was also tremendously secular in nature and its propounders like Kabir and Guru Nanak had a large number of followers irrespective of caste or religion.\n\n=== Riti-kavya kal (c. 1700 to 1900) ===\nIn the ''Ritikavya'' or ''Ritismagra Kavya'' period, the erotic element became predominant in the [[Hindi]] literature. This era is called Riti (meaning 'procedure') because it was the age when poetic figures and theory were developed to the fullest. But this emphasis on poetry theory greatly reduced the emotional aspects of poetry\u2014the main characteristic of the Bhakti movement\u2014and the actual content of the poetry became less important. The Saguna School of the Bhakti Yug split into two schools (Rama bhakti and Krishna bhakti) somewhere in the interregnum of the Bhakti and the Reeti Eras. Although most Reeti works were outwordly related to [[Krishna]] [[Bhakti]], their emphasis had changed from total devotion to the supreme being to the\n[[Shringar]] or erotic aspects of Krishna's life\u2014his Leela, his pranks with the Gopis in [[Braj]], and the description of the physical beauty of [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]],(Krishna's Consort). The poetry of [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]], and [[Ghananand Das]] fit this bill. The most well known book from this age is the [[Satasai|Bihari Satsai]] of [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]], a collection of Dohas (couplets), dealing with ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion), ''Neeti'' (Moral policies) and ''Shringar'' (love).\n\nThe first Hindi books, using the [[Devanagari script]] or [[N\u0101gar\u012b script]] were one Heera Lal's treatise on [[Ain-i-Akbari]], called Ain e Akbari ki Bhasha Vachanika, and Rewa Mharaja's treatise on [[Kabir]]. Both books came out in 1795. Munshi [[Lallu Lal]]'s Hindi translation of Sanskrit [[Hitopadesha]] was published in 1809. Lala Srinivas Das published a novel in Hindi [[Pariksha guru]] in the [[N\u0101gar\u012b script]] in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756753/your-article-on-hindi-chauvinism-had-factual-inaccuracies|title='Your article on Hindi chauvinism had factual inaccuracies'}}</ref> Shardha Ram Phillauri wrote a Hindi novel [[Bhagyawati]] which was published in 1888.\n\n[[Chandrakanta (novel)|Chandrakanta]], written by [[Devaki Nandan Khatri]] in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756105/stop-outraging-over-marathi-hindi-and-english-chauvinism-is-much-worse-in-india|title=Stop outraging over Marathi \u2013 Hindi and English chauvinism is much worse in India}}</ref> The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement.\n\n=== Adhunik kal (c. 1900 onwards) ===\nIn 1800, the [[British East India Company]] established [[Fort William College]] at [[Calcutta]]. The College president [[John Borthwick Gilchrist|J. B. Gilchrist]] hired professors to write books in Hindustani. Some of these books were ''Prem Sagar'' by [[Lallu Lal]], ''Naasiketopaakhyan'' by Sadal Mishra, ''Sukhsagar'' by Sadasukhlal of Delhi and ''Rani Ketaki ki kahani'' by Munshi Inshallah Khan.\n\n[[File:Surya chariot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A depiction of [[Surya]] in an 1884 book, ''Indrajalakala'' (The Art of Magic); Jwala Prakash Press, [[Meerut]] ]]\n\nThe person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand's novels have been translated into many other languages.\n\n<!--\n====Bhartendu Yug====\n-->\n\n====Dwivedi Yug====\nThe ''Dwivedi Yug'' (\"Age of Dwivedi\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]], who played a major role in establishing the modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of the Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love. He encouraged poetry in Hindi dedicated to nationalism and social reform.<ref name=lmnph>Lucy (aka \"Ludmila\") Rosenstein, editor, translator, author of the [https://books.google.com/books?id=yt2ROIhYfC4C&printsec=frontcover#PPA1,M1 \"Introduction\"], ''New Poetry in Hindi: Nayi Kavita: An Introduction'', Anthem Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-84331-125-6}}</ref>\n\nDwivedi became the editor of ''[[Saraswati (magazine)|Saraswati]]'' in 1903,  the first Hindi monthly magazine of India, which was established in 1900.<ref name=pib>{{cite web | title = Education will lay the foundation of India\u2019s future, says President | url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=102161 |work=[[Press Information Bureau]], President's Secretariat |date=25 December 2013|accessdate = 2014-09-19}}</ref> He used it to crusade for reforms in the Hindi literature. One of the most prominent poems of the period was [[Maithili Sharan Gupt]]'s ''Bharat-bharati'', which evokes the past glory of India. [[Shridhar Prathak]]'s ''Bharatgit'' is another renowned poem of the period.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\nSome scholars have labelled much of the poetry of this period as \"versified propaganda\". According to Lucy Rosenstein: \"It is verse of public statement; its language is functional but aesthetically unappealing. Earnestly concerned with social issues and moral values, it is puritanical poetry in which aesthetic considerations are secondary. Imagination, originality, poetic sensibility and expression are wanting, the metre is restrictive, the idiom clumsy.\" She adds, however, that the period was important for laying the foundations to the modern Hindi poetry and that it did reflect sensitivity to social issues of the time. However, she also adds that the inelegance is a typical feature of a \"young\" poetry, as she considers Modern Hindi.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\nWithout a poetic tradition in modern Hindi, poets often modeled their forms on Braj, and later on Sanskrit, Urdu, Bengali and English forms, often ill-suited to Hindi. The subjects of the poems tended to be communal rather than personal. Characters were often presented not as individuals but as social types.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\n====Chhayavaadi Yug====\nIn the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as ''[[Chhayavaad]]'' (''shadowism'') and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as ''Chhayavaadi''. [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], [[Mahadevi Varma]] and [[Sumitranandan Pant]], are the four major ''Chhayavaadi'' poets. Poet [[Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar']] was another great poet with some Chayavaadi element in his poetry although he wrote in other genres as well.\n\nThis period of [[Neo-romanticism]], represents the adolescence of Hindi Poetry. It is marked by beauty of expression and flow of intense emotion. The four representative poets of this era represent the best in Hindi Poetry. A unique feature of this period is the emotional (and sometimes active) attachment of poets with national freedom struggle, their effort to understand and imbibe the vast spirit of a magnificent ancient culture and their towering genius which grossly overshadowed all the literary 'talked abouts' of next seven decades.\n\nOther important genres of ''Adhunik Sahitya'' (Modernism) are: '''Prayogvad''' (Experimentalism) of [[Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan 'Ajneya'|Ajneya]] and the ''[[Tar Saptak]]'' poets, also known as ''Nayi Kavita'' (New Poetry) and ''Nayi Kahani'' (New Story) of [[Nirmal Verma]] and others; followed by '''Pragativad''' (Progressivism) of [[Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh]] and other authors.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026144551/http://geocities.com/indian_poets/hindi.html Indian Poets Writing In Hindi]</ref>\n\n===Nakenwad===\nAmong the numerous schools of poetry which sprang up in the fifties of this century was ''Nakenwad'', a school deriving its nomenclature from the first letters of the names of its three pioneers \u2013 [[Nalin Vilochan Sharma]], [[Kesari Kumar]], and [[Naresh Mehta]] all poets of note in their own right.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\">{{cite book\n| first = Mohan\n| last = Lal\n| title = Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature\n| publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]]\n| year = 1992\n| pages = 820\n| isbn = 978-81-260-1221-3\n}}</ref> Apart from being poets, Nalin Vilochan and Kesari Kumar were also brilliant critics, with a wide perspective on literary history.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\"/> Their critical attitude is marked by a synthesis or coordination of various disciplines of human knowledge \u2013 philosophy, history, art and culture, all pressed into the service of literary appraisal and analysis.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\"/>\n\n===Genres of Hindi Literature===\n\n===Hindi Kavita (Poetry)===\nHindi has a rich legacy of poetry.

Vyangya writings includes the essence of sarcasm and humour. Some of the better known writers in this genre are, [[Harishankar Parsai]](Hindi: \u0939\u0930\u093f\u0936\u0902\u0915\u0930 \u092a\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0908) (August 22, 1924 \u2013 1995) was a Hindi writer.

[[Rahul Sankrityayan]] was one of the greatest travelled scholars of India, spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home. He is known as the (''\"Father of Hindi [[Travel literature]]\"''). [[Baba Nagarjun]] was a major Hindi and Maithili poet who has also penned a number of novels, short stories, literary biographies and travelogues, and was known as (\"''Janakavi- the People's Poet''\").\n\n===Hindi playwriting===\nThe pioneer of [[Hindi theatre]] as well as playwrighting, [[Bhartendu Harishchandra]] wrote ''Satya Harishchandra'' (1875), ''Bharat Durdasha'' (1876) and ''Andher Nagari'' (1878), in the late 19th century, [[Jaishankar Prasad]] became the next big figure in Hindi playwriting with plays like ''Skanda Gupta'' (1928), ''Chandragupta'' (1931) and ''Dhruvswamini'' (1933).<ref>[[#Dm|Dimitrova, p. 15]]</ref><ref>[[#Da|Datta, p. 1075]]</ref>\n\nAs the Independence struggle was gathering steam playwrights broaching issues of nationalism and subversive ideas against the British, yet to dodge censorship they adapted themes from mythology, history and legend and used them as vehicle for political messages, a trend that continues to date, though now it was employed to bring out social, personal and psychological issues rather than clearly political, though street theatre broke this trend in coming decades in post-independence era, like IPTA-inspired, Naya Theatre of [[Habib Tanvir]] did in the 1950s\u201390s, [[Jana Natya Manch]] of [[Safdar Hashmi]] did in the 1970s\u201380s. Post-independence the emerging republic threw up new issues for playwrights to tackle and express, and Hindi playwriting showed greater brevity and symbolism, but it was not as prolific as in case with Hindi poetry or fiction.<ref>[[#Na|Nagendra, p. 661]]</ref> Yet we have playwrights like [[Jagdish Chandra Mathur]] (''Konark'') and [[Upendranath Ashk]] (''Anjo Didi''), who displayed a steadily evolving understanding of stagecraft.

On 17 August 1880, he started a 3rd weekly- Ucchit Vakta- meaning Right or Best Time.  Ucchit Vakta focused on spreading the truth (about the British Raj) and fighting for justice. It became very popular for many years.\n\nMishra underwent a lot of difficulties trying to bring out a critical publication at the time of the British Raj. At times he was the editor, writer and also sold the paper himself.\nHe was an inspiration for many journalists, particularly Bal Mukund Gupta.\n\n'''Dharmvir Bharati'''\n\nBorn on 25 December 1926, [[Dharamvir Bharati]] graduated in BA (first class) in 1945 and in 1947 completed his MA in Hindi literature (first class) and finally did his PhD from Allahabad University. For some time he was principal of Allahabad University.\n\nHe began his journalist career in Abhyudaya, a journal by Padmakant Malviya. He then joined Sangam, edited by Ilachand Joshi and then became editor of Dharmayug. Thanks to Bharati, this journal became very popular.\n\nDuring the 1971 war, Bharati reported from the frontlines of the battle. He covered all the horrors of the war. His series of reports, the finest in Hindi war journalism, were published under the title of 'Yudh Yatra'. As an honest and dedicated reporter, Bharati was unrivaled. After the war, he became editor of 2 more journals- Aalochana and Nikarshak.\n\nBharati was also famous as a short story writer, poet, essayist and novelist. The best known of his works are 'Band Galli ka Aakhiri Makaan', 'Andha Yug', 'Kunpriya'.\n\n'''Bharatendu Harishchandra'''\n\n[[Bharatendu Harishchandra]] began his career as a journalist at the age of 17.

Bharatendu kept the journal up until his death 1885.\nBecause of his extraordinary achievements, he is considered the most prolific Hindi journalist.\n\n'''Madan Mohan Malaviya'''\n\n[[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] was born in 1861 in Allahabad to a Brahmin family. From 1885 to 1887 was the editor of Indian Opinion. He was a strong supporter of the Congress. He helped launch the newspaper Dainik Hindustan and was its editor from 1887 to 1889. He was a close friend of many eminent Hindi writers like Gopalram Gehmari, Amrutlal Chakravarty and Pandit Pratap Narayan Mishra.\n\nAlong with Bal Mukund Gupta, he launched an Urdu journal 'Kohinoor' from Lahore. In those days, Gupta was not a facile Hindi scholar, but under Malviya's training, Gupta became editor of Bharat Mitra.\nIn 1908, Malviya founded a new revolutionary journal Abhyudaya from Prayag. The renowned writer [[Purushottam Das Tandon]] was a frequent contributor to it.\n\nAfter Abhyudaya, Malviya founded a monthly magazine 'Maryada', in 1909 he founded a daily 'Leader' and later on another daily \u2013 'Bharat'.\n\nMalviya was a great patriot and his love for his country was seen in all of his writings.\nHe also contributed to Aaj, and helped to found the Hindustan Times in 1933, along with its Hindi counterpart Hindustan.\nBabu Gulabrai (17 January 1888 \u2013 13 April 1963) (pen name: Gulabrai MA) was one of the greatest literary figures of modern Hindi literature.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Literature}}\n* [[Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya]], an [[Central University (India)|Indian central university]] with a literary focus\n*[[Hindustani orthography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |title=Indian Literature|author=Dr. Nagendra |publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|year=1988|isbn= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC&pg=PA661&dq=%22Hindi+drama%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=20#v=onepage&q=%22Hindi%20drama%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |ref=Na}}\n* {{cite book |title=Western tradition and naturalistic Hindi theatre|author=Diana Dimitrova |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher=Peter Lang|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-6822-3 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FA9qAKpUtTIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hindi+theatre#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref=Dm }}\n* {{cite book |title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), Volume 2|author=Amaresh Datta|publisher=Sahitya Akademi |year=2006|isbn=81-260-1194-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1075&dq=%22Hindi+drama%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=11#v=onepage&q=%22Hindi%20drama%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |ref=Da }}\n==Further reading==\n* ''Hindi Literature'', by Ram Awadh Dwivedi.

Chand Bardai was a court poet of [[Prithviraj Chauhan]], the famous ruler of [[Delhi]] and [[Ajmer]] during the invasion of [[Muhammad of Ghor]].\n\nJayachand, the last ruler of Kannauj belonging to the [[Rathore]] [[Rajput]] clan, gave more patronage to [[Sanskrit]] rather than local dialects. Harsha, the author of ''Naishdhiya Charitra'', was his court poet. Jagnayak (sometimes Jagnik), the royal poet in [[Mahoba]], and Nalha, the royal poet in [[Ajmer]], were the other prominent literary figures in this period. However, after Prithviraj Chauhan's defeat in the [[Second Battle of Tarain]], most literary works belonging to this period were destroyed by the army of [[Muhammad of Ghor]]. Very few scriptures and manuscripts from this period are available and their genuineness is also doubted.\n\nSome [[Siddha]] and Nathpanthi poetical works belonging to this period are also found, but their genuineness is again, doubted. The Siddhas belonged to the [[Vajrayana]], a later [[Buddhist|Buddhist sect]]. Some scholars argue that the language of Siddha poetry is not an earlier form of Hindi, but [[Magadhi]] [[Prakrit]]. Nathpanthis were [[yoga|yogis]] who practised the [[Hatha yoga]]. Some [[Jainism|Jain]] and ''Rasau'' (heroic poets) poetry works are also available from this period.\n\nIn the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] region in South India, [[Dakkhini]] or Hindavi was used. It flourished under the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later under the [[Nizam]]s of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. It was written in the [[Persian language|Persian]] script. Nevertheless, the Hindavi literature can be considered as proto-Hindi literature. Many Deccani experts like Sheikh Ashraf or Mulla Vajahi used the word ''Hindavi'' to describe this dialect. Others such as Roustami, Nishati etc. preferred to call it Deccani. Shah Buharnuddin Janam Bijapuri used to call it Hindi. The first Deccani author was Khwaja Bandanawaz Gesudaraz Muhammad Hasan. He wrote three prose works \u2013 Mirazul Aashkini, Hidayatnama and Risala Sehwara. His grandson Abdulla Hussaini wrote ''Nishatul Ishq''. The first Deccani poet was Nizami.\n\nDuring the later part of this period and early Bhakti Kala, many saint-poets like [[Ramanand]] and [[Gorakhnath]] became famous. The earliest form of Hindi can also be seen in some of [[Vidyapati]]'s [[Maithili language#Literature|Maithili]] works.\n\n=== Bhakti kaal (c. 1375 to 1700) ===\nThe medieval Hindi literature is marked by the influence of [[Bhakti]] movement and composition of long, epic poems.\n\n[[Awadhi]] and [[Braj Bhasha]] were the dialects in which literature was developed. The main works in Avadhi are [[Malik Muhammad Jayasi]]'s ''Padmavat'' and [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Ramacharitamanas]]''. The major works in Braj dialect are [[Tulsidas]]'s ''[[Vinaya Patrika]]'' and [[Surdas]]'s ''[[Sur Sagar]]''. [[Sadhukaddi]] was also a language commonly used, especially by [[Kabir]] in his poetry and dohas.<ref>[http://www.crl.edu/focus/Spr05litGems.asp?issID=3 Mystic poet Kabir] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925005457/http://www.crl.edu/focus/Spr05litGems.asp?issID=3 |date=25 September 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe Bhakti period also marked great theoretical development in poetry forms chiefly from a mixture of older forms of poetry. These included Verse Patterns like ''[[Doha (Indian literature)|Doha]]'' (two-liners), ''Sortha'', ''Chaupaya'' (four-liners) etc. This was also the age when Poetry was characterised under the various [[Rasa (aesthetics)|Rasas]]. Unlike the [[Adi Kaal]] (also called the [[Vir Gatha Kaal]]) which was characterised by an overdose of Poetry in the ''Vir Rasa'' (Heroic Poetry), the Bhakti Yug marked a much more diverse and vibrant form of poetry which spanned the whole gamut of [http://wapedia.mobi/hi/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8_(%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0) rasas]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from ''Shringara rasa'' (love), ''Vir Rasa'' (Heroism).\n\nBhakti poetry had two schools \u2013 the ''Nirguna'' school (the believers of a formless God or an abstract name) and the ''Saguna'' school (the believers of a God with attributes and worshippers of Vishnu's incarnations). [[Kabir]] and [[Guru Nanak]] belong to the Nirguna school, and their philosophy was greatly influenced by the [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy of [[Adi Sankaracharya]]. They believed in the concept of [[Nirgun Nirakaar Bramh]] or the Shapeless Formless One. The [[Saguna]] school was represented by mainly [[Vaishnava]] poets like [[Surdas]], [[Tulsidas]] and others and was a logical extension of the Dvaita and Vishishta Advaita Philosophy propounded by the likes of Madhavacharya etc. This school was chiefly [[Vaishnava]] in orientation as in seen in the main compositions like [[Ramacharitamanas]], [[Sur Saravali]], [[Sur Sagar]] extoling [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].\n\nThis was also the age of tremendous integration between the Hindu and the Islamic elements in the Arts with the advent of many Muslim Bhakti poets like [[Abdul Rahim Khan-I-Khana]] who was a court poet to [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] and was a great devotee of Krishna. The Nirgun School of Bhakti Poetry was also tremendously secular in nature and its propounders like Kabir and Guru Nanak had a large number of followers irrespective of caste or religion.\n\n=== Riti-kavya kal (c. 1700 to 1900) ===\nIn the ''Ritikavya'' or ''Ritismagra Kavya'' period, the erotic element became predominant in the [[Hindi]] literature. This era is called Riti (meaning 'procedure') because it was the age when poetic figures and theory were developed to the fullest. But this emphasis on poetry theory greatly reduced the emotional aspects of poetry\u2014the main characteristic of the Bhakti movement\u2014and the actual content of the poetry became less important. The Saguna School of the Bhakti Yug split into two schools (Rama bhakti and Krishna bhakti) somewhere in the interregnum of the Bhakti and the Reeti Eras. Although most Reeti works were outwordly related to [[Krishna]] [[Bhakti]], their emphasis had changed from total devotion to the supreme being to the\n[[Shringar]] or erotic aspects of Krishna's life\u2014his Leela, his pranks with the Gopis in [[Braj]], and the description of the physical beauty of [[Krishna]] and [[Radha]],(Krishna's Consort). The poetry of [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]], and [[Ghananand Das]] fit this bill. The most well known book from this age is the [[Satasai|Bihari Satsai]] of [[Bihari (poet)|Bihari]], a collection of Dohas (couplets), dealing with ''[[Bhakti]]'' (devotion), ''Neeti'' (Moral policies) and ''Shringar'' (love).\n\nThe first Hindi books, using the [[Devanagari script]] or [[N\u0101gar\u012b script]] were one Heera Lal's treatise on [[Ain-i-Akbari]], called Ain e Akbari ki Bhasha Vachanika, and Rewa Mharaja's treatise on [[Kabir]]. Both books came out in 1795. Munshi [[Lallu Lal]]'s Hindi translation of Sanskrit [[Hitopadesha]] was published in 1809. Lala Srinivas Das published a novel in Hindi [[Pariksha guru]] in the [[N\u0101gar\u012b script]] in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756753/your-article-on-hindi-chauvinism-had-factual-inaccuracies|title='Your article on Hindi chauvinism had factual inaccuracies'}}</ref> Shardha Ram Phillauri wrote a Hindi novel [[Bhagyawati]] which was published in 1888.\n\n[[Chandrakanta (novel)|Chandrakanta]], written by [[Devaki Nandan Khatri]] in 1888, is considered the first authentic work of prose in modern Hindi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scroll.in/article/756105/stop-outraging-over-marathi-hindi-and-english-chauvinism-is-much-worse-in-india|title=Stop outraging over Marathi \u2013 Hindi and English chauvinism is much worse in India}}</ref> The person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement.\n\n=== Adhunik kal (c. 1900 onwards) ===\nIn 1800, the [[British East India Company]] established [[Fort William College]] at [[Calcutta]]. The College president [[John Borthwick Gilchrist|J. B. Gilchrist]] hired professors to write books in Hindustani. Some of these books were ''Prem Sagar'' by [[Lallu Lal]], ''Naasiketopaakhyan'' by Sadal Mishra, ''Sukhsagar'' by Sadasukhlal of Delhi and ''Rani Ketaki ki kahani'' by Munshi Inshallah Khan.\n\n[[File:Surya chariot.jpg|right|200px|thumb|A depiction of [[Surya]] in an 1884 book, ''Indrajalakala'' (The Art of Magic); Jwala Prakash Press, [[Meerut]] ]]\n\nThe person who brought realism in the Hindi prose literature was [[Munshi Premchand]], who is considered as the most revered figure in the world of Hindi fiction and progressive movement. Before Premchand, the Hindi literature revolved around fairy or magical tales, entertaining stories and religious themes. Premchand's novels have been translated into many other languages.\n\n<!--\n====Bhartendu Yug====\n-->\n\n====Dwivedi Yug====\nThe ''Dwivedi Yug'' (\"Age of Dwivedi\") in Hindi literature lasted from 1900 to 1918. It is named after [[Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi]], who played a major role in establishing the modern Hindi language in poetry and broadening the acceptable subjects of the Hindi poetry from the traditional ones of religion and romantic love. He encouraged poetry in Hindi dedicated to nationalism and social reform.<ref name=lmnph>Lucy (aka \"Ludmila\") Rosenstein, editor, translator, author of the [https://books.google.com/books?id=yt2ROIhYfC4C&printsec=frontcover#PPA1,M1 \"Introduction\"], ''New Poetry in Hindi: Nayi Kavita: An Introduction'', Anthem Press, 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-84331-125-6}}</ref>\n\nDwivedi became the editor of ''[[Saraswati (magazine)|Saraswati]]'' in 1903,  the first Hindi monthly magazine of India, which was established in 1900.<ref name=pib>{{cite web | title = Education will lay the foundation of India\u2019s future, says President | url = http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=102161 |work=[[Press Information Bureau]], President's Secretariat |date=25 December 2013|accessdate = 2014-09-19}}</ref> He used it to crusade for reforms in the Hindi literature. One of the most prominent poems of the period was [[Maithili Sharan Gupt]]'s ''Bharat-bharati'', which evokes the past glory of India. [[Shridhar Prathak]]'s ''Bharatgit'' is another renowned poem of the period.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\nSome scholars have labelled much of the poetry of this period as \"versified propaganda\". According to Lucy Rosenstein: \"It is verse of public statement; its language is functional but aesthetically unappealing. Earnestly concerned with social issues and moral values, it is puritanical poetry in which aesthetic considerations are secondary. Imagination, originality, poetic sensibility and expression are wanting, the metre is restrictive, the idiom clumsy.\" She adds, however, that the period was important for laying the foundations to the modern Hindi poetry and that it did reflect sensitivity to social issues of the time. However, she also adds that the inelegance is a typical feature of a \"young\" poetry, as she considers Modern Hindi.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\nWithout a poetic tradition in modern Hindi, poets often modeled their forms on Braj, and later on Sanskrit, Urdu, Bengali and English forms, often ill-suited to Hindi. The subjects of the poems tended to be communal rather than personal. Characters were often presented not as individuals but as social types.<ref name=lmnph/>\n\n====Chhayavaadi Yug====\nIn the 20th century, Hindi literature saw a romantic upsurge. This is known as ''[[Chhayavaad]]'' (''shadowism'') and the literary figures belonging to this school are known as ''Chhayavaadi''. [[Jaishankar Prasad]], [[Suryakant Tripathi 'Nirala']], [[Mahadevi Varma]] and [[Sumitranandan Pant]], are the four major ''Chhayavaadi'' poets. Poet [[Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkar']] was another great poet with some Chayavaadi element in his poetry although he wrote in other genres as well.\n\nThis period of [[Neo-romanticism]], represents the adolescence of Hindi Poetry. It is marked by beauty of expression and flow of intense emotion. The four representative poets of this era represent the best in Hindi Poetry. A unique feature of this period is the emotional (and sometimes active) attachment of poets with national freedom struggle, their effort to understand and imbibe the vast spirit of a magnificent ancient culture and their towering genius which grossly overshadowed all the literary 'talked abouts' of next seven decades.\n\nOther important genres of ''Adhunik Sahitya'' (Modernism) are: '''Prayogvad''' (Experimentalism) of [[Sachchidananda Hirananda Vatsyayan 'Ajneya'|Ajneya]] and the ''[[Tar Saptak]]'' poets, also known as ''Nayi Kavita'' (New Poetry) and ''Nayi Kahani'' (New Story) of [[Nirmal Verma]] and others; followed by '''Pragativad''' (Progressivism) of [[Gajanan Madhav Muktibodh]] and other authors.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20091026144551/http://geocities.com/indian_poets/hindi.html Indian Poets Writing In Hindi]</ref>\n\n===Nakenwad===\nAmong the numerous schools of poetry which sprang up in the fifties of this century was ''Nakenwad'', a school deriving its nomenclature from the first letters of the names of its three pioneers \u2013 [[Nalin Vilochan Sharma]], [[Kesari Kumar]], and [[Naresh Mehta]] all poets of note in their own right.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\">{{cite book\n| first = Mohan\n| last = Lal\n| title = Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature\n| publisher = [[Sahitya Akademi]]\n| year = 1992\n| pages = 820\n| isbn = 978-81-260-1221-3\n}}</ref> Apart from being poets, Nalin Vilochan and Kesari Kumar were also brilliant critics, with a wide perspective on literary history.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\"/> Their critical attitude is marked by a synthesis or coordination of various disciplines of human knowledge \u2013 philosophy, history, art and culture, all pressed into the service of literary appraisal and analysis.<ref name=\"Lal 1992 820\"/>\n\n===Genres of Hindi Literature===\n\n===Hindi Kavita (Poetry)===\nHindi has a rich legacy of poetry.

[[Rahul Sankrityayan]] was one of the greatest travelled scholars of India, spending forty-five years of his life on travels away from his home. He is known as the (''\"Father of Hindi [[Travel literature]]\"'').

The renowned writer [[Purushottam Das Tandon]] was a frequent contributor to it.\n\nAfter Abhyudaya, Malviya founded a monthly magazine 'Maryada', in 1909 he founded a daily 'Leader' and later on another daily \u2013 'Bharat'.\n\nMalviya was a great patriot and his love for his country was seen in all of his writings.\nHe also contributed to Aaj, and helped to found the Hindustan Times in 1933, along with its Hindi counterpart Hindustan.\nBabu Gulabrai (17 January 1888 \u2013 13 April 1963) (pen name: Gulabrai MA) was one of the greatest literary figures of modern Hindi literature.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Literature}}\n* [[Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwavidyalaya]], an [[Central University (India)|Indian central university]] with a literary focus\n*[[Hindustani orthography]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |title=Indian Literature|author=Dr. Nagendra |publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|year=1988|isbn= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC&pg=PA661&dq=%22Hindi+drama%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=20#v=onepage&q=%22Hindi%20drama%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |ref=Na}}\n* {{cite book |title=Western tradition and naturalistic Hindi theatre|author=Diana Dimitrova |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher=Peter Lang|year=2004|isbn=0-8204-6822-3 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FA9qAKpUtTIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Hindi+theatre#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref=Dm }}\n* {{cite book |title=The Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature (Volume Two) (Devraj To Jyoti), Volume 2|author=Amaresh Datta|publisher=Sahitya Akademi |year=2006|isbn=81-260-1194-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&pg=PA1075&dq=%22Hindi+drama%22+-inpublisher:icon&cd=11#v=onepage&q=%22Hindi%20drama%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&f=false |ref=Da }}\n==Further reading==\n* ''Hindi Literature'', by Ram Awadh Dwivedi.

The film stars [[Matthew Knight]], Taylor Dooley, [[Cayden Boyd]], [[David Arquette]], [[Kristin Davis]] and [[George Lopez]]. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by [[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels, [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Troublemaker Digital. \n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39 million in the United States and $69.4&nbsp;million worldwide on a $50&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMax is a 10-year-old lonely child in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] who creates an imaginary dreamworld named Planet Drool, where all of his dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (who was a marine biologist) at sea and became a shark-hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them on fire. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. Max is also bullied by fellow classmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad. After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad thanks to Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now-corrupt electrician, under the orders of an unknown mastermind.\n\nThey confront Mr. Electric in his lair, but he drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \"plughounds\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered the dreamworld with Max's journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by singing bubbles called LaLas and has a \"shark frenzy\", destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks Max why she is made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down.\n\nMax, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl eventually reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are too late to stop the corruption since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Afterwards, Mr. Electric seemingly kills Sharkboy by fooling him into jumping into water filled with [[electric eels]], which are his weakness, with Lavagirl sacrificing herself by jumping into the water to retrieve him. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees.\n\nMinus offers Mr. Electric to return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He also informs Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to destroy Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric arrives in the tornado before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the storm as well, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents.\n\nMax later informs his class that Planet Drool has become a proper dreamworld once again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Max.

Max's father is an unemployed writer. They are on the brink of a divorce. They mean well for Max, but are unable to settle his troubles.

He is a bully at Max's school and steals his Dream Journal. With it, he enters Max's dreamworld and, using the name \"Minus\" (a nickname bestowed by Mr. Electricidad for Linus' habit of disliked conduct), alters it to his version before ultimately befriending Max.\n* [[Sasha Pieterse]] as Marissa Electricidad / Ice Princess. Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, which is a necklace she wears which can freeze anything including time.\n* [[Robert Rodriguez]] has a role voicing a shark. As seen in the credits, two of Robert Rodriguez's children, Rebel and Racer, portray Sharkboy at age five and age seven respectively. Rico Torres plays Sharkboy's father. Marc Musso and [[Shane Graham]] play children at Max's school.\n\n==Production==\nParts of the film were shot on location in Texas in September to December 2004, where Max resides and goes to school in the film. Much of the film was shot in a studio against green screen. Most of the ships, landscapes and other effects including some creatures and characters, were accomplished digitally. According to Lautner and Dooley, when filming the scene with the dream train, the front part of the train was an actual physical set piece. \"The whole inside was there and when they have all the gadgets you can pull on, that was all there but everything else was a green screen,\" said Dooley.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.teenhollywood.com/d.asp?r=99961&cat=1038&p=7 | title=Hangin' with Sharkboy, Lavagirl....and Max | accessdate = August 9, 2008 | last = Barker | first = Lynn | author2 = | date = June 8, 2005 | work = | publisher = TeenHollywood.com }}</ref>\nEleven visual effects companies ([[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels and [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Rodriguez's Texas-based Troublemaker Digital) worked on the film in order to accomplish over 1,000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"DiLullo\">{{cite web | url = http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2520&ltype=cat | title = Shark Boy and Lava Girl: Back to 3D | accessdate = August 9, 2008 | last = DiLullo | first = Tara | date = June 10, 2005 | publisher = Animation World Magazine | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081207031559/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2520&ltype=cat | archivedate = December 7, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Robert Rodriguez]] appears in the credits fourteen times, most notably as director, a producer, a screenwriter (along with Marcel Rodriguez), visual effects supervisor, director of photography, editor, a camera operator, and a composer and performer.

web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-adventures-of-sharkboy-and-lavagirl-in-3d/|title=The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D|publisher=}}</ref> The film uses the [[anaglyph image|anaglyph]] [[3-D film|3-D]] technology, similar to the one used in ''[[Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over]]'' (2003). The film stars [[Taylor Lautner]], Taylor Dooley, [[Cayden Boyd]], [[David Arquette]], [[Kristin Davis]] and [[George Lopez]]. Many of the concepts and much of the story were conceived by Rodriguez's children. The special effects were done by [[Hybride Technologies]], CafeFX, [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]], Post Logic, [[Hydraulx]], [[Industrial Light & Magic]], R!ot Pictures, [[Tippett Studio]], Amalgamated Pixels, [[Intelligent Creatures]] and Troublemaker Digital. \n\nThe film received negative reviews from critics with much of the criticism directed at the film's story and poor 3-D. The film also underperformed at the box office earning just $39 million in the United States and $69.4&nbsp;million worldwide on a $50&nbsp;million budget.\n\n==Plot==\nMax is a 10-year-old lonely child in the suburbs of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] who creates an imaginary dreamworld named Planet Drool, where all of his dreams come to life. He creates two characters; Sharkboy, who was raised by sharks after losing his father (who was a marine biologist) at sea and became a shark-hybrid himself, and Lavagirl, who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them on fire. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In reality, Max's parents have little time for him, and their marriage is not going well. Max is also bullied by fellow classmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, the daughter of his teacher Mr. Electricidad. After a chase, Linus steals Max's dream journal and vandalizes it. The next day, as Max attempts to retaliate, twin tornadoes form outside the school. Sharkboy and Lavagirl emerge from the tornadoes and have Max accompany them to Planet Drool, which he learns is turning bad thanks to Mr. Electric, a robot resembling Mr. Electricidad and the dreamworld's now-corrupt electrician, under the orders of an unknown mastermind.\n\nThey confront Mr. Electric in his lair, but he drops them into the Dream Graveyard, where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor, a robot toy that Max never finished building in the real world after being discouraged by his father. Tobor gives them a lift to other parts of the planet. The three form a friendship during their journey, but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool. They are pursued by Mr. Electric and his \"plughounds\" across the planet. They plan to visit the Ice Princess and obtain the Crystal Heart, which can freeze time, giving them enough time to get to the center of Planet Drool and fix the dreamworld using Max's daydreaming. However, they are captured by Mr. Electric, and delivered to the mastermind, who is revealed to be Minus, a villain resembling Linus who has altered the dreamworld with Max's journal, and traps the three in a cage. Sharkboy gets annoyed by singing bubbles called LaLas and has a \"shark frenzy\", destroying the cage. After they escape, Max retrieves the dream journal from Minus while he is sleeping. Max informs Sharkboy that his father is alive in his book, but when Lavagirl wishes to learn what it says about her true identity, she burns the book to ash. In rage, Lavagirl asks Max why she is made out of lava, but Sharkboy tells him to let her cool down.\n\nMax, Sharkboy, and Lavagirl eventually reach the Ice Princess, who resembles Marissa. She hands over the Crystal Heart, but they are too late to stop the corruption since the Ice Princess is the only one who can use the Crystal Heart's power, and she cannot leave her home. Afterwards, Mr. Electric seemingly kills Sharkboy by fooling him into jumping into water filled with [[electric eels]], which are his weakness, with Lavagirl sacrificing herself by jumping into the water to retrieve him. Tobor appears and convinces Max to dream a better and unselfish dream. Just then, Sharkboy regains consciousness and races Lavagirl to a volcano to revive her. Max concludes that her purpose is as a light against the dark clouds which have engulfed Planet Drool's skies. Max gains reality warping as the Daydreamer and defeats Minus, then offers to make a better dreamworld between the two of them, to which Minus agrees.\n\nMinus offers Mr. Electric to return to running Planet Drool, but Mr. Electric reveals that he never enjoyed doing so in the first place. He also informs Max that he made a terrible mistake of dreaming him up and flies to Earth to destroy Max while he is dreaming. Max awakens back in his classroom during the tornado storm. Mr. Electric arrives in the tornado before Max and an astonished Mr. Electricidad. Max's parents are caught in the storm as well, but are saved by Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Max gives the Crystal Heart to Marissa so she can use the Ice Princess's powers to freeze and destroy Mr. Electric. Mr. Electricidad, Linus and Max make peace with one another, and Max reunites with his parents.\n\nMax later informs his class that Planet Drool has become a proper dreamworld once again, Sharkboy became the King of the Ocean, and Lavagirl became Queen of the Volcanoes, and as the film shows Max finally finishing Tobor, he reminds the class to \"dream a better dream, and work to make it real\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cayden Boyd]] as Max.

Max's father is an unemployed writer. They are on the brink of a divorce. They mean well for Max, but are unable to settle his troubles.

Mr. Electricidad is Max's teacher. Mr. Electric is Planet Drool's corrupt electrician. Tobor is an unfinished robot of Max that resided in the Dream Graveyard.

He is a bully at Max's school and steals his Dream Journal. With it, he enters Max's dreamworld and, using the name \"Minus\" (a nickname bestowed by Mr. Electricidad for Linus' habit of disliked conduct), alters it to his version before ultimately befriending Max.\n* [[Sasha Pieterse]] as Marissa Electricidad / Ice Princess. Marissa is the daughter of Mr. Electricidad, and at first the only student who befriends Max. On Planet Drool, she appears as the Ice Princess, the ruler of the Ice Kingdom and keeper of the Crystal Heart, which is a necklace she wears which can freeze anything including time.\n* [[Robert Rodriguez]] has a role voicing a shark. As seen in the credits, two of Robert Rodriguez's children, Rebel and Racer, portray Sharkboy at age five and age seven respectively. Rico Torres plays Sharkboy's father.

Some examples where the lone pair appears to be inactive are [[bismuth(III) iodide]], BiI<sub>3</sub>, and the {{chem|BiI|6|3-}} anion.

The stability of the +1 oxidation state increases in the following sequence:<ref name = \"Greenwood\">{{Greenwood&Earnshaw}}</ref>\n:Al<sup>I</sup> < Ga<sup>I</sup> < In<sup>I</sup> < Tl<sup>I</sup>.\n\nThe same trend in stability is noted in groups [[Group 14 element|14]], [[Group 15 element|15]] and [[Group 16 element|16]]. The heaviest members of each group, i.e. [[lead]], [[bismuth]] and [[polonium]] are comparatively stable in oxidation states +2, +3, and +4 respectively.\n\nThe lower oxidation state in each of the elements in question has two valence electrons in s orbitals. A partial explanation is that the valence electrons in an s orbital are more tightly bound and are of lower energy than electrons in p orbitals and therefore less likely to be involved in bonding.<ref>[http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Physical_Chemistry/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Atomic_and_Molecular_Properties/Electronegativity Electronegativity] UC Davis ChemWiki by University of California, Davis</ref> If the total [[ionization potential]]s (IP) (see below) of the two electrons in s orbitals (the 2nd + 3rd [[ionization potential]]s), are examined it can be seen that there is an expected decrease from B to Al associated with increased atomic size but the values for Ga, In and Tl are higher than expected. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Ionization potentials for group 13 elements<br /> kJ/mol\n!

Therefore, covalency  effects must be taken into account. An alternative explanation of the inert pair effect by [[Russell S. Drago|Drago]] in 1958 attributed the effect to low M-X bond enthalpies for the heavy p-block elements and the fact that it requires less energy to oxidize an element to a low oxidation state than to a higher oxidation state.<ref name=drago>{{cite journal\n| title =  Thermodynamic Evaluation of the Inert Pair Effect.\n| author = Russell S.

A simple example of steric activity is that of [[tin(II) chloride|SnCl<sub>2</sub>]] which is bent in accordance with [[valence shell electron repulsion theory|VSEPR]]. Some examples where the lone pair appears to be inactive are [[bismuth(III) iodide]], BiI<sub>3</sub>, and the {{chem|BiI|6|3-}} anion. In both of these the  central Bi atom is octahedrally coordinated with little or no distortion, in contravention to  [[valence shell electron repulsion theory|VSEPR]] theory.<ref>{{cite journal\n| title =  Stereochemically active or inactive lone pair electrons in some six-coordinate, group 15 halides\n| author = Ralph A.

The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, and the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode, \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" (which aired between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash''), and a two-issue comic book with characters and concepts unused in the live-action episodes also tied into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". The preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] are a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several others from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying reality. The crossover's events result in the Arrowverse being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]], affecting the entire series.\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014 with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", and the crossover's title was revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. Casting was announced in mid-2019, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. [[Cress Williams]] from the CW series ''Black Lightning'' crossed over with the Arrowverse for the first time, and other actors reprised their roles from DC film and television series. The event was filmed from the end of September to the beginning of November 2019.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was critically praised for its scope, ambition, and the many cameos; the fate of Oliver Queen had a mixed reception. The crossover was popular, with each episode giving season-high ratings to its corresponding series. A two-episode [[aftershow]], ''Crisis Aftermath'' hosted by [[Kevin Smith]], aired after parts one and three to explore the crossover's events.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect a variety of items;<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> he also retrieves the body of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West-Allen (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the crisis date has moved up to December 2019, and the Flash must die to save billions of people.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse, to learn more about what happens to him.

at in the [[Arrowverse]] in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" (the [[Arrowverse]] crossover in the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]]),<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said that the next crossover had \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said that the producers of all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover\";<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> according to [[Marc Guggenheim]], \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title (and premise) as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters of [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said that the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain elements of the upcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> [[The CW]] president [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful that ''Legends of Tomorrow'' (which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications) would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event spanning late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]] (which had not yet begun airing); the episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Guggenheim said that when they first presented the crossover to the studio and network, the creators stressed that they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\" but \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> About the crossover's comparison to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim said: \"For [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''&nbsp;... ''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. 'Crisis' is a semicolon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n==={{anchor|Lead-up}}Promotion===\nThe May 2019 season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' contained hints of the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor appearing in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> ''The Flash'' sixth-season showrunner Eric Wallace said that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in the crossover's events. According to Wallace, the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' of villain [[List of The Flash characters|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the season's start to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nMost of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season is a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with their counterparts on ''The Flash'' about the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure that they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said that the season would promote the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" Rovner cited the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]] ([[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother) as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, calling it \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who played the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover that the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him&nbsp;... You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' contained a [[Post-credits scene|tag scene]] of [[Nash Wells]] accessing a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" before [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appeared in the crossover's ''Flash'' episode. In the ''Black Lightning'' episode, a red sky covers Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]] and sends her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave wipes them and her Earth out, except for Jefferson (who is teleported to an unknown location).<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] (who wrote the original 1985 series) and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The series reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, and its second issue included material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). About the series, Guggenheim said that its concept \"came pretty early on in the process\" when it was realized that the story's scope would exceed the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics series] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" Its four main characters are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> and the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]].<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic-book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\"; the series felt like a main part of the story:<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted at [[Walmart]] on December 15, 2019; the second issue was released at Walmart on January 19, 2020, and in comic stores the following month.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The series is set during the first part of the crossover's ''Batwoman'' episode.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> Its stories and behind-the-scenes extra content are scheduled to be published in a deluxe hardcover edition on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]], with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing to the story;<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode;<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, based on a concept by Eric Wallace.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to work on the crossover. Guggenheim began, creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". The moments were designed to be modular; they could be moved throughout the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, actor availability, and other factors. They also determined episode order; Guggenheim's initial template had ''Arrow'' as the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' the fifth, \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW requested that ''The Flash'' be the third hour; after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\". ''Batwoman'' was the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Certain characters were considered \"integral\", others would make cameo appearances, depending on actor availability.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the writers separated to write each episode. The group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on its title character's scenes, to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] retained the series' grounded tone because it was \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> Although the crossover is considered \"a five-hour epic\", the title character of each series and characters appropriate in those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash'') are highlighted.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episode scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems; since the Arrowverse does not have those, however, the crossover allowed its creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was developed, after it was seen at the end of \"Elseworlds\" that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> This version of the Anti-Monitor was inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, opening with a similar destruction of parallel universes.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Wallace said about the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the comic storyline that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\", killing only some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Although it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover (which, Guggenheim felt, \"spoiled our own story\"), his death in the first hour was an attempt to \"surprise [an] audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth; it also \"establish[ed] the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> The third-hour death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\", without killing Gustin's character. According to Wallace, this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Guggenheim said that it was also done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\": \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover explored the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who played that series' Lois Lane, said: \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode in which the characters appear was written by former ''Smallville'' writers, allowing Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> The removal of this Clark's powers was a reference to ''[[Superman II]]'', where [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Superman temporarily surrenders his powers. Although the details of how ''Smallville'' Clark lost his powers are not explored, \"the idea that Clark would give up his powers in order to have this kind of life, that really resonated with all of\" the writers and [[Tom Welling]]. ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles written by Lois were shown \"to make it very clear\" to the audience \"that he did become Superman, that he did have all these adventures, but they are left to your imagination.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimSmallvillePowers\" /> The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Three actors who played Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, but no scene contains all three; the writers wanted a clear distinction between Welling's character at the Kent Farm and Routh's character at the ''Daily Planet''. Guggenheim said, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]: \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene, written by Certo (a ''Lucifer'' fan), was sent to that series' creative team for their feedback; ''Lucifer'' showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, and Ellis contributed his pronunciation of Constantine as \"Constantyne\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\"; he had wanted to participate in the crossover when he learned that it was adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> Black Lightning's inclusion was decided \"very late in the game\", according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to incorporate the character not as a cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". When the logistics and creative elements were resolved, Black Lightning \"elevated the crossover to another level\". Actor [[Cress Williams]] said that the character enters \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people\"; there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; they wanted to \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|''Arrow'' season-six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force in which she helps break up the fight. Since the writers considered season six \"relatively recent\", they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode (one of Guggenheim's favorites) and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". In the Speed Force, Barry encounters [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics chief creative officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]] film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure that it would not conflict with their planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe glimpse of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-2 from ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'' was not originally intended. ''Stargirl'' creator [[Geoff Johns]] said that production of that series had completed, and Pedowitz advocated its inclusion after seeing footage of the series: \"I was incredibly excited about the opportunity for that because it just meant more people would see it. And [tonally], Stargirl and the show has always been for everybody. Anyone can watch it. So it fits in nicely to that world.\"<ref name=\"StargirlCast\" /> The end of the crossover sees Barry converting the old [[S.T.A.R. Labs (Arrowverse)|S.T.A.R. Labs]] hangar from the \"[[Invasion! (Arrowverse)|Invasion!]]\" crossover into a spot where the heroes could gather,<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> hinting at a possible introduction of [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] and the [[Wonder Twins]]. The hints were a \"fun bit\" for the writers to end the crossover, since the Wonder Twins appeared in an early script.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nAlthough early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]], and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising his role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not appear; according to Guggenheim, a newspaper report cited executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had already appeared in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", also appeared in early versions of the crossover. Guggenheim said that he was not included because \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics; although he considered it \"a really important inclusion\", \"for a variety of different reasons\" it did not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett became a regular on all the series, receiving credit in the episodes he appeared in before the crossover to ensure that he would be available for \"Crisis\" and its lead-up.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Casting was announced at the July 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. It included [[Tyler Hoechlin]], reprising his role as [[Superman (Arrowverse)|Superman]];<ref name=\"HoechlinRouthSuperman\" /> [[Brandon Routh]], who plays Ray Palmer / Atom in the Arrowverse, would reprise his role as Superman in ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006) in \"an older, more world-weary\" version inspired by the comics' [[Superman (Kingdom Come)|''Kingdom Come'' Superman]].<ref name=\"RouthKingdomCome\" /><ref name=\"RouthSupermanClarify\" /><ref name=\"/FilmTCAAug2019\" /> Tom Cavanagh was cast as [[Pariah (comics)|Pariah]], in addition to Nash Wells;<ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /><ref name=\"NashWells\" /> [[Burt Ward]], who played [[Dick Grayson|<!-- don't delink -->Dick Grayson / Robin]] in the [[Batman (TV series)|1960s Batman television series]], was cast in an undisclosed role;<ref name=\"Ward\" /> Amell would play several versions of Oliver Queen;<ref name=\"MultipleOliverQueens\" /> [[Jon Cryer]] would reprise his role as Lex Luthor,<ref name=\"LexLuthor\" /> and Garrett would play the Anti-Monitor and the Monitor.<ref name=\"AntiMonitor\" /> Shortly afterwards, [[Elizabeth Tulloch]] was confirmed reprising her role as [[Lois Lane (Arrowverse)|Lois Lane]].<ref name=\"Tulloch\" />\n\nPedowitz announced to the [[Television Critics Association]] the following month that cast members from ''Black Lightning'' would appear<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> (previously hinted at by Cress Williams),<ref name=\"CressWilliamsTease\" /> and Kevin Conroy would play an elderly Bruce Wayne after voicing the character in animated media.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Conroy \"jumped at\" the opportunity to portray Bruce in live action for the first time, saying that it would satisfy the \"loyal\" fanbase of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" /> Guggenheim said that although the producers discussed with DC and Warner Bros. the possibility of [[Lynda Carter]] reprising her role as [[Wonder Woman]] from the [[Wonder Woman (TV series)|1975 television series]], they felt that it was unlikely.<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" />\n\n[[Johnathon Schaech]] was confirmed as reprising his role as [[Jonah Hex (Arrowverse)|Jonah Hex]] in September 2019,<ref name=\"JonahHex\" /> and John Wesley Shipp was cast in an undisclosed role shortly afterwards.<ref name=\"Shipp\" /> Around this time, Tom Ellis was approached to appear as Lucifer Morningstar from the series ''Lucifer''. Ellis had \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", saying that \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In mid-September, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane from ''Smallville'';<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance would also reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who played [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', said that he declined Warner Bros. and the producers' offer to reprise the role in \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', also declined an offer to reprise his role in the crossover due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> however, he appeared in archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] later in the month, and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed as reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the beginning of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced as reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] and playing [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] from the comics; Lyla had used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> That month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> The producers approached [[Nicolas Cage]], who was said would play Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim later regretted mentioning Cage, and tried to refrain from hinting at other actors' involvement because he did not want fans \"blowing up\" their [[Twitter]] feeds with questions about why they did not appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl before the release of her [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role as Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Although production had ended, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" about the idea;<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\nA number of other actors were considered for cameos. There was \"a whole host of reasons why\" certain cameos did not occur, according to Guggenheim. Some actors were busy with other projects; some were uninterested in the crossover, and others requested more money than the budget permitted. [[Cameron Cuffe]], who starred as Seg-El on ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', was approached to appear as a holographic Kryptonian elder when [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]] was evacuated. Although Cuffe said that he \"wanted to make [the cameo] happen\", he had committed to another project.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse on the fictional Kent family farm was done at the end of the month;<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> the farmhouse had appeared in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure that his characterization was consistent with the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Primary filming was completed by November 8, with re-shoots and minor filming finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> When Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' filmed it; the ''Arrow'' crew had already finished the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors of the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> They were hired for the crossover because their previous experience working in the Arrowverse allowed them (and their directors of photography) to create a unified look. ''Batwoman'', which is normally filmed with a different [[aspect ratio]] from the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for consistency. A number of stunt scenes, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]] and collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> and the score was recorded by an orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated a number of musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into the score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> cues included the 1960s ''Batman'' television-series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nBefore the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners that \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> He described it as not \"so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Guggenheim added that each series would be affected except for ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" and there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> After the crossover, Dries wanted to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounding established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the rest of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\"; he called the Arrowverse ending a \"game-changer\" which \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover the universe was rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}existing on the new [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]. A new multiverse was also created, with six Earths.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Although Guggenheim had wanted a single Earth-Prime, the crossover would not have been able to visit the worlds of other DC properties. A compromise was reached in which these properties were returned to different Earths in the multiverse, and the Arrowverse series were combined in a single Earth. The Arrowverse characters are oblivious to the newly-formed multiverse.<ref name=\"NewMultiveseCompromise\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that \"there is an opportunity going forward after 'Crisis' to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter, Sara, returning to the timeline after her change in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor's more-heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after they almost did so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> In ''Batwoman'', Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice;<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> Dries called this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] was a promotional partner for the event,<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> and the first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teasers.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the event's poster was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> A full trailer was released on November 24,<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> followed by additional trailers on December 3 and December 6.<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWhen the initial trailers were released in November, a logo with the lead character of each series (except Oliver Queen) was also released; Guggenheim said that at that time, legal and financial considerations prevented the inclusion of Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> With the release of the full trailer the following month, Oliver was included in the logo; according to  Guggenheim, this was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\".<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> He had been told that \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", and Amell does not appear in the fifth episode.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the last two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said that the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\"; different taglines were used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a trailer for the event's last two episodes.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December 9 and ''The Flash'' on December 10. The crossover concluded with ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on January 14, 2020.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> The December 9, 2019 episode of ''Black Lightning'' tied into the event.<ref

0.95&nbsp;million viewers and 0.3 rating/share.<ref name=\"LoTTHRRatings\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n====''Supergirl''====\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 100-percent approval rating, based on 14 reviews of the episode. According to the website's critical consensus, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09 |title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] rated the first hour nine out of ten. Schedeen called the episode \"accessible\" to viewers, and said that it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". He said that the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\" and called the episode \"very critical\" for fans of ''Arrow'', given Oliver's death (although he regretted Barry's small role).<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Grading the episode A\u2013minus, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said that \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare] us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\".<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the episode's opening \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". According to Siede, \"Crisis\" was the first Arrowverse crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover and a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" Noting that the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\", she graded the episode  B-plus.<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode 4.5 out of five stars, Kayti Burt of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\"; the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" About the cast, Burt said: \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific\"; \"one of the best scenes\" was between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Part two of DC's ambitious crossover is just as relentless as the first installment, if even smoother around the edges, masterfully juggling many characters, emotions, and Easter eggs to a satisfying result.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09 |title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09 |title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the [''Flash''] season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\", especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08 |title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character and one that justified the decision to resurrect him after his sacrifice in the first part. It also did \"even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" in what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out\" the character.<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.

[[Arrowverse]] [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] event featuring episodes of the television series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'', ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'', and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' on [[The CW]]. The ''Supergirl'', ''Batwoman'', and ''The Flash'' episodes aired in December 2019, and the ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episodes aired in January 2020. Events in the ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode, \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" (which aired between ''Batwoman'' and ''The Flash''), and a two-issue comic book with characters and concepts unused in the live-action episodes also tied into the event.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", inspired by the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]], continues plotlines established in the previous crossover, \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\". The preceding episodes of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow'' season eight]] and much of [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash'' season six]] are a prelude to the crossover. In \"Crisis\", the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] gathers [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Green Arrow]], the [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Flash]], [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Ray Palmer]], and several others from throughout the multiverse to stop the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]] from destroying reality. The crossover's events result in the Arrowverse being [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]], affecting the entire series.\n\nInitial references to the crossover began in 2014 with [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''The Flash''. The adaptation began in earnest during the development of \"Elseworlds\", and the crossover's title was revealed at the end of \"Elseworlds\" in December 2018. Casting was announced in mid-2019, including actors who previously portrayed DC characters in other media, such as [[Burt Ward]] and [[Kevin Conroy]]. [[Cress Williams]] from the CW series ''Black Lightning'' crossed over with the Arrowverse for the first time, and other actors reprised their roles from DC film and television series. The event was filmed from the end of September to the beginning of November 2019.\n\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" was critically praised for its scope, ambition, and the many cameos; the fate of Oliver Queen had a mixed reception. The crossover was popular, with each episode giving season-high ratings to its corresponding series. A two-episode [[aftershow]], ''Crisis Aftermath'' hosted by [[Kevin Smith]], aired after parts one and three to explore the crossover's events.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n===Prelude===\nTo prepare for the coming crisis, the [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Monitor]] recruits [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver Queen]] and sends him on missions to collect a variety of items;<ref name=\"ArrowFinale\" /> he also retrieves the body of [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]] and revives him.<ref name=\"SupergirlFinale\" /><ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /> [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] and [[Iris West-Allen (Arrowverse)|Iris West-Allen]] learn that the crisis date has moved up to December 2019, and the Flash must die to save billions of people.<ref name=\"Flash601\" /> Barry travels to [[Earth-3 (Arrowverse)|Earth-3]] to see [[Jay Garrick (Arrowverse)|Jay Garrick]] and [[Joan Williams (Arrowverse)|Joan Williams]], who have been tracking antimatter signatures across the multiverse, to learn more about what happens to him.

at in the [[Arrowverse]] in [[Pilot (The Flash)|the pilot episode]] of ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]''.<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /> In September 2018, three months before the release of \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\" (the [[Arrowverse]] crossover in the [[2018\u201319 United States network television schedule|2018\u201319 television season]]),<ref name=\"ElseworldsTitle\" /> ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' executive producer [[Phil Klemmer]] said that the next crossover had \"a loose shape\".<ref name=\"KlemmerSep2018\" /> In early December 2018, a week before the airing of \"Elseworlds\", ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' showrunner [[Beth Schwartz]] said that the producers of all the series \"already know a lot about what's going on in next year's crossover\";<ref name=\"SchwartzDec2018\" /> according to [[Marc Guggenheim]], \"Elseworlds\" would \"lay the groundwork\" for it.<ref name=\"TVInsiderNov2018\" /> The end of \"Elseworlds\" revealed the crossover title (and premise) as \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", adapting the story from the [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|comic of the same name]].<ref name=\"CrisisOnInfiniteEarthsCrossover\" /> \"Elseworlds\" introduced the characters of [[Monitor (Arrowverse)|Mar Novu / Monitor]] and [[Psycho-Pirate (Arrowverse)|Psycho-Pirate]], and alluded to an impending \"crisis\".<ref name=\"CrisisClues\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsSetUp\" />\n\nIn January 2019, ''The Flash'' showrunner [[Todd Helbing]] said that the remainder of the [[The Flash (season 5)|fifth season]] would contain elements of the upcoming crossover.<ref name=\"HelbingJan2019\" /> [[The CW]] president [[Mark Pedowitz]] called the crossover \"the biggest, the most complicated one\" to date, and was hopeful that ''Legends of Tomorrow'' (which did not participate in \"Elseworlds\" because of production complications) would be part of \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"PedowitzJan2019\" /> In May 2019, Pedowitz announced at The CW's [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation that the crossover would include ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', and ''[[Batwoman (TV series)|Batwoman]]'' in a five-episode event spanning late 2019 and early 2020.<ref name=\"CrisisTwoQuarters\" /> The crossover occurred in the ninth episodes of [[Supergirl (season 5)|''Supergirl''{{'}}s fifth season]],<ref name=\"SupergirlEpisodeNumber\" /> [[Batwoman (TV series)|''Batwoman''{{'}}s first season]],<ref name=\"BatwomanPreCrisis\" /> and [[The Flash (season 6)|''The Flash''{{'}}s sixth season]],<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> in the eighth episode of [[Arrow (season 8)|''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season]],<ref name=\"ArrowEpisodeNumber\" /> and as a special episode of [[Legends of Tomorrow (season 5)|''Legends of Tomorrow''{{'}}s fifth season]] (which had not yet begun airing); the episode is not considered the series' season premiere.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> Guggenheim said that when they first presented the crossover to the studio and network, the creators stressed that they did not want the event to be \"Crisis on CW Earths\" but \"to touch as many strands of the DC tapestry as possible.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> About the crossover's comparison to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film, ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), Guggenheim said: \"For [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry]] and [[Oliver Queen (Arrowverse)|Oliver]], there is an emotional denouement that is reminiscent of ''Endgame''&nbsp;... ''Endgame'' is an exclamation point. 'Crisis' is a semicolon.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\n==={{anchor|Lead-up}}Promotion===\nThe May 2019 season finales of ''The Flash'', ''Arrow'', ''Supergirl'', and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' contained hints of the upcoming crossover, with the Monitor appearing in all series except ''The Flash''.<ref name=\"SeasonFinaleTeases\" /> ''The Flash'' sixth-season showrunner Eric Wallace said that when all the series' showrunners discussed plans for their series before the crossover, \"all of this synergy started to happen\" with \"a lot of cross collaboration\" in the crossover's events. According to Wallace, the themes of grief, death, and the end of all worlds in \"Crisis\" worked with the story they were trying to tell in season six of ''The Flash'' of villain [[List of The Flash characters|Ramsey Rosso / Bloodwork]], \"who is facing the end of his own world\". This allowed the season's start to help set up the crossover.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nMost of ''Arrow''{{'}}s eighth season is a prelude to the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettArrowS8Prelude\" /> The ''Arrow'' writers consulted with their counterparts on ''The Flash'' about the destruction of [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse)|Earth-2]] in \"[[Starling City (Arrow episode)|Starling City]]\" to ensure that they could destroy this Earth.<ref name=\"Earth2Destroyed\" /> On ''Supergirl'', showrunner [[Robert Rovner]] said that the season would promote the crossover \"in our way, which is a little bit different from the way ''Arrow'' and ''The Flash'' are doing it.\" Rovner cited the return of [[Malefic J'onzz (Arrowverse)|Malefic]] ([[J'onn J'onzz (Arrowverse)|J'onn J'onzz]]'s brother) as a major plot thread leading to the crossover, calling it \"a gauntlet for J'onn\".<ref name=\"SupergirlEPsSep2019\" /> [[LaMonica Garrett]], who played the Monitor and the [[Anti-Monitor (Arrowverse)|Anti-Monitor]], said before the crossover that the Anti-Monitor's \"presence [would] be felt before you physically see him&nbsp;... You see just enough of him to know this guy means business, but it's not in your face in every scene leading up to\" the crossover.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> The preceding episodes of ''Batwoman'', ''Supergirl'', ''The Flash'', and ''Arrow'' contained a [[Post-credits scene|tag scene]] of [[Nash Wells]] accessing a chamber under Central City.<ref name=\"Batwoman108Supergirl508\" /><ref name=\"Flash608\" /><ref name=\"Arrow807Tag\" /><!--<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> can source all episodes having the tag, if needed. -->\n\n===Tie-ins===\nThe ''[[Black Lightning (TV series)|Black Lightning]]'' episode \"[[The Book of Resistance: Chapter Four: Earth Crisis]]\" tied in to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" before [[Jefferson Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jefferson Pierce]] first appeared in the crossover's ''Flash'' episode. In the ''Black Lightning'' episode, a red sky covers Freeland before anti-matter strikes [[Jennifer Pierce (Black Lightning)|Jennifer Pierce]] and sends her to a void where she finds her Earth-1 and 2 counterparts. An anti-matter wave wipes them and her Earth out, except for Jefferson (who is teleported to an unknown location).<ref name=\"BlackLightning309\" />\n\nThe crossover story was expanded in a two-issue comics series: ''Crisis on Infinite Earths Giant'', written by [[Marv Wolfman]] (who wrote the original 1985 series) and Guggenheim and illustrated by Tom Derenick, Trevor Scott, [[John Kalisz]], Andy Owens, Hi-Fi, [[Tom Grummett]], Danny Miki, and [[Chris Sotomayor]].<ref name=\"ComicsGiantDC\" /> The series reprinted material from the original ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' comic, and its second issue included material from ''DC Universe: Legacies'' #6 (2010). About the series, Guggenheim said that its concept \"came pretty early on in the process\" when it was realized that the story's scope would exceed the five episodes. By creating the comics, it allowed the producers to utilize \"all of the characters that we don't have in the crossover proper for logistical reasons, or financial reasons, or creative reasons{{nbsp}}... [The comics series] allows us to tell a major piece of the story that we're designing, with characters and concepts that we couldn't achieve in live action.\" Its four main characters are [[Felicity Smoak (Arrowverse)|Felicity Smoak]], the [[Ray Terrill (Arrowverse)|Ray]], [[Nyssa al Ghul (Arrowverse)|Nyssa al Ghul]], and [[Wally West (Arrowverse)|Wally West]], in addition to appearances by [[Ray Palmer (Arrowverse)|Atom]], [[Sara Lance]], [[Kate Kane (Arrowverse)|Batwoman]], the Flash,<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> and the Monitor, [[Lex Luthor (Arrowverse)|Lex Luthor]].<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Serious consideration was given to the [[Huntress (Arrowverse)|Huntress]], but Guggenheim opted for Nyssa al Ghul because \"we had done [[Arrow: Season 2.5|a comic-book tie-in]] that bridged [[Arrow (season 2)|seasons two]] and [[Arrow (season 3)|three]] of ''Arrow'' and [Huntress] had featured prominently in that, so Nyssa had not yet had her chance to be immortalized that way.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Wolfman added that the comics were \"created to tie in perfectly with the CW shows\"; the series felt like a main part of the story:<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> \"This is integral to the entire storyline.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> The first comic debuted at [[Walmart]] on December 15, 2019; the second issue was released at Walmart on January 19, 2020, and in comic stores the following month.<ref name=\"ComicsGiant\" /> The series is set during the first part of the crossover's ''Batwoman'' episode.<ref name=\"ComicsGiantTwitter\" /> Its stories and behind-the-scenes extra content are scheduled to be published in a deluxe hardcover edition on May 6, 2020.<ref name=\"ComicsHardCover\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ''Supergirl'' episode was written by Derek Simon and [[Jay Faerber]], with [[Robert Rovner]] and Guggenheim contributing to the story;<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Don Whitehead and Holly Henderson wrote the ''Batwoman'' episode;<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> Lauren Certo and Sterling Gates wrote ''The Flash'' episode, based on a concept by Eric Wallace.<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> The ''Arrow'' episode was co-written by Wolfman and Guggenheim,<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode was written by [[Keto Shimizu]] and Ubah Mohamed.<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" />\n\nThe writers gathered for a two-week session to work on the crossover. Guggenheim began, creating \"a series of big tentpole beats that could happen in each of the five hours\". The moments were designed to be modular; they could be moved throughout the episodes depending on each series' creative needs, actor availability, and other factors. They also determined episode order; Guggenheim's initial template had ''Arrow'' as the fourth hour and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' the fifth, \"because in crossovers past, ''Legends'' has always been the finale of the crossover.\" The CW requested that ''The Flash'' be the third hour; after working \"out those tentpoles, for a variety of different plot reasons, it made a lot of sense for the first hour to be ''Supergirl''\". ''Batwoman'' was the second hour.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Certain characters were considered \"integral\", others would make cameo appearances, depending on actor availability.<ref name=\"GuggenheimRollingStoneDec2019\" />\n\nWith the large moments determined, the writers separated to write each episode. The group reconvened to review the whole, making adjustments as necessary. Each series' writers would work on its title character's scenes, to ensure consistency.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> For scenes set in [[Gotham City]], ''Batwoman'' showrunner [[Caroline Dries]] retained the series' grounded tone because it was \"not normal for [the characters of ''Batwoman''] to interact with aliens and travel to different universes\".<ref name=\"DriesTCA\" /> Although the crossover is considered \"a five-hour epic\", the title character of each series and characters appropriate in those worlds (such as [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse Earth-90)|Barry Allen]] of [[Earth-90 (Arrowverse)|Earth-90]] appearing on ''The Flash'') are highlighted.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> The episode scripts were completed by early September 2019.<ref name=\"Scripts\" />\n\nThe original comic was created to help with [[DC Comics]]' continuity problems; since the Arrowverse does not have those, however, the crossover allowed its creators to focus on the characters and their interactions. [[Kara Danvers (Arrowverse)|Supergirl]] and Batwoman's relationship was developed, after it was seen at the end of \"Elseworlds\" that \"those two characters [are] supporting each other much in the same way that Barry and Oliver have been supporting each other in previous crossovers.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" /> This version of the Anti-Monitor was inspired by the character's appearance in the [[New 52]] \"Darkseid Wars\" storyline.<ref name=\"GarrettCBRNov2019\" /> [[Sara Lance]] is the focus of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' characters, with the crossover \"kick[ing] off Sara's emotional journey for season 5 of ''Legends''\" and giving Sara \"a different perspective on things.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWDec2019\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that the crossover would try to incorporate \"seminal moments\" from the comic book, opening with a similar destruction of parallel universes.<ref name=\"GuggenheimSeminalMoments\" /> Wallace said about the deaths of [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] and the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] in the comic storyline that the writers \"can't just kill all of our number ones on our shows\", killing only some.<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" /> Although it was revealed in \"Elseworlds\" that Oliver would die in the crossover (which, Guggenheim felt, \"spoiled our own story\"), his death in the first hour was an attempt to \"surprise [an] audience\" who may have expected him to die in the fifth; it also \"establish[ed] the stakes going into the next four hours\".<ref name=\"OliverDeathEW\" /> The third-hour death of Barry Allen from Earth-90 was \"a way to honor what was said [by] the Monitor {{nbsp}}... saying the Flash must die\", without killing Gustin's character. According to Wallace, this gave \"it a nice story twist, [to] get in some emotion\" while \"complet[ing] a 30-year arc\" for [[John Wesley Shipp]]'s character. The flashback scene from the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990 ''Flash'' television series]] was added while editing the episode \"to give a little bit of his life flashing before his eyes\".<ref name=\"Flash90Death\" /> Oliver dies a second time at the end of the ''Arrow'' episode. Guggenheim said that it was also done to \"[surprise] the audience with the unexpected\": \"I think <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Stephen Amell]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> enjoyed A) the opportunity to play two death scenes and B) the creative sleight of hand in terms of surprising the audience.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nThe inclusion of [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent]] and [[Lois Lane (Smallville)|Lois Lane]] from ''[[Smallville]]'' in the crossover explored the characters after ''Smallville'' ended.<ref name=\"Durance\" /> [[Erica Durance]], who played that series' Lois Lane, said: \"It's a little bit of a look into their future and the different choices they've made to be together. It's a full-circle moment that's really nice.\" The ''Batwoman'' episode in which the characters appear was written by former ''Smallville'' writers, allowing Guggenheim to \"[step] aside and let them speak to where things were headed. As a fan of the show, it answered a lot of questions that I had. It provided a lot of closure, I think, in a really nice way.\"<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> The removal of this Clark's powers was a reference to ''[[Superman II]]'', where [[Christopher Reeve]]'s Superman temporarily surrenders his powers. Although the details of how ''Smallville'' Clark lost his powers are not explored, \"the idea that Clark would give up his powers in order to have this kind of life, that really resonated with all of\" the writers and [[Tom Welling]]. ''[[Daily Planet]]'' articles written by Lois were shown \"to make it very clear\" to the audience \"that he did become Superman, that he did have all these adventures, but they are left to your imagination.\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimSmallvillePowers\" /> The ''Smallville'' material in the crossover was shared with ''Smallville'' co-creator [[Alfred Gough]] before filming began.<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> Three actors who played Clark Kent / Superman in the crossover, but no scene contains all three; the writers wanted a clear distinction between Welling's character at the Kent Farm and Routh's character at the ''Daily Planet''. Guggenheim said, \"The desire to have multiple Supermen [together] is what inspired the backup story\" in the comic tie-in.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> Appearing as [[Bruce Wayne]] in live action for the first time allowed [[Kevin Conroy]] to \"explore a lot of [the] dark corners\" of the character in a different way than when he voiced an older version of the character in the animated series, ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.<ref name=\"ConroyEWNov2019\" />\n\n[[Lucifer Morningstar (Arrowverse Earth-666)|Lucifer Morningstar]]'s appearance was five years before the events of ''[[Lucifer (TV series)|Lucifer]]'', according to actor [[Tom Ellis (actor)|Tom Ellis]]: \"This is him in his proper playboy, don't-give-a-damn-about-anything stage in his life. He is very irreverent with our characters when they turn up in the scene and obviously, with [[John Constantine (Arrowverse)|Constantine]], there is some history there.\"<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> His scene, written by Certo (a ''Lucifer'' fan), was sent to that series' creative team for their feedback; ''Lucifer'' showrunner Joe Henderson suggested Lucifer's flirting joke, and Ellis contributed his pronunciation of Constantine as \"Constantyne\". Henderson called Lucifer's appearance \"the coolest thing\"; he had wanted to participate in the crossover when he learned that it was adapting ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''.<ref name=\"EWLuciferShowrunners\" /> Black Lightning's inclusion was decided \"very late in the game\", according to Guggenheim. He worked closely with ''Black Lightning'' showrunner [[Salim Akil]] to incorporate the character not as a cameo but \"in a way that feels significant\". When the logistics and creative elements were resolved, Black Lightning \"elevated the crossover to another level\". Actor [[Cress Williams]] said that the character enters \"in a very surprising way. He's not prepared for it. So, he doesn't know these people\"; there is \"some conflict early on when he's trying to figure out, who are you people and why am I here?\".<ref name=\"BlackLightningEWNov2019\" />\n\nBarry's journey through the [[Speed Force]] in the ''Arrow'' hour was an opportunity for the writers to \"revisit a series 'greatest hits' for Oliver, key moments in terms of his relationships{{nbsp}}... it's a little bit of a 'Before you die, your life flashes before your eyes' kind of feel\"; they wanted to \"look backwards before Oliver's death.\" Oliver and [[John Diggle (Arrowverse)|Diggle]]'s fight in the [[Arrow (season 6)|''Arrow'' season-six]] episode \"[[Brothers in Arms (Arrow)|Brothers in Arms]]\" was originally planned for Kate's scene in the Speed Force in which she helps break up the fight. Since the writers considered season six \"relatively recent\", they chose \"[[Suicidal Tendencies (Arrow)|Suicidal Tendencies]]\" from [[Arrow (season 3)|season three]]. This episode (one of Guggenheim's favorites) and the argument between Oliver and Ray helped show \"how much all of the shows have evolved and relationships between the characters have evolved.\" The other moments in the Speed Force were based on \"showing how far the characters have come\". In the Speed Force, Barry encounters [[Ezra Miller]]'s [[Barry Allen (DC Extended Universe)|Barry Allen]] from the [[DC Extended Universe]]. Guggenheim worked with DC Comics chief creative officer [[Jim Lee]] and [[DC Entertainment]] film vice president Adam Schlagman on the scene to ensure that it would not conflict with their planned [[The Flash (film)|''Flash'' film]].<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" />\n\nThe glimpse of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]] and the [[Justice Society of America]] on Earth-2 from ''[[Stargirl (TV series)|Stargirl]]'' was not originally intended. ''Stargirl'' creator [[Geoff Johns]] said that production of that series had completed, and Pedowitz advocated its inclusion after seeing footage of the series: \"I was incredibly excited about the opportunity for that because it just meant more people would see it. And [tonally], Stargirl and the show has always been for everybody. Anyone can watch it.

The hints were a \"fun bit\" for the writers to end the crossover, since the Wonder Twins appeared in an early script.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nAlthough early allusions to \"Crisis\" on ''The Flash'' mentioned the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]], and [[Tom Cavanagh]] was said to be reprising his role in the crossover,<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /><ref name=\"CavanaghCharacters\" /> the character did not appear; according to Guggenheim, a newspaper report cited executives no longer involved with the series or this crossover. The character had already appeared in previous crossovers.<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Psycho-Pirate, included in \"Elseworlds\", also appeared in early versions of the crossover. Guggenheim said that he was not included because \"given the story we were telling, the only reason we were having him in there was because he was in the original comic\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimEWJan2020\" /> Guggenheim had tried to have [[Swamp Thing]] appear to interact with Constantine, given their history and relationship in the comics; although he considered it \"a really important inclusion\", \"for a variety of different reasons\" it did not happen.<ref name=\"SwampThing\" />\n\n===Casting===\nLaMonica Garrett became a regular on all the series, receiving credit in the episodes he appeared in before the crossover to ensure that he would be available for \"Crisis\" and its lead-up.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Casting was announced at the July 2019 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].

Ellis had \"talked over the years about Lucifer being a DC character and 'Is there any chance of this happening?'\", saying that \"Crisis\" was a good chance to explore that connection.<ref name=\"Ellis\" /> In mid-September, it was announced that Tom Welling and Erica Durance would reprise their roles as Clark Kent and Lois Lane from ''Smallville'';<ref name=\"Welling\" /><ref name=\"Durance\" /> Durance would also reprise her Arrowverse role as [[Alura Zor-El (Arrowverse)|Alura Zor-El]].<ref name=\"DuranceEWNov2019\" /> [[Michael Rosenbaum]], who played [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] on ''Smallville'', said that he declined Warner Bros. and the producers' offer to reprise the role in \"Crisis\".<ref name=\"RosenbaumApproached\" /> [[Alan Ritchson]], who played [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry/Aquaman]] on ''Smallville'', also declined an offer to reprise his role in the crossover due to scheduling conflicts with ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'';<ref name=\"Ritchson\" /> however, he appeared in archive footage as [[Hank Hall (Arrowverse Earth-9)|Hank Hall / Hawk]] from ''Titans''.<ref name=\"TitansArchiveFootage\" /> [[Osric Chau]] was cast as [[Atom (Ryan Choi)|Ryan Choi]] later in the month, and [[Ashley Scott]] was confirmed as reprising her role as [[Huntress (Helena Wayne)|Helena Kyle / Huntress]] from ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]''.<ref name=\"Chau\" /><ref name=\"Scott\" />\n\nAt the beginning of October, [[Audrey Marie Anderson]] was announced as reprising her role as [[Lyla Michaels (Arrowverse)|Lyla Michaels]] and playing [[Harbinger (DC Comics)|Harbinger]] from the comics; Lyla had used \"Harbinger\" as her [[A.R.G.U.S.]] codename.<ref name=\"Anderson\" /> That month, [[Stephen Lobo]] was cast as [[Jim Corrigan]].<ref name=\"Lobo\" /> The producers approached [[Nicolas Cage]], who was said would play Superman in the planned ''[[Superman in film#Superman Lives|Superman Lives]]'' film.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> Guggenheim later regretted mentioning Cage, and tried to refrain from hinting at other actors' involvement because he did not want fans \"blowing up\" their [[Twitter]] feeds with questions about why they did not appear.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" /> At the end of November, it was reported that [[Brec Bassinger]] would appear in the crossover as Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl before the release of her [[DC Universe (streaming service)|DC Universe]] series later in 2020.<ref name=\"Stargirl\" />\n\n[[Ezra Miller]] appeared in the ''Arrow'' episode reprising his [[DC Extended Universe]] role as Barry Allen, after [[Warner Bros. Television]] president [[Peter Roth (executive)|Peter Roth]] spoke to Guggenheim about including him. Although production had ended, Guggenheim approached Gustin to see if he would be \"on-board\" with Miller appearing and Gustin \"was incredibly enthusiastic\" about the idea;<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> Guggenheim called Jim Lee \"instrumental in making [the cameo] happen\".<ref name=\"EzraMiller\" />\n\nA number of other actors were considered for cameos. There was \"a whole host of reasons why\" certain cameos did not occur, according to Guggenheim. Some actors were busy with other projects; some were uninterested in the crossover, and others requested more money than the budget permitted. [[Cameron Cuffe]], who starred as Seg-El on ''[[Krypton (TV series)|Krypton]]'', was approached to appear as a holographic Kryptonian elder when [[Argo City (Arrowverse)|Argo City]] was evacuated. Although Cuffe said that he \"wanted to make [the cameo] happen\", he had committed to another project.<ref name=\"GuggenheimKryptonCage\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began on September 24, 2019.<ref name=\"ProductionBegins\" /> Filming at the farmhouse on the fictional Kent family farm was done at the end of the month;<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /> the farmhouse had appeared in the \"Elseworlds\" crossover and on ''Smallville''.<ref name=\"CrisisKentFarm\" /><ref name=\"ElseworldsKentFarm\" /> Production of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode began on October 4.<ref name=\"LegendsProduction\" /> Williams took a break from filming ''Black Lightning'' in [[Atlanta]] to spend a week filming his parts of the crossover in [[Vancouver]].<ref name=\"WilliamsFilming\" /> His scenes were reviewed by the crew of ''Black Lightning'' to ensure that his characterization was consistent with the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> Primary filming was completed by November 8, with re-shoots and minor filming finished by December 19.<ref name=\"FilmingEnd\" /><ref name=\"FilmingEnd2\" /> When Miller's cameo was finalized, a small crew from ''The Flash'' filmed it; the ''Arrow'' crew had already finished the series.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" />\n\nDirectors of the crossover included [[Jesse Warn]] (''Supergirl''),<ref name=\"SupergirlPressRelease\" /> Laura Belsey (''Batwoman''),<ref name=\"BatwomanPressRelease\" /> David McWhirter (''The Flash''),<ref name=\"FlashPressRelease\" /> [[Glen Winter]] (''Arrow''),<ref name=\"ArrowPressRelease\" /> and [[Gregory Smith (actor)|Gregory Smith]] (''Legends of Tomorrow'').<ref name=\"LegendsPressRelease\" /> They were hired for the crossover because their previous experience working in the Arrowverse allowed them (and their directors of photography) to create a unified look. ''Batwoman'', which is normally filmed with a different [[aspect ratio]] from the other series, used the same ratio as the other series for consistency. A number of stunt scenes, particularly in the ''Supergirl'' and ''Arrow'' episodes, were filmed with drones.<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" />\n\n===Music===\n[[Blake Neely]] and collaborators Nathaniel Blume, Sherri Chung, and Daniel Chan began work on the crossover on November 20, 2019,<ref name=\"ScoreStart\" /> and the score was recorded by an orchestra on December 2.<ref name=\"ScoreRecording\" /><ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyDec2019\" /> [[Tony Kanal]] and [[Stephen Perkins]] were featured performers on the score.<ref name=\"ScorePerformers\" /> Neely incorporated a number of musical [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] into the score, some of which were \"cues the production has attempted to obtain the rights to for years\";<ref name=\"ScoreEasterEggs\" /> cues included the 1960s ''Batman'' television-series theme,<ref name=\"60sBatmanTheme\" /> the [[Batman (1989 film)|1989 ''Batman'' film]] theme,<ref name=\"89BatmanTheme\" /> \"hints\" of the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' theme, the march theme and \"Can You Read My Mind?\" from the [[Superman (1978 film)|1978 ''Superman'' film]],<ref name=\"Part2EasterEggs\" /> the [[The Flash (1990 TV series)|1990s ''Flash'' television series]] theme,<ref name=\"Part3EasterEggs\" /> and the ''[[Super Friends]]'' theme.<ref name=\"TVLineFinaleRecap\" />\n\n===Effect on the Arrowverse===\nBefore the crossover, Guggenheim told each of the series' showrunners that \"there's an opportunity here to introduce some major status quo shift[s]\" if they desired.<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> He described it as not \"so much a burden of fixing something, it was the freedom of being able to change whatever we wanted to change.\"<ref name=\"ComicGiantComicBook\" /> Guggenheim added that each series would be affected except for ''Legends of Tomorrow'', since \"the crossover launches much of that season\" and there would be \"one rather big ramification\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimIndieWireDec2019\" /> After the crossover, Dries wanted to \"make Kate's life a little bit more integrated with all of this madness of sci-fi and aliens, and the dense mythology between\" the other series, but still keep the grounding established earlier in ''Batwoman''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> However, this was \"a little tricky because our characters aren't yet exposed to this notion of multiple universes, superheroes, powers, and stuff.\"<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> An action by Barry would have ramifications for the rest of ''The Flash''{{'}}s season.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" /> The goal of the crossover for Wallace was to \"tap into that feeling that the readers in 1985 would have had, when reading that story, with the tectonic shifts in the comic world, underneath\"; he called the Arrowverse ending a \"game-changer\" which \"opens up to a whole new world\".<ref name=\"FlashEpCollider\" />\n\nBy the end of the crossover the universe was rebooted, with all of the CW series airing at the time{{Snd}}''Arrow'', ''The Flash'', ''Supergirl'', ''Legends of Tomorrow'', ''Batwoman'', and ''Black Lightning''{{Snd}}existing on the new [[Earth-Prime (Arrowverse)|Earth-Prime]]. A new multiverse was also created, with six Earths.<ref name=\"EWMultiverseChanges\" /> Although Guggenheim had wanted a single Earth-Prime, the crossover would not have been able to visit the worlds of other DC properties. A compromise was reached in which these properties were returned to different Earths in the multiverse, and the Arrowverse series were combined in a single Earth. The Arrowverse characters are oblivious to the newly-formed multiverse.<ref name=\"NewMultiveseCompromise\" />\n\nGuggenheim said that \"there is an opportunity going forward after 'Crisis' to slowly reveal all of the weird changes,\"<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> with each series \"get[ing] the chance to tell a piece of that story.\"<ref name=\"TVLineBurningQuestions\" /> Changes include John Diggle and Lyla Michaels' daughter, Sara, returning to the timeline after her change in [[Flashpoint (Arrowverse)|Flashpoint]], and Lex Luthor's more-heroic qualities. Returning baby Sara was \"very important\" to Guggenheim and Schwartz to accomplish in \"Crisis\" after they almost did so in \"Elseworlds\"; it was held off until this crossover because they \"thought it had more punch if it was a part of the universal reboot\". ''Supergirl'' showrunners Robert Rovner and Jessica Queller came to Guggenheim with the idea to alter Lex Luthor, something they \"were all really excited about\".<ref name=\"GuggenheimVarietyJan2020\" /> In ''Batwoman'', Kate's sister [[Beth Kane|Beth]] return as a separate person from the season's antagonist Alice;<ref name=\"DriesEWJan2019\" /> Dries called this a \"shocking resonance\" for the series.<ref name=\"TVInsiderDec2019\" />\n\n==Marketing==\n{{external media\n| image1 = [https://static0.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Crisis-on-Infinite-Earths-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo without Oliver Queen]\n| image2 = [https://static3.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/crisis-final-logo-header.jpg \"Crisis\" logo with Oliver Queen]\n}}\n[[Boost Mobile]] was a promotional partner for the event,<ref name=\"FirstTeaser\" /> and the first teaser for the crossover was released on November 10, 2019.<ref name=\"FirstTeaserCast\" /> On November 15, The CW released a series of show-specific teasers.<ref name=\"SupergirlShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"BatwomanShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"FlashShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"ArrowShortTeaser\" /><ref name=\"LegendsShortTeaser\" /> A week later, the event's poster was released.<ref name=\"PosterReleased\" /> A full trailer was released on November 24,<ref name=\"FullTrailer\" /> followed by additional trailers on December 3 and December 6.<ref name=\"FirstLongTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SecondLongTrailer\" />\n\nWhen the initial trailers were released in November, a logo with the lead character of each series (except Oliver Queen) was also released; Guggenheim said that at that time, legal and financial considerations prevented the inclusion of Amell's character in the logo.<ref name=\"LogoNoOliver\" /> With the release of the full trailer the following month, Oliver was included in the logo; according to  Guggenheim, this was due to \"the creativity of a lot of very smart people\" and \"a loophole\".<ref name=\"LogoWithOliver\" /><ref name=\"LogoWithOliverLoophole\" /> He had been told that \"only actors appearing in all five hours could be in the main title card\", and Amell does not appear in the fifth episode.<ref name=\"LogoOliverExplaination\" />\n\nA week before the last two episodes aired, a second poster for the crossover was released. Russ Burlingame of Comicbook.com said that the poster was \"a mirror to the first \"Crisis\" poster, but centering on darkness rather than light\"; different taglines were used, and \"the Anti-Monitor standing with his hands raised up and pointed down, whereas The Monitor had stood with his palms up and arms at his sides.\"<ref name=\"ComicbookNewPoster\" /> On January 10, 2020, Amell released a trailer for the event's last two episodes.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Broadcast===\n\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" began with ''Supergirl'' on December 8, 2019, continuing with ''Batwoman'' on December 9 and ''The Flash'' on December 10. The crossover concluded with ''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow'' on January 14, 2020.<ref name=\"TCAAugust2019\" /> The December 9, 2019 episode of ''Black Lightning'' tied into the event.<ref

According to the website's critical consensus, \"TV's biggest crossover manages to tie these different universes together, offering plenty of cameos, dramatic moments, and surprising twists that will shake the Arrowverse forever.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/supergirl/s05/e09 |title=Supergirl \u2013 Season 5 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nJesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] rated the first hour nine out of ten. Schedeen called the episode \"accessible\" to viewers, and said that it did not \"lose sight of the personal and emotional stakes of this conflict\". He said that the ''Supergirl'' supporting cast was \"utilized well\" and called the episode \"very critical\" for fans of ''Arrow'', given Oliver's death (although he regretted Barry's small role).<ref name=\"IGNSupergirlReview\" /> Grading the episode A\u2013minus, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Sara Netzley said that \"no amount of watching, reading, and speculating [could] truly [prepare] us for the heroism, the tears, the sacrifice, and the cameos\".<ref name=\"EWSupergirlReview\" /> ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Caroline Siede called the episode's opening \"some of the most exhilarating superhero TV I've ever seen\". According to Siede, \"Crisis\" was the first Arrowverse crossover \"to deliver an episode that feels like a meaningful part of the crossover and a meaningful part of ''Supergirl'' as well.\" Noting that the scene between Kara and Clark discussing Argo City's destruction felt \"like ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' and its 'Asgard is not a place, it's a people' ethos\", she graded the episode  B-plus.<ref name=\"AVClubSupergirlReview\" /> Giving the episode 4.5 out of five stars, Kayti Burt of ''[[Den of Geek]]'' called Oliver's death \"a massively gutsy storytelling move\"; the episode \"set the stakes for the crossover journey to come.\" About the cast, Burt said: \"By keeping the ensemble in this part of the story relatively small, we were able to spend more time with all of them, not to mention check in with the characters who are ''Supergirl''-specific\"; \"one of the best scenes\" was between Alex and Lena.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekSupergirlReview\" />\n\n====''Batwoman''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 93% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Part two of DC's ambitious crossover is just as relentless as the first installment, if even smoother around the edges, masterfully juggling many characters, emotions, and Easter eggs to a satisfying result.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/batwoman/s01/e09 |title=Batwoman \u2013 Season 1 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen called the episode \"a superhero nerd's dream come true\" since it \"doubles down on the emotional character drama and manages to deliver some of the best live-action Superman moments in a very long time.\" Schedeen noted the ''Smallville'' moments were the \"epilogue fans deserve\", but conceded some fans would not have enjoyed them and praised Routh as \"a solid Superman and a downright terrific Clark Kent\". He added the second hour was less plot-driven and the crossover could be \"moving too slowly for its own good\", but preferred it \"prioritizing the character moments over the plot and spectacle\". Speaking to the Lazarus Pit subplot in the episode, Schedeen deemed it \"an unnecessary addition to an already crowded crossover\". He gave the episode an 8.8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNBatwomanReview\" /> Chancellor Agard at ''Entertainment Weekly'' gave the episode a \"B+\" saying \"''Batwoman''{{'}}s Part 2 of the crossover succeeds where Part 1 stumbled a bit. Yes, tonight's episode was just as busy (and cameo-filled), but it flowed smoothly and all of the important beats landed.\" Agard credited the simple task of the heroes searching for the Paragons as to why the episode worked so well. Conroy's appearance was \"truly something,\" according to Agard. He also was one of the fans \"letdown\" by the ''Smallville'' moments, but it eventually made sense to him because \"''Smallville'' was always about Clark Kent [and] his desire to live a normal life despite his powers\".<ref name=\"EWBatwomanReview\" /> Alani Vargas of ''The A.V. Club'' felt \"the writers did a great job of weaving in some of the most famous versions of Superman\" into the episode, though she did note that other characters and elements from ''Batwoman'' got \"the short end of the stick\" in the crossover; she gave the episode a \"B\".<ref name=\"AVClubBatwomanReview\" /> ''Den of Geek''{{'}}s Delia Harrington gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars.<ref name=\"DenOfGeekBatwomanReview\" />\n\n====''The Flash''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 11 reviews for the episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"An emotional episode that packs a surprising punch, \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" sets the stage for a heartbreaking winter premiere.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/flash/s06/e09 |title=The Flash \u2013 Season 6 Episode 9 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen felt \"the cracks are definitely starting to show\" with ''The Flash'' episode, highlighting the number of new characters introduced to the story along with all the plot needed to be covered in this hour. Specifically, he felt Ryan Choi's introduction could have happened before the crossover to \"get some of the backstory out of the way\", and the purgatory storyline \"deserved far more attention\" than the episode was able to give, despite Schedeen being \"very much behind\" Oliver becoming the [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|Spectre]]. Schedeen was able to see some of the production limitations, commenting on how it was obvious to him some scenes did not have all actors filming together. Despite all this, \"this episode never loses sight of the core appeal of Crisis\" giving characters \"their big moments and celebrating the connections these characters have forged.\" Schedeen praised Earth-90 Flash's sacrifice, the way Black Lightning was introduced to the Arrowverse, Blake Neely's score, and the Lucifer cameo, ultimately giving the episode an 8 out of 10.<ref name=\"IGNFlashReview\" /> Agard said with the Earth-90 Flash's death, the episode achieved the \"clever way to save Grant Gustin from that fate while also wrapping up that thread in a way that was satisfying and didn't feel like a complete cheat\". He was also glad that J'onn J'onnz and Iris West were having more substantial roles in the crossover than previous ones in which they had been sidelined or underutilized. To Agard, the introduction of Black Lightning was \"the definition of delayed gratification. Seeing Cress interact with everyone in this scene was something to behold because we've been waiting for it to happen and, more importantly, the script does a good job of synthesizing who this guy is to non-''Black Lightning'' viewers.\" Giving the episode an \"A\u2013\", Agard concluded, \"Overall, I kind of loved this episode. Sure, it definitely moved a bit too quickly and I lost track of the story at times. But it had an immense heart to it. Not only that, but it also improved on what Part 2 did.\"<ref name=\"EWFlashReview\" />\n\n''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Scott Von Doviak also awarded the episode an \"A\u2013\", saying the crossover is \"a hot mess, there's no question about it. To call it overstuffed would be an understatement{{nbsp}}... There are five-minute subplots here that could have been entire episodes of the various series making up the Arrowverse, and the whole thing feels like it could fly apart like the Flash on the cosmic treadmill at any moment. But that's what makes it so much fun.\" Von Doviak called the purgatory subplot one of the ones that felt rushed, and the killing of Earth-90 Flash made \"all the angst of the first half of the [''Flash''] season feel a little cheap\". As for the episode's ending, Von Doviak said it was \"kind of a ripoff of ''Avengers: Infinity War''\", especially since he predicted all of it would be reversed in the final installments, \"but as far as cliffhangers to hold us until after the holidays go, it'll do.\"<ref name=\"AVClubFlashReview\" /> Awarding the episode 5 out of 5 stars, Mike Cecchini from ''Den of Geek'' felt the crossover and this episode succeeded in \"deliver[ing] 100+ episodes worth of emotional and narrative payoff\" and being \"the climax of the single most ambitious crossover in television history\".<ref name=\"DenOfGeekFlashReview\" />\n\n====''Arrow'' and ''Legends of Tomorrow''====\nRotten Tomatoes reported a 79% approval rating, based on 14 reviews for the ''Arrow'' episode. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"{{'}}s fourth installment reshuffles the universe in rousing fashion thanks to ''Arrow'' himself and a delightful cameo from Ezra Miller, even if repeating the same sacrifice twice dilutes the impact of this farewell to Oliver Queen.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/arrow/s08/e08 |title=Arrow \u2013 Season 8 Episode 8 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 17, 2020}}</ref> For the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode, Rotten Tomatoes reported a 100% approval rating, based on 5 reviews.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/dc_s_legends_of_tomorrow/s05/e01 |title=DC's Legends of Tomorrow \u2013 Season 5 Episode 1 |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=January 25, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSchedeen gave the final two installments a 9 out of 10 saying, \"The final two chapters of \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" cement this crossover as the most entertaining and most ambitious Arrowverse adventure yet.\" After fearing the crossover would buckle under its weight in Part 3, Schedeen was glad in the ''Arrow'' episode that the \"consolidating [of] the cast down to a handful of heroes and a few cosmic entities really help[ed] refocus and remind viewers of what's at stake.\" He also liked seeing the human side of the Monitor, but could not say the same for the Anti-Monitor, who was just \"a faceless threat and an obligatory, all-powerful punching bag in these final two episodes.\" Schedeen called Oliver's sacrifice \"a fitting end\" to the character and one that justified the decision to resurrect him after his sacrifice in the first part. It also did \"even more to bring the character full circle and complete his arc. Ollie's story has always been about the sacrifices he makes for the greater good and what better way to end that story than by having the Arrowverse's first hero give his life so that its best heroes can continue the fight?\" For the ''Legends'' episode, he felt the \"finale manages to deftly balance the whimsical, self-aware tone of ''Legends'' with the gravitas needed as our heroes confront the Anti-Monitor one last time.\" Schedeen also added Part 5 \"manages to juggle its many moving parts elegantly\" and he enjoyed the ending sequence and the creation of the Arrowverse's version of the Justice League.<ref name=\"IGNArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nFor Part 4, Agard felt the Speed Force flashbacks were \"very cheesy and reminiscent of things ''Arrow'' has done in the past. On the other hand, I found it very effective in putting us in the mindset for the final battle and, more importantly, the end of ''Arrow''{{nbsp}}... [T]his episode honors his connection to the other shows and how this one show's existence has created so much.\" He added Oliver's death in this episode \"packed way more of an emotional punch [over the one in Part 1] because of the three actors\u2019 performances.\" With the ''Legends'' episode, Agard was \"surprised by how strong\" it was, noting, \"[t]he last episode of a crossover is usually the weakest because the big battle ends up taking precedence over character moments, but that's not the case here at all.\" The episodes were given an \"A\u2013\" by Agard.<ref name=\"EWArrowLegendsReview\" /> Delia Harrington at ''Den of Geek'' felt the final two episodes were \"very different, but equally compelling\". She praised the performances by Amell and Benoist and enjoyed all of the cameos and Easter eggs in the final episodes. She, like Agard, was more approving of Oliver's death in these episodes saying it \"was much more in line with what his character deserved\". For Part 5, Harrington said \"The governing principle of this episode was the banana pants aesthetic of ''Legends'', and that's exactly what it needed,\" pointing out the appearance of the giant Beebo. Giving the episodes 4 out of 5 stars, she concluded, \"for those of us who were touting ''Arrow'' as the best superhero property on any screen, big or small, back in Season 1, this is truly the television equivalent to ''Endgame''-level storytelling. Some of the old heroes are gone. New heroes rise in their place. The fandom mourns, but we also get to celebrate all the new stories there are to tell.\"<ref name=\"DenOfGeekArrowLegendsReview\" />\n\nKate Kulzick of ''The A.V. Club'' was more negative on the ''Arrow'' episode, giving it a \"C\u2013\". She said, \"''Arrow''{{'}}s contribution to the crossover not only fails to live up to the dramatic stakes of that cliffhanger, it sours the goodwill generated by the first three episodes, retreading old ground and sending the crossover limping into its finale.\" Kulzick was disappointed more explanation was not given to how the Monitor and Ant-Monitor received their god-like powers. She also called the Speed Force moments \"arbitrary\" in what could have been \"a wonderful opportunity to relive and re-imagine high points from each of the Arrowverse shows\u2019 histories.\" Getting to the final battle between the Paragons and Anti-Monitor was where Kulzick felt the episode \"really starts to flounder\". Unlike Agard and Harrington, Kulzick felt Oliver's death was \"a pale shadow of the raw and emotional end of part one\" and \"one hell of a disappointing way to send out\" the character.<ref name=\"AVClubArrowReview\" /> For the ''Legends'' episode, ''The A.V. Club''{{'}}s Allison Shoemaker felt some of the concepts in the episode were \"flimsy\" adding, \"The plot is fine. The characters and their reactions to what's happened, to that loss and the new status quo, is what really hits home.\" The highlight character moment to Shoemaker was Barry and Sara's conversation, followed by Sara and Diggle's. She gave the episode a \"B+\".<ref name=\"AVClubLegendsReview\" />\n\n==''Crisis Aftermath''==\n''Crisis Aftermath'' is an [[aftershow]] that aired after the December 8 ''Supergirl'' episode and the December 10 ''The Flash'' episode. The show went \"in-depth to explore\" the crossover, and was hosted by [[Kevin Smith]].<ref name=\"Aftershow\" /> ''Entertainment Weekly'' helped develop the special. The show featured discussions with executive producers Guggenheim, Dries, Rovner, Shimizu, and Wallace; stars Cryer, Garrett, McNamara, and Conroy; and panel guest Dani Fernandez, among others.
