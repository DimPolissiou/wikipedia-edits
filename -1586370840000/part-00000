When encountering a problem or something he doesn't understand (like the loss of his own smell following a bath or the unusual way sandwiches are cut to be triangular rather than rectangular), the episode will transition into an animated 'art world', represented by Pablo's drawings. There, Pablo and the Book Animals will work together to solve whatever problem is at hand.\n\n==Characters==\n*Pablo (voiced by Jake Williamson): The titular protagonist.\n*Mouse (voiced by Rachael Dickson): Mouse is very reliable and organized, but she's also very sensitive to sounds and smells. She talks in the third person.\n*Noasaurus (voiced by Tony Finnegan): Noasaurus is very kind, gentle and good at maths, but can get nervous and clumsy.\n*Tang (voiced by Michael White): Tang is the big, fun goofball of the group. He is always ready to do anything, but has problems reading social cues and isn't always very careful.\n*Wren (voiced by Sumita Majumdar): Wren is very energetic, but can have difficulty staying focused and [[Stimming|flaps her wings a lot for comfort]].\n*Llama (voiced by Rosie King): Llama is sweet and curious. She has [[echolalia]].\n*Draff (voiced by Scott Mulligan): The smartest of the group, Draff is highly intelligent and precise. His most commonly used phrase is \u2018in point of fact\u2019, as he loves explaining things.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/meet-stars-groundbreaking-new-cbeebies-506522|title=New CBeebies animated show explores life on the autistic spectrum|date=20 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/pablo|title=BBC - Pablo - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n*Pablo's Mum (played by Rosie Barry): The titular protagonist's mother.

When encountering a problem or something he doesn't understand (like the loss of his own smell following a bath or the unusual way sandwiches are cut to be triangular rather than rectangular), the episode will transition into an animated 'art world', represented by Pablo's drawings. There, Pablo and the Book Animals will work together to solve whatever problem is at hand.\n\n==Characters==\n*Pablo (voiced by Jake Williamson): The titular protagonist.\n*Mouse (voiced by Rachael Dickson): Mouse is very reliable and organized, but she's also very sensitive to sounds and smells. She talks in the third person.\n*Noasaurus (voiced by Tony Finnegan): Noasaurus is very kind, gentle and good at maths, but can get nervous and clumsy.\n*Tang (voiced by Michael White): Tang is the big, fun goofball of the group. He is always ready to do anything, but has problems reading social cues and isn't always very careful.\n*Wren (voiced by Sumita Majumdar): Wren is very energetic, but can have difficulty staying focused and [[Stimming|flaps her wings a lot for comfort]].\n*Llama (voiced by Rosie King): Llama is sweet and curious. She has [[echolalia]].\n*Draff (voiced by Scott Mulligan): The smartest of the group, Draff is highly intelligent and precise. His most commonly used phrase is \u2018in point of fact\u2019, as he loves explaining things.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/meet-stars-groundbreaking-new-cbeebies-506522|title=New CBeebies animated show explores life on the autistic spectrum|date=20 September 2017|publisher=|via=www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2017/pablo|title=BBC - Pablo - Media Centre|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n*Pablo's Mum (played by Rosie Barry): The titular protagonist's mother.

Blood flows from the heart to the gills where it is oxygenated. This oxygen-rich blood is then carried throughout the body and to the tissues before returning to the heart. As the heart beats, deoxygenated blood enters the sinus venosus. The blood then flows through the atrium to the ventricle, before emptying into the conus arteriosus and leaving the heart.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy: A laboratory dissection guide|last=Kardong, K.

The water enters through the mouth, passes into the pharynx, and exits through the [[gill slit]]s (most sharks have five pairs, the [[Chlamydoselachidae|frilled sharks]], [[Hexanchiformes|cow sharks]], and [[sixgill sawshark]] have six or seven pairs). Most sharks also have an accessory respiratory opening called a [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]] behind their eyes. In bottom-dwelling sharks such as [[angel shark]]s, the spiracle allows them to take in water to breathe without having to open their mouths {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.\n\nThere are two mechanisms that sharks can use to move water over their gills: in buccal pumping, the shark actively pulls in water using its buccal muscles, while in ram ventilation, the shark swims forward, forcing water into its mouth and through its gills. As buccal pumping is more energy-intensive than ram ventilation, the former is generally used by sedentary, bottom-dwelling sharks while the latter is used by more active sharks. Most sharks can switch between these mechanisms as the situation requires. A few species, such as the [[great white shark]], have lost the ability to perform buccal pumping and thus will suffocate if they stop moving forward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/zoology/marine-life/shark-drown.htm |title=Will a shark drown if it stops moving? |author=Edmonds, M. |publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=April 28, 2013|date=2008-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fish anatomy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Shark nav}}\n{{anatomy}}\n\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Parts of a shark.svg|right|500px|The major features of sharks]]\n\n'''Shark anatomy''' differs from that of [[Osteichthyes|bony fish]] in a variety of ways.

Blood flows from the heart to the gills where it is oxygenated. This oxygen-rich blood is then carried throughout the body and to the tissues before returning to the heart. As the heart beats, deoxygenated blood enters the sinus venosus. The blood then flows through the atrium to the ventricle, before emptying into the conus arteriosus and leaving the heart.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy: A laboratory dissection guide|last=Kardong, K.

The water enters through the mouth, passes into the pharynx, and exits through the [[gill slit]]s (most sharks have five pairs, the [[Chlamydoselachidae|frilled sharks]], [[Hexanchiformes|cow sharks]], and [[sixgill sawshark]] have six or seven pairs). Most sharks also have an accessory respiratory opening called a [[Spiracle (vertebrates)|spiracle]] behind their eyes. In bottom-dwelling sharks such as [[angel shark]]s, the spiracle allows them to take in water to breathe without having to open their mouths {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.\n\nThere are two mechanisms that sharks can use to move water over their gills: in buccal pumping, the shark actively pulls in water using its buccal muscles, while in ram ventilation, the shark swims forward, forcing water into its mouth and through its gills. As buccal pumping is more energy-intensive than ram ventilation, the former is generally used by sedentary, bottom-dwelling sharks while the latter is used by more active sharks. Most sharks can switch between these mechanisms as the situation requires. A few species, such as the [[great white shark]], have lost the ability to perform buccal pumping and thus will suffocate if they stop moving forward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/zoology/marine-life/shark-drown.htm |title=Will a shark drown if it stops moving? |author=Edmonds, M. |publisher=HowStuffWorks |accessdate=April 28, 2013|date=2008-06-09 }}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Fish anatomy]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Shark nav}}\n{{anatomy}}\n\n[[Category:Sharks]]\n", "name_user": "108.7.230.36", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eTail)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_anatomy"}
