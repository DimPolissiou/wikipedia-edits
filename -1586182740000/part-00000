The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u201367</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u201365</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u201306</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}. Their [[metacentric height]] declined from {{convert|6|ft|1}} at deep load to {{convert|4.4|ft|1}} and the ships had a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64\u201365</ref> In 1939, ''Courageous'' had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men, plus 403 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 283, 285</ref>\n\nTheir half-sister ''Furious'' was the same length, but had a beam of {{convert|89|ft|0.75|in|m|1}},<ref>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and an average draught of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76</ref> No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3 /> The maximum fuel capacity of ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' was increased during the conversion to {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=b83>Burt 2012, p. 283</ref> giving them an endurance of {{convert|6630|nmi|lk=in}} at 10 knots.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One of the 5.5-inch guns from ''Furious'', redeployed in the Faeroes]]\n''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref name=b69 /> They fired {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2790|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Their maximum range was {{convert|16000|yd|m}} at their maximum elevation of 25\u00b0, and the rate of fire was 12 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, p. 40</ref>\n\nHalf a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun|QF 4-inch Mark V]] guns replaced her original [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] guns. Four were mounted on the sides of the flying-off deck and two on the [[quarterdeck]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 267</ref> They had a maximum depression of \u22125\u00b0 and a maximum elevation of 80\u00b0. The guns fired a {{convert|31|lb|kg|adj=on}} [[Explosive material#High explosives|high explosive]] (HE) shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2387|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of 10 to 15 rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 58</ref> The four guns on the flying-off deck were removed during trials of the lower flight deck in 1926\u20131927, but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded.<ref name=f9>Friedman, p. 109</ref>\n\nFour single [[QF 2 pounder naval gun|QF 2-pounder ''pom-poms'']] were installed by 1927.<ref name=f9 /> During ''Furious''{{'}}s September 1930 \u2013 February 1932 refit, her anti-aircraft outfit was changed by the substitution of two eight-barrel 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts for the forward 4-inch guns on the flying-off deck removed earlier.<ref name=b69>Burt 2012, p. 276</ref> The Mark V mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark VIII 2-pounder gun fired a {{convert|40|mm|adj=on}} {{convert|.91|lb|kg|adj=on}} shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|1920|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a distance of {{convert|3800|yd|m}}. The gun's rate of fire was approximately 96\u201398 rounds per minute.<ref>Campbell, pp. 71\u201374</ref>\n\nThe {{convert|5.5|in|adj=on}} and {{convert|4|in|adj=on|0}} guns were replaced during ''Furious''{{'}}s refit in early 1939 by a dozen [[QF 4 inch Mk XVI naval gun|QF 4-inch Mk XVI guns]] in twin [[dual purpose gun|dual-purpose]] Mark XIX mounts. One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired 15\u201320 {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 feet and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|1}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|to|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from {{convert|0.75|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u201372</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u201376</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u201378</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor (circa 1935)]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201388</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u201354</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u201362</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u201310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u201330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u201341, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u201365</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u201385</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

The three ships\u2014{{HMS|Furious|47|2}}, {{HMS|Courageous|50|2}} and {{HMS|Glorious||2}}\u2014were originally laid down as [[Courageous-class battlecruiser]]s as part of the [[Baltic Project]] during the [[Naval warfare of World War I|First World War]]. While very fast, their minimal armour and few guns limited their long-term utility in the post-war Royal Navy, and they were [[Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom)|laid up]] after the war. They were considered [[capital ship]]s by the terms of the 1922 [[Washington Naval Treaty]] and were included in the total amount of tonnage allowed to the Royal Navy. Rather than [[ship breaking|scrap]] them, the Navy decided to convert them to aircraft carriers as permitted under the Treaty.\n\n''Furious'', already partially converted during the war, began her reconstruction in 1921, before the Treaty came into effect. In an attempt to minimise air turbulence, she was given no [[superstructure]] or [[Glossary of nautical terms#I|island]]. This was not entirely satisfactory, and a small island was added in 1939. Another problem was that she lacked a standard [[funnel (ship)|funnel]]; instead, her [[boiler]] uptakes ran along the sides of the ship and exhausted out of gratings on the rear of the [[flight deck]], or at the sides of the ship if landing operations were in progress. The long ducts reduced her aircraft capacity, and the exhaust gases were as much of a problem for landing aircraft as the turbulence would have been. Her [[sister ship|half-sisters]], ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', began their conversions to aircraft carriers as ''Furious'' neared completion. They drew upon the experience gained by the Royal Navy since ''Furious'' had been designed and incorporated an island with a funnel, increasing their aircraft capacity by one-third and making it safer to land.\n\nAs the first large carrier completed by the Royal Navy, ''Furious'' was extensively used to evaluate aircraft handling and landing procedures, including the first-ever carrier night landing in 1926. ''Courageous'' became the first warship lost by the Royal Navy in the Second World War when she was [[torpedo]]ed in September 1939 by a German [[U-boat|submarine]]. ''Glorious'' participated in the [[Norwegian campaign]] in 1940, but she was sunk by two German [[battleship]]s in June as she sailed home with a minimal escort. ''Furious'' participated in many major operations during the war, including the Norwegian campaign in 1940, the [[Malta Convoys]] and ''[[Operation Torch]]'' in 1942, and airstrikes on the {{ship|German battleship|Tirpitz}} and other targets in Norway in 1944. The ship was worn out by 1944 and was placed in [[Reserve fleet|reserve]] status in September 1944 before being [[Ship commissioning#Ship decommissioning|paid off]] in 1945 and sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]] in 1948.\n\n== Careers as battlecruisers ==\n{{Main|Courageous-class battlecruiser}}\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious (1917) profile drawing.png|thumb|left|''Glorious'' as a battlecruiser]]\nThe first two ships of the class, ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'', spent the First World War on [[North Sea]] patrols, climaxing in the [[Second Battle of Heligoland Bight]] in November 1917. Their half-sister ''Furious'' was designed with a pair of {{convert|18|in|0|adj=on}} guns\u2014as opposed to four {{convert|15|in|0|adj=on}}\u2014but was modified while being built to hold a flying-off deck and [[hangar]] in lieu of her forward [[gun turret|turret]] and [[barbette]]. She made some patrols in the North Sea before her rear turret was removed and another flight deck added. Her aircraft attacked [[Zeppelin]] sheds during the [[Tondern raid]] in July 1918.<ref>Roberts, p. 123</ref>\n\nAll three ships were reduced to reserve after the war. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 limited the signatory nations to a set amount of capital ship tonnage; all ships in excess of this figure had to be scrapped. Up to {{convert|66000|LT|t}} of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers, and the Royal Navy decided to use the ''Courageous''-class ships due to their high speed. Each ship was reconstructed with a flight deck during the 1920s.<ref>Friedman, p. 97</ref>\n\n== Conversions ==\n[[File:HMS Furious-2.jpg|thumb|left|''Furious'' as she was during the First World War with separate take-off and landing decks and superstructure in between]]\n[[File:Dunning Landing-on Furious In Pup.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Sopwith Pup]] unsuccessfully attempting to land on ''Furious''{{'}}s forward flight deck, 7 August 1917]]\n{{HMS|Furious|47|2}} had been fitted during the First World War with a flying-off and landing deck, but the latter proved largely unusable because of the strong air currents around the superstructure and exhaust gases from the funnel. She was laid up after the war, but was converted to an aircraft carrier between June 1921 and September 1925. Her design was based on the very limited experience gained with the first two British carriers: {{HMS|Argus|I49|2}}, less than three years old, and {{HMS|Eagle|1918|2}}, which had carried out only 143 deck landings during preliminary [[sea trial]]s in 1920.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 263\u201367</ref><ref>Burt 2012, p. 252</ref><ref>Brown, p. 252</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s superstructure, masts, funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a {{convert|576|by|92|ft|m|1|adj=on}} flight deck that extended over three-quarters of her length. This flight deck was not level; it sloped upwards about three-quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft, which had no brakes at the time it was designed. That era's fore-and-aft [[arresting gear]], initially {{convert|320|ft|1}} long on ''Furious'', was not intended to stop landing aircraft\u2014the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind\u2014but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck. Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges minimised turbulence. To minimise any turbulence over the flight deck, ''Furious'' was flush-decked and lacked an island, like ''Argus''; instead she was provided with a retractable [[Glossary of nautical terms#C|charthouse]] at the forward end of the flight deck.<ref>Friedman, pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nA two-level hangar was built under the flight deck, each level being {{convert|15|ft|1}} high. The lower hangar was {{convert|550|ft|1}} long by {{convert|35|-|50|ft|1}} wide and the upper was {{convert|520|by|50|ft|1}}. Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]] so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 264\u201365</ref> Two {{convert|47|by|46|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two {{convert|600|impgal|l USgal|adj=on}} ready-use [[petrol]] tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional {{convert|20000|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol were in bulk storage. The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard ''Furious'' in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side.<ref>Friedman, pp. 94\u201395</ref> ''Furious''{{'}}s long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\">Friedman, pp. 103, 105\u201306</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' and ''Courageous'' were converted to aircraft carriers after ''Furious'' began her reconstruction, ''Courageous'' at [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport]] starting on 29 June 1924, and ''Glorious'' at [[Rosyth]] on 14 February 1924. The latter was moved to Devonport to complete the conversion after ''Furious'' was finished. Their design was based on ''Furious'' with a few improvements based on experience gained since she was designed. All superstructure, guns, and fittings down to the main deck were removed. A two-storey hangar, each level {{convert|16|ft|1}} high and {{convert|550|ft|m|1}} long, was built on top of the remaining hull; the upper hangar level opened onto a short flying-off deck, below and forward of the main flight deck. Two slightly larger {{convert|46|by|48|ft|m|adj=on|1}} lifts were installed fore and aft in the flight deck. An island was added on the starboard side with the bridge, flying control station, and funnel, as an island did not create as much turbulence as had been earlier feared. By 1939 both ships could carry {{convert|34500|impgal|l USgal}} of petrol.<ref name=\"Friedmanpp\" />\n\n== Description ==\n[[File:HMS Glorious underway 1936.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of ''Glorious'', 1936]]\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships had an [[length overall|overall length]] of {{convert|786|ft|9|in|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|90|ft|6|in|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|28|ft|m|1}} at [[deep load]]. These were increases of {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m|1}} in beam and over {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} in draught compared to their earlier incarnations as battlecruisers. They displaced {{convert|24210|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26990|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, increases of over {{convert|3000|LT|t}}. Their [[metacentric height]] declined from {{convert|6|ft|1}} at deep load to {{convert|4.4|ft|1}} and the ships had a complete [[double bottom]].<ref name=r65>Roberts, pp. 64\u201365</ref> In 1939, ''Courageous'' had a complement of 807 officers and enlisted men, plus 403 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 283, 285</ref>\n\nTheir half-sister ''Furious'' was the same length, but had a beam of {{convert|89|ft|0.75|in|m|1}},<ref>Jenkins, front [[endpaper]]</ref> and an average draught of {{convert|27|ft|3|in|m|1}} at deep load, two feet deeper than before the conversion. She displaced {{convert|22500|LT|t}} at normal load and {{convert|26500|LT|t|abbr=on}} at deep load, over 3,000 long tons more than her previous displacement of {{convert|19513|LT|t}} at load and {{convert|22890|LT|t}} at deep load. ''Furious''{{'}}s metacentric height was {{convert|3.6|ft|1}} at deep load, a reduction of {{convert|1.48|ft|1}} after her conversion.<ref name=r65 /> In 1932, ''Furious'' had a complement of 738 officers and enlisted men, plus 468 men in her air group.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 266, 273</ref>\n\n=== Propulsion ===\nThe ''Courageous''-class ships were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared [[steam turbine]]s. Arranged in two engine rooms, each of the turbines drove one of the four propeller shafts. ''Furious''{{'}}s propellers were {{convert|11|ft|6|in|m|1}} in diameter. The turbines were powered by 18 [[Yarrow Shipbuilders|Yarrow]] small-tube boilers equally divided among three boiler rooms. The turbines were designed to produce a total of {{convert|90000|shp|lk=in}} at a working pressure of {{convert|235|psi|kPa kg/cm2|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}.<ref>Roberts, pp. 71, 76</ref> No significant changes to the machinery were made during the conversion process to any of the three ships, but their increased displacement reduced their speed to approximately {{convert|30|kn|lk=in}}.<ref name=f5>Friedman, p. 95</ref>\n\n''Furious''{{'}}s fuel capacity was increased by {{convert|700|LT|t}} during her reconstruction, which increased her range to {{convert|7480|nmi|lk=in}} at a speed of {{convert|10|kn}}.<ref name=f3 /> The maximum fuel capacity of ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' was increased during the conversion to {{convert|3800|LT|t}} of [[fuel oil]],<ref name=b83>Burt 2012, p. 283</ref> giving them an endurance of {{convert|6630|nmi|lk=in}} at 10 knots.<ref name=f3>Friedman, p. 363</ref>\n\n=== Armament ===\n[[File:British gun, skansin (Faroe Islands).jpg|thumb|left|300px|One of the 5.5-inch guns from ''Furious'', redeployed in the Faeroes]]\n''Furious'' retained ten of her original eleven [[breech-loading]] [[BL 5.5 inch Mark I naval gun|BL 5.5-inch Mk I]] guns, five on each side, for self-defence from enemy warships.<ref name=b69 /> They fired {{convert|82|lb|kg|adj=on}} projectiles at a [[muzzle velocity]] of {{convert|2790|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}.

One mount each was on the former flying-off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 268\u201369, 276</ref> The Mark XIX mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 80\u00b0. The Mark XVI gun fired 15\u201320 {{convert|35|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shells per minute at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2660|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. Against surface targets it had a range of {{convert|19850|yd|m}} and a maximum ceiling of {{convert|31000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective anti-aircraft range of much less.<ref>Campbell, p. 56</ref> Two more Mark V 2-pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island at the same time.<ref name=b69 />\n\nDuring the Second World War, ''Furious'', the only surviving ship of the three, received an eventual total of 22 manually operated automatic [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|20&nbsp;mm Oerlikon]] light anti-aircraft (AA) guns, which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50-calibre machine gun mount.<ref name=f9 /> The Oerlikon fired a {{convert|.272|lb|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2750|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. The maximum ceiling was 10,000 feet and the maximum range was {{convert|4800|yd}} although the effective range was under {{convert|1000|yd}}. The cyclic rate of fire was 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 250 and 320 rounds per minute owing to the need to reload [[magazine (firearms)|magazines]].<ref>Campbell, pp. 75\u201376</ref>\n\nA mix of single-purpose anti-surface and anti-aircraft guns in various sizes was considered for ''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' by the [[Admiralty]], but was ultimately rejected for a dual-purpose armament of sixteen [[QF 4.7 inch Mk VIII naval gun|QF 4.7-inch Mark VIII]] guns in single high-angle mounts. One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair were on the quarterdeck. The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of each ship.<ref name=b83 /> These mounts could depress to \u22125\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 90\u00b0. The Mark VIII guns fired a {{convert|50|lb|kg|adj=on}} HE shell at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2457|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} at a rate of eight to twelve rounds per minute. The guns had a maximum ceiling of {{convert|32000|ft|m|abbr=on}}, but an effective range of much less. They had a maximum range of {{convert|16160|yd|m}} against surface targets.<ref>Campbell, p. 51</ref>\n\nDuring refits in the mid-1930s, both ships received multiple 2-pounder ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Courageous'' received three quadruple Mark VII mounts, one on each side of the flying-off deck, forward of the 4.7-inch guns, and one behind the island on the flight deck (two of these were transferred from the battleship {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|05|2}}). ''Glorious'' received three octuple Mark VI mounts in the same locations. Both ships received four water-cooled [[Vickers .50 machine gun|.50-calibre Mark III]] [[machine gun]]s in a single quadruple mounting.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 157, 286</ref> This mount could depress to \u221210\u00b0 and elevate to a maximum of 70\u00b0. The machine guns fired a {{convert|1.326|oz|adj=on}} bullet at a muzzle velocity of {{convert|2520|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}. This gave the gun a maximum range of about {{convert|5000|yd|m}}, although its effective range was only {{convert|800|yd|m}}.<ref>Campbell, p. 78</ref> Neither ship had any further guns added before they were sunk early in the war,<ref name=f9 /> in 1939 and 1940, respectively.\n\n=== Fire control and radar ===\nTo assist its weapon systems in hitting their target, ''Furious'' was completed with one [[fire-control system]] for each side, with separate [[Fire-control system#Naval fire control|directors]] for low-angle and high-angle guns. The 5.5-inch guns were centrally controlled by a [[Frederic Charles Dreyer#Dreyer Fire Control Table|Dreyer Fire-Control Table]] on the lower deck while the 4-inch guns had their mechanical computers next to their directors.<ref name=f5 /> The existing fire-control directors were removed when ''Furious'' received her new dual-purpose 4-inch mountings in 1939. New high-angle directors, including two for the ''pom-poms'', were mounted on top of the new island and on the former lower flight deck. Over the course of the war [[Type 285 radar|Type 285]] gunnery [[radar]]s were mounted on top of the high-angle directors. She also received a [[List of World War II British naval radar#Type 290|Type 290]] air-search radar.<ref name=f9 />\n\n''Courageous'' was initially fitted only with low-angle directors for her guns, but these were replaced by dual-purpose directors when she was refitted in 1930. (''Glorious'', completed later, had hers from the beginning.) Neither ship was fitted with radar before its early loss.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386</ref>\n\n=== Protection ===\nLittle armour other than that of the [[barbette]]s was removed during their conversion to aircraft carriers. The transverse bulkheads were carried through the locations of the former barbettes. The flight deck was {{convert|.625|in|mm}} in thickness.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 273, 282</ref>\n\nUnlike other British battlecruisers, the bulk of the armour of the ''Courageous''-class ships was made from [[Ultimate tensile strength|high-tensile]] steel (HTS), a type of steel used structurally in other ships. Their waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] consisted of {{convert|2|in|0}} of HTS covered by a {{convert|1|in|0|adj=on}} thick mild steel skin. It protected roughly the middle two-thirds of the ship with a one-inch extension forward to the two-inch forward transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] well short of the bow. The belt had a height of {{convert|23|ft|m|1}}, of which {{convert|18|in|m|1}} was below the designed waterline. From the former forward barbette, a three-inch bulkhead extended out to the ship's side between the upper and lower decks and a comparable bulkhead was in place at the former location of the rear barbette as well. Four decks were armoured with thicknesses varying from {{convert|0.75|to|3|in}}, thickest over the magazines and the steering gear. After the [[Battle of Jutland]], {{convert|110|LT|t}} of extra protection was added to the deck around the magazines.<ref>Burt 1986, pp. 308, 313</ref>\n\nThe [[torpedo bulkhead]]s were increased during building from {{convert|0.75|in}} to {{convert|1.5|in}} in thickness.<ref>Roberts, pp. 54, 106, 113</ref> All three ships were fitted with a shallow [[anti-torpedo bulge]] integral to the hull, which was intended to detonate the torpedo before it hit the hull proper and deflect the underwater explosion to the surface, away from the ship. Later testing proved that it was not deep enough to accomplish its task and that it lacked the layers of empty and full compartments that were necessary to absorb the force of the explosion.<ref>Roberts, p. 111</ref>\n\n=== Air groups ===\n[[File:HMS Furious-15.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Furious'' in the mid-1930s with a flight of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers overhead]]\nNormally, ''Furious'' could carry only about 36 aircraft. In the 1920s this commonly meant one flight (squadrons after 1932) of fighters ([[Fairey Flycatcher]]), two of spotters ([[Blackburn Blackburn]] or [[Avro Bison]]), one spotter reconnaissance ([[Fairey III]]D) and two flights of torpedo bombers ([[Blackburn Dart]]). In 1935 there was one squadron of fighters with [[Hawker Nimrod]]s and [[Hawker Osprey]]s, one squadron of [[Blackburn Baffin]] torpedo bombers and one squadron of Fairey IIIF spotters. During the Second World War, the carrier typically carried a single fighter squadron and two of strike aircraft of various types, although the mix was often adjusted for specific missions.<ref name=b69 />\n\n''Courageous'' and ''Glorious'' were generally similar except that they carried a total of 48 aircraft. They commonly flew the same types of aircraft as ''Furious'', although they are also known to have flown the [[Fairey Seal]], the [[Blackburn Shark]], and the [[Blackburn Ripon]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 284</ref>\n\n== Pre-war service ==\n''Furious'' was assigned to the [[Atlantic Fleet (United Kingdom)|Atlantic Fleet]] after commissioning in 1925, although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the [[Fleet Air Arm]] (FAA) inventory. These included landing and flying-off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher [[floatplane]]s, with and without wheels, to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats. The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty. A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily.<ref name=f9 /><ref>Burt 2012, pp. 270\u201372</ref> The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards. Deck-edge [[palisade]]s ([[windbreak]]s) were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather.<ref name=f5 /><ref>Jenkins, p. 271</ref> The first carrier night-landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard ''Furious''.<ref>Jenkins, p. 274</ref>\n\nThe ship was reduced to reserve status on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport from September 1930 to February 1932, focused on refitting her machinery and re-tubing her boilers.<ref name=b0>Burt 2012, p. 270</ref> In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck, the AA armament was revised and water spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 275\u201376</ref> Upon completion she ran a full-power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was {{convert|28.8|kn}} from a total of {{convert|89754|shp}}.<ref name=b0 />\n\n''Furious'' was recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November.<ref name=j6>Jenkins, p. 276</ref> Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid-1930s. She was detached to the [[Mediterranean Fleet]] from May to October 1934. ''Furious'' was present at the Coronation [[Fleet Review]] at [[Spithead]] on 20 May 1937 for King [[George VI]]. She became a deck-landing training carrier in 1937, although she was refitted between December 1937 and May 1938 in Devonport, where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward. During the [[Munich Crisis]] in September 1938, she embarked Nos. [[801 Naval Air Squadron|801]], [[821 Naval Air Squadron|821]] and [[822 Naval Air Squadron|822 Squadrons]] and joined the fleet at [[Scapa Flow]], before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair.<ref name=\"b69\" /><ref name=j6 />\n\nShe was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5.5-inch guns and palisades, mounted AA guns on her flying-off deck, plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar, and gave her a small island on the starboard side. ''Furious'' resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 277\u201378</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Courageous (50).jpg|thumb|left|''Courageous'' at anchor (circa 1935)]]\n''Courageous'' was recommissioned on 21 February 1928 and assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet from May 1928 to June 1930. She was relieved by ''Glorious'' and refitted from June to August 1930. The ship was assigned to the Atlantic and Home Fleets from 12 August 1930 to December 1938 aside from a temporary attachment to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1936. In the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed and she received two hydraulic [[aircraft catapult|catapults]] on the upper flight deck before March 1934. ''Courageous'' was refitted again between October 1935 and June 1936 and received her ''pom-pom'' mounts. She was also present at the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review. She became a training carrier in December 1938 when {{HMS|Ark Royal|91|2}} joined the Home Fleet and continued on that duty until the start of the Second World War.<ref name=b15>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201386, 290</ref>\n\n[[File:HMS Glorious anchored.jpg|thumb|right|''Glorious'' at anchor (circa 1934)]]\n''Glorious'' was recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930. She relieved ''Courageous'' in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939. In a fog on 1 April 1931 ''Glorious'' rammed SS ''Florida'' amidships while steaming at {{convert|16|knots}}. The impact crumpled {{convert|60|ft|1}} of the flying-off deck and forced ''Glorious'' to put into [[Gibdock|Gibraltar]] for temporary repairs. She had to sail to [[Malta Dockyard|Malta]] for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931. Sometime in the early 1930s, transverse arresting gear was installed. She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two catapults, her flight deck was extended to the rear, her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple ''pom-pom'' mounts. ''Glorious'' also participated in the 1937 Coronation Fleet Review before returning to the Mediterranean.<ref>Burt 2012, pp. 285\u201388</ref>\n\n== Second World War ==\n=== ''Courageous'' ===\n[[File:HMS Courageous sinking.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Courageous'' sinking]]\nIn the early days of the war, [[Hunter-killer Group|hunter-killer groups]] were formed around the fleet aircraft carriers to find and destroy U-boats. On 17 September 1939, two torpedoes from {{GS|U-29|1936|2}} turned the tables, and ''Courageous'' became the first British warship sunk in the Second World War. As ''Ark Royal'' had been surprised by a near miss seven days earlier, the fleet carriers were withdrawn from this duty.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\n=== ''Glorious'' ===\nForce J, including ''Glorious'', was organised to hunt for the {{ship|German pocket battleship|Admiral Graf Spee}} in the Indian Ocean. They were not successful, and ''Glorious'' remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she was transferred to the Mediterranean.\n\n''Glorious'' was recalled to the Home Fleet in April 1940 to provide air cover for British forces landing in [[Norwegian Campaign|Norway]].<ref>Burt 2012, p. 285</ref> [[Gloster Gladiators]] of [[No. 263 Squadron RAF]] were flown aboard to be transferred to Norwegian airbases. ''Glorious'' and ''Ark Royal'' arrived off central Norway on 24 April where 263 Squadron was flown off and their organic aircraft attacked targets in the [[Trondheim]] area before ''Glorious'' had to return to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and embark new aircraft. She returned on 1 May, after failing to load new aircraft because of poor weather. The task force was under heavy air attack by the [[Luftwaffe]] all day and was withdrawn that evening.<ref>Haarr, pp. 143\u201354</ref>\n\n''Glorious'' returned on 18 May with six [[Supermarine Walrus]] [[Amphibious aircraft|amphibious]] [[flying boat]]s of [[701 Naval Air Squadron|701 Squadron]] and 18 [[Hawker Hurricane]]s of [[No. 46 Squadron RAF]]. The Walruses were flown off to [[Harstad]], but the airfield at [[Sk\u00e5nland]] was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when ''Glorious'' returned to Scapa on 21 May. ''Glorious'' came back to the [[Narvik]] area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 261\u201362</ref>\n\nBritish forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later. The evacuation (''[[Operation Alphabet]]'') began in the north on the night of 3/4 June, and ''Glorious'' arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support. She carried only nine Sea Gladiators of [[802 Naval Air Squadron|802 Squadron]] and six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of [[823 Naval Air Squadron|823 Squadron]] for self-defence, as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if possible. Ten Gladiators of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the biplanes.<ref>Haarr, pp. 308\u201310</ref> This was the first time that high performance monoplanes without [[tailhook]]s had been landed on an aircraft carrier.<ref name=h61>Howland, p. 61</ref>\n\nCaptain [[Guy D'Oyly-Hughes]] requested and was granted permission to proceed independently to Scapa Flow in the early hours of 8 June. On the way back across the [[North Sea]], ''Glorious'' and her two escorting destroyers, {{HMS|Acasta|H09|2}} and {{HMS|Ardent|H41|2}}, were found by the two German battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}}.<ref>Haarr, pp. 329\u201330</ref> No [[combat air patrol]] was being flown, no aircraft were spotted on the deck for quick take off and there was no lookout in the [[crow's nest]].<ref>Howland, p. 52</ref> The German heavy ships sank all three British vessels with most of their crews, although ''Acasta'' managed to torpedo ''Scharnhorst'' before she was sunk. Only 43 men from ''Glorious'' survived.<ref>Rohwer, p. 26</ref>\n\n=== ''Furious'' ===\nUntil 2 October 1939, ''Furious'' remained on training duties, combined with anti-submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland.<ref>Jenkins, p. 277</ref> She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken ''Courageous'' and sortied on 8 October with the fleet to hunt unsuccessfully for the ''Gneisenau'' and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway. ''Furious'' departed her berth adjacent to the battleship {{HMS|Royal Oak|08|2}} in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October, the day before ''Royal Oak'' was sunk by {{GS|U-47|1938|2}} in Scapa Flow. ''Furious'' served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the [[1st Canadian Infantry Division]] to Britain in mid-December 1939.<ref>Jenkins, p. 279</ref>\n\n''Furious'' joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 and her Swordfish made several attacks on German ships in Narvik on the following days. She refuelled at [[Troms\u00f8]] on the 14th and remained behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April, her aircraft flying reconnaissance missions until ordered home on 25 April. Her port inner turbine had been damaged by the shock wave from a near miss on 18 April, and the damage was more serious than initially thought. After quick repairs, ''Furious'' returned on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed 263 Squadron; they were flown off on 21 May once their base at [[Bardufoss Air Station|Bardufoss]] was ready. She sailed to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off.<ref>Haarr, pp. 139\u201341, 261</ref>\n\nOn 14 June, carrying only half of [[816 Naval Air Squadron|816 Squadron]] for her own protection, ''Furious'' sailed unescorted for [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] carrying \u00a318,000,000 in gold [[bullion]]. On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for [[Iceland]] from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft, spare parts and munitions. On his own initiative, Captain [[Thomas Hope Troubridge|Troubridge]] ordered all available space should be used for sugar bound for Britain. She reembarked her aircraft upon her arrival and made a number of air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Troms\u00f8 through October 1940.<ref>Jenkins, p. 283</ref> ''Furious'' loaded 55 aircraft in [[Liverpool]] on 7 November and sailed for [[Takoradi]], [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]], on 15 November where the aircraft were flown off on 27 November to reinforce fighter units defending [[Desert Air Force|Egypt]]. By 15 December, ''Furious'' was back in Liverpool, where she embarked 40 Hurricanes for Takoradi. She sailed on 21 December and joined up with [[Convoy WS 5A]] which encountered the {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Hipper||2|up=y}} on 25 December. The German ship was driven off by the escorts, and ''Furious'' reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941. She arrived in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit. She made another ferry trip to Takoradi between 4 and 22 March.<ref>Nailer, pp. 154\u201355</ref>\n\nNow with a new destination for her ferry trips, ''Furious'' transported two dozen Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to ''Ark Royal'' to be flown off for [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|Malta]]. She returned for another load of Hurricanes and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to ''Ark Royal'' via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied ''Ark Royal'' and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. She would repeat this ferry mission three more times from June to September 1941.<ref>Nailer, p. 165</ref> In July and August, ''Furious'' and {{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}} attacked German installations in the Arctic areas of Norway and Finland with limited success and heavy losses. Following her last ferry mission she was sent to [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, to refit.<ref>Jenkins, p. 284</ref>\n\n[[File:A Supermarine Seafire being brought up onto the flight deck of HMS FURIOUS, August 1944. A25076.jpg|thumb|A [[Supermarine Seafire]] being brought up onto the flight deck of ''Furious'', August 1944]]\n\n''Furious'' arrived back in the UK in April 1942 and spent the next three months [[Glossary of nautical terms#W|working up]]. In August she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in [[Operation Pedestal]], but she was to sail with them only far enough to allow her 38 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s to reach Malta. This she did, just as ''Eagle'' was torpedoed, but ''Furious'' turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully. She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south-east of the [[Balearic Islands]]. After this mission ''Furious'' was sent back to Home Fleet for training. One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before [[Operation Torch]], and she arrived on 27 October. She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on the 29th before returning to Gibraltar to participate in Torch.<ref>Nailer, pp. 164\u201365</ref>\n\nProviding cover for the Central Task Force, ''Furious''{{'}}s aircraft neutralised the airfields at [[Es S\u00e9nia|La Senia]] and [[Tafraoui]], both near [[Oran]], Algeria. She remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war. In July the Home Fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; ''Furious''{{'}}s role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report then shoot it down.<ref>Jenkins, pp. 284\u201385</ref> She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training.<ref name=b2>Burt 2012, p. 277</ref>\n\nOn 3 April 1944, [[Fairey Barracuda]]s from ''Furious'' and ''Victorious'' attacked the German battleship ''Tirpitz'' in [[Altafjord]], Norway, as part of [[Operation Tungsten]]. ''Tirpitz'' was hit 14 times and needed three months to complete her repairs, although four aircraft were lost in the attack. The Home Fleet tried another attack on ''Tirpitz'' later in the month, but bad weather prevented any attack from being made. Instead the aircraft attempted to attack installations at [[Bod\u00f8]], but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships. Three operations against targets in northern Norway, including two against ''Tirpitz'', had to be abandoned or diverted to other targets in May, but three German ships were sunk and two more were set afire. ''Furious'' and other carriers made another attempt to sink the ''Tirpitz'' on 17 July, but were unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences. Four more attacks on ''Tirpitz'' were made in August, but only the attack on the 24th was even partially successful as two minor hits were made.<ref>Rohwer, pp. 314, 320, 322, 343, 350\u2013351</ref>\n\nAs the war progressed, the ship's age and limitations became increasingly apparent, and ''Furious'' was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944. She was [[paid off]] in April 1945 and used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship's structure. She was sold in 1948 for scrap, which was completed in 1954 at [[Troon]].<ref name=b2 />\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|25em}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last=Brown|first=David|title=HMS Eagle|series=Warship Profile|volume=35|year=1973|publisher=Profile Publications|location=Windsor, Berkshire, UK|oclc=33084560}}\n* {{cite book|last=Burt|first=R.

Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]). Some commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n== Definition ==\nThe definition of multilingualism is a subject of debate in the same way as that of language fluency.  On one end of a sort of linguistic continuum, one may define multilingualism as complete competence and mastery in another language. The speaker would presumably have complete knowledge and control over the language to sound native. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be people who know enough phrases to get around as a tourist using the alternate language. Since 1992, [[Vivian Cook (academic)|Vivian Cook]] has argued that most multilingual speakers fall somewhere between minimal and maximal definitions. Cook calls these people ''multi-competent''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|title=Multi-competence definition|website=www.viviancook.uk|accessdate=8 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022003750/http://www.viviancook.uk/Writings/Papers/MCentry.htm|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"ParadowskiBator2016\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21 |issue=6 |pages=1\u201319 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, there is no consistent definition of what constitutes a distinct language.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cook|first=Vivian|title=Second Language Learning and Language Teaching|year=2008|publisher=Hodder Education|isbn=978-0-340-95876-6}}</ref> For instance, scholars often disagree whether [[Scots language]] is a language in its own right or a dialect of [[English language|English]].<ref>[[A.J. Aitken]] in ''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Oxford University Press 1992. p.894</ref> Furthermore, what is considered a language can change, often for purely political purposes, such as when [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] was created as a [[standard language]] on the basis of the [[Eastern Herzegovinian dialect]] to function as [[Dachsprache|umbrella]] for numerous [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] dialects, and after the breakup of [[Yugoslavia]] was split into [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], or when [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was dismissed as a Russian dialect by the Russian [[tsar]]s to discourage national feelings.<ref>[[Ems Ukaz]]</ref>\nMany small independent nations' schoolchildren are today compelled to learn multiple languages because of international interactions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foreign-language.org/|title=Writing With English As A Second Language|publisher=Foreign-Language.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150421235102/http://foreign-language.org/|archivedate=21 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, in Finland, all children are required to learn at least two foreign languages: the other national language (Swedish or Finnish) and one alien language (usually English). Many Finnish schoolchildren also select further languages, such as German or Russian.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn some large nations with multiple languages, such as India, schoolchildren may routinely learn multiple languages based on where they reside in the country. In major metropolitan areas of Central, Southern, and Eastern India, many children may be fluent in four languages (the mother tongue, the state language, and the official languages of India, Hindi, and English).

Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of \"[[code-switching]]\" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as [[mutual intelligibility]] of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of ''languages'', namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (''e.g.'', Norwegian and Swedish), whereas the former is a property of one or more ''persons'' and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |title=Ethnologue report for language code: spa |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-07-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418134038/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Order of acquisition===\n{{Citation style|section|date=June 2018}}\n<!-- https://www.jstor.org/stable/41961686 -->\nIn [[sequential bilingualism]], learners receive literacy instruction in their native language until they acquire a \"threshold\" literacy proficiency.

The advantage is literacy in two languages as the outcome. However, the teacher must be well-versed in both languages and also in techniques for teaching a second language.\n\nThe phases children go through during sequential acquisition are less linear than for simultaneous acquisition and can vary greatly among children. Sequential acquisition is a more complex and lengthier process, although there is no indication that non-language-delayed children end up less proficient than simultaneous bilinguals, so long as they receive adequate input in both languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nA coordinate model posits that equal time should be spent in separate instruction of the native language and the community language.

The belief was that the two languages were mutually exclusive and that learning a second required unlearning elements and dynamics of the first to accommodate the second (Hakuta, 1990). The evidence for this perspective relied on the fact that some errors in acquiring the second language were related to the rules of the first language (Hakuta, 1990). How this hypothesis holds under different types of languages such as Romance versus non-Western languages has yet to undergo research.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAnother new development that has influenced the linguistic argument for bilingual literacy is the length of time necessary to acquire the second language.  While previously children were believed to have the ability to learn a language within a year, today researchers believe that within and across academic settings, the period is nearer to five years (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).\n\nAn interesting outcome of studies during the early 1990s, however, confirmed that students who do complete bilingual instruction perform better academically (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).  These students exhibit more cognitive elasticity including a better ability to analyze abstract visual patterns.  Students who receive bidirectional bilingual instruction where equal proficiency in both languages is required perform at an even higher level.  Examples of such programs include international and multi-national education schools.\n\n==In individuals==\nA multilingual person is someone who can communicate in more than one language, either actively (through speaking, writing, or signing) or passively (through listening, reading, or perceiving). More specifically, bilingual and trilingual people are those in comparable situations involving two or three languages, respectively.

The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by mechanisms heavily disputed. Children acquiring two languages in this way are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language usually dominates over the other.<ref name=\"auto\">Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.</ref>\nIn linguistics, first language acquisition is closely related to the concept of a \"native speaker\". According to a view widely held by linguists, a native speaker of a given language has in some respects a level of skill which a second (or subsequent) language learner cannot easily accomplish. Consequently, descriptive empirical studies of languages are usually carried out using only native speakers. This view is, however, slightly problematic, particularly as many non-native speakers demonstrably not only successfully engage with and in their non-native language societies, but in fact may become culturally and even linguistically important contributors (as, for example, writers, politicians, media personalities and performing artists) in their non-native language. In recent years, linguistic research has focused attention on the use of widely known world languages, such as English, as a [[lingua franca]] or a shared common language of professional and commercial communities. In lingua franca situations, most speakers of the common language are functionally multilingual.\n\nThe reverse phenomenon, where people who know more than one language wind up losing command of some or all of their additional languages, is called [[language attrition]]. It has been documented that, under certain conditions, individuals may lose their L1 language proficiency completely, after switching to the exclusive use of another language, and effectively \"become native\" in a language that was once secondary after the L1 undergoes total attrition.\n\nThis is most commonly seen among [[immigrant]] communities and has been the subject of substantial academic study. The most important factor in spontaneous, total L1 loss appears to be age; in the absence of neurological dysfunction or injury, only young children typically are at risk of forgetting their native language and switching to a new one.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0267658309337641| title=Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors| year=2010| last1=Schmid| first1=Monika S.| last2=Dusseldorp| first2=Elise| journal=Second Language Research| volume=26| pages=125\u2013160}}</ref> Once they pass an age that seems to correlate closely with the [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]], around the age of 12, total loss of a native language is not typical, although it is still possible for speakers to experience diminished expressive capacity if the language is never practiced.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2009.00521.x| title=Maturational Constraints and First Language Attrition| year=2009| last1=Bylund| first1=Emanuel| journal=Language Learning| volume=59| issue=3| pages=687\u2013715}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive ability===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Main|Cognitive effects of multilingualism}}\nPeople who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.<ref name=\":0\"/> Bilinguals who are highly proficient in two or more languages have been reported to have enhanced executive function or even have reduced-risk for dementia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Martin MM |title=Attention and inhibition in bilingual children: evidence from the dimensional change card sort task |journal=Dev Sci |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=325\u201339 |year=2004 |pmid=15595373 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00351.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Craik FI, Grady C, Chau W, Ishii R, Gunji A, Pantev C |title=Effect of bilingualism on cognitive control in the Simon task: evidence from MEG |journal=NeuroImage |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=40\u201349 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.044 |pmid=15588595}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |title=How the Brain Benefits from Being Bilingual |last=Kluger |first=Jeffrey |date=18 July 2013 |journal=TIME |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHQkrPci?url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |archivedate=21 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Atkinson2016\">{{Cite journal |authors = Atkinson AL |title = Does Bilingualism Delay the Development of Dementia? |journal = Journal of European Psychology Students |year = 2016 |pages = 43\u201350 |volume = 7 |issue = 1 |doi = 10.5334/jeps.375 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Skibba |first=Ramin |title=How a second language can boost the brain|journal=Knowable Magazine |url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2018/how-second-language-can-boost-brain |doi=10.1146/knowable-112918-1 |language=en|year=2018 }}</ref> More recently, however, this claim has come under strong criticism<ref name=\"Atlantic2016\">{{Cite web|title = The Bitter Fight Over the Benefits of Bilingualism|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Ed|last = Yong|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160211015050/http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|archivedate = 11 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Lehtonen2018\">{{Cite journal|title = Is Bilingualism Associated With Enhanced Executive Functioning in Adults?

When acquisition of the first language is interrupted and insufficient or unstructured language input follows from the second language, as sometimes happens with [[Immigration|immigrant]] children, the speaker can end up with two languages both mastered below the monolingual standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A notable example can be found in the [[Bengali people|ethnic Bengali]] Muslim community of Assam province in India, hailing from [[Bangladesh|East Bengal]]. Their mother tongue is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but it is not offered as a subject in school: their language of study is [[Assamese language|Assamese]], the provincial language. As a result, their predominant form of communication mixes the mother tongue and the medium language. Because they have no chance to study the languages separately, they are not able to differentiate between the two or maintain such a difference in expression. Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in these immigrant children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Those who were literate in their first language before arriving, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are at the very least able to maintain and master their first language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} \n\nThere are differences between those who learn a language in a class environment and those who learn through total [[language immersion|immersion]], usually living in a country where the target language is widely spoken. Without the possibility to actively translate, due to a complete lack of any first language communication opportunity, the comparison between languages is reduced. The new language is almost independently learned, like the mother tongue for a child, with a direct concept-to-language translation that can become more natural than word structures learned as a subject. Added to this, the uninterrupted, immediate and exclusive practice of the new language reinforces and deepens the attained knowledge.\n\n===Economic benefits===\nBilinguals might have important labor market advantages over monolingual individuals as bilingual people can carry out duties that monolinguals cannot, such as interacting with customers who only speak a minority language.

Multilingualism was common in the past: in early times, when most people were members of small language communities, it was necessary to know two or more languages for trade or any other dealings outside one's town or village, and this holds good today in places of high linguistic diversity such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[India]]. Linguist Ekkehard Wolff estimates that 50% of the population of Africa is multilingual.<ref>Wolff, Ekkehard (2000).  Language and Society. In: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse (Eds.) ''African Languages - An Introduction'', 317. Cambridge University Press.\n</ref>\n\nIn multilingual societies, not all speakers need to be multilingual. Some states can have multilingual policies and recognize several official languages, such as Canada (English and French). In some states, particular languages may be associated with particular regions in the state (e.g., Canada) or with particular ethnicities (e.g., Malaysia and Singapore). When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved:\n* '''[[Diglossia]]''': if there is a structural-functional distribution of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in [[Europe]] where a [[regional language]] is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. [[Frisia]] (with [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Lusatia]] (with [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related and could be considered dialects of each other.  This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, [[English language|English]] is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, [[Scots language|Scots]] is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen in the difference between written Arabic ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) and colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two has been created what some have deemed \"Middle Arabic\" or \"Common Arabic\". Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia<ref>M.HBakalla(1984), Arabic Culture through its Language and Literature, Kegan Paul International, London</ref> has been suggested.\n* '''Ambilingualism''': a region is called ambilingual if this functional distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area it is nearly impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like [[Luxembourg]], which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], which fuses the cultures of [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[China]], and [[India]] or communities with high rates of deafness like [[Martha's Vineyard]] where historically most inhabitants spoke both [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|MVSL]] and [[English language|English]] or in southern Israel where locals speak both [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a dominant state language (be it ''de jure'' or ''de facto'') and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of the distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.\n* '''Bipart-lingualism''': if more than one language can be heard in a small area, but the large majority of speakers are monolinguals, who have little contact with speakers from neighboring ethnic groups, an area is called 'bipart-lingual'. An example of this is the [[Balkans]].\n\nN.B. the terms given above all refer to situations describing only two languages. In cases of an unspecified number of languages, the terms '''polyglossia''', '''omnilingualism''', and '''multipart-lingualism''' are more appropriate.\n\n==Interaction between speakers of different languages==\nWhenever two people meet, negotiations take place. If they want to express solidarity and sympathy, they tend to seek common features in their behavior. If speakers wish to express distance towards or even dislike of the person they are speaking to, the reverse is true, and differences are sought. This mechanism also extends to language, as described in the [[Communication Accommodation Theory]].\n\nSome multilinguals use [[code-switching]], which involves swapping between languages. In many cases, code-switching is motivated by the wish to express loyalty to more than one cultural group,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} as holds for many immigrant communities in the New World. Code-switching may also function as a strategy where proficiency is lacking. Such strategies are common if the vocabulary of one of the languages is not very elaborated for certain fields, or if the speakers have not developed proficiency in certain lexical domains, as in the case of immigrant languages.\n\nThis code-switching appears in many forms. If a speaker has a positive attitude towards both languages and towards code-switching, many switches can be found, even within the same sentence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Poplack Shana | authorlink = Shana Poplack | year = 1980 | title = Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espa\u00f1ol\": toward a typology of code-switching | url = | journal = Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = 7/8| pages = 581\u2013618 | doi = 10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581 | hdl = 10315/2506 }}</ref> If however, the speaker is reluctant to use code-switching, as in the case of a lack of proficiency, he might knowingly or unknowingly try to camouflage his attempt by converting elements of one language into elements of the other language through [[calque|calquing]]. This results in speakers using words like ''courrier noir'' (literally mail that is black) in French, instead of the proper word for [[blackmail]], ''chantage''.\n\nSometimes a [[pidgin language]] may develop. A pidgin language is a fusion of two languages that is mutually understandable for both speakers. Some pidgin languages develop into real languages (such as [[Papiamento]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]] or [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]]) while others remain as slangs or jargons (such as [[Helsinki slang]], which is more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] both in Finnish and Swedish).{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} In other cases, prolonged influence of languages on each other may have the effect of changing one or both to the point where it may be considered that a new language is born. For example, many linguists believe that the [[Occitan language]] and the [[Catalan language]] were formed because of a population speaking a single Occitano-Romance language was divided into political spheres of influence of France and Spain, respectively. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is a complex blend of [[Middle High German]] with [[Hebrew]] and borrowings from Slavic languages.\n\nBilingual interaction can even take place without the speaker switching. In certain areas, it is not uncommon for speakers to use a different language within the same conversation. This phenomenon is found, amongst other places, in [[Scandinavia]]. Most speakers of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages, while few can speak both (people used to these situations often adjust their language, avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood). Using different languages is usually called [[non-convergent discourse]], a term introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist Reitze Jonkman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} To a certain extent, this situation also exists between [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities. Another example is the former state of [[Czechoslovakia]], where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) were in common use. Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages, although they would use only one of them (their respective mother tongue) when speaking. For example, in Czechoslovakia, it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other. This bilinguality still exists nowadays, although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Wakkanai Russian sign.jpg|Japanese, English, and Russian sign in Northern Japan\nFile:Chengde summer palace writings.jpg|Mongolian, Chagatai, Chinese, Tibetan and Manchu languages sign in Chengde, China\nFile:Languages of Israel.jpeg|A sign at the Israeli Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Immigrant Absorption uses Hebrew, Arabic, English, and Russian\nFile:Protected place sign, Fort Canning Park, Singapore - 20081203.jpg|A multilingual sign in Singapore's four official languages: English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay\nFile:Digraphia in Hindustani.png|Urdu, Hindi, and English on a road sign in India\n</gallery>\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]\n\nWith emerging markets and expanding international cooperation, business users expect to be able to use software and applications in their own language.<ref>Dedi\u0107, N. and Stanier C., 2016., \"An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development\" in 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2016, p. 196.</ref> Multilingualisation (or \"m17n\", where \"17\" stands for 17 omitted letters) of computer systems can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]:\n* A localized system has been adapted or converted for a particular locale (other than the one it was originally developed for), including the language of the user interface, input, and display, and features such as time/date display and currency; but each instance of the system only supports a single locale.\n* Multilingualised software supports multiple languages for display and input simultaneously, but generally has a single user interface language.  Support for other locale features like time, date, number and currency formats may vary as the system tends towards full internationalization.  Generally, a multilingual system is intended for use in a specific locale, whilst allowing for multilingual content.\n* An internationalized system is equipped for use in a range of locales, allowing for the co-existence of several languages and character sets in user interfaces and displays.  In particular, a system may not be considered internationalized in the fullest sense unless the interface language is selectable by the user at runtime.\n\nTranslating the user interface is usually part of the [[software localization]] process, which also includes adaptations such as units and date conversion. Many software applications are available in several languages, ranging from a handful (the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]]) to dozens for the most popular applications (such as [[office suite]]s, [[web browser]]s, etc.).  Due to the status of [[English in computing]], software development nearly always uses it (but see also [[Non-English-based programming languages]]), so almost all commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|title=Multilingual Functionality: New in Wolfram Language 11|website=www.wolfram.com|access-date=2016-08-23|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820020128/http://www.wolfram.com/language/11/multilingual-functionality/?product=mathematica|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Multilingual App Toolkit (MAT)<ref>{{cite web|title=The New Reynell Developmental Language Scales|url=http://oro.open.ac.uk/33033/|website=oro.open.ac.uk|accessdate=21 Dec 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222075011/http://oro.open.ac.uk/33033/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> was first released in concert with the release of Windows 8 as a way to provide developers a set of free tooling that enabled adding languages to their apps with just a few clicks, in large part due to the integration of a free, unlimited license to both the Microsoft Translator machine translation service and the Microsoft Language Platform service, along with platform extensibility to enable anyone to add translation services into MAT.

But there is no predominant language in Europe (with [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German]] spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Belgium; [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French]] in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland; and [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English]] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta). Most of the time, English is used as a communication language, but in multilingual countries such as Belgium (Dutch, French, and German), Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh), Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) or Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician), it is common to see employees mastering two or even three of those languages. Some languages such as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian; Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian or Czech and Slovakian are so close to each other that it is generally more common when meeting to use their mother tongue rather than English. During Czechoslovakian times, Czech and Slovakian used to be the same language, but two different dialects as well as during Yugoslavian times Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin used to be one language with more dialects. After the Yugoslavian breakup, each state created its official language from their dialect. Name of the original language used to be called Serbo-Croatian. In spoken form, there is almost no difference between Serbian and Croatian. In written form, Serbs use Cyrillic and Croatian Latin.\n\nMany minor [[Russians|Russian]] ethnic groups, such as [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]] and others, are also multilingual. Moreover, with the beginning of compulsory study of the Tatar language in [[Tatarstan]], there has been an increase in its level of knowledge of the Russian-speaking population of the republic.<ref>http://www.lib.ua-ru.net/diss/cont/94828.html</ref>\n\nContinued global [[diversity (business)|diversity]] has led to an increasingly multilingual workforce. Europe has become an excellent model to observe this newly diversified labor culture. The expansion of the European Union with its open labor market has provided opportunities both for well-trained professionals and unskilled workers to move to new countries to seek employment. Political changes and turmoil have also led to migration and the creation of new and more complex multilingual workplaces. In most wealthy and secure countries, immigrants are found mostly in low paid jobs but also, increasingly, in high-status positions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gunnarsson|first1=Britt-Louise|title=Multilingualism in European Workplaces.|date=2014|volume=33|issue=1\u20132|pages=11\u201333|doi=10.1515/multi-2014-0002|journal=Multilingua}}</ref>\n\n==Music==\n{{further|List of multilingual bands and artists}}\nIt is extremely common for music to be written in whatever the contemporary [[lingua franca]] is.

On one end of a sort of linguistic continuum, one may define multilingualism as complete competence and mastery in another language. The speaker would presumably have complete knowledge and control over the language to sound native. On the opposite end of the spectrum would be people who know enough phrases to get around as a tourist using the alternate language.

Receptive bilingualism is frequently encountered among adult immigrants to the U.S. who do not speak English as a native language but who have children who do speak English natively, usually in part because those children's education has been conducted in English; while the immigrant parents can understand both their native language and English, they speak only their native language to their children.  If their children are likewise receptively bilingual but productively English-monolingual, throughout the conversation the parents will speak their native language and the children will speak English. If their children are productively bilingual, however, those children may answer in the parents' native language, in English, or in a combination of both languages, varying their choice of language depending on factors such as the communication's content, context, and/or emotional intensity and the presence or absence of third-party speakers of one language or the other. The third alternative represents the phenomenon of \"[[code-switching]]\" in which the productively bilingual party to a communication switches languages in the course of that communication.  Receptively bilingual persons, especially children, may rapidly achieve oral fluency by spending extended time in situations where they are required to speak the language that they theretofore understood only passively.  Until both generations achieve oral fluency, not all definitions of bilingualism accurately characterize the family as a whole, but the linguistic differences between the family's generations often constitute little or no impairment to the family's functionality.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}  Receptive bilingualism in one language as exhibited by a speaker of another language, or even as exhibited by most speakers of that language, is not the same as [[mutual intelligibility]] of languages; the latter is a property of a pair of ''languages'', namely a consequence of objectively high lexical and grammatical similarities between the languages themselves (''e.g.'', Norwegian and Swedish), whereas the former is a property of one or more ''persons'' and is determined by subjective or intersubjective factors such as the respective languages' prevalence in the life history (including family upbringing, educational setting, and ambient culture) of the person or persons.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |title=Ethnologue report for language code: spa |publisher=Ethnologue.com |accessdate=2010-07-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418134038/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=spa |archivedate=18 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Order of acquisition===\n{{Citation style|section|date=June 2018}}\n<!-- https://www.jstor.org/stable/41961686 -->\nIn [[sequential bilingualism]], learners receive literacy instruction in their native language until they acquire a \"threshold\" literacy proficiency.

The advantage is literacy in two languages as the outcome. However, the teacher must be well-versed in both languages and also in techniques for teaching a second language.\n\nThe phases children go through during sequential acquisition are less linear than for simultaneous acquisition and can vary greatly among children. Sequential acquisition is a more complex and lengthier process, although there is no indication that non-language-delayed children end up less proficient than simultaneous bilinguals, so long as they receive adequate input in both languages.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nA coordinate model posits that equal time should be spent in separate instruction of the native language and the community language. The native language class, however, focuses on basic literacy while the community language class focuses on listening and speaking skills.

The belief was that the two languages were mutually exclusive and that learning a second required unlearning elements and dynamics of the first to accommodate the second (Hakuta, 1990). The evidence for this perspective relied on the fact that some errors in acquiring the second language were related to the rules of the first language (Hakuta, 1990). How this hypothesis holds under different types of languages such as Romance versus non-Western languages has yet to undergo research.{{cn|date=February 2019}}\n\nAnother new development that has influenced the linguistic argument for bilingual literacy is the length of time necessary to acquire the second language.  While previously children were believed to have the ability to learn a language within a year, today researchers believe that within and across academic settings, the period is nearer to five years (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).\n\nAn interesting outcome of studies during the early 1990s, however, confirmed that students who do complete bilingual instruction perform better academically (Collier, 1992; Ramirez, 1992).  These students exhibit more cognitive elasticity including a better ability to analyze abstract visual patterns.  Students who receive bidirectional bilingual instruction where equal proficiency in both languages is required perform at an even higher level.  Examples of such programs include international and multi-national education schools.\n\n==In individuals==\nA multilingual person is someone who can communicate in more than one language, either actively (through speaking, writing, or signing) or passively (through listening, reading, or perceiving). More specifically, bilingual and trilingual people are those in comparable situations involving two or three languages, respectively. A multilingual person is generally referred to as a ''polyglot'', a term that may also refer to people who learn multiple languages as a hobby.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krzeminska|first=Marta|url=http://www.latg.org/2016/07/the-cult-polyglot.html/|title=The cult of the polyglot|date=19 July 2016|accessdate=7 September 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160906123938/http://www.latg.org/2016/07/the-cult-polyglot.html/|archivedate=6 September 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Erard\">{{cite book|last=Erard|first=Michael|year=2012|title=Babel No More: The Search for the World's Most Extraordinary Language Learners|publisher=Free Press|isbn=978-1-4516-2825-8}}</ref> \nMultilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called [[first language]] (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is acquired without formal education, by mechanisms heavily disputed. Children acquiring two languages in this way are called simultaneous bilinguals. Even in the case of simultaneous bilinguals, one language usually dominates over the other.<ref name=\"auto\">Hult, F.M. (2014).  Covert bilingualism and symbolic competence: Analytical reflections on negotiating insider/outsider positionality in Swedish speech situations. ''Applied Linguistics, 35''(1), 63-81.</ref>\nIn linguistics, first language acquisition is closely related to the concept of a \"native speaker\". According to a view widely held by linguists, a native speaker of a given language has in some respects a level of skill which a second (or subsequent) language learner cannot easily accomplish. Consequently, descriptive empirical studies of languages are usually carried out using only native speakers. This view is, however, slightly problematic, particularly as many non-native speakers demonstrably not only successfully engage with and in their non-native language societies, but in fact may become culturally and even linguistically important contributors (as, for example, writers, politicians, media personalities and performing artists) in their non-native language. In recent years, linguistic research has focused attention on the use of widely known world languages, such as English, as a [[lingua franca]] or a shared common language of professional and commercial communities. In lingua franca situations, most speakers of the common language are functionally multilingual.\n\nThe reverse phenomenon, where people who know more than one language wind up losing command of some or all of their additional languages, is called [[language attrition]]. It has been documented that, under certain conditions, individuals may lose their L1 language proficiency completely, after switching to the exclusive use of another language, and effectively \"become native\" in a language that was once secondary after the L1 undergoes total attrition.\n\nThis is most commonly seen among [[immigrant]] communities and has been the subject of substantial academic study. The most important factor in spontaneous, total L1 loss appears to be age; in the absence of neurological dysfunction or injury, only young children typically are at risk of forgetting their native language and switching to a new one.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0267658309337641| title=Quantitative analyses in a multivariate study of language attrition: The impact of extralinguistic factors| year=2010| last1=Schmid| first1=Monika S.| last2=Dusseldorp| first2=Elise| journal=Second Language Research| volume=26| pages=125\u2013160}}</ref> Once they pass an age that seems to correlate closely with the [[Critical period hypothesis|critical period]], around the age of 12, total loss of a native language is not typical, although it is still possible for speakers to experience diminished expressive capacity if the language is never practiced.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9922.2009.00521.x| title=Maturational Constraints and First Language Attrition| year=2009| last1=Bylund| first1=Emanuel| journal=Language Learning| volume=59| issue=3| pages=687\u2013715}}</ref>\n\n===Cognitive ability===\n{{More citations needed section|date=January 2020}}\n{{Main|Cognitive effects of multilingualism}}\nPeople who know more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals.<ref name=\":0\"/> Bilinguals who are highly proficient in two or more languages have been reported to have enhanced executive function or even have reduced-risk for dementia.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Martin MM |title=Attention and inhibition in bilingual children: evidence from the dimensional change card sort task |journal=Dev Sci |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=325\u201339 |year=2004 |pmid=15595373 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00351.x}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bialystok E, Craik FI, Grady C, Chau W, Ishii R, Gunji A, Pantev C |title=Effect of bilingualism on cognitive control in the Simon task: evidence from MEG |journal=NeuroImage |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=40\u201349 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.044 |pmid=15588595}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |title=How the Brain Benefits from Being Bilingual |last=Kluger |first=Jeffrey |date=18 July 2013 |journal=TIME |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IHQkrPci?url=http://science.time.com/2013/07/18/how-the-brain-benefits-from-being-bilingual/ |archivedate=21 July 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Atkinson2016\">{{Cite journal |authors = Atkinson AL |title = Does Bilingualism Delay the Development of Dementia? |journal = Journal of European Psychology Students |year = 2016 |pages = 43\u201350 |volume = 7 |issue = 1 |doi = 10.5334/jeps.375 |df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Skibba |first=Ramin |title=How a second language can boost the brain|journal=Knowable Magazine |url=https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2018/how-second-language-can-boost-brain |doi=10.1146/knowable-112918-1 |language=en|year=2018 }}</ref> More recently, however, this claim has come under strong criticism<ref name=\"Atlantic2016\">{{Cite web|title = The Bitter Fight Over the Benefits of Bilingualism|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Ed|last = Yong|url-status = live|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160211015050/http://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-battle-over-bilingualism/462114/|archivedate = 11 February 2016|df = dmy-all}}</ref><ref name=\"Lehtonen2018\">{{Cite journal|title = Is Bilingualism Associated With Enhanced Executive Functioning in Adults?

When acquisition of the first language is interrupted and insufficient or unstructured language input follows from the second language, as sometimes happens with [[Immigration|immigrant]] children, the speaker can end up with two languages both mastered below the monolingual standard.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} A notable example can be found in the [[Bengali people|ethnic Bengali]] Muslim community of Assam province in India, hailing from [[Bangladesh|East Bengal]]. Their mother tongue is [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but it is not offered as a subject in school: their language of study is [[Assamese language|Assamese]], the provincial language. As a result, their predominant form of communication mixes the mother tongue and the medium language. Because they have no chance to study the languages separately, they are not able to differentiate between the two or maintain such a difference in expression. Literacy plays an important role in the development of language in these immigrant children.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Those who were literate in their first language before arriving, and who have support to maintain that literacy, are at the very least able to maintain and master their first language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} \n\nThere are differences between those who learn a language in a class environment and those who learn through total [[language immersion|immersion]], usually living in a country where the target language is widely spoken. Without the possibility to actively translate, due to a complete lack of any first language communication opportunity, the comparison between languages is reduced. The new language is almost independently learned, like the mother tongue for a child, with a direct concept-to-language translation that can become more natural than word structures learned as a subject. Added to this, the uninterrupted, immediate and exclusive practice of the new language reinforces and deepens the attained knowledge.\n\n===Economic benefits===\nBilinguals might have important labor market advantages over monolingual individuals as bilingual people can carry out duties that monolinguals cannot, such as interacting with customers who only speak a minority language.

It was surmised that the [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing effect]] disappeared when choices are presented in a second language. As human reasoning is shaped by two distinct modes of thought: one that is systematic, analytical and cognition-intensive, and another that is fast, unconscious and emotionally charged, it was believed that a second language provides a useful cognitive distance from automatic processes, promoting analytical thought and reducing unthinking, emotional reaction. Therefore, those who speak two languages have better critical thinking and decision making skills.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Boaz Keysar |author2=Sayuri L.

Multilingualism was common in the past: in early times, when most people were members of small language communities, it was necessary to know two or more languages for trade or any other dealings outside one's town or village, and this holds good today in places of high linguistic diversity such as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[India]]. Linguist Ekkehard Wolff estimates that 50% of the population of Africa is multilingual.<ref>Wolff, Ekkehard (2000).  Language and Society. In: Bernd Heine and Derek Nurse (Eds.) ''African Languages - An Introduction'', 317. Cambridge University Press.\n</ref>\n\nIn multilingual societies, not all speakers need to be multilingual. Some states can have multilingual policies and recognize several official languages, such as Canada (English and French). In some states, particular languages may be associated with particular regions in the state (e.g., Canada) or with particular ethnicities (e.g., Malaysia and Singapore). When all speakers are multilingual, linguists classify the community according to the functional distribution of the languages involved:\n* '''[[Diglossia]]''': if there is a structural-functional distribution of the languages involved, the society is termed 'diglossic'. Typical diglossic areas are those areas in [[Europe]] where a [[regional language]] is used in informal, usually oral, contexts, while the state language is used in more formal situations. [[Frisia]] (with [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[German language|German]] or [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and [[Lusatia]] (with [[Sorbian languages|Sorbian]] and German) are well-known examples. Some writers limit diglossia to situations where the languages are closely related and could be considered dialects of each other.  This can also be observed in Scotland where, in formal situations, [[English language|English]] is used. However, in informal situations in many areas, [[Scots language|Scots]] is the preferred language of choice. A similar phenomenon is also observed in Arabic-speaking regions. The effects of diglossia could be seen in the difference between written Arabic ([[Modern Standard Arabic]]) and colloquial Arabic. However, as time goes, the Arabic language somewhere between the two has been created what some have deemed \"Middle Arabic\" or \"Common Arabic\". Because of this diversification of the language, the concept of spectroglossia<ref>M.HBakalla(1984), Arabic Culture through its Language and Literature, Kegan Paul International, London</ref> has been suggested.\n* '''Ambilingualism''': a region is called ambilingual if this functional distribution is not observed. In a typical ambilingual area it is nearly impossible to predict which language will be used in a given setting. True ambilingualism is rare. Ambilingual tendencies can be found in small states with multiple heritages like [[Luxembourg]], which has a combined Franco-Germanic heritage, or [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], which fuses the cultures of [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]], [[China]], and [[India]] or communities with high rates of deafness like [[Martha's Vineyard]] where historically most inhabitants spoke both [[Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|MVSL]] and [[English language|English]] or in southern Israel where locals speak both [[Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language]] and either Arabic or Hebrew. Ambilingualism also can manifest in specific regions of larger states that have both a dominant state language (be it ''de jure'' or ''de facto'') and a protected minority language that is limited in terms of the distribution of speakers within the country. This tendency is especially pronounced when, even though the local language is widely spoken, there is a reasonable assumption that all citizens speak the predominant state tongue (e.g., English in Quebec vs. Canada; Spanish in Catalonia vs. Spain). This phenomenon can also occur in border regions with many cross-border contacts.\n* '''Bipart-lingualism''': if more than one language can be heard in a small area, but the large majority of speakers are monolinguals, who have little contact with speakers from neighboring ethnic groups, an area is called 'bipart-lingual'. An example of this is the [[Balkans]].\n\nN.B. the terms given above all refer to situations describing only two languages. In cases of an unspecified number of languages, the terms '''polyglossia''', '''omnilingualism''', and '''multipart-lingualism''' are more appropriate.\n\n==Interaction between speakers of different languages==\nWhenever two people meet, negotiations take place. If they want to express solidarity and sympathy, they tend to seek common features in their behavior. If speakers wish to express distance towards or even dislike of the person they are speaking to, the reverse is true, and differences are sought. This mechanism also extends to language, as described in the [[Communication Accommodation Theory]].\n\nSome multilinguals use [[code-switching]], which involves swapping between languages. In many cases, code-switching is motivated by the wish to express loyalty to more than one cultural group,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} as holds for many immigrant communities in the New World. Code-switching may also function as a strategy where proficiency is lacking. Such strategies are common if the vocabulary of one of the languages is not very elaborated for certain fields, or if the speakers have not developed proficiency in certain lexical domains, as in the case of immigrant languages.\n\nThis code-switching appears in many forms. If a speaker has a positive attitude towards both languages and towards code-switching, many switches can be found, even within the same sentence.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Poplack Shana | authorlink = Shana Poplack | year = 1980 | title = Sometimes I'll start a sentence in Spanish y termino en espa\u00f1ol\": toward a typology of code-switching | url = | journal = Linguistics | volume = 18 | issue = 7/8| pages = 581\u2013618 | doi = 10.1515/ling.1980.18.7-8.581 | hdl = 10315/2506 }}</ref> If however, the speaker is reluctant to use code-switching, as in the case of a lack of proficiency, he might knowingly or unknowingly try to camouflage his attempt by converting elements of one language into elements of the other language through [[calque|calquing]]. This results in speakers using words like ''courrier noir'' (literally mail that is black) in French, instead of the proper word for [[blackmail]], ''chantage''.\n\nSometimes a [[pidgin language]] may develop. A pidgin language is a fusion of two languages that is mutually understandable for both speakers. Some pidgin languages develop into real languages (such as [[Papiamento]] in [[Cura\u00e7ao]] or [[Singlish]] in [[Singapore]]) while others remain as slangs or jargons (such as [[Helsinki slang]], which is more or less [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] both in Finnish and Swedish).{{Clarify|date=July 2014}} In other cases, prolonged influence of languages on each other may have the effect of changing one or both to the point where it may be considered that a new language is born. For example, many linguists believe that the [[Occitan language]] and the [[Catalan language]] were formed because of a population speaking a single Occitano-Romance language was divided into political spheres of influence of France and Spain, respectively. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] is a complex blend of [[Middle High German]] with [[Hebrew]] and borrowings from Slavic languages.\n\nBilingual interaction can even take place without the speaker switching. In certain areas, it is not uncommon for speakers to use a different language within the same conversation. This phenomenon is found, amongst other places, in [[Scandinavia]]. Most speakers of [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] can communicate with each other speaking their respective languages, while few can speak both (people used to these situations often adjust their language, avoiding words that are not found in the other language or that can be misunderstood). Using different languages is usually called [[non-convergent discourse]], a term introduced by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] linguist Reitze Jonkman.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} To a certain extent, this situation also exists between [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], although everyday contact is fairly rare because of the distance between the two respective communities. Another example is the former state of [[Czechoslovakia]], where two closely related and mutually intelligible languages ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]) were in common use. Most Czechs and Slovaks understand both languages, although they would use only one of them (their respective mother tongue) when speaking. For example, in Czechoslovakia, it was common to hear two people talking on television each speaking a different language without any difficulty understanding each other. This bilinguality still exists nowadays, although it has started to deteriorate after Czechoslovakia split up.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Wakkanai Russian sign.jpg|Japanese, English, and Russian sign in Northern Japan\nFile:Chengde summer palace writings.jpg|Mongolian, Chagatai, Chinese, Tibetan and Manchu languages sign in Chengde, China\nFile:Languages of Israel.jpeg|A sign at the Israeli Ministry of the Interior and Ministry of Immigrant Absorption uses Hebrew, Arabic, English, and Russian\nFile:Protected place sign, Fort Canning Park, Singapore - 20081203.jpg|A multilingual sign in Singapore's four official languages: English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay\nFile:Digraphia in Hindustani.png|Urdu, Hindi, and English on a road sign in India\n</gallery>\n\n==Computing==\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|Dual language [[Hebrew]] and English keyboard]]\n\nWith emerging markets and expanding international cooperation, business users expect to be able to use software and applications in their own language.<ref>Dedi\u0107, N. and Stanier C., 2016., \"An Evaluation of the Challenges of Multilingualism in Data Warehouse Development\" in 18th International Conference on Enterprise Information Systems - ICEIS 2016, p. 196.</ref> Multilingualisation (or \"m17n\", where \"17\" stands for 17 omitted letters) of computer systems can be considered part of a continuum between [[internationalization and localization]]:\n* A localized system has been adapted or converted for a particular locale (other than the one it was originally developed for), including the language of the user interface, input, and display, and features such as time/date display and currency; but each instance of the system only supports a single locale.\n* Multilingualised software supports multiple languages for display and input simultaneously, but generally has a single user interface language.  Support for other locale features like time, date, number and currency formats may vary as the system tends towards full internationalization.  Generally, a multilingual system is intended for use in a specific locale, whilst allowing for multilingual content.\n* An internationalized system is equipped for use in a range of locales, allowing for the co-existence of several languages and character sets in user interfaces and displays.  In particular, a system may not be considered internationalized in the fullest sense unless the interface language is selectable by the user at runtime.\n\nTranslating the user interface is usually part of the [[software localization]] process, which also includes adaptations such as units and date conversion. Many software applications are available in several languages, ranging from a handful (the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|most spoken languages]]) to dozens for the most popular applications (such as [[office suite]]s, [[web browser]]s, etc.).

Mainstream society justifies the divided job market, arguing that getting a low-paying job is the best newcomers can achieve considering their limited language skills.\n\n=== Asia===\nWith companies going international they are now focusing more and more on the English level of their employees. Especially in South Korea since the 1990s, companies are using different English language testing to evaluate job applicants, and the criteria in those tests are constantly upgrading the level for good English. In India, it is even possible to receive training to acquire an English accent, as the number of outsourced call centers in India has soared in the past decades.\nMeanwhile, Japan ranks 53rd out of 100 countries in 2019 [[EF English Proficiency Index]], amid calls for this to improve in time for the [[2020 Tokyo Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWithin multiracial countries such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], it is not unusual for one to speak two or more languages, albeit with varying degrees of fluency.<ref>{{cite news|title=9 of the world's most multilingual countries|url=http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|publisher=Mother Nature Network|date=28 June 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210034/http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/stories/9-of-the-worlds-most-multilingual-countries|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= A Model for Polyglossia and Multilingualism (With Special Reference to Singapore and Malaysia)|jstor=4166945|journal=[[Language in Society]]|volume=6|issue=3|date=December 1977|pages=361\u2013378|doi=10.1017/s0047404500005066|last1=Platt|first1=John T.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|chapter=English and Multilingualism in Singapore|title=Encyclopedia of Applied Linguistics|first=Lisa|last=Lim|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley Online]]}}</ref> Some are proficient in several Chinese dialects, given the linguistic diversity of the ethnic Chinese community in both countries.\n\n\n=== Africa===\nNot only in multinational companies is English an important skill, but also in the engineering industry, in the chemical, electrical and aeronautical fields.

But there is no predominant language in Europe (with [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German]] spoken in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, and Belgium; [[List of territorial entities where French is an official language|French]] in France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland; and [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|English]] in the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Malta). Most of the time, English is used as a communication language, but in multilingual countries such as Belgium (Dutch, French, and German), Switzerland (German, French, Italian and Romansh), Luxembourg (Luxembourgish, French and German) or Spain (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician), it is common to see employees mastering two or even three of those languages. Some languages such as Danish, Swedish and Norwegian; Serbian, Croatian and Slovenian or Czech and Slovakian are so close to each other that it is generally more common when meeting to use their mother tongue rather than English. During Czechoslovakian times, Czech and Slovakian used to be the same language, but two different dialects as well as during Yugoslavian times Croatian, Serbian, Bosnian and Montenegrin used to be one language with more dialects. After the Yugoslavian breakup, each state created its official language from their dialect. Name of the original language used to be called Serbo-Croatian. In spoken form, there is almost no difference between Serbian and Croatian. In written form, Serbs use Cyrillic and Croatian Latin.\n\nMany minor [[Russians|Russian]] ethnic groups, such as [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]] and others, are also multilingual. Moreover, with the beginning of compulsory study of the Tatar language in [[Tatarstan]], there has been an increase in its level of knowledge of the Russian-speaking population of the republic.<ref>http://www.lib.ua-ru.net/diss/cont/94828.html</ref>\n\nContinued global [[diversity (business)|diversity]] has led to an increasingly multilingual workforce. Europe has become an excellent model to observe this newly diversified labor culture. The expansion of the European Union with its open labor market has provided opportunities both for well-trained professionals and unskilled workers to move to new countries to seek employment. Political changes and turmoil have also led to migration and the creation of new and more complex multilingual workplaces.

Following the derby defeat, results picked up and Tottenham were soon back amongst the race for a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] spot, but a draw with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on the last day of the season saw their slim European hopes dashed. Nonetheless, good cup runs and the resurgence in the league under Jol gave Spurs fans hopes of a greater push for European football the next season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tottenham Hotspur 2004\u20132005 Home - statto.com |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/2004-2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65tSUmNUd?url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/2004-2005# |archivedate=3 March 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Squad==\n===First Team squad===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[Paul Robinson (goalkeeper)|Paul Robinson]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=MAR|pos=DF|name=[[Noureddine Naybet]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=Serbia and Montenegro|pos=DF|name=[[Goran Bunjev\u010devi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=WAL|pos=MF|name=[[Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979)|Simon Davies]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=POR|pos=MF|name=[[Pedro Mendes (footballer, born 1979)|Pedro Mendes]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=MLI|pos=FW|name=[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9]]<ref>Kanout\u00e9 was born in [[Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon]], France, and has represented them at [[France national under-21 football team|U-21]] level, but also qualified to represent [[Mali]] internationally and made his debut for [[Mali national football team|Mali]] in January 2004</ref>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=IRL|pos=FW|name=[[Robbie Keane]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Mounir El Hamdaoui]]<ref>El Hamdaoui was born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], and has represented them at [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|U-21]] level, but also qualified to represent [[Morocco]] internationally and made his full international debut for [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] in February 2009</ref>}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SWE|pos=DF|name=[[Erik Edman]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=EGY|pos=FW|name=[[Mido (footballer)|Mido]]|other=on loan from [[A.S.

successive season in the top division of the [[English football league system]].\n\n==Season summary==\nTottenham made a promising start under [[Jacques Santini]] and looked to be challenging for a place in Europe, but Santini resigned in November after only 12 games, citing personal reasons. He was replaced by his assistant coach [[Martin Jol]], whose first match in charge saw arch-rivals [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] win a thrilling [[North London derby]] 5\u20134. Following the derby defeat, results picked up and Tottenham were soon back amongst the race for a [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] spot, but a draw with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] on the last day of the season saw their slim European hopes dashed. Nonetheless, good cup runs and the resurgence in the league under Jol gave Spurs fans hopes of a greater push for European football the next season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tottenham Hotspur 2004\u20132005 Home - statto.com |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/2004-2005 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65tSUmNUd?url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/tottenham-hotspur/2004-2005# |archivedate=3 March 2012 |url-status=dead |accessdate=25 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Squad==\n===First Team squad===\n{{Fs start}}\n{{Fs player|no=1|nat=ENG|pos=GK|name=[[Paul Robinson (goalkeeper)|Paul Robinson]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=2|nat=MAR|pos=DF|name=[[Noureddine Naybet]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=4|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Sean Davis (footballer)|Sean Davis]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=5|nat=Serbia and Montenegro|pos=DF|name=[[Goran Bunjev\u010devi\u0107]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=7|nat=WAL|pos=MF|name=[[Simon Davies (footballer, born 1979)|Simon Davies]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=8|nat=POR|pos=MF|name=[[Pedro Mendes (footballer, born 1979)|Pedro Mendes]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=9|nat=MLI|pos=FW|name=[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9]]<ref>Kanout\u00e9 was born in [[Sainte-Foy-l\u00e8s-Lyon]], France, and has represented them at [[France national under-21 football team|U-21]] level, but also qualified to represent [[Mali]] internationally and made his debut for [[Mali national football team|Mali]] in January 2004</ref>}}\n{{Fs player|no=10|nat=IRL|pos=FW|name=[[Robbie Keane]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=11|nat=ENG|pos=MF|name=[[Michael Brown (footballer, born 1977)|Michael Brown]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=12|nat=NED|pos=FW|name=[[Mounir El Hamdaoui]]<ref>El Hamdaoui was born in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], and has represented them at [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|U-21]] level, but also qualified to represent [[Morocco]] internationally and made his full international debut for [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] in February 2009</ref>}}\n{{Fs player|no=14|nat=SWE|pos=DF|name=[[Erik Edman]]}}\n{{Fs player|no=15|nat=EGY|pos=FW|name=[[Mido (footballer)|Mido]]|other=on loan from [[A.S.

The detectives discover several more victims, and though Maggie stops another murder from occurring, the killer kidnaps Maggie, keeping her in the trunk of his car. He threatens to blow the car up and sets himself on fire, but Danny is able to pull Maggie out in the nick of time. During the investigation, Danny and Maggie appear to grow closer, much to Baez's chagrin, as she feels that Maggie is disrupting Danny's life. Frank tries to help his former partner Lenny Ross (Treat Williams) when his daughter is arrested. The girl uses a police courtesy card and is revealed to have pulled DNA from her half-sister, with whom she shares a mother. The half-sister, also in trouble with the law, is Lenny's actual daughter, and Frank encourages him to connect with her. After admitting that he never felt comfortable talking about his children to Frank due to a false impression of the Reagans as a \u201cperfect\u201d, happy family, Frank takes Henry\u2019s advice and makes Lenny the first outsider ever invited to Sunday dinner, which they then go out of their way to turn contentious...until Jamie deduces that that the uber-bickering in front of a guest was no coincidence; putting two and two together, Lenny thanks Frank for the gesture. Erin faces off against a cold-blooded defense attorney from her past, who serves as the lawyer for a wealthy man accused of repeatedly assaulting his girlfriend. The woman testifies in court that her boyfriend never abused her, but he later stabs her; she is injured, but survives. Jamie and Eddie go apartment hunting and find a deal that is too good to be true, but the former does not want any discounts due to being a Reagan. The couple eventually settles on a smaller apartment, with Eddie working nights at the 29th precinct.\n |LineColor         = 004953\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Blue Bloods (season 10)\n |EpisodeNumber     = 201\n |EpisodeNumber2    = 2\n |Title             = Naughty or Nice\n |DirectedBy        = [[John Behring]]\n |WrittenBy         = Ian Biederman\n |OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2019|10|4}}\n |Viewers           = 7.44<ref name=\"10.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-4-2019/|title='The Blacklist,' 'Hawaii Five-O,' all others hold: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 7, 2019|accessdate=October 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007204015/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-4-2019/|archive-date=October 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary      = Frank and Erin are at odds when Frank learns the D.A.'s office keeps a \"naughty list\" of NYPD cops they consider unreliable, to the point where [[Brady disclosure|they won't prosecute some cases those cops work for fear that the defense will use their history against them]].

This leads to Anthony working with his brother, a former mobster, to catch the criminal. Meanwhile, Eddie struggles with her unreasonable boss, Sergeant McNichols (Stephanie Kurtzuba), after taking some initiatives while investigating a murder at a community pool; McNichols berates Eddie for being a part of the Reagan family and \"putting herself in charge of a crime scene\" despite Eddie doing her job. Also, Danny drags a reluctant Baez into a case involving a suspicious Chinese immigrant couple who are grieving at the morgue. Due to their immense distaste for cops \u2014 whom they still associate with the brutal authoritarian regime they came to the United States to escape \u2014 they disowned their son, Officer Chen, after he became one.

Erin ponders a life-challenging opportunity presented to her by Mayor-elect Peter Chase ([[Dylan Walsh]]), who endorses her for the district attorney's office. Her family expresses support, but Erin is more reluctant to take that step and settles on telling Chase she is still considering it.

The detectives discover several more victims, and though Maggie stops another murder from occurring, the killer kidnaps Maggie, keeping her in the trunk of his car. He threatens to blow the car up and sets himself on fire, but Danny is able to pull Maggie out in the nick of time. During the investigation, Danny and Maggie appear to grow closer, much to Baez's chagrin, as she feels that Maggie is disrupting Danny's life. Frank tries to help his former partner Lenny Ross (Treat Williams) when his daughter is arrested. The girl uses a police courtesy card and is revealed to have pulled DNA from her half-sister, with whom she shares a mother. The half-sister, also in trouble with the law, is Lenny's actual daughter, and Frank encourages him to connect with her. After admitting that he never felt comfortable talking about his children to Frank due to a false impression of the Reagans as a \u201cperfect\u201d, happy family, Frank takes Henry\u2019s advice and makes Lenny the first outsider ever invited to Sunday dinner, which they then go out of their way to turn contentious...until Jamie deduces that that the uber-bickering in front of a guest was no coincidence; putting two and two together, Lenny thanks Frank for the gesture. Erin faces off against a cold-blooded defense attorney from her past, who serves as the lawyer for a wealthy man accused of repeatedly assaulting his girlfriend. The woman testifies in court that her boyfriend never abused her, but he later stabs her; she is injured, but survives. Jamie and Eddie go apartment hunting and find a deal that is too good to be true, but the former does not want any discounts due to being a Reagan. The couple eventually settles on a smaller apartment, with Eddie working nights at the 29th precinct.\n |LineColor         = 004953\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Blue Bloods (season 10)\n |EpisodeNumber     = 201\n |EpisodeNumber2    = 2\n |Title             = Naughty or Nice\n |DirectedBy        = [[John Behring]]\n |WrittenBy         = Ian Biederman\n |OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|2019|10|4}}\n |Viewers           = 7.44<ref name=\"10.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-4-2019/|title='The Blacklist,' 'Hawaii Five-O,' all others hold: Friday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 7, 2019|accessdate=October 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191007204015/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/friday-final-ratings-oct-4-2019/|archive-date=October 7, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary      = Frank and Erin are at odds when Frank learns the D.A.'s office keeps a \"naughty list\" of NYPD cops they consider unreliable, to the point where [[Brady disclosure|they won't prosecute some cases those cops work for fear that the defense will use their history against them]]. Danny and Baez work a case of a restaurant owner who was killed by a mob hitman, and recruit retired mobster Vincent Rella ([[Dan Hedaya]]) to assist in their investigation.

This leads to Anthony working with his brother, a former mobster, to catch the criminal. Meanwhile, Eddie struggles with her unreasonable boss, Sergeant McNichols (Stephanie Kurtzuba), after taking some initiatives while investigating a murder at a community pool; McNichols berates Eddie for being a part of the Reagan family and \"putting herself in charge of a crime scene\" despite Eddie doing her job.

It was awarded its broadcasting licence by the BAI in September 2008 and launched on 1 September 2010. It is the only Dublin radio station licensed to transmit to the extensive Dublin commuter belt, including Dublin, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath (County Offaly can also pick up the frequency of Radio NOVA 100fm however it is greater in some areas than others and Mullingar County Westmeath usually cannot get the station). NOVA is available throughout County Louth, in south Armagh, south Down, east Tyrone and north Armagh although in some of these areas reception is patchy. NOVA broadcasts on 100.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] from Three Rock Mountain Dublin, 100.5 from Saggart Hill, [[County Dublin]], to serve [[County Kildare]] and 95.7 FM from Bray Head in North Wicklow, to cover [[County Wicklow]]. The station covers [[County Meath]] from its main Dublin transmitter (100.3&nbsp;MHz).Radio NOVA 100fm in County Offaly operates (100.3&nbsp;MHz) to 100.5. <ref>http://www.nova.ie/about/</ref>\n\n==Shareholding==\nThe current parent company of Radio Nova is Choice Broadcasting.

In November 2012, it received a derogation from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to reduce its news content from 20% of total programming to 10%, on account of it being a special interest station. As a result, NOVA continues to broadcast hourly news bulletins between 6 am and 12 midnight, as well as music news segments at various times during the day. Its main newscasters are Tara Ducken and John Harte with cover provided by Elaine Stenson and David Layde.\n\n==Ambitions==\nWhile NOVA's licence allows it to broadcast to Dublin and surrounding counties, the station has made no secret of its ambitions to broadcast to a wider area. In April 2013 and September 2015, NOVA received temporary licences from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland to run a temporary, pilot station called 'The Rock'. The temporary station broadcast to several areas outside NOVA's own transmission area: Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford, Kilkenny and the North East (Louth, Monaghan, Cavan & North Meath). The station's Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Branigan, stated that the purpose of the temporary licence was to test the market in these areas for a full-time classic rock radio station. \n\nThe Rock previously broadcast under a BAI temporary licence in 2007 and 2008 and was the forerunner to NOVA. \n\nSeveral articles appeared in the Irish media in the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Times during 2015 in which Branigan stated he intended to apply to the BAI for approval to extend Radio NOVA to include these extra areas in 2016. If approved, the station would create an additional 10 full-time jobs. \n\n==Location==\nThe station is based at Castleforbes House, Castleforbes Road, in the north east of [[Dublin]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Radio Nova (Ireland)]] - pirate station by the same name operating from 1981 to 1986\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nova.ie/ Radio NOVA Homepage]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n~~Presenters~~\n*Marty Miller (Marty@Work, 10am-1pm)\n*Colm Hayes (The Colm And Lucy Breakfast Show, 6am-10am, Saturday 8am-11am)\n*Lucy Kennedy (The Colm And Lucy Breakfast Show, 6am-10am, Saturday 8am-11am)\n*Greg Gaughran (Nova Nights, Monday-Thursday 7pm-12am, Saturday night, 9pm-1am, Toys For Boys, Saturday 6am-8am)\n*Dee Woods (The Nova Lunchbreak, 1pm-3pm, Friday Night 80s, 7pm-10pm)\n*Pat Courtenay (Weekday Afternoon Drive, 3pm-7pm)\n*Lisa Gernon (Sunday night, 11pm-1am)\n*Tony Ainscough (The Friday Night Rock Show, 10am-1am)\n*Liam Quigley (Weekend Mornings, Saturday 11am-2pm, Sunday 10am-2pm)\n*Ruth Scott (Cover Presenter)\n*[[The_Devlins|Peter Devlin]] (Saturday Soundtrack, Saturday 6pm-9pm)\n*John Clarke (Sunday morning, Sunday 7am-10am)\n*Jack Hyland (Weekend afternoons, Sunday 2pm-6pm)\n*Phil Cawley (Saturday afternoon 2pm-6pm)\n*Kieran McGuinness (The nova Guestlist, Sunday 6pm-9pm)\n{{Media in County Dublin}}\n{{Media in County Meath}}\n{{Media in County Kildare}}\n{{Media in County Wicklow}}\n\n[[Category:Rock radio stations in Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=October 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox radio station\n | name = Radio Nova\n | image = File:Nova-web1-228x150.jpg\n | city = [[Dublin]]\n | area = Dublin and surrounding areas\n | branding = ''Radio NOVA 100FM''\n | slogan = \n | airdate = 1 September 2010\n | frequency = 100.3 [[Megahertz|MHz]]\n | format = Rock\n | erp = \n | haat = \n | class =\n | facility_id = \n | callsign_meaning = \n | former_callsigns =\n | affiliations = \n | owner = \n | licensee =\n | sister_stations =\n | webcast =\n | website = [http://www.nova.ie/ RadioNova]\n}}                                                               \n'''Radio NOVA''' is a radio station licensed by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, based in [[Dublin]], Ireland.

The station's Chief Executive Officer, Kevin Branigan, stated that the purpose of the temporary licence was to test the market in these areas for a full-time classic rock radio station. \n\nThe Rock previously broadcast under a BAI temporary licence in 2007 and 2008 and was the forerunner to NOVA. \n\nSeveral articles appeared in the Irish media in the Sunday Business Post and Sunday Times during 2015 in which Branigan stated he intended to apply to the BAI for approval to extend Radio NOVA to include these extra areas in 2016. If approved, the station would create an additional 10 full-time jobs. \n\n==Location==\nThe station is based at Castleforbes House, Castleforbes Road, in the north east of [[Dublin]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Radio Nova (Ireland)]] - pirate station by the same name operating from 1981 to 1986\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.nova.ie/ Radio NOVA Homepage]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n~~Presenters~~\n*Marty Miller (Marty@Work, 10am-1pm)\n*Colm Hayes (The Colm And Lucy Breakfast Show, 6am-10am, Saturday 8am-11am)\n*Lucy Kennedy (The Colm And Lucy Breakfast Show, 6am-10am, Saturday 8am-11am)\n*Greg Gaughran (Nova Nights, Monday-Thursday 7pm-12am, Saturday night, 9pm-1am, Toys For Boys, Saturday 6am-8am)\n*Dee Woods (The Nova Lunchbreak, 1pm-3pm, Friday Night 80s, 7pm-10pm)\n*Pat Courtenay (Weekday Afternoon Drive, 3pm-7pm)\n*Lisa Gernon (Sunday night, 11pm-1am)\n*Tony Ainscough (The Friday Night Rock Show, 10am-1am)\n*Liam Quigley (Weekend Mornings, Saturday 11am-2pm, Sunday 10am-2pm)\n*Ruth Scott (Cover Presenter)\n*[[The_Devlins|Peter Devlin]] (Saturday Soundtrack, Saturday 6pm-9pm)\n*John Clarke (Sunday morning, Sunday 7am-10am)\n*Jack Hyland (Weekend afternoons, Sunday 2pm-6pm)\n*Phil Cawley (Saturday afternoon 2pm-6pm)\n*Kieran McGuinness (The nova Guestlist, Sunday 6pm-9pm)\n{{Media in County Dublin}}\n{{Media in County Meath}}\n{{Media in County Kildare}}\n{{Media in County Wicklow}}\n\n[[Category:Rock radio stations in Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:8084:6a01:2880:4cb5:d4c7:4980:b15f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eProgramming)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Nova_100FM_(Ireland)"}
