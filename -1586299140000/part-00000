Feiyue continued to be popular for numerous decades, with hundreds of thousands of shoes sold by the original company over the course of its lifetime, continuing to the present day. The shoes are a popular export with numerous foreign martial arts clubs and schools importing them as the standard shoes for their students. With the [[Chinese economic reform|opening up of China]] and the associated cultural and economic shifts, the sneaker began to lose prominence in China. Famous indoor football coach [[Xu Genbao]] and player [[Qi Hong]] participated in contests wearing Feiyue ''track and field'' shoes.\n\nIn 2005, Patrice Bastian, a marketing and events manager and an entrepreneur living in Shanghai, decided to team up with a group of artists to recreate the brand name with the stated intention of improving the image and appearance of Feiyue. Nicolas Seguy and Clement Fauth were part of his team to redesign Feiyue for the contemporary Western consumer. In February 2006, they launched the first French-designed Feiyue Shoes collection.<ref name=daxue/>\n\nThe DaFu Rubber Company reorganized and sold the rights to Feiyue to the \"Shuang Qian Group Co.

The Philippine National Police Academy graduates are automatically appointed as Inspectors/Lieutenants in the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology according to their choice of public safety curriculum during their cadetship. This is under the supervision of the DILG and the [[Philippine Public Safety College]].\n\n===Poland===\nThe Polish Police college is located in the town of [[Szczytno]]. Police schools are in [[Pi\u0142a]], [[S\u0142upsk]], [[Katowice]], and [[Legionowo]]. Border guard training centers are located in [[K\u0119trzyn]], [[Koszalin]], and [[Luba\u0144]]. Poland also has a \"higher educational institution\" called ''Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Policji.'' where officers are enrolled in academic studies and trained in modern policing techniques, weapons handling, and informatics.\n\n===Romania===\nOffering three levels of training for officers, ([[Bachelor's Degree]] (3 years), [[Master's Degree]], (2 years) and [[Doctorate|Dr]] (3+1 years)), The Romanian Police academy is located in [[Bucure\u015fti]].\n\nThe Border Police School and Training Center is located in [[Oradea]], [[Avram Iancu]], the Coast Guard Center is in Constanta. Centers for Training Border Police Personnel are in [[Ia\u0219i]] and [[Orsova]].\n\n===Serbia===\nIn Serbia, future police officers are trained at the [[Basic Police Training Centre]] in Sremska Kamenica, the former Police High School. The training lasts for 1 year and is followed by a 6-month probation period at a Regional Police Department. The skills the recruits learn are for general jurisdiction police officers, and after they are employed, they may specialize in a line of work (traffic police, border police, special forces, etc.).\nThere is also the Academy of Criminalistic and Police Studies, a higher education institution established as a legal successor of the Advanced School of Internal Affairs, formed in 1972; and Police Academy, formed in 1993.\n\n===Slovak Republic===\nIn the Slovak Republic, the Police College, (University), offers courses in security specialization for police, public administration, and private security services. Some branches are open to civilians, while some only allow police officers, firefighters, soldiers and the like. The schools offer Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and Doctoral Degrees.\n\nAll police officers must pass through the basic training centers for new police officers, called secondary police schools.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn Slovenia, the police academy conducts training programs, education, and training for the police and for external users. All candidates need to have a high-school education before attending. Candidates spend eighteen months in basic training in order to become a police officer, followed by a six-month evaluation period. Advanced police school courses last two years, and require one to have been a police officer for at least two years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Spain===\nIn [[Spain]], there is a [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]]'s [[National Police Corps|National Police]] centralized academy near [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] ({{Coord|40.666044|-4.653832|display=inline}}.) The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs two centralized academies, one for enlisted ''guardias'' and [[sub-officer]]s in [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]], {{Coord|37.995590|-3.480421|display=inline}}) and another one for [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officers]] in two campuses at [[Aranjuez]] ({{Coord|40.052223|-3.600720|display=inline}}) and [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial|El Escorial]] ({{Coord|40.599491|-4.132105|display=inline}}) ([[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]). The autonomous [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan]] and [[Basque Government|Basque]] police forces \u2014the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Ertzaintza]]\u2014 also have their own academies in [[Mollet del Vall\u00e8s]] ([[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], {{Coord|41.551442|2.221305|display=inline}}) and [[Arcaute]] ([[\u00c1lava]], {{Coord|42.858187|-2.618719|display=inline}}). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted.\n\nCandidates attend these centralized public academies after passing the police force's [[Civil service entrance examination|entry examination]], this way recruits are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Recruits' training is tuition free and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level ''polic\u00eda Nacional'' or ''Guardia civil'' to 9 months for a ''mosso'', but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including [[Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid|Madrid]]'s or [[Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana de Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialized courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree.\n\nThe Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private ''academias'' training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not required and potential candidates are able to take the entrance examination without these courses.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nSri Lanka established the [[Sri Lanka Police Academy]] in 2008, bringing together several police training institutions including the Sri Lanka Police College.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Details|Swedish Police Authority#Police training}}\nSince 2015, police training has been entirely outsourced by the [[Swedish Police Authority]], and is carried out at three universities: [[Linnaeus University|V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], [[Ume\u00e5 University|Ume\u00e5]], and [[S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University|S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S\u00f6dert\u00f6rns h\u00f6gskola f\u00e5r utbilda poliser|url=https://polisen.se/Stockholms_lan/Arkiv/Pressmeddelandearkiv/Rikspolisstyrelsen/Sodertorns-hogskola-far-utbilda-poliser/|publisher=Swedish Police Authority|accessdate=10 August 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref> The training covers five terms, and the last two include six months of paid workplace practicum as a Police Trainee.

In 1938, a police college, (high school), was established in [[Ankara]] in order to prepare students for the Police Academy. Today, the police academy recruits police officers in 26 schools located in different parts of Turkey, and police chiefs in one school located in [[Ankara]].\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\nIn UAE, the [[Emirate]]s either train their own police force or outsource training to academies of other [[Emirate]]s. There are mainly two academies, one located in [[Abu Dhabi]] and the other in [[Dubai]].\n\n====Abu Dhabi====\nIn the Abu Dhabi Police Academy, the study program includes practical and field training. After successful completion of the program, the student is awarded a bachelor's degree in Law and Policing Sciences.\n\nAn Institute for officer training affiliated with the Police College was established in 1992. In 2002, the system of study in the college was changed to incorporate training theory programs and fieldwork.\n\nThe four years of study are divided into two levels of study consisting of eight terms:\n\n=====Basic level \u2013 two years=====\nOne year for theoretical study and another for fieldwork.\n\n=====Advanced level \u2013 two years=====\nThese two levels are preceded by an introductory period for the physical and psychological preparation of the students. After successful completion of the study and training programs, the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice.\n\n====Dubai====\nThe Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987 and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of [[Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. \n\nThe first class was from 1987 to 1988 and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996\u20131997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\nAll candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18\u00bd; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight.  Candidates also must hold British citizenship, be a citizen of the Commonwealth with no restrictions on his or her stay within Britain or be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. All candidates serve two years as probationary constables, which will be spent training in both academic and practical situations. From 2007, all training was managed by the now defunct [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] with the [[College of Policing]] taking over in 2013.\n\n====Scotland====\nAll new police officers in Scotland attend an initial 11-week training course at the [[Scottish Police College]] at [[Tulliallan Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Training - Police Officers - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/recruitment/police-officers/training/|website=Police Service of Scotland - Training Information|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> The college has been operating since 1954 and hosts initial training of new officers as well as a range of courses such as the training of traffic officers and detectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Scotland College - About Us - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/scottish-police-college/|website=Police Service of Scotland - About Us|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> Many courses have received accreditation from the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) or are credit rated on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF).

Each state has an agency that certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification.\n====Federal====\nWhile some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals Service]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fletc.gov/current-partners|title=Current Partners - FLETC|website=www.fletc.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC).

All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the ''Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission'' under the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

Master's studies focus on management skills and supervisory tasks. The Master's degree is a required qualification for command positions such as Chief Inspector or Superintendent.\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{see also|Military Academy #Indonesia}}\n[[File:Akademi Kepolisian Semarang.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian Police Academy]]\n[[File:Taruna akpol.jpg|thumb|280px|Indonesian Police Academy Cadets]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], the National Police Academy ([[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]]: ''Akademi Kepolisian'' abbreviated \"'''AKPOL'''\") is the main institute, training center, and school for recruits joining the [[Indonesian National Police]] Force to become professional [[officers]]. After 4 years in the Police Academy, cadets graduate to the rank of Police Inspector 2nd Class (''Inspektur Polisi Dua''), (equivalent to [[Second Lieutenant]] in the military). Graduates become first line supervisors with the rank of junior first ranking officers in the Indonesian National Police and can be deployed to different units within the force. The academy is located in [[Semarang]], [[Central Java]] and is part of the [[International Association of Police Academies]] (Interpa).\n\nCadet ranks in the Academy are as shown below:\n*Cadet Enlisted Candidate (''Calon Bhayangkara Taruna'') - Trainee for the first 4 months\n*Cadet Enlisted Second Class (''Bhayangkara Dua Taruna'') - First Year\n*Cadet Enlisted First Class (''Bhayangkara Satu Taruna'') - Second Year\n*Cadet Brigadier Second Class (''Brigadir Dua Taruna'') - Third Year\n*Cadet Brigadier First Class (''Brigadir Satu Taruna'') - Fourth Year\n*Cadet Brigadier (''Brigadir Taruna'') - Graduating year (After this rank, they will graduate and achieve the rank of \"Police Inspector\")\n\nUntil 1999, before the [[Indonesian National Police]] officially separated from the armed forces (ABRI), the Indonesian Police Academy (\"AKPOL\") also stood under the National Armed Forces Academy but now has separated from the Military and is under the auspices of the President of Indonesia, and controlled by the National Police Headquarters (''Mabes Polri''). Although separated from the service academies, cadets from both institutions maintain cooperative relationships through annual joint exercises. The NPA's new cadets and 4th class cadets, alongside their armed forces counterparts, have had a joint 4th class cadet training program since 2008, after completing it the police officer cadets spend the remaining 4 years of study in Semarang.\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy}}\nLocated in [[Hyderabad, India]], [[Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy]] is the national institute for training of [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officers before they are assigned to their respective Indian state cadres.\n\n===Ireland===\n{{Main|Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na College}}\nIn the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na College]] in [[Templemore]] is the only police academy, All trainees for the [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na]] and [[Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na Reserve]] study here.\n\n===Italy===\n\nFor prospective candidates to the [[Polizia di Stato]], basic education is conducted at the Scuola Superiore di Polizia while the Scuola di perfezionamento per le Forze di Polizia conducts advanced education and implements courses on new legislation, regulations and operational techniques.<ref>http://www.poliziadistato.it/articolo/965M</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn Malaysia, there are fifteen police academies, one of them being the [[Royal Malaysian Police College Kuala Lumpur|Royal Malaysia Police College]] in [[Kuala Lumpur]] which is a combination of four police training institutes, (the Kuala Kubu Baru Police College, the Special Branch Training School, the College of Criminal Investigation, and Traffic School), which train higher-ranking officers.

After the merging of the [[Philippine Constabulary]] and INP on January 1, 1991, it became the primary officer's school for the new [[Philippine National Police]], the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]] and the [[Bureau of Jail Management and Penology]], all under the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]]. The Philippine National Police Academy graduates are automatically appointed as Inspectors/Lieutenants in the Philippine National Police, Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology according to their choice of public safety curriculum during their cadetship. This is under the supervision of the DILG and the [[Philippine Public Safety College]].\n\n===Poland===\nThe Polish Police college is located in the town of [[Szczytno]]. Police schools are in [[Pi\u0142a]], [[S\u0142upsk]], [[Katowice]], and [[Legionowo]]. Border guard training centers are located in [[K\u0119trzyn]], [[Koszalin]], and [[Luba\u0144]]. Poland also has a \"higher educational institution\" called ''Wy\u017csza Szko\u0142a Policji.'' where officers are enrolled in academic studies and trained in modern policing techniques, weapons handling, and informatics.\n\n===Romania===\nOffering three levels of training for officers, ([[Bachelor's Degree]] (3 years), [[Master's Degree]], (2 years) and [[Doctorate|Dr]] (3+1 years)), The Romanian Police academy is located in [[Bucure\u015fti]].\n\nThe Border Police School and Training Center is located in [[Oradea]], [[Avram Iancu]], the Coast Guard Center is in Constanta.

The training lasts for 1 year and is followed by a 6-month probation period at a Regional Police Department. The skills the recruits learn are for general jurisdiction police officers, and after they are employed, they may specialize in a line of work (traffic police, border police, special forces, etc.).\nThere is also the Academy of Criminalistic and Police Studies, a higher education institution established as a legal successor of the Advanced School of Internal Affairs, formed in 1972; and Police Academy, formed in 1993.\n\n===Slovak Republic===\nIn the Slovak Republic, the Police College, (University), offers courses in security specialization for police, public administration, and private security services. Some branches are open to civilians, while some only allow police officers, firefighters, soldiers and the like. The schools offer Bachelor's Degrees, Master's Degrees, and Doctoral Degrees.\n\nAll police officers must pass through the basic training centers for new police officers, called secondary police schools.\n\n===Slovenia===\nIn Slovenia, the police academy conducts training programs, education, and training for the police and for external users. All candidates need to have a high-school education before attending. Candidates spend eighteen months in basic training in order to become a police officer, followed by a six-month evaluation period. Advanced police school courses last two years, and require one to have been a police officer for at least two years.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n===Spain===\nIn [[Spain]], there is a [[Ministry of the Interior (Spain)|Ministry of the Interior]]'s [[National Police Corps|National Police]] centralized academy near [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]] ({{Coord|40.666044|-4.653832|display=inline}}.) The [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] runs two centralized academies, one for enlisted ''guardias'' and [[sub-officer]]s in [[Baeza]] ([[Province of Ja\u00e9n (Spain)|Ja\u00e9n]], {{Coord|37.995590|-3.480421|display=inline}}) and another one for [[Officer (armed forces)|commanding officers]] in two campuses at [[Aranjuez]] ({{Coord|40.052223|-3.600720|display=inline}}) and [[San Lorenzo de El Escorial|El Escorial]] ({{Coord|40.599491|-4.132105|display=inline}}) ([[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]). The autonomous [[Generalitat de Catalunya|Catalan]] and [[Basque Government|Basque]] police forces \u2014the [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Ertzaintza]]\u2014 also have their own academies in [[Mollet del Vall\u00e8s]] ([[Province of Barcelona|Barcelona]], {{Coord|41.551442|2.221305|display=inline}}) and [[Arcaute]] ([[\u00c1lava]], {{Coord|42.858187|-2.618719|display=inline}}). No candidates with a criminal record are accepted.\n\nCandidates attend these centralized public academies after passing the police force's [[Civil service entrance examination|entry examination]], this way recruits are already enlisted and will automatically become police officers if they don't fail the course or drop out. Recruits' training is tuition free and the candidates are paid a police cadet's wage as members of the force. Basic training ranges from 5 months for an entry-level ''polic\u00eda Nacional'' or ''Guardia civil'' to 9 months for a ''mosso'', but realistically takes 18 months to two years including practicums and additional training. Local police forces including [[Polic\u00eda Municipal de Madrid|Madrid]]'s or [[Gu\u00e0rdia Urbana de Barcelona|Barcelona]]'s are often trained at these large public academies too. High-rank or highly specialized courses are longer and eventually lead to a college-like degree.\n\nThe Spanish police academies must not be confused with the many fee-paying private ''academias'' training potential candidates to pass the entry examination beforehand. While these private academies may be helpful, studying at them is not required and potential candidates are able to take the entrance examination without these courses.\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nSri Lanka established the [[Sri Lanka Police Academy]] in 2008, bringing together several police training institutions including the Sri Lanka Police College.\n\n===Sweden===\n{{Details|Swedish Police Authority#Police training}}\nSince 2015, police training has been entirely outsourced by the [[Swedish Police Authority]], and is carried out at three universities: [[Linnaeus University|V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], [[Ume\u00e5 University|Ume\u00e5]], and [[S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University|S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn]].<ref>{{cite web|title=S\u00f6dert\u00f6rns h\u00f6gskola f\u00e5r utbilda poliser|url=https://polisen.se/Stockholms_lan/Arkiv/Pressmeddelandearkiv/Rikspolisstyrelsen/Sodertorns-hogskola-far-utbilda-poliser/|publisher=Swedish Police Authority|accessdate=10 August 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref> The training covers five terms, and the last two include six months of paid workplace practicum as a Police Trainee.

In 1938, a police college, (high school), was established in [[Ankara]] in order to prepare students for the Police Academy. Today, the police academy recruits police officers in 26 schools located in different parts of Turkey, and police chiefs in one school located in [[Ankara]].\n\n===United Arab Emirates===\nIn UAE, the [[Emirate]]s either train their own police force or outsource training to academies of other [[Emirate]]s. There are mainly two academies, one located in [[Abu Dhabi]] and the other in [[Dubai]].\n\n====Abu Dhabi====\nIn the Abu Dhabi Police Academy, the study program includes practical and field training. After successful completion of the program, the student is awarded a bachelor's degree in Law and Policing Sciences.\n\nAn Institute for officer training affiliated with the Police College was established in 1992. In 2002, the system of study in the college was changed to incorporate training theory programs and fieldwork.\n\nThe four years of study are divided into two levels of study consisting of eight terms:\n\n=====Basic level \u2013 two years=====\nOne year for theoretical study and another for fieldwork.\n\n=====Advanced level \u2013 two years=====\nThese two levels are preceded by an introductory period for the physical and psychological preparation of the students. After successful completion of the study and training programs, the student will be awarded a bachelor's degree in Police Sciences and Criminal Justice.\n\n====Dubai====\nThe Dubai Police Academy was founded in 1987 and was granted autonomy from the police force as long as it retained some affiliation with Dubai Police General Headquarters. It was fully inaugurated in 1989 in the presence of [[Sheikh Maktoum Bin Rashid Al Maktoum]]. In 1992, degrees offered by the academy were given university equivalency. \n\nThe first class was from 1987 to 1988 and consisted of 51 cadets and 30 full-time students, (some of whom were existing police officers), which graduated in 1991. During the academic year of 1996\u20131997, students from other Arabic countries such as Yemen and the Palestinian Territories were admitted.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n\n====England and Wales====\nAll candidates for the 43 police forces for England and Wales must be over the age of 18\u00bd; of a reasonable standard of physical fitness, with good health and eyesight.  Candidates also must hold British citizenship, be a citizen of the Commonwealth with no restrictions on his or her stay within Britain or be a citizen of the Republic of Ireland. All candidates serve two years as probationary constables, which will be spent training in both academic and practical situations. From 2007, all training was managed by the now defunct [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] with the [[College of Policing]] taking over in 2013.\n\n====Scotland====\nAll new police officers in Scotland attend an initial 11-week training course at the [[Scottish Police College]] at [[Tulliallan Castle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Training - Police Officers - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/recruitment/police-officers/training/|website=Police Service of Scotland - Training Information|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> The college has been operating since 1954 and hosts initial training of new officers as well as a range of courses such as the training of traffic officers and detectives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Police Scotland College - About Us - Police Scotland|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/scottish-police-college/|website=Police Service of Scotland - About Us|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref> Many courses have received accreditation from the [[Scottish Qualifications Authority]] (SQA) or are credit rated on the [[Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework]] (SCQF).

Each state has an agency that certifies state-specific police academies and their programs. Most states have minimum physical and academic requirements to be completed prior to entry into the academy. Some states may require additional certifications before qualification as a police officer. While some states allow open enrollment in police academies, many require cadets to be hired by a police department in order to attend training. Departments and/or state certification agencies may also require individuals to pass background checks, psychological evaluations, polygraph exams, drug screenings, firearms qualifications and demonstrations of driving skills as prerequisites of employment/certification.\n====Federal====\nWhile some federal law enforcement agencies have their own training requirements and training facilities, 91 federal law enforcement agencies (including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and [[United States Marshals Service]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fletc.gov/current-partners|title=Current Partners - FLETC|website=www.fletc.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> require agents, officers and prospective agents/officers to attend basic and in-service training at the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers]] (FLETC).

All law enforcement officers in the state are certified as such by a governing body appointed by the governor called the ''Criminal Justice Standards and Training Commission'' under the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. All applicants must pass a state examination and be hired by a law enforcement agency within 4 years of graduation to be considered certified.\n====Kentucky====\nAll law enforcement officers in Kentucky, (except as listed below), hired after 1998 are required to complete the minimum screening, physical training and classroom requirements of the Kentucky's ''Police Officer Professional Standards (POPS)'' prior to being certified, and acting, as a law enforcement officer.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://docjt.ky.gov/history.html|title=Welcome to the Department of Criminal Justice Training|first=|last=bbowling@docjt.jus.state.ky.us|website=docjt.ky.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Larger agencies, such as the [[Kentucky State Police]], as well as the [[Louisville Metro Police]] and the [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]] Division of Police, operate their own police academies and may have requirements that exceed the minimum POPS standards. Agencies in Kentucky who do not run their own academies send their prospective officers to a 16-week basic training class at the Kentucky Department of Criminal Justice Training Academy, operated by the [[Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet]] and located on the campus of [[Eastern Kentucky University]] in [[Richmond, Kentucky|Richmond]]. <ref name=\"auto\"/> Exceptions to POPS training and certification are officers hired prior to 1998 and elected law enforcement officers whose duties and requirements are set forth in the [[Kentucky Constitution]]. These include [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]], [[Constables in the United States|constables]], [[coroner]]s and [[jailer]]s, (though generally not deputies).  Many of these officeholders, however, hold POPS certification from previous employment as law enforcement officers prior to their election and some will receive POPS certification or approved equivalent training before taking office.\n====Maryland====\nIn Maryland, the [[Maryland Police and Correctional Training Commission]] is the civilian governing body that sets standards for law enforcement personnel within the state. Most major [[List of law enforcement agencies in Maryland|law enforcement agencies]] operate their own academy in which recruits must pass over 550 objectives including, (but not limited to), criminal and traffic law, officer safety techniques, [[self-defense|defensive tactics]], report writing, a 40-hour block of emergency vehicle operations, a 40-hour block of [[Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation|First Responder]], and a 40-hour block of weapon training.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dpscs.state.md.us/aboutdpscs/pct/peltp/peltp.shtml|title=DPSCS.state.md.us|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref> Most agencies operate non-resident academies; however, the [[Maryland State Police]] requires recruits to live at the academy and, dependent on their performance level for the week, may leave campus for the weekend.<ref>[http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp Recruiting.mdsp.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005063842/http://recruiting.mdsp.org/training.asp |date=October 5, 2011 }}</ref> Many colleges such as the [[University of Maryland]] and other [[community colleges]] offer police academy instruction as well.<ref>[http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 Outlook.umd.edu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607130843/http://www.outlook.umd.edu/article.cfm?id=2041 |date=June 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n====Michigan====\nIn Michigan, in order to become law enforcement officers, all applicants have the option to be certified by the ''Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards'' or MCOLES. All persons wishing to become police officers in the State of Michigan must be certified through MCOLES. Cadets must pass a physical fitness exam as well as a reading and writing exam. Applicants also cannot have any felonies, weapons violations, or a history of domestic violence posted on their criminal records. Police academies are most often part of [[community colleges]], city or county police and sheriff departments, or the [[Michigan State Police]].\n\nAfter the police academy, candidates take the MCOLES test. Upon successful completion, candidates are 'certifiable' and have a period of one year to obtain employment as law enforcement officers, (if not sponsored by an agency). If a candidate is unable to obtain a law enforcement position within that year, and if the candidate wishes to be considered in the future, he/she must attend a two-week re-certification course, which adds a year to the candidate's window of opportunity.\n====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire's PSTC, (Police Standards and Training Council), provides all training and maintains certification standards for every full and part-time law enforcement officer in the state. This includes anyone who has the power of arrest, (except federal officers), under New Hampshire law.   The PSTC also provides training and certification for correctional officers employed directly by the State. All recruits must have at least a conditional offer of employment from a law enforcement agency, have a clear background check, pass a medical exam and a physical fitness test. Agencies may add other qualifications such as education, polygraph, and drug exams. The PSTC law enforcement academies require each recruit to qualify with a firearm, demonstrate driving skills, maintaining physical fitness, pass subject matter exams and scenario evaluations as a condition of certification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pstc.nh.gov/|title=NH Police Standards and Training Council|website=www.pstc.nh.gov|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nMost agencies in the state use a Field Training Officer program to provide additional training and evaluation of new hires.\n====Texas====\nThe agency which certifies police academies in Texas is the [[Texas Commission on Law Enforcement]] (TCOLE). Many major cities and sheriff's offices also operate their own training academies, while some smaller municipalities cooperate to maintain regional academies. Some community colleges offer police training courses as well. There are three state-level law enforcement academies: the [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Department of Public Safety]] which trains state troopers, the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] who train game wardens, and the [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] that trains state [[Corrections Officer|corrections officers]]. Police academies typically last from 18 to 30 weeks, though there are many variations. All police cadets are required to obtain at least a Basic Peace Officer Proficiency Certification from TCOLE before beginning active duty; some academies also require their cadets to obtain an Intermediate certification before graduating. TCOLE offers certifications for jailers and corrections officers, who must also undergo training prior to being commissioned, (albeit typically much less than police officers).\n====Utah====\nThe basis of the Utah basic training for police officers is to protect the community and the citizens the officers are serving. They do this by completing basic training, firearms training, curriculum development, canine training, defensive tactics, emergency vehicle operations, and physical fitness training. Training for Utah officers is broken into two separate sections, called blocks. The two blocks are Special Functions and Law Enforcement. In order to be certified in the state of Utah an individual must successfully finish both blocks of training. This training is intended to teach the officers to be as professional and as up to date as possible. Officers are also required to do an additional 40 hours of training annually in order to stay up to date on all current laws and police procedures.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|title = Utah Department of Public Safety|date = March 8, 2013|accessdate = March 20, 2015|website = The Academy - Basic Training Bureau|publisher = State of Utah|last = |first = |url-status=dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150402151823/http://publicsafety.utah.gov/post/academy/basic.html|archivedate = April 2, 2015|df = }}</ref>\n\n===Vietnam===\nLocated in Tu Liem district, [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]], The Vietnam People's Police Academy is one of the leading schools of the [[Vietnam People's Public Security]], training officers with university degrees and postgraduate degrees.

While the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] selects, manages, and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one (W\u20111), normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service.<ref name=\"warrant officer appointment\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/571 10 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f571.

However, the warrant officer's primary task as a leader is to serve as a technical expert, providing valuable skills, guidance, and expertise to commanders and organizations in their particular field.\n{{TOCLeft}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Rank insignia==\n{| class=\"wikitable center\"\n|+ Modern insignia and grades of U.S. Military Warrant Officers\n!

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Candidates were drawn from Chief Warrant Officer 4s (CW4) who had attended a special course at the Warrant Officer school at Fort Rucker. The first class graduated in 8 December 1988. The Warrant Officer Management Act {{USPL|102|190}} of 5 December 1991, created the paygrade of W5 and the separate rank of Master Warrant Officer (CW5), since renamed as Chief Warrant Officer Five.\n\nOn 9 July 2004 the Warrant Officer Branch insignia (also known as the \"Eagle Rising\" or \"Squashed Bug\") was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.cavhooah.com/info/index.php/join-the-cav/warrant-officers/warrant-insignia/ \"Warrant officers to sport branch insignia\"] by Sgt. 1st Class Marcia Triggs.

Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School|U.S. Army Special Operations Center of Excellence]]]]\nThe Army warrant officer\n<ref group=Note>Warrant officer definitions: (Per Army Pamphlet DA PAM 600-3 Commissioned Officer Professional Development and Career Management, Paragraph 3-9, dated 3 December 2014)\n*http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/p600_3/head.asp</ref> is a self-aware and adaptive technical expert, combat leader, trainer, and advisor. Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black. In 2004, this insignia was changed to a single silver bar surmounted by a single, narrow, vertical, black stripe. The proposed CW6 insignia had two narrow, vertical, parallel, black stripes.<ref>https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_Army_CW5_Insignia.htm. Retrieved 17 January 2017.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains.<ref name=\"WO-4\" /> Until 1912, a [[midshipman]] graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>Commission of ensign to graduates of the Naval Academy at end of four years' course, Pub.

McComas, US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD, c2011</ref> However, the United States Navy experienced a similar issue of rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Navy ceased using the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO-1), also known as pay grade W-1, because chief petty officers in pay grades E-7 and above with many years in service would lose pay when appointed to the rank of warrant officer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Navy appoints their warrant officers directly to the rank of CWO2 (i.e., as chief warrant officers), and are \"commissioned\" officers, with the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Personnel (NAVPERSCOM/BUPERS) managing all grades (CWO-2 through CWO-5) by [[Billet#United States usage|billet]]s appropriate for each rank.

Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012. The Navy re-evaluated the program in 2011, when the last of the \"flying\" chief warrant officers reported to their operational fleet squadrons and opted to subsequently terminate the program.<ref name=\"WO-5\"/><ref name=\"public.navy.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navytrng/a/navwarflight.htm |title=Flying CWO Program|accessdate=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Reestablishment of warrant officer one ===\n{{Annotated image\n| image = US Navy Cap Devices.png\n| image-width = 380\n| image-left = -29\n| image-top = -270\n| width = 180\n| height = 140\n| float = right\n| annotations =\n| caption = U.S. Navy Warrant Officer\u2013One combination cover device\n}}\nOn 4 June 2018, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade.<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\">[https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2018/NAV18140.txt  MODIFICATION OF THE NAVY CYBER WARRANT OFFICER PROGRAM], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], 2018-06-04</ref> These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\"/> They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later.

Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

While the ranks are authorized by Congress, each branch of the [[Uniformed services of the United States|uniformed services]] selects, manages, and uses warrant officers in slightly different ways. For appointment to the rank of warrant officer one (W\u20111), normally a warrant is approved by the secretary of the respective service.<ref name=\"warrant officer appointment\">[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/571 10 U.S. Code \u00a7\u202f571.

In 1916, an Army [[Judge Advocate General's Corps|Judge Advocate General]] review determined that field clerks should be members of the military. Legislation in 1916 authorized those positions as military rather than civilian and created the ranks of Army Field Clerk (the former rank of Headquarters Clerk) and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk (the former rank of Pay Clerk). In July, 1917, all Field Clerks were considered enlisted and were assigned an enlisted uniform. Their branch insignia was two crossed quill pens (worn on a disk pin on the left side of the standing collar and a freework insignia on the visored cap).\n\nIn 19 December 1917, ''Special Regulation 41'' stated that the Army Field Clerk and Quarter Master Corps Field Clerk ranks were authorized the same uniform as an officer. Their rank insignia was now a freework pin of crossed quill pens on either side of the freework \"U.S.\" pins worn on the standing collar of the M1909 tunic. They were not permitted the brown mohair cuff braid band of an Army officer, but were authorized a silver-and-black braid hatcord for wear with the M1911 Campaign Hat and the officer's \"G.I. Eagle\" on the M1902 peaked cap.\n\nOn 9 July 1918, Congress established the rank and grade of warrant officer concurrent with establishing the Army [[Mine Planter Service (U.S. Army)|Mine Planter Service]] (AMPS)<ref>http://www.militarymuseum.org/Mines.html | The California State Military Museum - Forts Under the Sea - Submarine Mine Defense of San Francisco Bay</ref> within the [[United States Army Coast Artillery Corps|Coast Artillery Corps]]. Creation of the Mine Planter Service replaced an informal service crewed by civilians, replacing them with military personnel, of whom the vessel's master, mates, chief engineer, and assistant engineers were Army warrant officers. Warrant officer rank was indicated by rings of brown cord worn on the lower sleeve of the uniform jacket: two for 2nd Mate and 2nd Assistant Engineer, three for 1st Mate and Assistant Engineer, and four for Ship's Master and Chief Engineer.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1941 to 1949\n| width    = 45\n| image1   = FlightOfficerWW2.jpg\n| caption1 = Flight Officer\n| image2   = JuniorWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption2 = Warrant Officer\n| image3   = ChiefWarrantWW2.jpg\n| caption3 = Chief Warrant Officer\n}}\n{{anchor|W1|WOJG}}Since that time, the position of warrant officer in the Army has been refined. On 21 August 1941, under {{USPL|77|230}}, Congress authorized two grades: warrant officer (junior grade) and chief warrant officer. In 1942, temporary appointments in about 40 occupational areas were made.\nThe insignia for warrant officer (junior grade) was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} wide and {{convert|1|in|cm}} long, rounded at the ends with brown enamel on top and a latitudinal center of gold {{sfrac|1|8}} (0.32&nbsp;cm) inch wide. The insignia for chief warrant officer was a gold bar {{convert|3/8|in|cm}} in width and {{convert|1|in|cm}} in length with rounded ends, brown enamel on top with a longitudinal center stripe of gold {{convert|1/8|in|cm}} wide. The brown enamel backing of the warrant officer insignia was based on the color of the sleeve insignia of rank for ship's officers of the AMPS.<ref name=\"WO-1\">{{cite web|url=http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/wocc/woprogram.asp#history|title=Warrant Officer History|publisher=U.S. Army Warrant Officer Career College|accessdate=14 November 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"tioh_rank\">http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/UniformedServices/Insignia_Rank/warrant_officers.aspx |Insignia of Grade Warrant - Officers</ref><ref>[http://www.usawoa.org/stivers2announced.htm Ship's officers]</ref>\n\nOn 18 July 1942 {{USPL|77|658}}, the Flight Officer Act, was enacted, creating the rank of [[flight officer]], equivalent to warrant officer (junior grade) and assigned to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Insignia was the same as for a warrant officer (junior grade), except the backing was in blue enamel rather than brown. Most flight officers were graduates of various USAAF flight-training programs, including power and glider pilots, and navigator and bombardier ratings. Graduates were appointed to the rating of flight officer, but some of each graduating class were commissioned as [[second lieutenant]]s. Once reaching operational units and after gaining flying experience, flight officers were later offered direct commissions as lieutenants.\n\nFlight sergeants, who were assigned as transport and glider pilots, were appointed as flight officers when the new rank was created. Some of the first eligible flight officers were Americans who had served as sergeant pilots in the [[Royal Air Force]] and who transferred to the USAAF after the U.S. entered the war.\n\nIn November 1942, the War Department defined the rank order as having warrant officers above all enlisted grades and below all commissioned grades. In March 1944, the first six women were appointed to the warrant officer grades as Band Leaders and administrative specialists.\n\nIn 1947, legislation was sought to introduce four grades of warrant officers. Proposed rank titles were: chief warrant officer, senior warrant officer, warrant officer first class, and warrant officer.\n\nIn 1949, {{USPL|81|351}}, the Career Compensation Act, created four pay grades, W-1 through W-4, for all the armed services. The two warrant ranks were unchanged, but warrant officer (junior grade) was pay grade W-1, while chief warrant officer started at W-2 and could advance to W-3 and -4.\n\nIn late 1949, the Warrant Officer Flight Program was created, which trained thousands of warrant officer pilots. The personnel were to be trained by the US Air Force, but controlled by the US Army Transportation Corps. The first helicopter pilot class was 51A (April 1951 to December 1951), which was trained to fly [[Sikorsky H-19 Chickasaw|H-19 Chickasaws]]. The program was temporarily cancelled in 1959 due to military budget cuts, but was reinstated in 1963 to meet the increased demand.\n\n{{multiple image\n| header   = U.S. Army Warrant Officer rank insignia from 1956 to 2004\n| width1   = 45\n| image1   = US Army WO-1 1950-1972.png\n| caption1 = WO1 (1956-1972)\n| width2   = 45\n| image2   = US Army CW-2 1950-1972.png\n| caption2 = CW2 (1956\u20131972)\n| width3   = 45\n| image3   = US Army CW-3 1950-1972.png\n| caption3 = CW3 (1956\u20131972)\n| width4   = 45\n| image4   = US Army CW-4 1950-1972.png\n| caption4 = CW4 (1956-1972)\n| width5   = 41\n| image5   = US-Army-CW5old.svg\n| caption5 = CW5 (1991\u20132004)\n}}\nIn 1954, the Warrant Officer Act, {{USPL|83|379}}, created separate ranks for each pay grade, W-1 through W-4. On 10 September 1956, AR 670-5 authorized the approved insignia for the new ranks that consisted of a metal frame around a brown enamel bar. The insignia for Warrant Officer 1 (Grade W-1) and Chief Warrant Officer 2 (Grade W-2) was a gold metal frame with one or two horizontal metal bands across it. Chief Warrant Officer 3 and Chief Warrant Officer 4 had a silver frame with one or two horizontal bands across it.\n\nDue to the demand for helicopter pilots in Vietnam, the number of warrant officer pilots grew from about 2,960 in 1966 to more than 12,000 by 1970. In 1973, a reduction in force began and chief warrant officer helicopter pilots were offered promotion to the rank of first lieutenant to retain combat veterans.\n\nOn 10 June 1970, the Army adopted a redesigned warrant officer insignia that was easier to identify. It was a silver bar with one to four black enamel squares on it (one per level of rank). \"In July 1972, Army Warrant Officers began wearing the newly designed silver rank insignia, with black squares...\"<ref>[https://warrantofficerhistory.org/Hist_of_Army_WO.htm#1950-1974 \"Army Warrant Officer History 1950\u20131974\"].

Candidates were drawn from Chief Warrant Officer 4s (CW4) who had attended a special course at the Warrant Officer school at Fort Rucker. The first class graduated in 8 December 1988. The Warrant Officer Management Act {{USPL|102|190}} of 5 December 1991, created the paygrade of W5 and the separate rank of Master Warrant Officer (CW5), since renamed as Chief Warrant Officer Five.\n\nOn 9 July 2004 the Warrant Officer Branch insignia (also known as the \"Eagle Rising\" or \"Squashed Bug\") was discontinued.<ref>[http://www.cavhooah.com/info/index.php/join-the-cav/warrant-officers/warrant-insignia/ \"Warrant officers to sport branch insignia\"] by Sgt. 1st Class Marcia Triggs.

Through progressive levels of expertise in assignments, training, and education, the warrant officer administers, manages, maintains, operates, and integrates Army systems and equipment across the full spectrum of Army operations. Warrant officers are innovative integrators of emerging technologies, dynamic teachers, confident warfighters, and developers of specialized teams of soldiers. They support a wide range of Army missions throughout their careers. Warrant officers in the Army are accessed with specific levels of technical ability. They refine their technical expertise and develop their leadership and management skills through tiered progressive assignment and education. The following are specific characteristics and responsibilities of the separate, successive warrant officer grades:\n\na. Warrant officer one (WO1) / chief warrant officer two (CW2): A WO1 is an officer appointed by warrant with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position given by the Secretary of the Army. CW2s and above are commissioned officers with the requisite authority pursuant to assignment level and position as given by the President of the United States. WO1's and CW2's primary focus is becoming proficient and working on those systems linked directly to their AOC/MOS, that is, their area of concentration (officer AOC), or an enlisted rank's military occupational specialty (MOS). Warrant officers are classified by warrant officer military occupational specialty, or WOMOS. As they become experts on the systems they operate and maintain, their focus migrates to integrating their systems with other branch systems.\n\nb. Chief warrant officer three (CW3): The CW3s are advanced level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, trainer, operator, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor. They also perform any other branch-related duties assigned to them. As they become more senior, their focus becomes integrating branch systems into larger Army systems. \n \nc. Chief warrant officer four (CW4): The CW4s are senior-level technical and tactical experts who perform the duties of technical leader, manager, maintainer, sustainer, integrator, and advisor and serve in a wide variety of branch level positions. As they become more senior, they focus on integrating branch and Army systems into joint and national-level systems. \n \nd. Chief warrant officer five (CW5): The CW5s are master-level technical and tactical experts who perform the primary duties of technical leader, manager, integrator, and advisor. They are the senior technical experts in their branches and serve at [[brigade]] and higher levels. They also serve as '''Command Chief Warrant Officers (CCWO)'''<ref name= ccwo>[https://www.army.mil/article/227507/smdc_command_chief_warrant_officer_discusses_role  Jason Cutshaw (September 20, 2019) SMDC command chief warrant officer discusses role]</ref> for large commands at the brigade level and higher.\n\nNote: Chief warrant officer six was approved by the Army Chief of Staff in 1970 with the anticipation of Congress approving two new grades, W-5 and W-6. However, Congress did not authorize W-5 until 1991 and as of January 2017 has not approved W-6. The original W-5 insignia consisted of a single silver bar superimposed with four equally spaced silver squares with each square bordered in black.

Those appointed would be selected from the noncommissioned officer ranks.\n\nOn 26 August 1916, Congress increased the Marine Corps strength, which included adding the rank of warrant officer; 43 Marine Gunners and 41 Quartermaster Clerks would be appointed. The first Marine Gunner is believed to have been [[Henry L. Hulbert]].<ref>Bevilacqua, Allan C. Major USMC (Ret) ''Henry Lewis Hurlbert-Marine Gunner'' ''Leatherneck'' Dec 2008 Vol XCI No 12</ref> On 22 May 1917, due to commissioned officer shortages, all but three of the appointees were commissioned as temporary second lieutenants. In 1918, the grade of pay clerk was added.\n\nIn June, 1926, Congress created the commissioned warrant grades of Chief Marine Gunner, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Requirements for promotion to chief warrant officer were six years of service as a warrant officer and an examination to qualify.\n\nDuring World War II, Congress abolished the titles of Marine Gunner, Chief Marine Gunner, Quartermaster Clerk, Chief Quartermaster Clerk, Pay Clerk, and Chief Pay Clerk. Instead, they would be designated warrant officer or commissioned warrant officer. In 1943, all Marine warrant officer ranks were aligned with the other services. They were warrant officer and commissioned warrant officer.\n\nThen in 1949, the grade of WO (paygrade W-1) was created for warrant officers and CWO-2, CWO-3, and CWO-4 (paygrades W-2, W-3, and W-4) were created for commissioned warrant officers. In 1954, title \"Chief Warrant Officer\" replaced \"commissioned warrant officer\" for those in grades CWO-2, CWO-3 and CWO-4.\n\nOn 1 February 1992, the grade of CWO-5 (paygrade W-5) was created and those who are appointed serve on the highest unit echelon levels. Only 5% of chief warrant officers occupy this grade.\n\n===Today===\nThe role and purpose of the Chief Warrant Officer in the United States Marine Corps fulfills the responsibilities as a high-rank 'Subject Matter Expert' within their chosen craft (military occupation specialty [MOS]), and the additional authority of a Commissioned Officer.\n\nThe Chief Warrant Officers commonly provide their respective Marine units and sections, valuable practical experience, and a master level of technical proficiency. Normally, a Unrestricted officer (2ndLt-General) would not have the opportunity to achieve such specialized skills due to their career progression track being more Commander-Centric and less MOS technical as they advance through the ranks.\n\nOnly active-duty enlisted (non-commissioned officers) are accepted into the program. Currently, there are two selection program distinctions, with each its own separate qualifications: administration-oriented or field-oriented.\n\nThe administrative Warrant Officer Selection Program requires a minimum of eight years of active-duty enlistment (not commissioned), proof and/or demonstration of their exceedingly technical proficiency within their MOS field, and achieved the rank and pay grade of Sergeant (E-5) or above.\n\n{{Multiple image\n|header    = U.S. Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officer 'Gunner' insignia\n|width     = 110\n|image1    = USMC CWO Gunner (Dress).png\n|image2    = USMC CWO Gunner (Black).png\n}}\n{{See also|Infantry Weapons Officer}}\n\nHowever, the duties of an [[Infantry Weapons Officer]] is much more demanding. The Infantry Weapons Officer Program requires a minimum of sixteen years in MOS 0300 (Infantry) and achieved at least the rank and grade of [[Gunnery Sergeant]] (E-7).\n\nWhen either Marine (administrative or field [infantry]) is selected for the program, they are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), conducted at [[The Basic School]], in [[Quantico, Virginia]].<ref name=\"marines\">[http://www.quantico.usmc.mil/Sentry/StoryView.aspx?SID=677 General Emphasizes Leadership at Warrant Officer Commissioning] 2nd Lt.

That warrant was considered a patent of trust and honor, but was not considered a commission to command. Since this first appointment, Navy warrant officers have held positions as surgeons, master mates, boatswains, carpenters, and chaplains.<ref name=\"WO-4\" /> Until 1912, a [[midshipman]] graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]] was required to have two years of sea duty as a warrant officer before receiving a commission as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref>Commission of ensign to graduates of the Naval Academy at end of four years' course, Pub.

McComas, US Naval Institute, Annapolis, MD, c2011</ref> However, the United States Navy experienced a similar issue of rank, where highly competent senior noncommissioned officers are required to report to inexperienced junior officers, giving rise to special status to the Navy's chief warrant officers.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn 1975, the Navy ceased using the rank of warrant officer 1 (WO-1), also known as pay grade W-1, because chief petty officers in pay grades E-7 and above with many years in service would lose pay when appointed to the rank of warrant officer.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The Navy appoints their warrant officers directly to the rank of CWO2 (i.e., as chief warrant officers), and are \"commissioned\" officers, with the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Personnel (NAVPERSCOM/BUPERS) managing all grades (CWO-2 through CWO-5) by [[Billet#United States usage|billet]]s appropriate for each rank. In past years, some CWOs resigned their warrant commission prior to retirement to receive greater retirement pay at their former senior enlisted rank.<ref>MILPERSMAN 15560.D, OPNAV 1811.3, OPNAV 1820.1</ref> However, this pay disparity has effectively disappeared in recent years and all Navy CWOs now retire at the appropriate officer grade.\n\n====Flying chief warrant officer====\n[[File:US Navy 090910-N-6651N-007 Chief Warrant Officer Leighton DaCosta performs pre-flight set-up on a P-3 Orion during the platform-specific phase of his Chief Warrant Officer Flight Training program at Patrol Squadron (VP) 30.jpg|thumb|left|250px|CWO2 DaCosta performs pre-flight setup on a [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] during the platform phase of the CWO Flight Training Program, circa 2009]]\nThe Navy started a test program called the \"Flying Chief Warrant Officer Program\" in 2006 to acquire additional [[naval aviator]]s (pilots) and [[naval flight officer]]s (NFOs), who would fly naval aircraft, but who would not compete with traditional [[unrestricted line]] (URL) officers in [[naval aviation]] for eventual command of squadrons, air wings, air stations, etc., the numbers of such commands which had been greatly reduced in the post-[[Cold War]] era, thereby limiting the command opportunity for URL pilots and NFOs.\n\nEnlisted sailors in the grades E-5 through E-7 who had at least an associate degree and were not currently serving in the diver, master-at-arms, nuclear, SEAL, SWCC, or EOD communities were eligible to apply. Upon being commissioned as CWO2, selectees underwent warrant officer indoctrination and then flight school for 18 to 30 months. After completion of flight school, selectees were placed in one of four types of squadrons: Shipbased Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) or Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons, and land-based fixed-wing maritime patrol and reconnaissance (VP) and fleet air reconnaissance (VQ). These pilots and NFOs were then trained to operate the [[Lockheed P-3 Orion|P-3 Orion]], the [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]], the [[Boeing E-6 Mercury|E-6 Mercury]], or variants of the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|MH-60 Seahawk]]. Those in the VP community would also eventually qualify to fly the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]] once that aircraft began replacing the P-3 in 2012. The Navy re-evaluated the program in 2011, when the last of the \"flying\" chief warrant officers reported to their operational fleet squadrons and opted to subsequently terminate the program.<ref name=\"WO-5\"/><ref name=\"public.navy.mil\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navytrng/a/navwarflight.htm |title=Flying CWO Program|accessdate=28 February 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Reestablishment of warrant officer one ===\n{{Annotated image\n| image = US Navy Cap Devices.png\n| image-width = 380\n| image-left = -29\n| image-top = -270\n| width = 180\n| height = 140\n| float = right\n| annotations =\n| caption = U.S. Navy Warrant Officer\u2013One combination cover device\n}}\nOn 4 June 2018, the [[Chief of Naval Operations]] announced the reestablishment of the rank of warrant officer one (pay grade W-1), for cyber warrant officers, and solicited applications for the rank/grade.<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\">[https://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/reference/messages/Documents/NAVADMINS/NAV2018/NAV18140.txt  MODIFICATION OF THE NAVY CYBER WARRANT OFFICER PROGRAM], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], 2018-06-04</ref> These warrant officers will receive their appointment via warrant and not via [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]].<ref name=\"2018-06-04_CNO\"/> They will incur a six-year service obligation once promoted to W-1.

The USAF inherited warrant officer ranks from the Army at its inception in 1947, but their place in the Air Force structure was never made clear. When Congress authorized the creation of two new senior enlisted ranks in each of the five services in 1958 (implementing them in 1959-60), Air Force officials privately concluded that these two new \"super grades\" of [[senior master sergeant]] and [[chief master sergeant]] (styling the incumbents as \"[[Air Force Specialty Code#Enlisted AFSCs|superintendents]]\" vice senior or staff NCOICs as does the USA{{not a typo}} and USMC) could fill all Air Force needs then performed at the warrant officer level. This was not publicly acknowledged until years later. The Air Force stopped appointing warrant officers in 1959.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\nThe last active-duty air force chief warrant officer, CWO4 James H. Long, retired in 1980. The last [[Air Force Reserve Command|Air Force Reserve]] chief warrant officer, CWO4 Bob Barrow, retired in 1992. Upon his retirement, Barrow was honorarily promoted to CWO5, the only person in the Air Force ever to hold this grade.<ref name=\"WO-5\" />\n\n==Coast Guard==\n[[File:US Coast Guard Warrant Officer Specialty Markings-Collar.png|thumb|475px|United States Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer specialty insignia (collar devices)]] Due to the small and decentralized nature of the service, Coast Guard Warrant Officers often fill command roles. Warrant Officers may serve as officers-in-charge of [[Coast Guard Stations]], or even as Command warrant officers. Chief Warrant officers fill a variety of [[billet#United States usage|billets]] as they can command larger small boat stations and patrol boats, as specialists and supervisors in other technical areas, and as special agents in the [[Coast Guard Investigative Service]]. They wear insignia essentially like that of their Navy counterparts, but with the USCG shield between the rank insignia and the specialty mark, as Coast Guard commissioned officers do with their rank insignia. Like their Navy counterparts, candidates for the rank of chief warrant officer must typically be serving in the chief petty officer grades (E-7 through E-9), however, the Coast Guard also permits selection of first class petty officers (E-6) who are chief petty officer selectees and who are in the top 50% on their advancement list to E-7.  The Coast Guard does not use the rank of warrant officer (WO-1). Although authorized in 1994, the Coast Guard does not currently use or have any active CWO5 grade.<ref>United States Coast Guard.

His family had origins in Navan, County Meath in [[Ireland]], but was domiciled in then [[Burma]] (a part of British India). He was one of two domiciled European officers serving in the Independent Indian Army, the other being [[T. B. Henderson Brooks]].\n\nHe had a brother, [[Commander]] [[Charles Nugent Lentaigne]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], who commanded [[HMS Gurkha (F63/G63)]], launched in July 1940, by Mary, daughter of [[Winston Churchill]]. The ship was originally to be named ''Larne''; however, after the Tribal-class ''Gurkha'' was sunk in April 1940, the officers and men of the Gurkha Regiments each subscribed one day's pay to replace her, and ''Larne'' was renamed before launching. Whilst escorting a Malta convoy, the ship  was torpedoed 17 January 1942 off Sidi Barani and later scuttled.\n\n==Military Career==\nWalter Lentaigne joined [[British Indian Army]] as [[Second Lieutenant]] in October 1918 in [[4th Gurkha Rifles]].

Took part in the retreat from Burma, into India. Better described in \"British Commanders\" Published June 1945 by British Information Services in the US as commanding a battalion which was landed in Burma in time to take part in General Alexander's battling withdrawal. He soon gained a legendary name for bravery. \"Once this bespectacled giant had his revolver kicked out of his hand in a hand-to-hand scrap with four Japs. He tore the sword from the leader's hand and killed him with it; then, turning on the others, hewed one to the ground and chased the other two back into the jungle. Another time, when the japanese had captured an ambulance convoy, a wounded officer in one of them heard a noise which he described as like the roaring of the Bull of Bashan. It was Joe Lentaigne arriving. He had charged ahead of his Gurkhas and arrived first, killing several Japs before they caught up with him. The ambulances were saved.\"\n** 1943 Temporarily commanded [[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]] in [[Imphal]], India. Subsequently, raised [[111th Indian Infantry Brigade]], a Long Range Penetration formation.\n** 1944 Led 111 Brigade in [[Chindits#Operation Thursday|Operation Thursday]], the second Chindit operation. On 24 March 1944 succeeded to command of Special Force / 3rd Indian Infantry Division, on the death of Major General Orde Wingate in an air crash.

He was appointed by General Wavell in the spring of 1943 to raise 111th Indian Brigade as a second Chindit Brigade. Because Wingate was in Burma conducting the Chindit operation (Operation ''Longcloth''), he was unable to influence the choice. Wingate's dislike of Indian Army officers and in particular officers of Gurkha battalions also worked against Lentaigne. He objected to the appointment after he learned of it but was unable to do anything about it.\n\nOn Wingate's death, Lentaigne took over command of the Chindit organization. He was the senior most officer in the Chindits and also had the most command experience. [[General]] [[William Slim|Slim]] described the problems involved in replacing Wingate within the Chindits: 'To step into Wingate's place would be no easy task. His successor had to be someone known to the men of Special Force, one who had shared their hardships and in whose skill and courage they could trust'.\nAgain, \"British Commanders\" states \"the inevitable choice for the new chief of the Chindits was Major General Lentaigne. He was one of Wingate's closest disciples and a veteran of the Burma fighting.\"\n\nAmongst his rivals for the position including [[Mike Calvert]] and [[Derek Tulloch]] there was criticism of this decision. They alleged that Lentaigne was the Chindit leader least in tune with Wingate's methods and tactics. They also pointed out that he had commanded 111 Indian Brigade in the field for only a few weeks. After the war, certain of his rivals used the comments of his Brigade Major [[John Masters]] with regard to Lentaigne's age out of context to attack him.\n\nLentaigne had been a distinguished battalion commander who had fought during the 1942 Burma campaign. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities lacking Staff College qualifications or significant time in command of even a battalion-sized formation. Additionally, there was no clear successor to Wingate even among his closest followers. Each of them thought that they would have been (or were) Wingate's obvious successor. Field Marshal Lord Slim wrote in his memoirs of the Burma War, [[Defeat into Victory]], that after Wingate's death, at least three officers went to him, and told him, separately and confidentially, that Wingate had designated each of them as the divisional commander, in the event of his death.\n\n==Post-war career==\nIn his book ''Red Coats to Olive Green'', Colonel V Longer has listed Lentaigne as one of the handful of British general officers to be offered attachment to, and service in, the post-independence Indian Army. Among the others were General Sir Rob Lockhart, Lt-Gen Sir [[Dudley Russell]], and Maj-Gen H Williams, who, as engineer-in-chief, was the last to retire, late in 1955. He was  acting Director Military Operations but was eased out as he proposed a 25-mile border corridor in Punjab under British troops to save innocent people.(Ref. Transfer of Power,8 Aug 1947 meeting) Nehru opposed him tooth and nail and was overruled by Mountbatten. In February 1948, he was asked to lead Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington in the Nilgiris in what's now the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In 1950, he predicted problems for India after conquest of Tibet by China and sparred with visiting foreign secretary of India at Wellington. (Ref. Himalayan Blunder by [[John Dalvi]]). He would serve as the Commandant DSSC Wellington from 1948-1955.  He retired in 1955 and died soon after returning to London.\n\n==See also==\n* [[John Masters]], brigade major and subsequent commander of 111 Indian Infantry Brigade\n* [[Joseph Stilwell]], American general\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/locreg/LENTAIGNE.html Lentaigne's entry] in the [[Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives]]\n* [http://www.generals.dk/general/Lentaigne/Walter_David_Alexander/Great_Britain.html Lentaigne's entry] at [[Generals.dk]]\n* [http://www.chindits.info/index.html Official website] for The [[Chindits]]\n* Biography of Lieutenant General Walter David Alexander LENTAIGNE at www.BritishMilitaryHistory.co.uk [http://www.britishmilitaryhistory.co.uk/documents.php?aid=119&nid=16&start=10]\n* [[Surgeon General of the United States|Office of the US Surgeon General]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20041015212334/http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/CrisisFleeting/frameindex.html ''Office of Medical History'']: [http://history.amedd.army.mil/booksdocs/wwii/CrisisFleeting/bookfour.htm ''Book 4, With Wingate's Chindits'']\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{succession box\n| title = [[Commandant of the Defence Services Staff College]]\n| years = 1948 - 1955\n| before = [[Brigadier]] S D Verma\n| after = [[Major General]] P S Gyani\n}}\n|-\n{{succession box\n| title = Commander [[Chindits]]\n| years = 1944 - 1945\n| before = [[Orde Wingate]]\n| after = Unit disbanded\n}}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lentaigne, Walter}}\n[[Category:1899 births]]\n[[Category:1955 deaths]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Third Anglo-Afghan War]]\n[[Category:Indian Army generals of World War II]]\n[[Category:British military personnel of the Waziristan Campaign]]\n[[Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the Royal College of Defence Studies]]\n[[Category:Lentaigne family|Walter]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=April 2018}}\n{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}\n{{more footnotes|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n{{Infobox military person\n| honorific_prefix = [[Lieutenant General]]\n| name          = W D A Lentaigne\n| honorific_suffix = [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]]\n| native_name   = \n| native_name_lang = \n| image         = File:The Chindits IND3426.jpg\n| image_size    = 200px\n| alt           = \n| caption       = \n| birth_date    = <!-- {{birth date and age|df=yes|YYYY|MM|DD}} or {{birth date|df=yes|YYYY|MM|DD}} if dead -->\n| death_date    = <!-- {{Death date and age|df=yes|YYYY|MM|DD|YYYY|MM|DD}} death date first, then birth date -->\n| birth_place   = \n| death_place   = \n| placeofburial = \n| placeofburial_label = \n| placeofburial_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|display=inline,title}} -->\n| nickname      = \n| birth_name    = \n| allegiance = {{flag|British India}}<br> {{flag|India}}\n| branch = {{army|British India}}<br>{{army|India}}\n| serviceyears  = \n| rank          = [[File:Lieutenant General of the Indian Army.svg|22px]] [[Lieutenant General]]\n| servicenumber = \n| unit          = [[4th Gorkha Rifles]]\n| commands      = [[39th Infantry Division (India)|39th Infantry Division]]<br/>[[Chindits]]<br/>[[111th Indian Infantry Brigade]]<br/>[[63rd Indian Infantry Brigade]]<br/>[[4th Gurkha Rifles|1/4 Gurkha Rifles]]\n| battles       = [[World War II]]\n| battles_label = \n| awards        = [[File:Order_of_the_Bath_UK_ribbon.svg|20px]] [[Order of the Bath]]<br/>[[File:Order_of_the_British_Empire_(Military)_Ribbon.png|20px]] [[Order of the British Empire]]<br/>[[File:Dso-ribbon.svg|20px]] [[Distinguished Service Order]]\n| spouse        = \n| relations     = \n| laterwork     = \n| signature     = \n| website       = \n| other_name    = \n| memorials     = \n| signature_size = \n| signature_alt = \n| module\n}}\n[[Lieutenant General]] '''Walter David Alexander 'WDA' Lentaigne''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] (15 July 1899 \u2013 24 June 1955), (also known as ''Joe Lentaigne'') was a [[General Officer]] in the [[British Indian Army]] and later in the [[Indian Army]].\n \n==Early Life==\nHe was born the elder son of Justice Benjamin Plunkett Lentaigne of the Burma High Court and educated at the Oratory School, [[Edgbaston]], [[Birmingham]]. His family had origins in Navan, County Meath in [[Ireland]], but was domiciled in then [[Burma]] (a part of British India). He was one of two domiciled European officers serving in the Independent Indian Army, the other being [[T. B. Henderson Brooks]].\n\nHe had a brother, [[Commander]] [[Charles Nugent Lentaigne]], [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]], who commanded [[HMS Gurkha (F63/G63)]], launched in July 1940, by Mary, daughter of [[Winston Churchill]]. The ship was originally to be named ''Larne''; however, after the Tribal-class ''Gurkha'' was sunk in April 1940, the officers and men of the Gurkha Regiments each subscribed one day's pay to replace her, and ''Larne'' was renamed before launching. Whilst escorting a Malta convoy, the ship  was torpedoed 17 January 1942 off Sidi Barani and later scuttled.\n\n==Military Career==\nWalter Lentaigne joined [[British Indian Army]] as [[Second Lieutenant]] in October 1918 in [[4th Gurkha Rifles]].

He appeared in a local bar, the D&G Tavern, armed with an [[M1 Garand]] rifle and bayonet, and later threatened to kill Bowenkamp.<ref name=\"mcclatchydc1\"/><ref name=\"autogenerated1988\"/> The next day, McElroy was shot to death in broad daylight as he sat with his wife Trena in his pickup truck on Skidmore's main street.<ref name=\"trutv1\"/> He was struck by bullets from at least two different firearms, in front of a crowd of people estimated as between 30 and 46.<ref name=\"mcclatchydc1\"/> To date, no one has been charged in connection with McElroy's death.<ref name=\"mcclatchydc1\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nMcElroy was born in 1934, the fifteenth of sixteen children born to a poor, migrant tenant-farming couple named Tony and Mabel (n\u00e9e Lister) McElroy, who had moved between [[Kansas]] and the [[Ozark Mountains|Ozarks]] before settling outside of Skidmore. He dropped out of school at age 15 in the eighth grade and quickly established a local reputation as a [[raccoon]] hunter, cattle rustler, small-time thief and womanizer. For more than two decades, McElroy was suspected of being involved in theft of grain, gasoline, alcohol, antiques and livestock, but he avoided conviction when charges were brought against him 21 times&mdash;often after witnesses refused to testify because he allegedly intimidated them, frequently by following his targets or parking outside their homes and watching them. He was represented by defense attorney Richard Gene McFadin of [[Gallatin, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/2.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606153040/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/2.html|archive-date=2009-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMcElroy fathered more than 10 children with different women. He met his last wife, Trena McCloud (1957\u20132012), when she was 12 years old and in eighth grade. She became pregnant when she was fourteen, dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and went to live with McElroy and his third wife Alice. McElroy divorced Alice and married Trena in order to escape charges of statutory rape, to which she was the only witness. Sixteen days after Trena gave birth, both she and Alice fled to Trena's mother's and stepfather's house. According to court records, McElroy tracked them down and brought them back. He then returned to Trena's parents' home when they were away, shot the family dog, and burned down the house.<ref name=\"trutv2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/8.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Another Teen Love|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602001233/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/8.html|archive-date=2009-06-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Events prior to his killing==\nBased on Trena's story, McElroy was indicted in June 1973 for arson, assault and statutory rape. He was arrested, booked, arraigned and released on $2,500 bail.<ref name=\"trutv2\"/> Trena and her baby were placed in foster care at a home in [[Maryville, Missouri]]. McElroy sat outside the foster home for hours at a time staring at it.  He told the foster family that he would trade \"girl for girl\" to get his child back, since he knew where the foster family's biological daughter went to school and what bus route she rode. Additional charges were filed against McElroy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/9.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Saved by the Law|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106152111/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/9.html|archive-date=2010-01-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nOn July 27, 1976, Skidmore farmer Romaine Henry said McElroy shot him twice with a shotgun after Henry challenged him for shooting weapons on Henry's property. McElroy was charged with assault with intent to kill. McElroy denied he was at the scene. As the case dragged on without a court date, Henry said McElroy had parked outside his home at least 100 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/11.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Intent to Kill|publisher=Trutv.com|date=1976-07-27|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606153327/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/11.html|archive-date=2009-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref> At the trial, two raccoon hunters testified they were with McElroy the day of the shooting away from Henry's property. Henry was forced to admit in court, under questioning by McElroy's attorney Richard Gene McFadin, that he had concealed his own petty criminal conviction from more than 30 years previous.<ref name=\"autogenerated1988\"/> McElroy was acquitted.\n\n==1981 killing==\nIn 1980, one of McElroy's children got into an argument with a clerk, Evelyn Sumy, in a local grocery store owned by 70-year-old Ernest \"Bo\" Bowenkamp and his wife, Lois, allegedly because a younger McElroy child tried to steal some candy. McElroy began stalking the Bowenkamp family, and eventually threatened Bo Bowenkamp in the back of his store with a shotgun in hand. In the ensuing confrontation, McElroy shot Bowenkamp in the neck; Bowenkamp survived, and McElroy was arrested and charged with attempted murder.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h9rI-d5_24&t=110s</ref> McElroy was convicted at trial of assault, but freed on bail pending his appeal. Immediately after being released at a post-trial hearing, McElroy went to the D&G Tavern, a local bar, with an [[M1 Garand]] rifle with a [[bayonet]] attached, and made graphic threats about what he would do to Bo Bowenkamp. This led to several patrons deciding to see what they could legally do to prevent McElroy from harming anyone else. [[Nodaway County]] Sheriff Dan Estes suggested they form a [[neighborhood watch]].\n\nMcElroy's appeal hearing was again delayed. On the morning of July 10, 1981, townspeople met at the Legion Hall in the center of town with [[Sheriff]] Estes to discuss how to protect themselves. During the meeting, McElroy arrived at the D&G Tavern with Trena. As he sat drinking at the bar, word got back to the men at the Legion Hall that he was in town. Sheriff Estes instructed the assembled group not to get into a direct confrontation with McElroy, but instead seriously consider forming a neighborhood watch program. Estes then drove out of town in his police cruiser. The citizens decided to go to the tavern [[en masse]]. The bar soon filled completely. After McElroy finished his drinks, he purchased a six pack of beer, left the bar, and entered his pickup truck. Someone shot at McElroy while he was sitting in his truck. He was shot at several times and hit twice, once by a centerfire rifle and once by a .22 rimfire rifle. In all, there were 46 potential witnesses to the shooting, including Trena McElroy, who was in the truck with her husband when he was shot. No one called for an ambulance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/29/99817/3-decades-on-who-killed-skidmores.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830144638/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/29/99817/3-decades-on-who-killed-skidmores.html |archive-date=2010-08-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> Only Trena claimed to identify a gunman; every other witness either was unable to name an assailant or claimed not to have seen who fired the fatal shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/4.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Murder in Broad Daylight|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602001231/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/4.html|archive-date=2009-06-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The DA declined to press charges.

He dropped out of school at age 15 in the eighth grade and quickly established a local reputation as a [[raccoon]] hunter, cattle rustler, small-time thief and womanizer. For more than two decades, McElroy was suspected of being involved in theft of grain, gasoline, alcohol, antiques and livestock, but he avoided conviction when charges were brought against him 21 times&mdash;often after witnesses refused to testify because he allegedly intimidated them, frequently by following his targets or parking outside their homes and watching them. He was represented by defense attorney Richard Gene McFadin of [[Gallatin, Missouri]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/2.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606153040/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/2.html|archive-date=2009-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nMcElroy fathered more than 10 children with different women. He met his last wife, Trena McCloud (1957\u20132012), when she was 12 years old and in eighth grade. She became pregnant when she was fourteen, dropped out of school in the ninth grade, and went to live with McElroy and his third wife Alice. McElroy divorced Alice and married Trena in order to escape charges of statutory rape, to which she was the only witness. Sixteen days after Trena gave birth, both she and Alice fled to Trena's mother's and stepfather's house. According to court records, McElroy tracked them down and brought them back. He then returned to Trena's parents' home when they were away, shot the family dog, and burned down the house.<ref name=\"trutv2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/8.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Another Teen Love|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602001233/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/8.html|archive-date=2009-06-02|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Events prior to his killing==\nBased on Trena's story, McElroy was indicted in June 1973 for arson, assault and statutory rape. He was arrested, booked, arraigned and released on $2,500 bail.<ref name=\"trutv2\"/> Trena and her baby were placed in foster care at a home in [[Maryville, Missouri]]. McElroy sat outside the foster home for hours at a time staring at it.  He told the foster family that he would trade \"girl for girl\" to get his child back, since he knew where the foster family's biological daughter went to school and what bus route she rode.

As the case dragged on without a court date, Henry said McElroy had parked outside his home at least 100 times.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/11.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Intent to Kill|publisher=Trutv.com|date=1976-07-27|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606153327/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/11.html|archive-date=2009-06-06|url-status=live}}</ref> At the trial, two raccoon hunters testified they were with McElroy the day of the shooting away from Henry's property.

McElroy began stalking the Bowenkamp family, and eventually threatened Bo Bowenkamp in the back of his store with a shotgun in hand. In the ensuing confrontation, McElroy shot Bowenkamp in the neck; Bowenkamp survived, and McElroy was arrested and charged with attempted murder.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8h9rI-d5_24&t=110s</ref> McElroy was convicted at trial of assault, but freed on bail pending his appeal. Immediately after being released at a post-trial hearing, McElroy went to the D&G Tavern, a local bar, with an [[M1 Garand]] rifle with a [[bayonet]] attached, and made graphic threats about what he would do to Bo Bowenkamp. This led to several patrons deciding to see what they could legally do to prevent McElroy from harming anyone else. [[Nodaway County]] Sheriff Dan Estes suggested they form a [[neighborhood watch]].\n\nMcElroy's appeal hearing was again delayed. On the morning of July 10, 1981, townspeople met at the Legion Hall in the center of town with [[Sheriff]] Estes to discuss how to protect themselves. During the meeting, McElroy arrived at the D&G Tavern with Trena. As he sat drinking at the bar, word got back to the men at the Legion Hall that he was in town. Sheriff Estes instructed the assembled group not to get into a direct confrontation with McElroy, but instead seriously consider forming a neighborhood watch program. Estes then drove out of town in his police cruiser. The citizens decided to go to the tavern [[en masse]]. The bar soon filled completely. After McElroy finished his drinks, he purchased a six pack of beer, left the bar, and entered his pickup truck. Someone shot at McElroy while he was sitting in his truck. He was shot at several times and hit twice, once by a centerfire rifle and once by a .22 rimfire rifle. In all, there were 46 potential witnesses to the shooting, including Trena McElroy, who was in the truck with her husband when he was shot. No one called for an ambulance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/29/99817/3-decades-on-who-killed-skidmores.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830144638/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/08/29/99817/3-decades-on-who-killed-skidmores.html |archive-date=2010-08-30 |url-status=live }}</ref> Only Trena claimed to identify a gunman; every other witness either was unable to name an assailant or claimed not to have seen who fired the fatal shots.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/4.html|title=Ken McElroy Murderer, rapist and consummate intimidator \u2014 Murder in Broad Daylight|publisher=Trutv.com|accessdate=2010-09-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090602001231/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/classics/ken_mcelroy/4.html|archive-date=2009-06-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The DA declined to press charges.
