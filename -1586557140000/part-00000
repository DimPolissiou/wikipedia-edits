The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has 3 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''1.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''2.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''3.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

The dirt roof had to be compacted which required stomping the dirt hard in a uniform way to compact it evenly. This event of cooperation is called ''ta'awon'' and from here comes the word ''awneh'', meaning \"help.\" This developed into the song ''Ala Dalouna'' ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0644\u0649 \u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627}}), roughly translated, \"let's go and help\". The Dabke and the rhythmic songs go together in an attempt to keep the work fun and the workers energetic.\nAccording to Yazbec, the Canaanites and Phoenicians were the first teachers of the dance in the world, and the dabke is a representative descendant of the Phoenician dances.<ref name=\"Dabke Origin\">{{cite book|title=The Arab World, Volume 8|date=1962|publisher=Arab Information Center|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=rbcwU7nSAcKfyQHZlIHoBw&id=HlbVAAAAMAAJ&dq=}}</ref>\n\n==Variations==\n\nIn levant there are around 19 types of The  Dabke and many of them are performed in Palestine, jordan  Syria and Lebanon. But Lebanon has 3 variations of Dabke native to specific villages in Lebanon only. Different Levantine types include but are not limited to:<ref name=\"allofjo.net\"/>\n\n<br />\n\n* \n\n'''1.Daloonah''' is the most common variation and it's Native to Mount Lebanon. It comprises six beats and is typically accompanied by a ''minjeira'' or ''mizmar'' (types of flutes) and the ''tabel'' (drum). Clapping is used to add joy to the festivities.\n\n'''2.Ra\u2019asit el Aarjah''' (limping dance) is native to Baalbeck. It is slower than the common ''dabke'' as it comprises 12 beats. The music is usually a combination of ''minjeira'' or ''mijwiz'' or ''rabehbeh'' (violin-like instrument) and ''tabel''. Any combination can also be accompanied by clapping.\n\n'''3.Metalteh''' is characteristic of Barja, a southern village in Lebanon . It is composed of 16 beats and the music is a mix of ''minjeira'' and ''tabel''.\n\n<br />\n{{Div col}}\n* ''' Habel Mwadea\u2019 ''' '''(\u062d\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u062f\u0639)''': is the Jordanian dabke of any type performed by men and women jointly.<ref name=\"allofjo.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allofjo.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12074:2011-05-21-20-17-50&catid=51:2010-06-06-04-19-21&Itemid=263 |title=\u0643\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0646 |website=Allofjo.net |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref> \n* '''Al-Karaadiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0643\u0631\u0627\u062f\u064a\u0629)'' also known as ''Al-Taiyyara'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0637\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629)'': It is on of the most famous types of dabke in Jordan, it is characterized by its fast rhythm in an open circle.

It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ''(\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d)'' at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\">\u0647\u0634\u0627\u0645 \u0639\u0627\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f \u0648\u0645\u0623\u0645\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f. \u0641\u0648\u0643\u0644\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0633 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0646\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628\u064a: \u0644\u064a\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0646\u0627>.\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u0631\u0627\u062b \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0644\u0633\u0637\u064a\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644.</ref>\n* '''Al-\u2019Askariyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0633\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0629)'': \n* '''Al-Joufiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0648\u0641\u064a\u0629)'': it consists of two groups stand in opposition to each other: the first group sings and the second responses with Jordanian folkloric songs.\n* '''Al-Ghawarneh''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u063a\u0648\u0627\u0631\u0646\u0629)'' also known as ''Deir \u2019Ala''  ''(\u062f\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0644\u0627)'': performed in [[Jordan Valley]], and it's one of the fastest types of dabke.\n* '''Wahad w Nos''' ''(\u0648\u0627\u062d\u062f \u0648\u0646\u0635)''\n* '''Abu \u2019Alanda''' ''(\u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0639\u0644\u0646\u062f\u0647)''\n* '''Al-Aqabawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Aqaba]] in South Jordan.\n* '''Al-Ramthawiyya''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u062b\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': It is performed in [[Ramtha]] in North Jordan.\n* '''Al-Sahja''' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u062d\u062c\u0629)'' : is a popular Palestinian and Jordanian dance which became significantly more popular during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]].

Another type is the ''dabke niswaniyyah'', danced specifically by women. Each type of dabke dance has its own corresponding set of songs, the theme of which is often love.<ref name=Cohenp271>Cohen, Katz, 2006, pp. 271\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThere are six main types of dabke:\n\n# ''Al-Shamaliyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0645\u0627\u0644\u064a\u0629)'': is probably the most famous type of dabke. It consists of a ''lawweeh'' ''(\u0644\u0648\u064a\u062d)'' at the head of a group of men holding hands and formed in a semicircle. The ''lawweeh'' is expected to be particularly skilled in accuracy, ability to improvise, and quickness (generally light on his feet). Typically, the dabke begins with a musician playing a solo on the ''mijwiz'' or ''yarghoul'' of a ''Dal Ouna'' piece, often with two singers accompanying his music. The dancers develop a synchronized movement and step and when the singers finish their song, the ''lawweeh'' breaks from the semicircle to dance on his own. When the leader of the dabke sees that the men's steps are one, in sync, he instructs the dancers to slow down and begin a movement crossing their right foot in front of the opposite one (their left foot). The ''lawweeh'' continues to inform the dancers of their basic rhythms, and at this point other guests at the wedding or event occurring will join in the dabke line. This is the most popular and familiar form of dabke danced for happy family celebrations, such as weddings, circumcisions, the return of travelers, release of prisoners, and also for national holidays, in which dabke becomes a demonstration of national personality.<ref name=\"layla\"/>\n# ''Al-Sha\u2019rawiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629)'': is limited to men and is characterized by strong steps or stomps.

Al-Sahja belongs mostly to northern and central Palestine, and in the south has two kinds: As-Samir ''(\u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0645\u0631)'' and Al-Dahiyya ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)''.

''Al-Sahja'' usually occurs the night before the wedding party of the groom (''zafat al-'arees''), with most of the men in the village participating, especially those who will be attending or are directly involved in the other wedding festivities.\n\nThe ''Oxford International Encyclopedia of Dance'' also mentions these additional kinds of line dances in its entry under \"Middle East\":\n\n<blockquote>The ''Murdah'' was originally performed by women in [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]] while the men of the community were away on extended fishing and pearling expeditions. It involves two lines of dancers who move toward each other with small steps and then retreat while singing rhymed couplets. These couplets were largely laments for absent loved ones. Although seafaring is no longer economically important in the region, women continue to perform this dance at social gatherings.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The ''Ahwash'' (Fr., ahouache) performed by Berber tribes of the Moroccan High Atlas Mountains, includes one or several curved lines of men and one or several curved lines of women, the whole forming a circle or ellipse around male drummers (Jouad and Lortat-Jacob, 1978; Lortat-Jacob, 1980). One line recites a poem that the other line responds to with another poem; then all move to the beat of the drums. Customarily, the whole community participates. While performing, women dancers hold themselves very straight and move with staccato steps, holding onto the weaving rod of the house. Women as well as men compose the poetry that is recited. A similar dance reported for Morocco is the dukkala. In one variation a man and woman facing each other compete to see which one can dance the longest (Mercier, 1927).<ref>[http://0-www.oxfordreference.com.library.lausys.georgetown.edu/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t171.e1157.s0001&srn=2&ssid=1017131773#FIRSTHIT ]{{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Song genres==\nThere are numerous kinds of songs that are sung during and specifically for dabke, by both men and women respectively, depending on the occasion, song, and audience. Some of the most popular of these songs, such as ''Dal Ouna'' ''(\u062f\u0644\u0639\u0648\u0646\u0627)'', ''Al Jafra'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0641\u0631\u0627)'', ''Al Dahiyya'' ''(\u0627\u0644\u062f\u062d\u064a\u0629)'', and ''Zareef il-Tool'' ''(\u0638\u0631\u064a\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0648\u0644)'', are actually entire genres in themselves, in the sense that lyrics can vary significantly in each performance but the basic rhythm of the music is consistent and recognizable. This variation can be seen in the hundreds of lyrical variations heard and recorded of these songs which regardless of specific lyrics, are recognized by their rhythm and at times, a single phrase, as in ''Ala Dal Ouna, Jafra'', and others. For example, even though one might have heard ''Ala Dal Ouna'' sung previously telling a different story in this famous love song, people will still call another song ascribing to the same rhythm and theme as ''Dal Ouna''.<ref>\u0648\u0644\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u064a\u0639, \u0639\u0628\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0632\u064a\u0632 \u0627\u0628\u0648\u0647\u0630\u0628\u0627, \u0639\u0645\u0631 \u062d\u0645\u062f\u0627\u0646, \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0627\u062d\u0645\u062f. <u>\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0631\u0645\u0633\u0639\u064a\u0627</u>. \"\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0635\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u2013 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0627\u0646\u064a\".</ref>\n\nThe majority of dabke music, being folk songs, is on [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] [[Bayati (maqam)|Bayati]] musical mode.\n\n==Instruments==\nThe [[Oud]] ''(\u0639\u0648\u062f)'', from which the English word \"lute\" comes,  is shaped like half a pear with a short non-fretted neck. It has six courses of two strings and played with a plectrum, usually a trimmed eagle's feather. This instrument creates a deep and mellow sound.\n\nThe [[mijwiz]] ''(\u0645\u062c\u0648\u0632)'' which means \u201cdouble\u201d in Arabic is very popular in Levantine music. It is a type of reed clarinet that is played by breathing smoothly through a circular aperture at the end and by moving the fingers over the holes down the front of the tube in order to create the different notes. The minjjayrah is similar to the mijwiz, an open ended reed flute played in the same style.\n\nThe [[tablah]] ''(\u0637\u0628\u0644\u0629)'' is a small hand-drum also known as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, etched metal, or paintings in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played of the percussion instruments; the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats. Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.\n\nThe [[daf]]f ''(\u062f\u0641)'', also known as the [[Riq]] ''(\u0631\u0642)'', is similar to the tambourine. It consists of a round frame, covered on one side with goat or fish skin. Pairs of metal discs are set into the frame to produce the jingle when struck by the hand. The sounds of this percussion instrument set the rhythm of much Arab music, particularly in the performances of classical pieces.<ref>Badley, Bill and Zein al Jundi. \"Europe Meets Asia\". 2000.

Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}</ref>\n\nThe [[arghul]], ''(\u064a\u0631\u063a\u0648\u0644)'' also known as the ''yarghoul'', is commonly used in solos, often accompanied by singers, that begin dabke performances. Unlike the ''mijwiz'', it only has finger holes in one of its pipes/reeds. (see ''Al-Shamaliyya'', under Types).\n\nThe Shubabeh, (<span lang=\"ar\" dir=\"ltr\">\u0634\u0628\u0627\u0628\u0629</span>) is a woodwind instrument traditionally made from reed cane. It differs from the Mijwiz and Arghul in that it does not have a reed, instead the musician blows against the side of the instrument at an angle to produce the tone. The Shubabeh is traditionally played by herders in the wilderness.\n\n==Performances and competitions==\n[[File:Palestinian Dabke.jpg|thumb|Men dancing dabke]]\n''Dabke'' competitions or shows  consist of different cultural dances and various troupes performing ''dabke.'' For example, the International Fiesta, a well known festival at the [[University at Buffalo]], consists of a series of clubs performing their cultural dances. This competition occurs every semester in the main stage theater of the [[UB Center for the Arts]] during the spring time, usually at the end of February or beginning of March. This allows the Organization of Arab Students to participate and show the cultural awareness of ''dabke''.\n\nMany universities host events called Arab Night or a title to that effect. When these shows occur, ''dabke'' is either performed on stage (inside or outside), in a hall on the floor, or outside on the floor. There are different steps that comprise the ''Dabke'' dance: the belbel, the inzel, shemmel and taxi; a combination of each of these steps as well as the occasional jump and turn make the dance complete.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabamericannews.com/news/index.php?mod=article&cat=Artamp;Culture&article=987 |title=Dabke appeals to Westerners, Arabs alike |website=Arabamericannews.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}</ref>\n\nIn America, the tradition has not been lost and is held in the same places as it would in the original homeland and the dance music is also commonly played in America at Arab-community cultural centers and conventions such as the annual convention hosted by the American Federation of Ramallah Palestine.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19970529223911/http://www.afrp.org/]</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn August 2011, a group in a Lebanese village [[Dhour El Choueir]], [[Lebanon]] set a new world record.

A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founders of the United States]] were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the [[American Civil War]], continuing to serve as the armed forces of the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]], although a number of its officers resigned to join the [[Military of the Confederate States of America|military of the Confederate States]]. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following [[World War II]] and during the [[Cold War]]'s onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]], headed by the secretary of defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.\n\nThe U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest militaries in terms of the number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]. Although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1973, but the [[Selective Service System]] retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18\u201325 register with the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sss.gov/About/Quick-Facts-and-Figures|title=Quick Facts and Figures|website=Sss.gov|accessdate=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141339/https://www.sss.gov/About/Quick-Facts-and-Figures|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On February 22, 2019, however, [[National Coalition for Men v.

The [[Continental Navy]], established on 13 October 1775, and [[Continental Marines]], established on 10 November 1775, were created in close succession by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in order to defend the new nation against the [[British Empire]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThese forces demobilized in 1784 after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the War for Independence. The [[Congress of the Confederation]] created the current [[United States Army]] on 3 June 1784. The [[United States Congress]] created the current [[United States Navy]] on 27 March 1794 and the current [[United States Marine Corps]] on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gave the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to \"raise and support armies\", to \"provide and maintain a navy\" and to \"make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces\", as well as the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. The [[President of the United States|president]] is the U.S. Armed Forces' [[commander-in-chief]].\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] traces its origin to the founding of the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] on 4 August 1790 which merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The [[United States Air Force]] was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]], which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] before becoming an independent service  as per the National Security Act of 1947. The [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] was formerly considered to be a branch of the United States Armed Forces from 29 July 1945 until its status as such was revoked on 3 July 1952.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |title=Veterans Preference and \"Wartime\" Service |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221456/https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |archive-date=21 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Space Force]] was established on 20 December 2019.

The Constitution presumes the existence of \"[[United States federal executive departments|executive Departments]]\" headed by \"[[Officer of the United States|principal officers]]\", whose appointment mechanism is provided for in the [[Appointments Clause]]. This allowance in the Constitution formed the basis for creation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1947 by the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]].

With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the [[Delayed Entry Program]] (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).\n\nAfter enlistment, new recruits undergo [[Recruit training|basic training]] (also known as \"boot camp\" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by schooling in their primary [[United States military occupation codes|Military Occupational Specialty]] (MOS), [[List of United States Navy ratings|rating]] and [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC) at any of the numerous training facilities around the United States. Each branch conducts basic training differently. The Marine Corps sends all non-infantry MOS's to an infantry skills course known as [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|Marine Combat Training]] prior to their technical schools. Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level. All Army recruits undergo [[Basic Combat Training]] (BCT), followed by [[Advanced Individual Training]] (AIT), with the exceptions of cavalry scouts, infantry, armor, combat engineers and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT. The Navy sends its recruits to Recruit Training and then to \"A\" schools to earn a rating. The Coast Guard's recruits attend basic training and follow with an \"A\" school to earn a [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]].\n\nInitially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1 and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training. Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and referring friends who go on to enlist as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.\n\nThere are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency or maintenance of good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.\n\n====Non-commissioned and petty officers====\nWith very few exceptions, becoming a [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) or [[petty officer]] in the U.S. Armed Forces is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service and are generally attained between three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.\n\nWhile considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as [[chief petty officer]]s in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16&nbsp;years of service.\n\n=====Senior enlisted advisors=====\nEach of the five services employs a single [[Senior Enlisted Advisor|senior enlisted advisor]] at departmental level. This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within that respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary, service chief and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force. These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to [[three-star rank|three-star]] [[general officer|general]] or [[flag officer]]s. They are as follows:\n\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE OR ELSEWHERE IN THE ARTICLE. Please read the talk page as to why. -->\n* [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]]\n* [[Sergeant Major of the Army]]\n* [[Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps]]\n* [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy]]\n* [[Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force]]\n* [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard]]\n\n====Warrant officers====\nAdditionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] corps. Above the rank of warrant officer one, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units. More recently, they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army helicopter and [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a warrant officer as a technical expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Warrant Officer Candidate School]] at [[Fort Rucker]], Alabama and then on to [[flight school]].\n\nWarrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers. They may attend the [[Military officers' club|officer's club]], receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members.\n\nThe Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the enlisted grades of E-8 and E-9 were created. Most non-flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force.\n\n====Commissioned officers====\nOfficers receive a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in one of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces through one of the following routes.\n* [[United States Service academies|Service academies]] ([[United States Military Academy]], [[United States Naval Academy]], [[United States Air Force Academy]], [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]])\n* [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC)\n* [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) ([[Officer Training School]] (OTS) in the Air Force): this can be through active-duty schools, or through state-run schools in the case of the Army National Guard.\n* [[Direct commission officer|Direct commission]]: civilians who have special skills that are critical to sustaining military operations and supporting troops may receive direct commissions. These officers occupy leadership positions in law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, intelligence, supply-logistics-transportation, engineering, public affairs, chaplain, [[oceanography]] and others.\n* [[Battlefield commission]]: under certain conditions, enlisted personnel who have skills that separate them from their peers can become officers by direct commissioning of a commander so authorized to grant them. This type of commission is rarely granted and is reserved only for the most exceptional enlisted personnel; it is done on an ''ad hoc'' basis, typically only in wartime. No direct battlefield commissions have been awarded since the [[Vietnam War]]. The Navy and Air Force do not employ this commissioning path.\n* [[Limited Duty Officer]]: due to the highly technical nature of some officer [[billet]]<nowiki/>s, the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard employ a system of promoting proven senior enlisted members to the ranks of commissioned officers. They fill a need that is similar to, but distinct from that filled by warrant officers (to the point where their accession is through the same school). While warrant officers remain technical experts, LDOs take on the role of a generalist, like that of officers commissioned through more traditional sources. LDOs are limited, not by their authority, but by the types of billets they are allowed to fill. However, in recent times they have come to be used more and more like their more-traditional counterparts.\n\nOfficers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the president with the Senate's [[Advice and consent|consent]]. To accept this commission, all officers must take an [[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office|oath of office]].\n\nThrough their careers, officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many [[staff college]]s.\n\n[[Junior officer|Company grade officers]] in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as \"junior\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.\n\n[[Field officer|Field grade officers]] in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as \"senior\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion requirements.\n\n[[General officers]], (known as [[flag officer]]s in the Navy and Coast Guard) serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission.\n\n=====Service chiefs=====\nEach service has a uniformed head who is considered the highest-ranking officer within their respective service, with the exception of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|chairman]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and the [[Chief of the National Guard Bureau|chief]] of the [[National Guard Bureau]]. They are responsible for ensuring personnel readiness, policy, planning and training and equipping their respective military services for the [[Unified combatant command|combatant commanders]] to utilize. They also serve as senior military advisors to the president, the secretary of defense, their respective service secretaries, as well as other councils they may be called to serve on. They are as follows:\n\n*[[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]]\n*[[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]\n*[[Chief of Naval Operations]]\n*[[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]]\n*[[Chief of Space Operations]]\n*[[Commandant of the Coast Guard]]\n\n===Five-star ranking===\n{{Main|Five-star rank}}\n\nThese are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the U.S. Armed Forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star rank:\n\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE OR ELSEWHERE IN THE ARTICLE. Please read the talk page as to why. -->\n* [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]\n* [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]]\n* [[General of the Air Force]]\n\nNo corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps, Space Force, or the Coast Guard. As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority for a five-star rank confirmation.\n\nThe rank of [[general of the Armies]] is considered senior to general of the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of general of the Army. It has been held by two people: [[John J. Pershing]] who received the rank in 1919 after World War I and [[George Washington]] who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the [[American Bicentennial]] celebrations. Pershing, appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World War&nbsp;II and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War&nbsp;II\u2013era Generals of the Army. George Washington's appointment by [[S:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]] to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having \"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\", making him not only superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in perpetuity.\n\nIn the Navy, the rank of [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|admiral of the Navy]] theoretically corresponds to that of general of the Armies, though it was never held by active-duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of fleet admiral. [[George Dewey]] is the only person to have ever held this rank. After the establishment of the rank of fleet admiral in 1944, the Department of the Navy specified that the rank of fleet admiral was to be junior to the rank of admiral of the Navy. However, since Dewey died in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of fleet admiral, the [[six-star rank]] has not been totally confirmed.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:C-130 - First all female crew.jpg|thumb|From 2005, the first all female [[C-130 Hercules]] crew to fly a combat mission for the U.S. Air Force<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Michael G. |date=27 September 2005 |url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |title=First All-female Crew Flies Combat Mission |work=DefendAmerica.mil |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=2 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630032514/http://defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |archivedate=30 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Women's Army Corps|Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. Women saw combat during World War II, first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on 7 December 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]], [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women's Reserve]], [[SPARS|US Coast Guard Women's Reserve]], and [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASPs) were also created during this conflict. In 1944, WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations. [[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest U.S. combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France.\n\nAfter World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950\u20131953, many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 {{dubious|date=January 2018}}during the conflict. During the [[Vietnam War]], 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. Even so, the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|founders of the United States]] were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played a critical role in the [[American Civil War]], continuing to serve as the armed forces of the [[Union (American Civil War)|United States]], although a number of its officers resigned to join the [[Military of the Confederate States of America|military of the Confederate States]]. The [[National Security Act of 1947]], adopted following [[World War II]] and during the [[Cold War]]'s onset, created the modern U.S. military framework. The Act established the [[United States Department of Defense|National Military Establishment]], headed by the secretary of defense; and created the [[United States Department of the Air Force|Department of the Air Force]] and the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]]. It was amended in 1949, renaming the National Military Establishment the Department of Defense, and merged the cabinet-level Department of the Army, Department of the Navy, and Department of the Air Force, into the Department of Defense.\n\nThe U.S. Armed Forces are one of the largest militaries in terms of the number of personnel. It draws its personnel from a large pool of paid [[Volunteer military|volunteers]]. Although [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] has been used in the past in various times of both war and peace, it has not been used since 1973, but the [[Selective Service System]] retains the power to conscript males, and requires that all male citizens and residents residing in the U.S. between the ages of 18\u201325 register with the service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sss.gov/About/Quick-Facts-and-Figures|title=Quick Facts and Figures|website=Sss.gov|accessdate=17 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141339/https://www.sss.gov/About/Quick-Facts-and-Figures|archive-date=12 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> On February 22, 2019, however, [[National Coalition for Men v.

The [[Continental Navy]], established on 13 October 1775, and [[Continental Marines]], established on 10 November 1775, were created in close succession by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in order to defend the new nation against the [[British Empire]] in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\nThese forces demobilized in 1784 after the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] ended the War for Independence. The [[Congress of the Confederation]] created the current [[United States Army]] on 3 June 1784. The [[United States Congress]] created the current [[United States Navy]] on 27 March 1794 and the current [[United States Marine Corps]] on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] gave the [[United States Congress|Congress]] the power to \"raise and support armies\", to \"provide and maintain a navy\" and to \"make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces\", as well as the power to [[Declaration of war by the United States|declare war]]. The [[President of the United States|president]] is the U.S. Armed Forces' [[commander-in-chief]].\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] traces its origin to the founding of the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] on 4 August 1790 which merged with the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] on 28 January 1915 to establish the Coast Guard. The [[United States Air Force]] was established as an independent service on 18 September 1947; it traces its origin to the formation of the [[Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps]], which was formed 1 August 1907 and was part of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] before becoming an independent service  as per the National Security Act of 1947. The [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]] was formerly considered to be a branch of the United States Armed Forces from 29 July 1945 until its status as such was revoked on 3 July 1952.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |title=Veterans Preference and \"Wartime\" Service |access-date=20 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621221456/https://www.archives.gov/personnel-records-center/vso/veterans-preference-and-wartime-service#8 |archive-date=21 June 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all |date=15 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Space Force]] was established on 20 December 2019.

This allowance in the Constitution formed the basis for creation of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) in 1947 by the [[National Security Act of 1947|National Security Act]]. The DoD is headed by the [[United States Secretary of Defense|secretary of defense]], who is a civilian and member of the [[United States Cabinet|Cabinet]]. The defense secretary is second in the U.S. Armed Forces [[chain of command]], with the exception of the Coast Guard, which is under the [[Secretary of Homeland Security|secretary of homeland security]], and is just below the president and serves as the principal assistant to the president in all defense-related matters.<ref>[[Title 10 of the United States Code]] [http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+45+1++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2810%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28113%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20 \u00a7113] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025080903/http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t09t12+45+1++%28%29%20%20AND%20%28%2810%29%20ADJ%20USC%29%3ACITE%20AND%20%28USC%20w%2F10%20%28113%29%29%3ACITE%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20 |date=25 October 2011 }}</ref> Together, the president and the secretary of defense comprise the [[National Command Authority]], which by law is the ultimate lawful source of military orders.<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA272075&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf \"World-Wide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS), Department of Defense Directive 5100.30\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130062117/http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA272075&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |date=30 November 2012 }}.

With the permission of a parent or guardian, applicants can enlist at age 17 and participate in the [[Delayed Entry Program]] (DEP), in which the applicant is given the opportunity to participate in locally sponsored military activities, which can range from sports to competitions led by recruiters or other military liaisons (each recruiting station's DEP varies).\n\nAfter enlistment, new recruits undergo [[Recruit training|basic training]] (also known as \"boot camp\" in the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard), followed by schooling in their primary [[United States military occupation codes|Military Occupational Specialty]] (MOS), [[List of United States Navy ratings|rating]] and [[Air Force Specialty Code]] (AFSC) at any of the numerous training facilities around the United States. Each branch conducts basic training differently. The Marine Corps sends all non-infantry MOS's to an infantry skills course known as [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|Marine Combat Training]] prior to their technical schools. Air Force Basic Military Training graduates attend Technical Training and are awarded their Air Force Specialty Code (AFSC) at the apprentice (3) skill level. All Army recruits undergo [[Basic Combat Training]] (BCT), followed by [[Advanced Individual Training]] (AIT), with the exceptions of cavalry scouts, infantry, armor, combat engineers and military police recruits who go to One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines BCT and AIT. The Navy sends its recruits to Recruit Training and then to \"A\" schools to earn a rating. The Coast Guard's recruits attend basic training and follow with an \"A\" school to earn a [[List of United States Coast Guard ratings|rating]].\n\nInitially, recruits without higher education or college degrees will hold the pay grade of E-1 and will be elevated to E-2 usually soon after basic training. Different services have different incentive programs for enlistees, such as higher initial ranks for college credit, being an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and referring friends who go on to enlist as well. Participation in DEP is one way recruits can achieve rank before their departure to basic training.\n\nThere are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency or maintenance of good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.\n\n====Non-commissioned and petty officers====\nWith very few exceptions, becoming a [[non-commissioned officer]] (NCO) or [[petty officer]] in the U.S. Armed Forces is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service and are generally attained between three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.\n\nWhile considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as [[chief petty officer]]s in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16&nbsp;years of service.\n\n=====Senior enlisted advisors=====\nEach of the five services employs a single [[Senior Enlisted Advisor|senior enlisted advisor]] at departmental level. This individual is the highest ranking enlisted member within that respective service and functions as the chief advisor to the service secretary, service chief and Congress on matters concerning the enlisted force. These individuals carry responsibilities and protocol requirements equivalent to [[three-star rank|three-star]] [[general officer|general]] or [[flag officer]]s. They are as follows:\n\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE OR ELSEWHERE IN THE ARTICLE. Please read the talk page as to why. -->\n* [[Senior Enlisted Advisor to the Chairman]]\n* [[Sergeant Major of the Army]]\n* [[Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps]]\n* [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy]]\n* [[Chief Master Sergeant of the Air Force]]\n* [[Master Chief Petty Officer of the Coast Guard]]\n\n====Warrant officers====\nAdditionally, all services except for the Air Force have an active [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] corps. Above the rank of warrant officer one, these officers may also be commissioned, but usually serve in a more technical and specialized role within units. More recently, they can also serve in more traditional leadership roles associated with the more recognizable officer corps. With one notable exception (Army helicopter and [[Fixed-wing aircraft|fixed-wing]] pilots), these officers ordinarily have already been in the military often serving in senior NCO positions in the field in which they later serve as a warrant officer as a technical expert. Most Army pilots have served some enlisted time. It is also possible to enlist, complete basic training, go directly to the [[Warrant Officer Candidate School (U.S. Army)|Warrant Officer Candidate School]] at [[Fort Rucker]], Alabama and then on to [[flight school]].\n\nWarrant officers in the U.S. military garner the same customs and courtesies as commissioned officers. They may attend the [[Military officers' club|officer's club]], receive a command and are saluted by junior warrant officers and all enlisted service members.\n\nThe Air Force ceased to grant warrants in 1959 when the enlisted grades of E-8 and E-9 were created. Most non-flying duties performed by warrant officers in other services are instead performed by senior NCOs in the Air Force.\n\n====Commissioned officers====\nOfficers receive a [[Officer (armed forces)|commission]] in one of the branches of the U.S. Armed Forces through one of the following routes.\n* [[United States Service academies|Service academies]] ([[United States Military Academy]], [[United States Naval Academy]], [[United States Air Force Academy]], [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] and the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy]])\n* [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC)\n* [[Officer Candidate School]] (OCS) ([[Officer Training School]] (OTS) in the Air Force): this can be through active-duty schools, or through state-run schools in the case of the Army National Guard.\n* [[Direct commission officer|Direct commission]]: civilians who have special skills that are critical to sustaining military operations and supporting troops may receive direct commissions. These officers occupy leadership positions in law, medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, intelligence, supply-logistics-transportation, engineering, public affairs, chaplain, [[oceanography]] and others.\n* [[Battlefield commission]]: under certain conditions, enlisted personnel who have skills that separate them from their peers can become officers by direct commissioning of a commander so authorized to grant them. This type of commission is rarely granted and is reserved only for the most exceptional enlisted personnel; it is done on an ''ad hoc'' basis, typically only in wartime. No direct battlefield commissions have been awarded since the [[Vietnam War]]. The Navy and Air Force do not employ this commissioning path.\n* [[Limited Duty Officer]]: due to the highly technical nature of some officer [[billet]]<nowiki/>s, the Marine Corps, Navy and Coast Guard employ a system of promoting proven senior enlisted members to the ranks of commissioned officers. They fill a need that is similar to, but distinct from that filled by warrant officers (to the point where their accession is through the same school). While warrant officers remain technical experts, LDOs take on the role of a generalist, like that of officers commissioned through more traditional sources. LDOs are limited, not by their authority, but by the types of billets they are allowed to fill. However, in recent times they have come to be used more and more like their more-traditional counterparts.\n\nOfficers receive a commission assigning them to the officer corps from the president with the Senate's [[Advice and consent|consent]]. To accept this commission, all officers must take an [[United States Uniformed Services Oath of Office|oath of office]].\n\nThrough their careers, officers usually will receive further training at one or a number of the many [[staff college]]s.\n\n[[Junior officer|Company grade officers]] in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (known as \"junior\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) function as leaders of smaller units or sections of a unit, typically with an experienced SNCO (or CPO in the Navy and Coast Guard) assistant and mentor.\n\n[[Field officer|Field grade officers]] in pay grades O-4 through O-6 (known as \"senior\" officers in the Navy and Coast Guard) lead significantly larger and more complex operations, with gradually more competitive promotion requirements.\n\n[[General officers]], (known as [[flag officer]]s in the Navy and Coast Guard) serve at the highest levels and oversee major portions of the military mission.\n\n=====Service chiefs=====\nEach service has a uniformed head who is considered the highest-ranking officer within their respective service, with the exception of the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|chairman]] and [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|vice chairman]] of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], and the [[Chief of the National Guard Bureau|chief]] of the [[National Guard Bureau]]. They are responsible for ensuring personnel readiness, policy, planning and training and equipping their respective military services for the [[Unified combatant command|combatant commanders]] to utilize. They also serve as senior military advisors to the president, the secretary of defense, their respective service secretaries, as well as other councils they may be called to serve on. They are as follows:\n\n*[[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]]\n*[[Commandant of the Marine Corps]]\n*[[Chief of Naval Operations]]\n*[[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the Air Force]]\n*[[Chief of Space Operations]]\n*[[Commandant of the Coast Guard]]\n\n===Five-star ranking===\n{{Main|Five-star rank}}\n\nThese are ranks of the highest honor and responsibility in the U.S. Armed Forces, but they are almost never given during peacetime and only a very small number of officers during wartime have held a five-star rank:\n\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ORDER OF PRECEDENCE HERE OR ELSEWHERE IN THE ARTICLE. Please read the talk page as to why. -->\n* [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]]\n* [[Fleet admiral (United States)|Fleet Admiral]]\n* [[General of the Air Force]]\n\nNo corresponding rank exists for the Marine Corps, Space Force, or the Coast Guard. As with three- and four-star ranks, Congress is the approving authority for a five-star rank confirmation.\n\nThe rank of [[general of the Armies]] is considered senior to general of the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of general of the Army. It has been held by two people: [[John J. Pershing]] who received the rank in 1919 after World War I and [[George Washington]] who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the [[American Bicentennial]] celebrations. Pershing, appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World War&nbsp;II and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War&nbsp;II\u2013era Generals of the Army. George Washington's appointment by [[S:Public Law 94-479|Public Law 94-479]] to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having \"rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present\", making him not only superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in perpetuity.\n\nIn the Navy, the rank of [[Admiral of the Navy (United States)|admiral of the Navy]] theoretically corresponds to that of general of the Armies, though it was never held by active-duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of fleet admiral. [[George Dewey]] is the only person to have ever held this rank. After the establishment of the rank of fleet admiral in 1944, the Department of the Navy specified that the rank of fleet admiral was to be junior to the rank of admiral of the Navy. However, since Dewey died in 1917 before the establishment of the rank of fleet admiral, the [[six-star rank]] has not been totally confirmed.\n\n===Women===\n[[File:C-130 - First all female crew.jpg|thumb|From 2005, the first all female [[C-130 Hercules]] crew to fly a combat mission for the U.S. Air Force<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnson |first=Michael G. |date=27 September 2005 |url=http://www.defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |title=First All-female Crew Flies Combat Mission |work=DefendAmerica.mil |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=2 July 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630032514/http://defendamerica.mil/articles/sep2005/a092705wm3.html |archivedate=30 June 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Women's Army Corps|Woman's Army Auxiliary Corps]] was established in the United States in 1942. Women saw combat during World War II, first as nurses in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attacks on 7 December 1941. The [[WAVES|Woman's Naval Reserve]], [[United States Marine Corps Women's Reserve|Marine Corps Women's Reserve]], [[SPARS|US Coast Guard Women's Reserve]], and [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] (WASPs) were also created during this conflict. In 1944, WACs arrived in the Pacific and landed in Normandy on [[D-Day]]. During the war, 67 Army nurses and 16 [[United States Navy Nurse Corps|Navy nurses]] were captured and spent three years as Japanese prisoners of war. There were 350,000 American women who served during World War II and 16 were killed in action. In total, they gained over 1,500 medals, citations and commendations. [[Virginia Hall]], serving with the Office of Strategic Services, received the second-highest U.S. combat award, the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], for action behind enemy lines in France.\n\nAfter World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, [[Women's Armed Services Integration Act|The Women's Armed Services Act]] of 1948, was signed by [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]], allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peacetime, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the [[Korean War]] of 1950\u20131953, many women served in the [[Mobile Army Surgical Hospital]]s, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000 {{dubious|date=January 2018}}during the conflict. During the [[Vietnam War]], 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff.

Pinturault]] (France)]]\nThis is a '''list of all male winners''' in [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]] from 1967 to present. The list includes all [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]], [[super-G]], [[giant slalom]], [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]], parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom, but does not show team events.\n\n==History==\nIn 54 World Cup seasons 1782 races (496 downhills, 217 super-G's, 419 giant slaloms, 497 slaloms, 134 combined, 2 parallel slaloms, 10 city events, 6 parallel giant slaloms and 1 K.O. slalom) for men were held. These events saw 1793 winners, because eleven races (four downhills, four super-G's, one giant slalom, and two slaloms) ended with a tie.\n\nA total of 291 male alpine skiers from 19 nations have won at least one individual race. The first winner in 1967 was the Austrian [[Heinrich Messner]] who won the slalom in [[Berchtesgaden]]. The newest member in this list is Croatian [[Filip Zub\u010di\u0107]] who won the  Giant Slalom in [[Naeba Ski Resort|Naeba]], Japan, on 22 February 2020. Alpine skiers from nineteen nations from three continents have won races; Yugoslavia and Slovenia are listed separately, but counted as one nation; also Germany and West Germany are shown but counted together. The first winner for his country is highlighted in blue.\n\n[[Jean-Claude Killy]] was the first skier to win races in two different seasons (1967 and 1967/1968), while [[Ingemar Stenmark]] won races in 13 different seasons. He won races between 1974/1975 and 1988/1989, only failing to win in the seasons 1984/1985 and 1987/1988. [[Marc Girardelli]], [[Benjamin Raich]], and [[Aksel Lund Svindal]] all won races in twelve different seasons. Stenmark was also able to win races in ten consecutive seasons (1974/1975 to 1983/1984). [[Alberto Tomba]] bettered this mark, when he won races in eleven consecutive seasons (1987/1988 to 1997/1998), and he is still the only skier to do so. [[Marcel Hirscher]] (2009/2010 to 2018/2019) won races in ten consecutive seasons. [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]] (1981/1982 to 1989/1990), [[Michael Walchhofer]] (2002/2003 to 2010/2011), [[Aksel Lund Svindal]] (2005/2006 to 2013/2014), [[Ted Ligety]] (2007/2008 to 2015/2016), and [[Alexis Pinturault]] (2011/2012 to 2019/2020) all won races in nine consecutive seasons.\n\n[[Patrick Russel]] was the first to win races in three and four seasons, [[Henri Duvillard]] was the first to win races in five seasons. [[Gustav Th\u00f6ni]] was the first to win races in six, seven, and eight seasons. [[Ingemar Stenmark]] was the first to win races in nine, ten, eleven, and twelve seasons and he is the only skier to win races in 13 seasons.\n\n[[Jean-Claude Killy]] won all his 18 races in only two seasons, while [[G\u00fcnther Mader]] won his 14 races in nine seasons. [[Paul Accola]] was only able to win races in one season (1991/1992), but won seven events in four different disciplines. [[Rok Petrovi\u010d]] also won races only in one season (1985/1986) when he won five slaloms. [[Michael von Gr\u00fcnigen]] is the highest placed racer to win in only one discipline \u2013 23 giant slaloms.\n\n98 racers have won only one race. The downhill races saw 116 different winners (the 100th different winner was Canada's [[Manuel Osborne-Paradis]] in 2009), the super-G races saw 80 different winners, the giant slaloms 98 different, the slaloms 108 different (the 100th different winner was Italy's [[Cristian Deville]] in 2012), combined events 39 different winners, parallel slalom events saw ten different winners and parallel giant slalom events saw four different winner.\n\nThe youngest male winner is [[Piero Gros]] (born 30 October 1954) who won the giant slalom in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re]] on 8 December 1972 at the age of 18 years and 39 days. The oldest winner is [[Didier Cuche]] (born 16 August 1974) who was aged 37 years and 192 days when he won the super-G in [[Crans-Montana]] on 24 February 2012. The oldest skier to win his first race was [[Thomas Fanara]] (born 24 April 1981) when he won the giant slalom in [[Piz Nair|St. Moritz]] on 19 March 2016, he was aged 34 years and 330 days.\n\nThe highest [[bib number]] with 66 to win a race was worn by [[Markus Foser]] in the downhill of [[Val Gardena]] on 17 December 1993. Only five days later the highest bib number to win a super-G was 51 used by [[Hannes Trinkl]] in [[Lech (Vorarlberg)|Lech am Arlberg]] on 22 December 1993. In giant slalom the highest bib number 45 to win belonged to the youngest winner ever [[Piero Gros]] on 8 December 1972 in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re]]. The record holder for the highest bib number in slalom is [[Ivica Kosteli\u0107]], who won in [[Aspen, Colorado]] with 64. [[Niels Hintermann]] won the Alpine combined in [[Lauberhorn ski races|Wengen]] on 17 January 2017 with bib number 51.

Pinturault]] (France)]]\nThis is a '''list of all male winners''' in [[FIS Alpine Ski World Cup]] from 1967 to present. The list includes all [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]], [[super-G]], [[giant slalom]], [[Slalom skiing|slalom]], [[Alpine skiing combined|combined]], parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom, but does not show team events.\n\n==History==\nIn 54 World Cup seasons 1782 races (496 downhills, 217 super-G's, 419 giant slaloms, 497 slaloms, 134 combined, 2 parallel slaloms, 10 city events, 6 parallel giant slaloms and 1 K.O. slalom) for men were held. These events saw 1793 winners, because eleven races (four downhills, four super-G's, one giant slalom, and two slaloms) ended with a tie.\n\nA total of 291 male alpine skiers from 19 nations have won at least one individual race. The first winner in 1967 was the Austrian [[Heinrich Messner]] who won the slalom in [[Berchtesgaden]]. The newest member in this list is Croatian [[Filip Zub\u010di\u0107]] who won the  Giant Slalom in [[Naeba Ski Resort|Naeba]], Japan, on 22 February 2020. Alpine skiers from nineteen nations from three continents have won races; Yugoslavia and Slovenia are listed separately, but counted as one nation; also Germany and West Germany are shown but counted together. The first winner for his country is highlighted in blue.\n\n[[Jean-Claude Killy]] was the first skier to win races in two different seasons (1967 and 1967/1968), while [[Ingemar Stenmark]] won races in 13 different seasons. He won races between 1974/1975 and 1988/1989, only failing to win in the seasons 1984/1985 and 1987/1988. [[Marc Girardelli]], [[Benjamin Raich]], and [[Aksel Lund Svindal]] all won races in twelve different seasons. Stenmark was also able to win races in ten consecutive seasons (1974/1975 to 1983/1984). [[Alberto Tomba]] bettered this mark, when he won races in eleven consecutive seasons (1987/1988 to 1997/1998), and he is still the only skier to do so. [[Marcel Hirscher]] (2009/2010 to 2018/2019) won races in ten consecutive seasons. [[Pirmin Zurbriggen]] (1981/1982 to 1989/1990), [[Michael Walchhofer]] (2002/2003 to 2010/2011), [[Aksel Lund Svindal]] (2005/2006 to 2013/2014), [[Ted Ligety]] (2007/2008 to 2015/2016), and [[Alexis Pinturault]] (2011/2012 to 2019/2020) all won races in nine consecutive seasons.\n\n[[Patrick Russel]] was the first to win races in three and four seasons, [[Henri Duvillard]] was the first to win races in five seasons. [[Gustav Th\u00f6ni]] was the first to win races in six, seven, and eight seasons. [[Ingemar Stenmark]] was the first to win races in nine, ten, eleven, and twelve seasons and he is the only skier to win races in 13 seasons.\n\n[[Jean-Claude Killy]] won all his 18 races in only two seasons, while [[G\u00fcnther Mader]] won his 14 races in nine seasons. [[Paul Accola]] was only able to win races in one season (1991/1992), but won seven events in four different disciplines. [[Rok Petrovi\u010d]] also won races only in one season (1985/1986) when he won five slaloms. [[Michael von Gr\u00fcnigen]] is the highest placed racer to win in only one discipline \u2013 23 giant slaloms.\n\n98 racers have won only one race. The downhill races saw 116 different winners (the 100th different winner was Canada's [[Manuel Osborne-Paradis]] in 2009), the super-G races saw 80 different winners, the giant slaloms 98 different, the slaloms 108 different (the 100th different winner was Italy's [[Cristian Deville]] in 2012), combined events 39 different winners, parallel slalom events saw ten different winners and parallel giant slalom events saw four different winner.\n\nThe youngest male winner is [[Piero Gros]] (born 30 October 1954) who won the giant slalom in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re]] on 8 December 1972 at the age of 18 years and 39 days. The oldest winner is [[Didier Cuche]] (born 16 August 1974) who was aged 37 years and 192 days when he won the super-G in [[Crans-Montana]] on 24 February 2012. The oldest skier to win his first race was [[Thomas Fanara]] (born 24 April 1981) when he won the giant slalom in [[Piz Nair|St. Moritz]] on 19 March 2016, he was aged 34 years and 330 days.\n\nThe highest [[Competition number|bib number]] with 66 to win a race was worn by [[Markus Foser]] in the downhill of [[Val Gardena]] on 17 December 1993. Only five days later the highest bib number to win a super-G was 51 used by [[Hannes Trinkl]] in [[Lech (Vorarlberg)|Lech am Arlberg]] on 22 December 1993. In giant slalom the highest bib number 45 to win belonged to the youngest winner ever [[Piero Gros]] on 8 December 1972 in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re]]. The record holder for the highest bib number in slalom is [[Ivica Kosteli\u0107]], who won in [[Aspen, Colorado]] with 64. [[Niels Hintermann]] won the Alpine combined in [[Lauberhorn ski races|Wengen]] on 17 January 2017 with bib number 51. The third highest bib number overall to win a race was 61 worn by [[Josef Strobl]] on 16 December 1994 in the downhill in [[Val-d'Is\u00e8re]].\n\nDisciplines were introduced in World Cup: [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill]], [[Giant Slalom skiing|giant slalom]] and [[Slalom skiing|slalom]] in 1967; [[Alpine skiing combined|Combined]] and parallel slalom in 1975; [[super-G]] in 1982, super-combined in 2006 and renamed to alpine combined in 2015. \nFive skiers have won reaces in all five main disciplines: Marc Girardelli, Pirmin Zurbriggen, [[Bode Miller]], [[Kjetil Andr\u00e9 Aamodt]] and G\u00fcnther Mader.\n\n==Winners==\n<small>{{legend|#CFECEC|active skiers}}</small>\n<small>{{legend|#F0F8FF|the first racer to win for his country}}</small>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"border: 1px solid #999;

He is interested in literature and his early poems. It is then decided to return to [[Kairouan]], capital of science and know-how of the time, in 1015. There are often the great masters and scientists of the time, like Mohamed Ibn Ja'far al- Kazzaz Temim\u012b and Ab\u016b Is\u1e25\u0101q Ibrah\u012bm al-\u1e24u\u1e63ari, and deepen his knowledge with them. At the same time, he deals with commercial activities.\n\nIn 1026, he contacted the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid court]] by [[Panegyric|eulogizing]] the ruler of [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis|Al-Mu\u02bfizz ben Badis]] who appreciated the extent of his knowledge and his literary talent. He quickly became the palace's official poet, while expanding his area of interest in the history of literature and developing his skills in criticism and poetic art theory. \n[[File:50_TND_ob_2009.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Ibn Rachik on a fify [[Tunisian dinar]] bill mis put into circulation July 25, 2009]]\nHis life is normal and nothing seems to have disrupted his course until 1051, the year in which he composes the satire of the judge of the city of Sabra (also called [[Mansouria, Tunisia|El Mansouria]]), which is worth to be exiled and flee to [[Egypt]].

In 1939 Ruf had to go to war. From 1940 to 1942 he was allowed to stay at home because he worked as an independent architect with the family of [[Hugo Junkers]]. From 1934 to 1936, one year before his death, Junkers had allowed the 26-year-old architect to build an estate for his workers in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria]]. Hugo Junkers, who had lost nearly all of his inventions and his factory in Dessau to the new authorities and now lived near Munich under surveillance, now did research for metal-housing. In 1942 Ruf had to go to the Russian front and after the war had ended, he went back to Germany by foot and directly began his work of rebuilding Germany with the Church Christk\u00f6nig in Munich.\n\n== First modern buildings ==\n\nOne of his first works were buildings for the HICOG (High Commissioner of Germany), the [[Allied High Commission]] at the palace Deichmannsaue in Bad-Godesberg/Bonn together with the architects Otto Apel, Rudolf Letocha, Rohrer and Herdt.

The only high building is the auditorium, on both sides open with glass-walls. The way to build these pavilions was later used again for the pavilions of the [[Expo 58]] in Brussels. The studios and ateliers are looking to the atrium, so the students can work inside as well as outside in the green patio.

William V., Duke of Bavaria, built the residence from 1593 to 1596. In the 17th century it was called the Herzog-Max-Burg. After it was destroyed in World War II., only the renaissance-tower was still standing. The city asked some architects to find ideas for the place and allowed to destroy the old tower. Only Ruf and Theo Papst were the two architects, who wanted to save it. So both got the order to build the New Maxburg. The steel skeleton building followed the structure of the tower and in the middle of the buildings is a green meadow and a fountain. The building of Justice is one of the most elegant buildings in Europe, like [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] wrote.

Every architect got his own part to realize. For example, the new upper house of the German parliament, the tower building of the delegates, the privat- and representative house of the chancellor of the Federal Republic.\n\nIn 1963 and 1964 Ruf built the house for the [[Chancellor of Germany|chancellor]]. It was to be a house to live in and also to be a representative building to welcome guests of state. In a park beside the river Rhine he built a flat-roofed house with large glass-windows, that should show the open democratic way, the new Germany was thinking. The bungalow is designed with two quadrates with two [[Atrium (architecture)|atriums]] and one part of the house is wide open to the park and the other private part into one atrium with a little swimming pool.

Parts of the former [[Nuremberg Charterhouse]], dissolved in 1525, were used for the museum.  During World War II. great parts of the museum were destroyed. So Ruf and Harald Roth made the development plans. They began to rebuild the museum from 1953 until 1978 and Ruf designed several modern exhibition areas. The first was the [[Theodor Heuss]] -Bau. The first Federal President Theodor Heuss came to the opening and said, he was happy to see, that there was conceived something new, than to try to imitate the old.\n\nSt. Johann von Capistran is a round Church and it is called to be the last cathedral in Munich. Ruf built it 1958\u201360. The building is designed with two crescent-shaped shells, in the inside there are the sacred rooms. The flat roof is lying upon a circlet of glass and has a glass-dome. Outside 22 pillars hold the roof free above the open room.<ref>http://www.erzbistum-muenchen.de/media/pfarreien/media13472720.PDF</ref>\n\nThe [[Bavarian State Library]] is one of Europe's most important universal libraries.

They made an available surface of 17,000 m<sup>2</sup> and a volume of 84,000 m<sup>3</sup>.

He attended the [[Interbau]] 1957 in Berlin-[[Hansaviertel]] and was one of the three architects who had the top secret order to create the governmental buildings in the new capital city of the Federal Republic of Germany, [[Bonn]]. His best known building was the residence for the [[Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany]], built for [[Ludwig Erhard]], the so-called Chancellor's Bungalow.\n\n== Personal life ==\n\n[[File:Akademie N\u00fcrnberg Eingang.JPG|thumb|Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg Entry]]\n[[File:Akademie N\u00fcrnberg N\u00fcrnberg.JPG|thumb|Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg Aula]]\n[[File:Akademie N\u00fcrnberg Au\u00dfenaufnahme.JPG|thumb|Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg]]\n[[File:Neue Maxburg M\u00fcnchen.JPG|thumb|New Maxburg Munich curved stairs with glass-ceiling]]\n[[File:Neue Maxburg M\u00fcnchen Treppe.JPG|thumb|New Maxburg Munich stair]]\nHis father was Josef Ruf and his mother was Wilhelmine Mina Ruf (n\u00e9e Scharrer).

He was a Roman Catholic and went to the boy scouts, where he met friends, he had for his lifetime: [[Golo Mann]], the son of the famous German writer and Nobel laureate in literature [[Thomas Mann]] and the later physicist and Nobel Prize laureate [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Until his years of study he went to the Luitpold-Oberrealschule and he loved skiing and climbing in the mountains.<ref>archive Sep Ruf, Family of Sep Ruf</ref>\nDuring this time he met his later fianc\u00e9e, Aloisia Ruf, n\u00e9e Mayer, born in Munich, 2 April 1910, a daughter of a factory owner. They married 1938, built a home in [[Gmund am Tegernsee]] and had two children. His bureau was in Munich. Ruf loved to travel and he visited Austria, Italy, Greece, France, Belgium, Switzerland, the United States and Norway. 1969 he bought a winery in Italy and renovated the house. He became friend with many artists like [[Marino Marini (sculptor)|Marino Marini]] and [[Bruno Pulga]] and had guests in Italy such as [[Henry Moore]]. He also kept in touch with [[Walter Gropius]], [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]], [[Richard Neutra]] and [[Romano Guardini]].

In 1939 Ruf had to go to war. From 1940 to 1942 he was allowed to stay at home because he worked as an independent architect with the family of [[Hugo Junkers]]. From 1934 to 1936, one year before his death, Junkers had allowed the 26-year-old architect to build an estate for his workers in [[Gr\u00fcnwald, Bavaria]]. Hugo Junkers, who had lost nearly all of his inventions and his factory in Dessau to the new authorities and now lived near Munich under surveillance, now did research for metal-housing. In 1942 Ruf had to go to the Russian front and after the war had ended, he went back to Germany by foot and directly began his work of rebuilding Germany with the Church Christk\u00f6nig in Munich.\n\n== First modern buildings ==\n\nOne of his first works were buildings for the HICOG (High Commissioner of Germany), the [[Allied High Commission]] at the palace Deichmannsaue in Bad-Godesberg/Bonn together with the architects Otto Apel, Rudolf Letocha, Rohrer and Herdt.

The only high building is the auditorium, on both sides open with glass-walls. The way to build these pavilions was later used again for the pavilions of the [[Expo 58]] in Brussels.

After it was destroyed in World War II., only the renaissance-tower was still standing. The city asked some architects to find ideas for the place and allowed to destroy the old tower. Only Ruf and Theo Papst were the two architects, who wanted to save it. So both got the order to build the New Maxburg. The steel skeleton building followed the structure of the tower and in the middle of the buildings is a green meadow and a fountain. The building of Justice is one of the most elegant buildings in Europe, like [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] wrote.

It was to be a house to live in and also to be a representative building to welcome guests of state. In a park beside the river Rhine he built a flat-roofed house with large glass-windows, that should show the open democratic way, the new Germany was thinking. The bungalow is designed with two quadrates with two [[Atrium (architecture)|atriums]] and one part of the house is wide open to the park and the other private part into one atrium with a little swimming pool.
