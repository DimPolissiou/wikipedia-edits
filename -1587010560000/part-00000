{"title_page": "Deaths in 2020", "text_new": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Short description|List of notable individuals who died in 2020}}\nThe following deaths of notable individuals occurred in 2020. Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===16===\n\n===15===\n*[[Adam Alsing]], 51, Swedish television and radio presenter (''[[Big Brother (Swedish TV series)|Big Brother]], [[Adam Live]], [[Mix Megapol]]''), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.svd.se/adam-alsing-dod Adam Alsing d\u00f6d i Covid19] {{in lang|sv}}</ref>\n*[[Ranjit Chowdhry]], 64, Indian actor (''[[Baton Baton Mein]]'', ''[[Bollywood/Hollywood]]'', ''[[Last Holiday (2006 film)|Last Holiday]]'').<ref>[https://www.pinkvilla.com/entertainment/news/khubsoorat-actor-ranjit-chowdhry-passes-away-age-65-524755%3f Khubsoorat actor Ranjit Chowdhry passes away at the age of 65]</ref>\n*[[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]], 85, American [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] football player ([[Cleveland Browns]], [[Green Bay Packers]]).<ref>[https://www.cbs58.com/news/packers-legend-willie-davis-passes-away-at-age-85 Packers legend Willie Davis passes away at age 85]</ref>\n*[[Ed Genson]], 78, American attorney ([[R.

He was elected as a Democrat to the [[Indiana General Assembly]] in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], Debs led his union in [[Burlington railway strike of 1888|a major ten-month strike against the CB&Q Railroad in 1888]], and lost.  Debs was instrumental in the founding of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), one of the nation's first [[industrial unions]]. After workers at the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]] organized a [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strike]] over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He led a [[boycott]] by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide [[Pullman Strike]], affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. Purportedly to keep the mail running, President [[Grover Cleveland]] used the [[United States Army]] to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.\n\nIn prison, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the [[Marxism|international socialist]] movement. Debs was a founding member of the [[Social Democracy of America]] (1897), the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] (1898) and the [[Socialist Party of America]] (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for [[President of the United States]] five times, including [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] (earning 0.6% of the popular vote), [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] (3.0%), [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]] (2.8%), [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] (6.0%) and [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] (3.4%), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for [[United States Congress]] from his native state [[Indiana]] in 1916.\n\nDebs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in [[World War I]] led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] and sentenced to a term of 10 years. President [[Warren G. Harding]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a [[sanatorium]] due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nDebs was born on November 5, 1855, in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari Bettrich Debs, who immigrated to the United States from [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]], France. His father, who came from a prosperous family, owned a textile mill and meat market. Debs was named after the French authors [[Eug\u00e8ne Sue]] and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref name=\"socialistworker\">{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=Bill |title=The Socialist Worker |url=http://www.socialistworker.org/2007-2/638/638_12_Debs.shtml |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310173710/http://www.socialistworker.org/2007-2/638/638_12_Debs.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDebs attended public school, dropping out of high school at age 14.<ref name=RTimes>\"Biographical: Eugene V.

Their motto was \"Benevolence, Sobriety, and Industry\". As editor of the official journal of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs initially concentrated on improving the Brotherhood's death and disability insurance programs. During the early 1880s, Debs' writing stressed themes of self-upliftment: [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], hard work, and honesty. Debs also held the view that \"labor and capital are friends\" and opposed strikes as a means of settling differences. The Brotherhood had never authorized a strike from its founding in 1873 to 1887, a record which Debs was proud of. Railroad companies cultivated the Brotherhood and granted them perks like free transportation to their conventions for the delegates. Debs also invited railroad president [[Henry C. Lord]] to write for the magazine. Summarizing Debs' thought in this period, historian David A. Shannon wrote: \"Debs's [[wikt:desideratum|desideratum]] was one of peace and co-operation between labor and capital, but he expected management to treat labor with respect, honor and social equality\".<ref name=\"ShannonConservative\">{{cite journal |last=Shannon |first=David A. |year=1951 |title=Eugene V.

In its ruling on ''[[Debs v. United States]]'', the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding [[World War I]] and [[socialism]]. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the [[Espionage Act]], the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially the same as that of ''[[Schenck v.

Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success.<ref>Coben, 202</ref> At one point, Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization, this man, Debs, stood behind the lines sniping, attacking, and denouncing them....This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration.<ref name=\"Noggle\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn January 1921, Palmer, citing Debs' deteriorating health, proposed to Wilson that Debs receive a presidential pardon freeing him on February 12, Lincoln's birthday.

He was elected as a Democrat to the [[Indiana General Assembly]] in 1884. After working with several smaller unions, including the [[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]], Debs led his union in [[Burlington railway strike of 1888|a major ten-month strike against the CB&Q Railroad in 1888]], and lost.  Debs was instrumental in the founding of the [[American Railway Union]] (ARU), one of the nation's first [[industrial unions]]. After workers at the [[Pullman Palace Car Company]] organized a [[Wildcat strike action|wildcat strike]] over pay cuts in the summer of 1894, Debs signed many into the ARU. He led a [[boycott]] by the ARU against handling trains with Pullman cars in what became the nationwide [[Pullman Strike]], affecting most lines west of Detroit and more than 250,000 workers in 27 states. Purportedly to keep the mail running, President [[Grover Cleveland]] used the [[United States Army]] to break the strike. As a leader of the ARU, Debs was convicted of federal charges for defying a court injunction against the strike and served six months in prison.\n\nIn prison, Debs read various works of socialist theory and emerged six months later as a committed adherent of the [[Marxism|international socialist]] movement. Debs was a founding member of the [[Social Democracy of America]] (1897), the [[Social Democratic Party of America]] (1898) and the [[Socialist Party of America]] (1901). Debs ran as a Socialist candidate for [[President of the United States]] five times, including [[1900 United States presidential election|1900]] (earning 0.6% of the popular vote), [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] (3.0%), [[1908 United States presidential election|1908]] (2.8%), [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]] (6.0%) and [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]] (3.4%), the last time from a prison cell. He was also a candidate for [[United States Congress]] from his native state [[Indiana]] in 1916.\n\nDebs was noted for his oratory, and his speech denouncing American participation in [[World War I]] led to his second arrest in 1918. He was convicted under the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] and sentenced to a term of 10 years. President [[Warren G. Harding]] [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] his sentence in December 1921. Debs died in 1926, not long after being admitted to a [[sanatorium]] due to cardiovascular problems that developed during his time in prison.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nDebs was born on November 5, 1855, in [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], to Jean Daniel and Marguerite Mari Bettrich Debs, who immigrated to the United States from [[Colmar]], [[Alsace]], France.

Debs was named after the French authors [[Eug\u00e8ne Sue]] and [[Victor Hugo]].<ref name=\"socialistworker\">{{cite web |last=Roberts |first=Bill |title=The Socialist Worker |url=http://www.socialistworker.org/2007-2/638/638_12_Debs.shtml |accessdate=2007-07-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310173710/http://www.socialistworker.org/2007-2/638/638_12_Debs.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-10 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nDebs attended public school, dropping out of high school at age 14.<ref name=RTimes>\"Biographical: Eugene V.

Debs Home|Their home]] still stands in Terre Haute, preserved on the campus of [[Indiana State University]].\n\n== Labor activism ==\nThe railroad brotherhoods were comparatively conservative organizations, focused on providing fellowship and services rather than on collective bargaining. Their motto was \"Benevolence, Sobriety, and Industry\". As editor of the official journal of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen, Debs initially concentrated on improving the Brotherhood's death and disability insurance programs. During the early 1880s, Debs' writing stressed themes of self-upliftment: [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], hard work, and honesty. Debs also held the view that \"labor and capital are friends\" and opposed strikes as a means of settling differences. The Brotherhood had never authorized a strike from its founding in 1873 to 1887, a record which Debs was proud of. Railroad companies cultivated the Brotherhood and granted them perks like free transportation to their conventions for the delegates. Debs also invited railroad president [[Henry C. Lord]] to write for the magazine. Summarizing Debs' thought in this period, historian David A. Shannon wrote: \"Debs's [[wikt:desideratum|desideratum]] was one of peace and co-operation between labor and capital, but he expected management to treat labor with respect, honor and social equality\".<ref name=\"ShannonConservative\">{{cite journal |last=Shannon |first=David A. |year=1951 |title=Eugene V. Debs: Conservative Labor Editor |journal=Indiana Magazine of History |jstor=27787982 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=357\u201364}}</ref>\n\nDebs gradually became convinced of the need for a more unified and confrontational approach as railroads were powerful forces in the economy. One influence was his involvement in the [[Burlington Railroad Strike of 1888]], a defeat for labor that convinced Debs of the necessity of organizing along craft lines.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Reitano |first=Joanne |editor-last1=Schlup |editor-first1=Leonard C.  |editor-last2=Ryan |editor-first2=James G. |year=2003 |title=Railroad Strike of 1888 |work=Historical Dictionary of the Gilded Age |page=405 |publisher=M.E.

I said then, and I say now, that while there is a lower class, I am in it, and while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, I am not free.</blockquote>\n\nDebs appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on ''[[Debs v. United States]]'', the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding [[World War I]] and [[socialism]]. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches in an attempt to comply with the [[Espionage Act]], the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially the same as that of ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'', in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.\n\n[[File:EugeneDebs.gif|thumb|Clifford Berryman's cartoon depiction of Debs' [[1920 United States presidential election|1920 presidential run]] from prison]]\nDebs went to prison on April 13, 1919.<ref name=bio/> In protest of his jailing, [[Charles Ruthenberg]] led a parade of [[Trade union|unionists]], [[socialism|socialists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]] and [[communism|communists]] to march on May 1 ([[May Day]]) in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

Palmer generally favored releasing people convicted under the wartime security acts, but when he consulted with Debs' prosecutors\u2014even those with records as defenders of civil liberties\u2014they assured him that Debs' conviction was correct and his sentence appropriate.<ref>Stanley Coben, ''A. Mitchell Palmer: Politician'' (NY: Columbia University Press, 1963), 200\u201303</ref> The President and his Attorney General both believed that public opinion opposed clemency and that releasing Debs could strengthen Wilson's opponents in the [[Treaty of Versailles#United States rejects Treaty|debate over the ratification of the peace treaty]]. Palmer proposed clemency in August and October 1920 without success.<ref>Coben, 202</ref> At one point, Wilson wrote:\n\n<blockquote>While the flower of American youth was pouring out its blood to vindicate the cause of civilization, this man, Debs, stood behind the lines sniping, attacking, and denouncing them....This man was a traitor to his country and he will never be pardoned during my administration.<ref name=\"Noggle\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn January 1921, Palmer, citing Debs' deteriorating health, proposed to Wilson that Debs receive a presidential pardon freeing him on February 12, Lincoln's birthday.

A White House statement summarized the administration's view of Debs' case:\n\n<blockquote>There is no question of his guilt....He was by no means as rabid and outspoken in his expressions as many others, and but for his prominence and the resulting far-reaching effect of his words, very probably might not have received the sentence he did.
