He incorporates the Hum-a-long(vocal scatting with the bowed bass) bass technique, popularized by Leroy \u201cSlam\u201d Stewart and Major \u201cMule\u201d Holly, into his playing.\n\nSharpe was first bought to prominence by tenor saxophonist [[Archie Shepp]] and drummer [[Art Blakey]], but is best known for his longtime association with Piano Jazz Legend [[McCoy Tyner]] from 1980-2003. He recorded some 20 plus records with Tyner.\n\n== Early Life ==\nSharpe's first instrument was the piano, which he started playing at eight years old.  His mother, Evelyn was a pianist and choir director in the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) and she gave lessons to Sharpe, as well as to his 7 other siblings. Sharpe also studied the accordion, in his youth and ultimately the electric bass. While attending the University of Massahusetts, (Amherst) Sharpe studied double bass with Reggie Workman. While at UMASS, he also studied with Max Roach, Archie Shepp, Horace Boyer and Fred Tillis. He played the double and electric bass in gospel, funk, rock groups, jazz band and orchestra, while there. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.williams.edu/profile/ags3/|title=Avery G.

Set in London, the [[first person narrative]] by a young girl, Dolphin, features her [[bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] mother Marigold, nicknamed \"the illustrated mum\" because of her many tattoos. The title is a reference to ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'', a 1951 book of short stories by [[Ray Bradbury]], also named for [[tattoos]].\n\nWilson and ''The Illustrated Mum'' won the annual [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=prize2000/><ref name=relaunch/>\n\nBy 2001 translations had been published in Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, and Catalan.<ref>\n[http://www.worldcat.org/title/illustrated-mum/oclc/59399913/editions?start_edition=1&sd=asc&referer=di&se=yr&qt=sort_yr_asc&editionsView=true&fq= \"Formats and editions of The Illustrated Mum\"]. WorldCat. Retrieved 2 August 2012.</ref>\n[[Delacorte Press]] published the first American edition only in 2005.<ref name=LCC/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nDolphin and her older sister, Star, live with their mother, Marigold, in a small London flat. Marigold, an avid lover of tattoos, suffers from bipolar disorder and also has a drinking problem. Dolphin loves Marigold and thinks she is wonderful and unique, while Star is embarrassed by Marigold's tattoos and erratic behaviour. Dolphin feels like an outsider at school; she is bullied by some classmates and feels her teacher is unkind to her. She also struggles with her [[dyslexia]]. Star appears to be more popular, and Dolphin dislikes the fact that Star has an older boyfriend. Dolphin later befriends Oliver, a shy and studious boy who spends the lunch period in the library to avoid being teased.\n\nMarigold buys tickets to see her favourite band Emerald City, with the intention of finding Micky, Star's father, who Marigold still claims to love. Both girls are surprised when she returns that night with Micky. He was unaware he had a daughter and is thrilled to meet Star, and she adores him in turn. Dolphin dislikes him because she feels that he abandoned Marigold.\n\nMicky sends both the girls presents, and Star goes to spend a weekend with him. Marigold hoped to reconcile romantically with Micky and is upset to hear that he has a girlfriend living with him. Micky hears of Marigold's behaviour and invites both Star and Dolphin to live with him. Dolphin stays loyal to Marigold and refuses to leave her so Star leaves to be with Micky. After Star leaves, Marigold has a mental breakdown and paints herself white using [[toxic]] paint. Dolphin has to phone her an ambulance and finds out that due to her [[mental illness]] she may be in hospital for some time.\n\nWith Marigold in hospital ill and tired, Oliver encourages Dolphin to contact her real father, who she knows nothing about, except that his name is also Micky and he worked as a swimming instructor. She manages to track him down and he's pleased to meet her. Dolphin hopes he will look after her, but he has a wife and daughters already and wants to do things properly, getting in touch with child services so Dolphin can be in [[foster care]] for a while. Dolphin is initially terrified of going into a foster home having heard Marigold's horror stories from her own childhood, but she stays with a kind older woman and several younger children and her father takes her to visit Marigold, who is on medication for [[bipolar disorder]].\n\nStar appears at the foster home after returning to the flat to find both Marigold and Dolphin gone. Star stays in foster care with Dolphin and although they argue at first, they reconcile and go to visit Marigold together. The story ends with Dolphin deciding that even though Marigold is in hospital and she and Star in foster care, they are still a family.\n\n==Adaptation==\n\nThe television drama stars [[Michelle Collins]] as Marigold Westward, and [[Alice Connor]] and [[Holly Grainger]] as her daughters Dolphin and Star. The script was by [[Debbie Isitt]], and it was directed by Cilla Ware. Ware had previously directed the television adaptation of another of Wilson's books, ''[[Double Act (film)|Double Act]]'', and went on to adapt a third, ''Best Friends''.\n\n===Characters===\n\n*Dolphin Westward \u2013 Dolphin Westward is the daughter of Michael and Marigold Westward, and is the opposite of her elder sister Star, or so she believes. Star is beautiful and confident, whereas Dolphin, with her mousy hair and her greyish-green eyes, is shy yet fiery, has no friends at school and worries about things, including her mother Marigold's erratic, somewhat mad behaviour.\n*Star Westward \u2013 Star is the daughter of Micky and Marigold Westward and the elder sister of Dolphin, and she is very beautiful, with long blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Although she loves Dolphin very much, as she got older, she has put her outside life above Dolphin and Marigold, preferring to go out without Dolphin, initially with her former boyfriend, Mark.\n*Marigold Westward \u2013 Marigold Westward is the mother of Star and Dolphin. After she had Star and left Micky, she became the girlfriend of Michael (whom she met at the swimming-pool) for a short time, also calling him Micky, but she was never as keen on him, and got bored of him. She had Dolphin, and left him. Her erratic behaviour makes Star infuriated, while Dolphin is loving towards her mum, while being sometimes frightened.\n*Micky \u2013 Micky is the father of Star and was Marigold's first boyfriend.\n*Oliver Morris \u2013 Oliver Morris is Dolphin's best friend, and wears glasses. He helps Dolphin find her father.\n*Miss Hill \u2013 Dolphin's quite mean teacher, although not completely heartless.\n*Michael \u2013 Michael is the father of Dolphin and was Marigold's second boyfriend, whom she met at the swimming pool. He has a wife and two daughters. He later meets Dolphin when she comes to find him. More sensible than Micky.\n*Mr Harrison \u2013 Mr Harrison is Dolphin's school librarian. He is the kindest school teacher.\n*Aunty Jane \u2013 Aunty Jane is Dolphin's foster mother, and the wife of Uncle Eddie. Although ugly with a red face and short grey hair, she is very sympathetic and kind. She has one son, who is at university, and several younger foster children, who are babies.\n*Ronnie Churley \u2013 Ronnie is the school bully, and picks on Dolphin and Oliver.\n*Kayleigh and Yvonne \u2013 The mean girls at school. They call Dolphin names such as \"Bottle Nose\".\n*Natasha (Tasha) \u2013 Tasha is the most beautiful girl at Dolphin's school, and she is in her class with Miss Hill (although not as pretty as Star) with long blonde hair down to her waist. Dolphin longs to be her friend, but she is not interested.\n*Mrs Luft \u2013 Dolphin, Star and Marigold's grumpy, supercilious neighbour. Mean and disapproving of Dolphin and her family, she does her best to keep out of their way, but she picks on them and makes sneering comments.\n\nThe drama won the [[Children's BAFTA]] award in 2005 for best schools drama, and Debbie Isitt won the award for best adapted writer.\n\n===Cast===\n\n*Dolphin Westward -  [[Alice Connor]]\n*Marigold Westward - [[Michelle Collins]]\n*Star Westward - [[Holly Grainger]]\n*Micky -  [[Con O'Neill (actor)|Con O'Neill]]\n*Oliver Morris - Henry Cox\n*Miss Hill - [[Lisa George]]\n*Mr Harrison - [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]]\n*Tasha - [[Sacha Parkinson]]\n*Mark - [[Luke Bailey (actor)|Luke Bailey]]\n\n== Awards ==\n\nWon the 2004 [[BAFTA]] award for best schools drama.

Set in London, the [[first person narrative]] by a young girl, Dolphin, features her [[bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] mother Marigold, nicknamed \"the illustrated mum\" because of her many tattoos. The title is a reference to ''[[The Illustrated Man]]'', a 1951 book of short stories by [[Ray Bradbury]], also named for [[tattoos]].\n\nWilson and ''The Illustrated Mum'' won the annual [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]], judged by a panel of British children's writers.<ref name=prize2000/><ref name=relaunch/>\n\nBy 2001 translations had been published in Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Spanish, and Catalan.<ref>\n[http://www.worldcat.org/title/illustrated-mum/oclc/59399913/editions?start_edition=1&sd=asc&referer=di&se=yr&qt=sort_yr_asc&editionsView=true&fq= \"Formats and editions of The Illustrated Mum\"]. WorldCat. Retrieved 2 August 2012.</ref>\n[[Delacorte Press]] published the first American edition only in 2005.<ref name=LCC/>\n\n==Plot==\n\nDolphin and her older sister, Star, live with their mother, Marigold, in a small London flat. Marigold, an avid lover of tattoos, suffers from bipolar disorder and also has a drinking problem. Dolphin loves Marigold and thinks she is wonderful and unique, while Star is embarrassed by Marigold's tattoos and erratic behaviour. Dolphin feels like an outsider at school; she is bullied by some classmates and feels her teacher is unkind to her. She also struggles with her [[dyslexia]]. Star appears to be more popular, and Dolphin dislikes the fact that Star has an older boyfriend. Dolphin later befriends Oliver, a shy and studious boy who spends the lunch period in the library to avoid being teased.\n\nMarigold buys tickets to see her favourite band Emerald City, with the intention of finding Micky, Star's father, who Marigold still claims to love. Both girls are surprised when she returns that night with Micky. He was unaware he had a daughter and is thrilled to meet Star, and she adores him in turn. Dolphin dislikes him because she feels that he abandoned Marigold.\n\nMicky sends both the girls presents, and Star goes to spend a weekend with him. Marigold hoped to reconcile romantically with Micky and is upset to hear that he has a girlfriend living with him. Micky hears of Marigold's behaviour and invites both Star and Dolphin to live with him. Dolphin stays loyal to Marigold and refuses to leave her so Star leaves to be with Micky. After Star leaves, Marigold has a mental breakdown and paints herself white using [[toxic]] paint. Dolphin has to phone her an ambulance and finds out that due to her [[mental illness]] she may be in hospital for some time.\n\nWith Marigold in hospital ill and tired, Oliver encourages Dolphin to contact her real father, who she knows nothing about, except that his name is also Micky and he worked as a swimming instructor. She manages to track him down and he's pleased to meet her. Dolphin hopes he will look after her, but he has a wife and daughters already and wants to do things properly, getting in touch with child services so Dolphin can be in [[foster care]] for a while. Dolphin is initially terrified of going into a foster home having heard Marigold's horror stories from her own childhood, but she stays with a kind older woman and several younger children and her father takes her to visit Marigold, who is on medication for [[bipolar disorder]].\n\nStar appears at the foster home after returning to the flat to find both Marigold and Dolphin gone. Star stays in foster care with Dolphin and although they argue at first, they reconcile and go to visit Marigold together. The story ends with Dolphin deciding that even though Marigold is in hospital and she and Star in foster care, they are still a family.\n\n==Adaptation==\n\nThe television drama stars [[Michelle Collins]] as Marigold Westward, and [[Alice Connor]] and [[Holly Grainger]] as her daughters Dolphin and Star. The script was by [[Debbie Isitt]], and it was directed by Cilla Ware. Ware had previously directed the television adaptation of another of Wilson's books, ''[[Double Act (film)|Double Act]]'', and went on to adapt a third, ''Best Friends''.\n\n===Characters===\n\n*Dolphin Westward \u2013 Dolphin Westward is the daughter of Michael and Marigold Westward, and is the opposite of her elder sister Star, or so she believes. Star is beautiful and confident, whereas Dolphin, with her mousy hair and her greyish-green eyes, is shy yet fiery, has no friends at school and worries about things, including her mother Marigold's erratic, somewhat mad behaviour.\n*Star Westward \u2013 Star is the daughter of Micky and Marigold Westward and the elder sister of Dolphin, and she is very beautiful, with long blonde hair and bright blue eyes. Although she loves Dolphin very much, as she got older, she has put her outside life above Dolphin and Marigold, preferring to go out without Dolphin, initially with her former boyfriend, Mark.\n*Marigold Westward \u2013 Marigold Westward is the mother of Star and Dolphin. After she had Star and left Micky, she became the girlfriend of Michael (whom she met at the swimming-pool) for a short time, also calling him Micky, but she was never as keen on him, and got bored of him. She had Dolphin, and left him. Her erratic behaviour makes Star infuriated, while Dolphin is loving towards her mum, while being sometimes frightened.\n*Micky \u2013 Micky is the father of Star and was Marigold's first boyfriend.\n*Oliver Morris \u2013 Oliver Morris is Dolphin's best friend, and wears glasses. He helps Dolphin find her father.\n*Miss Hill \u2013 Dolphin's quite mean teacher, although not completely heartless.\n*Michael \u2013 Michael is the father of Dolphin and was Marigold's second boyfriend, whom she met at the swimming-pool. He has a wife and two daughters. He later meets Dolphin when she comes to find him. More sensible than Micky.\n*Mr Harrison \u2013 Mr Harrison is Dolphin's school librarian. He is the kindest school teacher.\n*Aunty Jane \u2013 Aunty Jane is Dolphin's foster mother, and the wife of Uncle Eddie. Although ugly with a red face and short grey hair, she is very sympathetic and kind. She has one son, who is at university, and several younger foster children, who are babies.\n*Ronnie Churley \u2013 Ronnie is the school bully, and picks on Dolphin and Oliver.\n*Kayleigh and Yvonne \u2013 The mean girls at school. They call Dolphin names such as \"Bottle Nose\".\n*Natasha (Tasha) \u2013 Tasha is the most beautiful girl at Dolphin's school, and she is in her class with Miss Hill (although not as pretty as Star) with long blonde hair down to her waist. Dolphin longs to be her friend, but she is not interested.\n*Mrs Luft \u2013 Dolphin, Star and Marigold's grumpy, supercilious neighbour. Mean and disapproving of Dolphin and her family, she does her best to keep out of their way, but she picks on them and makes sneering comments.\n\nThe drama won the [[Children's BAFTA]] award in 2005 for best schools drama, and Debbie Isitt won the award for best adapted writer.\n\n===Cast===\n\n*Dolphin Westward -  [[Alice Connor]]\n*Marigold Westward - [[Michelle Collins]]\n*Star Westward - [[Holly Grainger]]\n*Micky -  [[Con O'Neill (actor)|Con O'Neill]]\n*Oliver Morris - Henry Cox\n*Miss Hill - [[Lisa George]]\n*Mr Harrison - [[John Elkington (business author)|John Elkington]]\n*Tasha - [[Sacha Parkinson]]\n*Mark - [[Luke Bailey (actor)|Luke Bailey]]\n\n== Awards ==\n\nWon the 2004 [[BAFTA]] award for best schools drama.
