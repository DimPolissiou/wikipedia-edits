Flumazenil effectively blocks the effects of benzodiazepine agonists such as [[alprazolam]] and [[diazepam]] and so is used for treating [[overdoses]] of these drugs but is ineffective in blocking alcohol actions. Ro15-4513 was somewhat less effective than flumazenil at blocking the effects of benzodiazepines, but instead selectively blocked the effects of [[ethanol]]. This meant that in contrast to flumazenil, which is ineffective at treating alcohol overdoses, Ro15-4513 showed potential as a useful alcohol antidote. It is thought that Ro15-4513 antagonizes the effects of ethanol because the [[azido]] group at the 8- position of the benzene ring blocks the binding site for ethanol on the \u03b15\u03b23\u03b4 subtype of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor]]; flumazenil, which has a fluorine at this position, does not block this binding site and so does not counteract the effects of ethanol.\n\nUnfortunately Ro15-4513 had several disadvantages that made it unsuitable for development and marketing. Its fairly short half-life means that several repeated doses would have to be given over an extended period, since if only one dose were used it would wear off before the alcohol had been metabolised and the patient would relapse (similar to the problems with renarcotization seen when treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as [[methadone]] with short-acting antagonists such as [[naloxone]]). Also because of its GABA antagonist effects, Ro15-4513 causes serious side-effects including both [[anxiety]], and at higher doses, [[convulsions]], which would require careful control of dosing and would cause complications in clinical use. Another problem is that alcohol's effects are not purely mediated by GABA receptors; at higher doses alcohol binds to several other targets as well, so while Ro15-4513 is an effective antidote against moderate levels of alcohol intoxication, it might be ineffective at treating life-threatening overdoses.\n\nAlso, Roche was concerned about the legal implications of introducing an alcohol antidote, as Ro15-4513 blocks the effects of ethanol but does not remove it from the bloodstream, which could lead to potential problems, as the effects of the alcohol would be masked only temporarily. As a result, patients might, for instance, feel that they are sober and discharge themselves from hospital once the drug took effect, then become drunk again once it wore off, possibly crashing their car or having other accidents that might lead to legal consequences for Roche.\n\nHowever, the discovery of Ro15-4513 has been important in elucidating the mechanism of action of ethanol as used as a recreational drug, and this compound could now be used as a template to design a more effective and longer-lasting antidote for ethanol, or alternatively to develop a selective agonist drug that could replicate the desired effects of alcohol, but with fewer side effects.\n\n===Current use in PET Imaging===\nLabelling Ro15-4513 with [[carbon-11]] leads to the possibility of its use in [[PET imaging]] of the brain. The specificity of the compound to a small number of GABA receptor sub-types leads to the generation, with accurate modelling, of detailed images with well-defined [[limbic]] and cortical structures. These images can be useful in quantitatively analysing conditions such as addiction, that are known to be, at least in part, associated with the GABAergic system. The images produced are similar to those for labelled flumazenil, though the distribution varies especially in regions such as the [[occipital lobe]], [[cerebellum]], and [[basal ganglia]], as it does not selectively label the [[GABRA1]] subtype.<ref name=\"pmid8148363\">{{cite journal | author = Sieghart W | title = Pharmacology of benzodiazepine receptors: an update | journal = J Psychiatry Neurosci | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 24\u20139 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8148363 | doi = | pmc = 1188559 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid2457076\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mehta AK, Ticku MK | title = Ethanol potentiation of GABAergic transmission in cultured spinal cord neurons involves gamma-aminobutyric acidA-gated chloride channels | journal = J.

{"title_page": "Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n'''Christopher St Lawrence, 8th Baron Howth''' (died 1589) was an Irish  politician and [[peerage|peer]]. He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and played a leading part in  the Government  of Ireland in the 1560s; but he  later went into opposition and was imprisoned as a result.  He was nicknamed the '''Blind Lord'''.\n\nHe was a man of considerable  intelligence and  learning,   who  may have  written part of  the historical compilation called ''The Book of Howth''.  On the other hand, he was notorious for his domestic cruelty: he was imprisoned  briefly and fined for ill-treating his wife and for  causing  the death of his teenage daughter through his  brutal  treatment of her.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born  sometime after 1509, the third of the four sons of  [[Christopher St Lawrence, 5th Baron Howth]] and  his wife Anne Bermingham. He was the  brother of Edward St Lawrence, 6th Baron Howth  and [[Richard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Christopher (d.1589)|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|volume=50}}</ref>  Since he was a younger son without much prospect of inheriting the title, not  a great deal  is recorded of his early years. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1544 and was practising at the [[English bar]] ten years later: his legal knowledge later made him an effective leader of the opposition to the Crown's policies. It is not known when he was afflicted with blindness, nor whether he went  totally blind.  By 1556 he had returned to Ireland and was managing one of the family estates.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> He succeeded to the [[baron]]y in 1558 on the death of his brother Richard without issue.\n\n== Politician ==\n\n[[Image:Thomas Radclyffe Earl of Sussex.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and a key ally of Lord Howth]]\n\nThe [[Baron Howth|Baron of Howth]] was always well positioned  to play a major part in Irish politics: Christopher  had the additional advantage of enjoying the trust of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|the Earl of Sussex]]. He was made a member of the Privy Council immediately after the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] and sat in her first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1560. Sussex sent him to negotiate with [[S\u00e9an \u00d3 N\u00e9ill|Shane O'Neill]], the effective ruler of [[Ulster]],   in 1561:   Howth  persuaded O'Neill  to go to London and submit himself  to the Queen's mercy.  Howth himself went to London the following year to discuss Irish affairs with the Queen. By his own  account Elizabeth  at first treated him with great suspicion,  simply because he was an Irishman,<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> but he succeeded in winning her trust. He was confirmed in the title  Baron of Howth and later [[knighted]]. After Sussex's recall from Ireland  he continued to enjoy the confidence of the [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], [[Sir Nicholas Arnold]], who sent him to negotiate  with the O'Reilly clan.\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThe 1570s were a time of  conflict between Sussex's successor as  Lord Deputy, Sir [[Henry Sidney]], and the Anglo-Irish nobility over his taxation policies,  and especially over the ''cess'', the tax for maintaining garrisons. Howth, despite his previous record of loyalty to the Crown, emerged as  one of the leaders  of the opposition, and gave grave offence to the Queen as a result. Summoned before the Council, he argued that according to  his understanding  of the law  (and he was of course a qualified [[barrister]]) Sidney's proposals were [[unconstitutional]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months in [[Dublin Castle]], and then made a full submission to the Crown, arguing that he had never intended to question the [[Royal Prerogative]] or the Queen's power to tax her Irish subjects. After a sharp rebuke he was  allowed to go free,   but it is unlikely that he was ever fully trusted again, and it may be that his later prosecution for domestic cruelty had political motives behind it.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n== Charges of domestic cruelty ==\n\nIn 1579 Nicholas Terrell, a servant of Lord Howth, was convicted of [[perjury]]. In the course of the trial  there was a good deal of evidence  about Howth's cruelty to his wife, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], ordered a further investigation into these allegations,  which resulted in a full hearing before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]]. It is not  entirely clear why  Castle Chamber, which in theory  dealt  only with cases of  riot and  other offences against public order, intervened in a private  family law case (although in  practice Castle  Chamber did hear many  private lawsuits).\n\nThe evidence showed that Howth had assaulted his wife so often and  so severely that she had fled in fear of her life and taken refuge with  her brother. On  one occasion he had beaten her so badly that she had been unable to leave her bed for two weeks, and he had given her another  severe beating before she had  fully recovered from the first.<ref>''Dublin Penny Journal''  August 24, 1833</ref> Even more serious was the evidence that he had beaten his 13-year-old daughter Jane so badly  that she died as a result- \"some said he gave her  forty strokes, some said sixty, on her bare back\". Howth  in his defence  pleaded that Jane had died of a fever, unrelated to the beatings, which he admitted  to having administered.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\">''Dublin Penny Journal'' 1833</ref>\n\nHowth was found guilty of both charges. He was  sentenced to a brief term of imprisonment and  fined heavily; he was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife, who was allowed to live apart from him and was  given [[child custody|custody]]  of the children. While the Government in imposing these penalties may have intended  to rebuke Howth for his opposition to its taxation policy, the verdict also suggests that the Court felt  genuine sympathy for Lady Howth.<ref>Crawford , Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641''  Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\n\nIn the 1580s Howth briefly resumed his role as leader of the opposition,  and succeeded in temporarily  blocking further proposals for tax reform by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir John Perrot]]. On this occasion he was quickly brought to admit his faults : he was reconciled with Perrot, and sent him a present of a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], a bird which has always been a great  rarity in Ireland.\n\nHe died on 24 October 1589 and was buried in Howth Abbey; his [[tomb]] has  an effigy to himself and his first wife. His last [[will (law)|will]] made generous [[bequests]] to servants but none of his children, except his eldest son, received anything. The reference in the will to his ''many and grave sins'' has led some to suggest that he felt  genuine remorse for his ill-treatment of his wife and daughter.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n== The Book of Howth ==\n\nHe owned a manuscript, the ''Book of Howth'', which is  a historical source of considerable  value. It is partly a celebration of the achievements of the St. Lawrence family and partly a description of historical events such as the [[Battle of Knockdoe]]. The last part deals in detail with Howth's own career and may well have been written by him.\n\n== Legend of Granuaile ==\n\nA famous legend, which may have some basis in fact, records that about 1575 [[Grace O'Malley]], or [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway, called at [[Howth Castle]] only to find the gates barred. Outraged by the discourtesy, she kidnapped Lord Howth's heir, then a young child (this would probably have been the 8th Baron's grandson, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]) and held him [[hostage]]  until the St. Lawrence family apologised for their lack of hospitality.  To make amends Lord Howth promised that in future his gates would always be open at dinner time and a place  would be set at table  for unexpected guests, a tradition which later generations maintained.\n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\n== Character ==\n\nElrington Ball<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> calls  the eighth Lord Howth the most striking member of his family and the most forceful Irish statesman of the Elizabethan era. He does not defend his ill- treatment of his wife and daughter, but argues,  rather unconvincingly, that the early years of his marriage were  probably happy enough.  Crawford<ref>''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland''</ref> takes a much more severe view of Howth's  faults, arguing that  his killing of his daughter Jane  was certainly at least [[manslaughter]], and possibly  [[murder]], and  notes that her mother  was forced to flee from home in order to avoid a similar fate.\n\n== Family ==\n[[Image:Beaulieu House, Co.

He was a member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]], and played a leading part in  the Government  of Ireland in the 1560s; but he  later went into opposition and was imprisoned as a result.  He was nicknamed the '''Blind Lord'''.\n\nHe was a man of considerable  intelligence and  learning,   who  may have  written part of  the historical compilation called ''The Book of Howth''.  On the other hand, he was notorious for his domestic cruelty: he was imprisoned  briefly and fined for ill-treating his wife and for  causing  the death of his teenage daughter through his  brutal  treatment of her.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nHe was born  sometime after 1509, the third of the four sons of  [[Christopher St Lawrence, 5th Baron Howth]] and  his wife Anne Bermingham. He was the  brother of Edward St Lawrence, 6th Baron Howth  and [[Richard St Lawrence, 7th Baron Howth]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=St. Lawrence, Christopher (d.1589)|last=Dunlop|first=Robert|volume=50}}</ref>  Since he was a younger son without much prospect of inheriting the title, not  a great deal  is recorded of his early years. He entered [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1544 and was practising at the [[English bar]] ten years later: his legal knowledge later made him an effective leader of the opposition to the Crown's policies. It is not known when he was afflicted with blindness, nor whether he went  totally blind.  By 1556 he had returned to Ireland and was managing one of the family estates.<ref>Ball F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' 6 Volumes Alexander Thom and Co Dublin 1902\u20131920</ref> He succeeded to the [[baron]]y in 1558 on the death of his brother Richard without issue.\n\n== Politician ==\n\n[[Image:Thomas Radclyffe Earl of Sussex.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex]], [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], and a key ally of Lord Howth]]\n\nThe [[Baron Howth|Baron of Howth]] was always well positioned  to play a major part in Irish politics: Christopher  had the additional advantage of enjoying the trust of the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], [[Thomas Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex|the Earl of Sussex]]. He was made a member of the Privy Council immediately after the accession of [[Elizabeth I]] and sat in her first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] in 1560. Sussex sent him to negotiate with [[S\u00e9an \u00d3 N\u00e9ill|Shane O'Neill]], the effective ruler of [[Ulster]],   in 1561:   Howth  persuaded O'Neill  to go to London and submit himself  to the Queen's mercy.  Howth himself went to London the following year to discuss Irish affairs with the Queen. By his own  account Elizabeth  at first treated him with great suspicion,  simply because he was an Irishman,<ref>Ball  ''History of Dublin''</ref> but he succeeded in winning her trust. He was confirmed in the title  Baron of Howth and later [[knighted]]. After Sussex's recall from Ireland  he continued to enjoy the confidence of the [[Lord Justice of Ireland]], [[Sir Nicholas Arnold]], who sent him to negotiate  with the O'Reilly clan.\n\n== Opposition ==\n\nThe 1570s were a time of  conflict between Sussex's successor as  Lord Deputy, Sir [[Henry Sidney]], and the Anglo-Irish nobility over his taxation policies,  and especially over the ''cess'', the tax for maintaining garrisons. Howth, despite his previous record of loyalty to the Crown, emerged as  one of the leaders  of the opposition, and gave grave offence to the Queen as a result. Summoned before the Council, he argued that according to  his understanding  of the law  (and he was of course a qualified [[barrister]]) Sidney's proposals were [[unconstitutional]]. He was imprisoned for 5 months in [[Dublin Castle]], and then made a full submission to the Crown, arguing that he had never intended to question the [[Royal Prerogative]] or the Queen's power to tax her Irish subjects. After a sharp rebuke he was  allowed to go free,   but it is unlikely that he was ever fully trusted again, and it may be that his later prosecution for domestic cruelty had political motives behind it.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\n== Charges of domestic cruelty ==\n\nIn 1579 Nicholas Terrell, a servant of Lord Howth, was convicted of [[perjury]]. In the course of the trial  there was a good deal of evidence  about Howth's cruelty to his wife, and the [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]], Sir [[William Gerard (Lord Chancellor of Ireland)|William Gerard]], ordered a further investigation into these allegations,  which resulted in a full hearing before the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]]. It is not  entirely clear why  Castle Chamber, which in theory  dealt  only with cases of  riot and  other offences against public order, intervened in a private  family law case (although in  practice Castle  Chamber did hear many  private lawsuits).\n\nThe evidence showed that Howth had assaulted his wife so often and  so severely that she had fled in fear of her life and taken refuge with  her brother. On  one occasion he had beaten her so badly that she had been unable to leave her bed for two weeks, and he had given her another  severe beating before she had  fully recovered from the first.<ref>''Dublin Penny Journal''  August 24, 1833</ref> Even more serious was the evidence that he had beaten his 13-year-old daughter Jane so badly  that she died as a result- \"some said he gave her  forty strokes, some said sixty, on her bare back\". Howth  in his defence  pleaded that Jane had died of a fever, unrelated to the beatings, which he admitted  to having administered.<ref name=\"Dublin Penny Journal 1833\">''Dublin Penny Journal'' 1833</ref>\n\nHowth was found guilty of both charges. He was  sentenced to a brief term of imprisonment and  fined heavily; he was ordered to pay maintenance to his wife, who was allowed to live apart from him and was  given [[child custody|custody]]  of the children. While the Government in imposing these penalties may have intended  to rebuke Howth for his opposition to its taxation policy, the verdict also suggests that the Court felt  genuine sympathy for Lady Howth.<ref>Crawford , Jon G. ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641''  Four Courts Press Dublin 2006</ref>\n\n== Last years ==\n\nIn the 1580s Howth briefly resumed his role as leader of the opposition,  and succeeded in temporarily  blocking further proposals for tax reform by the Lord Deputy, [[Sir John Perrot]]. On this occasion he was quickly brought to admit his faults : he was reconciled with Perrot, and sent him a present of a [[Northern goshawk|goshawk]], a bird which has always been a great  rarity in Ireland.\n\nHe died on 24 October 1589 and was buried in Howth Abbey; his [[tomb]] has  an effigy to himself and his first wife. His last [[will (law)|will]] made generous [[bequests]] to servants but none of his children, except his eldest son, received anything. The reference in the will to his ''many and grave sins'' has led some to suggest that he felt  genuine remorse for his ill-treatment of his wife and daughter.<ref>Ball ''History of Dublin''</ref>\n\n== The Book of Howth ==\n\nHe owned a manuscript, the ''Book of Howth'', which is  a historical source of considerable  value. It is partly a celebration of the achievements of the St. Lawrence family and partly a description of historical events such as the [[Battle of Knockdoe]]. The last part deals in detail with Howth's own career and may well have been written by him.\n\n== Legend of Granuaile ==\n\nA famous legend, which may have some basis in fact, records that about 1575 [[Grace O'Malley]], or [[Granuaile]], the celebrated Pirate Queen of Galway, called at [[Howth Castle]] only to find the gates barred. Outraged by the discourtesy, she kidnapped Lord Howth's heir, then a young child (this would probably have been the 8th Baron's grandson, [[Christopher St Lawrence, 10th Baron Howth]]) and held him [[hostage]]  until the St. Lawrence family apologised for their lack of hospitality.  To make amends Lord Howth promised that in future his gates would always be open at dinner time and a place  would be set at table  for unexpected guests, a tradition which later generations maintained.\n\n[[Image:Howth Castle.jpg|thumb|Howth Castle]]\n\n== Character ==\n\nElrington Ball<ref>''History of Dublin''</ref> calls  the eighth Lord Howth the most striking member of his family and the most forceful Irish statesman of the Elizabethan era. He does not defend his ill- treatment of his wife and daughter, but argues,  rather unconvincingly, that the early years of his marriage were  probably happy enough.  Crawford<ref>''A Star Chamber Court in  Ireland''</ref> takes a much more severe view of Howth's  faults, arguing that  his killing of his daughter Jane  was certainly at least [[manslaughter]], and possibly  [[murder]], and  notes that her mother  was forced to flee from home in order to avoid a similar fate.\n\n== Family ==\n[[Image:Beaulieu House, Co.

{"title_page": "Physical theatre", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{use British English|date=November 2017}}\n'''Physical theatre''' is a genre of theatrical performance that encompasses [[storytelling]] primarily through physical movement. Although several performance theatre disciplines are often described as \"physical theatre,\" the genre's characteristic aspect is a reliance on the performers' physical motion rather than, or combined with, text to convey storytelling. Performers can communicate through various body gestures (including using the body to portray emotions).\n\n==Common elements==\nCertain institutions suggest that all physical theatre genres share common characteristics, although individual performances do not need to exhibit all such characteristics to be defined as physical theatre. Research into the training or \"work\" of physical theatre artists cites an amalgamation of numerous elements adopted as a means to further inform the theatrical research/production. These elements include:<ref name=Callery />\n|Devised]] origins, rather than originated from\n\n* Inter-disciplinary origins, spanning music, dance, visual art, etc., as well as theatre\n* Challenging the traditional, [[proscenium|proscenium arch]], and the traditional performer/audience relationship (also known as [[fourth wall|\"breaking the fourth wall\"]]).\n* Encouraging audience participation, any interaction that occurs physically throughout the course of a performance.\n\nSome practitioners, such as [[Lloyd Newson]],<ref name=Callery /> despite being the first company to incorporate the term Physical Theater into his company's title (DV8 Physical Theater), has expressed concern that the expression is now being used as a \"miscellaneous\" category, which includes anything that does not fall neatly into literary dramatic theater or contemporary dance. He is also frustrated that many companies and performers who describe what they do as physical theatre lack physical skills, training and/or expertise in movement. As such, contemporary theatre approaches (including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, post-dramatic performance, etc.), while having their own distinct definitions, are often simply labelled \"physical theatre\" for no other reason than they are unusual in some way.\n\nDance that is of a theatrical nature can also be problematic. A dance piece may be called \"physical theatre\" simply because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative. However, although it is theatrical and physical, it may not necessarily share anything in common with the physical theatre tradition.\n\n==Modern physical theatre==\nA modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. [[Mime]] and theatrical clowning schools, such as [[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]] in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as [[Steven Berkoff]] and [[John Wright (theatre director)|John Wright]] received their initial [[training]] at such institutions. [[Contemporary dance]] has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a certain level of physical control and flexibility. These qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as ''[[Commedia dell'arte]]'', and some suggest links to the [[ancient greek theatre]], particularly the theatre of [[Aristophanes]].\n\nAnother physical theatre tradition started with the French master [[Etienne Decroux]] (father of [[corporeal mime]]). Decroux's aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor, allowing the creation of a more [[Metaphor|metaphorical theatre]]. This tradition has grown, and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools.\n\n[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]], a teacher out of the lineage of [[Etienne Decroux]], has this to say about physical theatre:\n<blockquote>'I think physical theatre is much more visceral and audiences are affected much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theatre is a live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I know of. Live theatre, where real human beings are standing in front of real human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else that we partake of in our lives. I don\u2019t think we could do it the same way if we were doing literary-based theatre.'<ref>[http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php  Interview with Daniel Stein] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030620230205/http://www.communityarts.net/readingroom/archive/perfcomm/dellarte/interviews/dellarte-stein.php |date=2003-06-20 }}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\nArguably, the point at which physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when [[Jean-Louis Barrault]] (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher's notion that the mime should be silent.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as \"[[Total Theatre]]\" and Barrault advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. He viewed each element as equally important, and believed that each should be explored for their possibilities.\n\nBarrault was a member of [[Michel Saint-Denis]]'s company, alongside [[Antonin Artaud]].<ref>[http://www.weeblsstuff.com]</ref> Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the [[proscenium arch]] is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience.\n\n[[Eastern theatre]] traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of [[Bali]]nese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Joan Littlewood]] have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. [[Tadashi Suzuki]] drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through [[Anne Bogart]]'s collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the [[Viewpoints]] method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the [[Butoh]] Movement, which originated from [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]] contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.)\n\nBesides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of [[naturalism (theater)|naturalism]],<ref name=Callery>{{cite book\n|last = Callery\n|first = Dympha\n|title = Through the Body: A practical guide to Physical Theatre\n|year = 2001\n|publisher = Nick Hern Books\n|location = London\n|ISBN = 1-85459-630-6\n|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbEa2gowoFQC}}</ref> and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work.\n\nContemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with [[Rudolf von Laban]]. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the [[Dance Theatre|Tanzteater]] of [[Pina Bausch]] and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the [[postmodern dance]] movement of the [[Judson Dance Theater|Judson Church Dance]] also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and [[Somatic technique|somatic]] training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, [[Steve Paxton]] taught theatre students at [[Dartington College of Arts]] and other institutions.\n\n==Notable performers==\nPhysical theatre companies and practitioners include:\n[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Pantomime Pablo Zibes]]\n\n===Companies===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n*[[Canadian Deaf Theatre]]\n*[[Chotto Ookii Theatre Company]]\n*[[Complicite]]\n*[[DEREVO]]\n*[[Double Edge Theatre]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Familie Fl\u00f6z]]\n*[[Frantic Assembly]]\n*[[Gamarjobat]]\n*[[Gecko (theatre company)|Gecko]]\n*[[Hoipolloi]]\n*[[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]]\n*[[Kage Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Kneehigh Theatre]]\n*[[Legs On The Wall]]\n*[[Margolis Brown Adaptors Company]]\n*[[Mondo Bizarro]]\n*[[Motionhouse]]\n*[[Shared Experience]]\n*[[Spymonkey]]\n*[[Synetic Theater (Arlington, Virginia)|Synetic Theater]]\n*[[Theatre de l'Ange Fou]]\n*[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil]]\n*[[Theo Adams|Theo Adams Company]]\n*[[Trestle Theatre]]\n*[[The Umbilical Brothers]]\n*[[Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Practitioners===\n<!-- Alphabetize by last name -->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Theo Adams]]\n*[[Antonin Artaud]]\n*[[Pina Bausch]]\n*[[Steven Berkoff]]\n*[[Anne Bogart]]\n*[[Wolfe Bowart]]\n*[[Lynne Bradley]]\n*[[Les Bubb]]\n*[[Janet Carafa]]\n*[[Romeo Castellucci]]\n*[[Kate Champion]]\n*[[Alan Clay]]\n*[[Carlo Mazzone-Clementi]]\n*[[Adam Darius]]\n*[[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]\n*[[Avner the Eccentric]]\n*[[Antonio Fava]]\n*[[Philippe Gaulier]]\n*[[Niranjan Goswami]]\n*[[Jerzy Grotowski]]\n*[http://davidglassensemble.org/ David Glass]\n*[[Kathryn Hunter]]\n*[[Lindsay Kemp]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/stacy-klein Stacy Klein]\n*[[Ireneusz Krosny]]\n*[[Thomas Leabhart]]\n*[[Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[Peta Lily]]\n*[[Marcel Marceau]]\n*[[Linda Marlowe]]\n*[[Petra Massey]]\n*[[Johnny Melville]]\n*[[Matt Mitler]]\n*[[Thomas Monckton]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre|Lloyd Newson]]\n*[[Dimitris Papaioannou]]\n*[[Robin Patterson]]\n*[[Adrian Pecknold]]\n*[[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]\n*[https://leandreclown.com/ Leandre Ribena] \n*[http://gavinrobins.wixsite.com/gavin-robins Gavin Robins]\n*[[Bill Robison]]\n*[http://alseed.net/about/ Al Seed]\n*[[Richmond Shepard]]\n*[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]]\n*[[Julie Taymor]]\n*[[James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e]]\n*[[Henryk Tomaszewski (mime)|Henryk Tomaszewski]]\n*[[Steven Wasson]]\n*[[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]\n*[[Vahram Zaryan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Institutes and training programmes===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[American Mime Theatre]]\n*[[Circomedia]]\n*[[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/ Double Edge Theatre]\n*[http://www.lassaad.com/gb/?page=0 \u00c9cole LASSAAD School of Theatre] \n*[http://www.physicalityinacting.com Ostrenko Brothers Physical Theatre Intensives]\n*[http://duende-ensemble.com/duende-school-of-ensemble-physical-theatre/ Duende School of Ensemble Physical Theatre]\n*[http://www.iugte.com/projects IUGTE Physical Theatre Workshops]\n*[[East 15]] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00337/1/ba-physical-theatre)\n*[https://www.franticignition.co.uk/ Frantic Assembly's Ignition Programme]\n*[https://www.folkwang-uni.de/en/home/theater/courses-of-studies/physical-theatre/ Folkwang University of the Arts]\n*[[Fourth Monkey Actor Training Company]]\n*[http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/ Headlong Performance Institute]\n*[[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[London International School of Performing Arts]]\n*[https://www.margolismethod.org/ Margolis Method Center]\n*[http://www.moveo.cat/en/ Moveo]\n*[http://pigironschool.org/school Pig Iron School for Advanced Training]\n*[http://www.theschoolfortheatrecreators.com/ The School of Theatre Creators]\n*[http://evoe.pt/ EVO\u00c9 - Actors School and Physical Theatre]\n*[https://www.zenzenzo.com Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corporeal mime]]\n*[[Mime artist]]\n*[[Pantomime]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n{{commonscat}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Artaud, Antonin;

Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the [[proscenium arch]] is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience.\n\n[[Eastern theatre]] traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese [[Noh]] tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of [[Bali]]nese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [[Peter Brook]], [[Jacques Copeau]] and [[Joan Littlewood]] have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. [[Tadashi Suzuki]] drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through [[Anne Bogart]]'s collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the [[Viewpoints]] method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the [[Butoh]] Movement, which originated from [[Tatsumi Hijikata]] and [[Kazuo Ohno]] contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq's mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.)\n\nBesides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of [[naturalism (theater)|naturalism]],<ref name=Callery>{{cite book\n|last = Callery\n|first = Dympha\n|title = Through the Body: A practical guide to Physical Theatre\n|year = 2001\n|publisher = Nick Hern Books\n|location = London\n|ISBN = 1-85459-630-6\n|url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mbEa2gowoFQC}}</ref> and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work.\n\nContemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with [[Rudolf von Laban]]. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the [[Dance Theatre|Tanzteater]] of [[Pina Bausch]] and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the [[postmodern dance]] movement of the [[Judson Dance Theater|Judson Church Dance]] also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and [[Somatic technique|somatic]] training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, [[Steve Paxton]] taught theatre students at [[Dartington College of Arts]] and other institutions.\n\n==Notable performers==\nPhysical theatre companies and practitioners include:\n[[File:PANTOMIME-PABLO.jpg|thumb|200px|Pantomime Pablo Zibes]]\n\n===Companies===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n\n*[[Canadian Deaf Theatre]]\n*[[Chotto Ookii Theatre Company]]\n*[[Complicite]]\n*[[DEREVO]]\n*[[Double Edge Theatre]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Familie Fl\u00f6z]]\n*[[Frantic Assembly]]\n*[[Gamarjobat]]\n*[[Gecko (theatre company)|Gecko]]\n*[[Hoipolloi]]\n*[[Horse and Bamboo Theatre]]\n*[[Kage Physical Theatre]]\n*[[Kneehigh Theatre]]\n*[[Legs On The Wall]]\n*[[Margolis Brown Adaptors Company]]\n*[[Mondo Bizarro]]\n*[[Motionhouse]]\n*[[Shared Experience]]\n*[[Spymonkey]]\n*[[Synetic Theater (Arlington, Virginia)|Synetic Theater]]\n*[[Theatre de l'Ange Fou]]\n*[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Soleil]]\n*[[Theo Adams|Theo Adams Company]]\n*[[Trestle Theatre]]\n*[[The Umbilical Brothers]]\n*[[Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Practitioners===\n<!-- Alphabetize by last name -->\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Theo Adams]]\n*[[Antonin Artaud]]\n*[[Pina Bausch]]\n*[[Steven Berkoff]]\n*[[Anne Bogart]]\n*[[Wolfe Bowart]]\n*[[Lynne Bradley]]\n*[[Les Bubb]]\n*[[Janet Carafa]]\n*[[Romeo Castellucci]]\n*[[Kate Champion]]\n*[[Alan Clay]]\n*[[Carlo Mazzone-Clementi]]\n*[[Adam Darius]]\n*[[\u00c9tienne Decroux]]\n*[[Avner the Eccentric]]\n*[[Antonio Fava]]\n*[[Philippe Gaulier]]\n*[[Niranjan Goswami]]\n*[[Jerzy Grotowski]]\n*[http://davidglassensemble.org/ David Glass]\n*[[Kathryn Hunter]]\n*[[Lindsay Kemp]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/stacy-klein Stacy Klein]\n*[[Ireneusz Krosny]]\n*[[Thomas Leabhart]]\n*[[Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[Peta Lily]]\n*[[Marcel Marceau]]\n*[[Linda Marlowe]]\n*[[Petra Massey]]\n*[[Johnny Melville]]\n*[[Matt Mitler]]\n*[[Thomas Monckton]]\n*[[DV8 Physical Theatre|Lloyd Newson]]\n*[[Dimitris Papaioannou]]\n*[[Robin Patterson]]\n*[[Adrian Pecknold]]\n*[[Jami Reid-Quarrell]]\n*[https://leandreclown.com/ Leandre Ribena] \n*[http://gavinrobins.wixsite.com/gavin-robins Gavin Robins]\n*[[Bill Robison]]\n*[http://alseed.net/about/ Al Seed]\n*[[Richmond Shepard]]\n*[[Daniel Stein (mime)|Daniel Stein]]\n*[[Julie Taymor]]\n*[[James Thi\u00e9rr\u00e9e]]\n*[[Henryk Tomaszewski (mime)|Henryk Tomaszewski]]\n*[[Steven Wasson]]\n*[[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]\n*[[Vahram Zaryan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Institutes and training programmes===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[American Mime Theatre]]\n*[[Circomedia]]\n*[[Dell'Arte International School of Physical Theatre]]\n*[https://doubleedgetheatre.org/ Double Edge Theatre]\n*[http://www.lassaad.com/gb/?page=0 \u00c9cole LASSAAD School of Theatre] \n*[http://www.physicalityinacting.com Ostrenko Brothers Physical Theatre Intensives]\n*[http://duende-ensemble.com/duende-school-of-ensemble-physical-theatre/ Duende School of Ensemble Physical Theatre]\n*[http://www.iugte.com/projects IUGTE Physical Theatre Workshops]\n*[[East 15]] (https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/ug00337/1/ba-physical-theatre)\n*[https://www.franticignition.co.uk/ Frantic Assembly's Ignition Programme]\n*[https://www.folkwang-uni.de/en/home/theater/courses-of-studies/physical-theatre/ Folkwang University of the Arts]\n*[[Fourth Monkey Actor Training Company]]\n*[http://www.headlongperformanceinstitute.org/ Headlong Performance Institute]\n*[[L'\u00c9cole Internationale de Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Jacques Lecoq]]\n*[[London International School of Performing Arts]]\n*[https://www.margolismethod.org/ Margolis Method Center]\n*[http://www.moveo.cat/en/ Moveo]\n*[http://pigironschool.org/school Pig Iron School for Advanced Training]\n*[http://www.theschoolfortheatrecreators.com/ The School of Theatre Creators]\n*[http://evoe.pt/ EVO\u00c9 - Actors School and Physical Theatre]\n*[https://www.zenzenzo.com Zen Zen Zo Physical Theatre]\n\n\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Corporeal mime]]\n*[[Mime artist]]\n*[[Pantomime]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n{{commonscat}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Artaud, Antonin;

Directed by [[Guy Ritchie]], from a script he co-wrote with [[John August]], it is a [[live-action]] adaptation of Disney's [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|1992 animated film of the same name]], which itself is based on the [[Aladdin|eponymous tale]] from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''.<ref name=\"PressKit\"/>{{efn|name=Origins}} The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Mena Massoud]], [[Naomi Scott]], [[Marwan Kenzari]], [[Navid Negahban]], [[Nasim Pedrad]], [[Billy Magnussen]], and [[Numan Acar]], as well as the voices of [[Alan Tudyk]] and [[Frank Welker]]. The plot follows [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]], a street urchin, as he falls in love with [[Princess Jasmine]], befriends a wish-granting [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]], and battles the wicked [[Jafar (Disney)|Jafar]].\n\nIn October 2016, Disney announced Ritchie would direct a live-action ''Aladdin'' remake. Smith was the first member of the cast to join, signing on to portray Genie in July 2017, and Massoud and Scott were confirmed for the two lead roles later that month. [[Principal photography]] began that September at [[Longcross Studios]] in [[Surrey]], England, also filming in the [[Wadi Rum|Wadi Rum Desert]] in Jordan, and lasted until January 2018. Additional filming and [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] took place in August 2018.\n\n''Aladdin'' was theatrically released in the United States on May 24, 2019. It grossed $1 billion worldwide, becoming the [[2019 in film#Highest-grossing films|ninth-highest-grossing film of 2019]], and the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing films|<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!-->34th<!--This is the peak position the film attained, not the current, don't adjust!--> highest-grossing film of all-time]] during its theatrical run. The film received mixed reviews from critics; while the musical score, costumes and performances of Smith, Massoud and Scott were praised, criticisms were aimed at Ritchie's direction, the CGI effects, the deviations from the original film and Kenzari's performance as Jafar.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| title=\u2018Aladdin\u2019 Remake Rubs Critics Differently, From \u2018Rip-Roaring Spectacle\u2019 to \u2018Cinematic Karaoke\u2019| author=Brian Welk| website=[[TheWrap]]| date=May 22, 2019| accessdate=May 22, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190522183634/https://www.thewrap.com/aladdin-remake-rubs-critics-differently-from-rip-roaring-spectacle-to-cinematic-karaoke/| archive-date=May 22, 2019| url-status=live}}</ref> A sequel is in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. -->\nAladdin, a kind-hearted [[street urchin]], living in the Arabian city of Agrabah along with his pet [[monkey]] ([[Tufted capuchin]]) Abu, rescues and befriends Princess Jasmine, who has snuck out of the palace to explore, tired of her sheltered life. Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie / Mariner]]: <br />A comedically eccentric and kindly [[jinn]] who has the power to grant three wishes to whoever possesses his magic lamp.

Meanwhile, the [[grand vizier]], Jafar, schemes to overthrow Jasmine's father as the Sultan with the support of Iago, his sardonic pet parrot. He seeks a [[magic lamp]] hidden in the Cave of Wonders that will grant him three wishes. He has been unable to retrieve the lamp himself because only \"the diamond in the rough\" is allowed to enter the cave.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin is the diamond in the rough and when Aladdin sneaks back into the royal palace to talk to Jasmine (while also meeting Jasmine's [[handmaiden]] Dalia, and pet tiger Rajah), he is captured and persuaded by Jafar's deal to help him retrieve the lamp: since only Aladdin can enter the cave alive, he will retrieve the lamp for Jafar and Jafar will make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine. Jafar warns Aladdin not to take anything but the lamp. Inside the cave, Aladdin finds a [[magic carpet]] and obtains the lamp, but Abu accidentally causes the cave to collapse after he catches a falling ruby. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, but he double-crosses Aladdin and kicks him and Abu back into the cave, though Abu steals the lamp back. The magic carpet catches Aladdin and saves him from falling to his death.\n\nTrapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent [[Genie (Disney)|Genie]] who lives inside it. The Genie explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes, with the exceptions of murder, romance, the resurrection of the dead, and more wishes. Aladdin gets the Genie to free them from the cave without using a wish on a technicality: Aladdin didn't rub the lamp as he stated the wish. After they get out of the cave, Aladdin uses his first official wish to become a prince to impress Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human. Abu is temporarily transformed into an elephant in the process.\n\nAladdin enters Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, arriving in an extravagant spectacle. However, Jasmine is unimpressed by his first presentation, including an assortment of gifts and gems. The two later bond when he takes her on a ride on the magic carpet to show her the world she wants to see while the Genie goes out with Dalia. Jasmine realizes who Aladdin is and tricks him into revealing his true identity; however, he convinces her that he is actually a prince and only dressed like a peasant to meet the citizens of Agrabah beforehand.\n\nJafar discovers Aladdin's identity and, to test his theory, throws Aladdin into the sea, saying if he lives, it will be because he found the lamp, and the Genie saved him. If he dies, he really is a prince and doesn't have the lamp. Abu, now a monkey again, and the carpet arrive with the lamp, but Aladdin loses consciousness before he can rub it. The Genie, impressed by Aladdin's good character, assumes he can Genie rules allow him to save Aladdin, but at the cost of his second wish. At the palace, Jafar tries to turn the others against Aladdin and the Genie with lies, but when Aladdin returns, Jafar is exposed by him and Jasmine, who was also suspicious of Jafar. He is arrested and imprisoned in the dungeon. The Sultan offers Aladdin the position as heir to the throne. Fearing he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin decides to reserve the Genie for then and refuses to free him. The Genie tells Aladdin that he was the first master he ever considered a friend and that he's now breaking his heart.\n\nIago snatches one of the guards' keys, and he frees Jafar. Jafar stealthily steals the lamp from Aladdin and becomes the Genie's new master, to his horror. As Aladdin realizes he has betrayed his friend the Genie and decides to free him, he notices the lamp is gone.\n\nJafar uses his first wish to become Sultan. When the loyal guards refuse to acknowledge the change, per Jasmine's request, he makes a second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer and imprisons the guards and Rajah. He then exposes Aladdin's identity to Jasmine and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland on the other side of the Earth. He threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding ceremony, Aladdin and Abu return, having been rescued by the magic carpet, and Jasmine steals back the lamp. Furious, Jafar transforms Iago into a [[Roc (mythology)|roc]] to give chase. Jafar, angered by the Sultan's attempt to stop him, overpowers them and severely damaging the magic carpet in the process. Iago steals the lamp back.\n\nAladdin stalls by taunting Jafar for being second and powerless to the Genie, thereby tricking him into using his last wish to become the most powerful being in the universe. Due to the vagueness of the wish, the Genie is able to use it to turn Jafar into a genie; chained to the lamp without a master, Jafar is trapped inside, dragging Iago in with him. The Genie banishes them and throws Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders and repairs the magic carpet. Aladdin keeps his promise, using his last wish to free the Genie and allow him to live as a human. The Sultan declares that Jasmine will be the next ruler and tells her that Aladdin is a good person, outlines how worthy he is, and tells her as [[Sultana (title)|sultana]], she can overturn the law that requires her to marry a prince.\n\nThe Genie marries Dalia and leaves to explore the world and start a family with her. Aladdin and Jasmine get married and start a new life as well.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of Disney's Aladdin characters}}\n* [[Will Smith]] as [[Genie (Disney)|Genie / Mariner]]: <br />A comedically eccentric and kindly [[jinn]] who has the power to grant three wishes to whoever possesses his magic lamp.

Over 2,000 actors and actresses had auditioned for the roles of Aladdin and Jasmine, but finding a male lead of Middle Eastern or Indian descent in his 20s, who could act and sing, had proven difficult for the producers. [[Naomi Scott]] and [[Tara Sutaria]] were the final two actresses in the running for the role of Jasmine, but neither could be cast until a chemistry test was done with whomever would be cast as Aladdin.

The second was the prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] for [[seditious libel]]; this was viewed as an assault on the [[Church of England]] and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England.

In February 1689, a special [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] held that the king had \"vacated\" the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs, establishing the principle that [[sovereignty]] derived from Parliament, not birth. James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms, but despite a simultaneous [[Jacobite rising of 1689|rising in Scotland]], in April a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] followed that of England by finding that James had \"forfeited\" the throne and offered it to William and Mary.

According to Turner, James's reaction to the agreement was \"The King shall be obeyed, and I would be glad if all his subjects would learn of me to obey him\".  Turner, 132.</ref> Despite the Protestant marriage, fears of a potential Catholic monarch persisted, intensified by the failure of Charles II and his wife, [[Catherine of Braganza]], to produce any children.

Or was he a well-intentioned and even enlightened ruler\u2014an enlightened despot well ahead of his time, perhaps\u2014who was merely trying to do what he thought was best for his subjects?<ref>Harris, 478\u2013479</ref>}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Steven Pincus]] confronted that scholarly ambivalence in ''1688: The First Modern Revolution.'' Pincus claims that James's reign must be understood within a context of economic change and European politics, and makes two major assertions about James II. The first of these is that James purposefully \"followed the French Sun King, Louis XIV, in trying to create a modern Catholic polity. This involved not only trying to Catholicize England&nbsp;... but also creating a modern, centralizing, and extremely bureaucratic state apparatus.\"<ref>Pincus, 475</ref> The second is that James was undone in 1688 far less by Protestant reaction against Catholicization than by nationwide hostile reaction against his intrusive bureaucratic state and taxation apparatus, expressed in massive popular support for William of Orange's armed invasion of England. Pincus presents James as neither na\u00efve nor stupid nor egotistical. Instead, readers are shown an intelligent, clear-thinking strategically motivated monarch whose vision for a French authoritarian political model and alliance clashed with, and lost out to, alternative views that favoured an entrepreneurial Dutch economic model, feared French power, and were outraged by James's authoritarianism.\n\n[[Scott Sowerby]] countered Pincus's thesis in 2013 in ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution.''  He noted that English taxes remained low during James II's reign, at about 4% of the English national income, and thus it was unlikely that James could have built a bureaucratic state on the model of Louis XIV's France, where taxes were at least twice as high as a proportion of GDP.<ref>Sowerby, 51\u201353</ref>  Sowerby also contends that James's policies of religious toleration attracted substantial support from religious nonconformists, including Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians, who were attracted by the king's push for a new \"Magna Carta for liberty of conscience\".<ref>Sowerby, 43\u201344</ref> The king was overthrown, in Sowerby's view, largely because of fears among the Dutch and English elites that James might be aligning himself with Louis XIV in a supposed \"holy league\" to destroy Protestantism across northern Europe.<ref>Sowerby, 227\u2013239</ref> Sowerby presents James's reign as a struggle between those who believed that the king was sincerely devoted to liberty of conscience and those who were sceptical of the king's espousals of toleration and believed that he had a hidden agenda to overthrow English Protestantism.\n\n==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==\n[[File:James2coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half crown coin]] of James II, 1686]]\n===Titles and styles===\n* 14 October 1633 \u2013 6 February 1685: <!--sources from the time call him HRH after 1680 but not before 1660--> The Duke of York\n* 10 May 1659 \u2013 6 February 1685: The Earl of Ulster<ref name=\"weir\">[[Alison Weir|Weir, Alison]] (1996). 258.

The second was the prosecution of the [[Seven Bishops]] for [[seditious libel]]; this was viewed as an assault on the [[Church of England]] and their acquittal on 30 June destroyed his political authority in England.

In February 1689, a special [[Convention Parliament (1689)|Convention Parliament]] held that the king had \"vacated\" the English throne and installed William and Mary as joint monarchs, establishing the principle that [[sovereignty]] derived from Parliament, not birth. James landed in Ireland on 14 March 1689 in an attempt to recover his kingdoms, but despite a simultaneous [[Jacobite rising of 1689|rising in Scotland]], in April a [[Convention of the Estates of Scotland|Scottish Convention]] followed that of England by finding that James had \"forfeited\" the throne and offered it to William and Mary. After his defeat at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] in July 1690, James returned to France, where he spent the rest of his life in exile at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye|Saint-Germain]], protected by [[Louis XIV]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Birth===\n[[File:Charles I and James II.png|thumb|James with his father, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], by [[Sir Peter Lely]], 1647]]\n\nJames, the second surviving son of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and his wife, [[Henrietta Maria of France]], was born at [[St James's Palace]] in London on 14 October 1633.<ref>Miller, 1</ref> Later that same year, he was baptised by [[William Laud]], the [[Church of England|Anglican]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]].<ref name=callow31>Callow, 31</ref> He was educated by private tutors, along with his older brother, the future [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]], and the two sons of the [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|Duke of Buckingham]], [[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham|George]] and Francis Villiers.<ref>Callow, 34</ref> At the age of three, James was appointed [[Lord High Admiral of England|Lord High Admiral]]; the position was initially honorary, but would become a substantive office after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]], when James was an adult.<ref>Miller, 10; Callow, 101</ref>\n\nHe was designated [[Duke of York]] at birth,<ref name=\"weir\"/> invested with the [[Order of the Garter]] in 1642,<ref>Callow, 36</ref> and formally created Duke of York in January 1644.<ref name=callow31/><ref name=\"weir\"/>\n\n===Civil War===\nThe King's disputes with the [[English Parliament]] grew into the [[English Civil War]].

In consequence, James was expelled from France and forced to leave Turenne's army.<ref>Miller, 19\u201320</ref> James quarrelled with his brother over the diplomatic choice of Spain over France. Exiled and poor, there was little that either Charles or James could do about the wider political situation, and James ultimately travelled to [[Bruges]] and (along with his younger brother, [[Henry Stuart, Duke of Gloucester|Henry]]) joined the Spanish army under [[Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond\u00e9|Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9]] in Flanders, where he was given command as Captain-General of six regiments of British volunteers<ref name=compeerage3/> and fought against his former French comrades at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of the Dunes]].<ref>Miller, 19\u201325</ref>\n\nDuring his service in the Spanish army, James became friendly with two Irish Catholic brothers in the Royalist entourage, [[Archbishop Peter Talbot|Peter]] and [[Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell|Richard Talbot]], and became somewhat estranged from his brother's Anglican advisers.<ref>Miller, 22\u201323</ref> In 1659, the French and Spanish [[Treaty of the Pyrenees|made peace]].

Although James was the [[heir presumptive]], it seemed unlikely that he would inherit the Crown, as Charles was still a young man capable of fathering children.<ref>Callow, 89</ref> On 31 December 1660, following his brother's restoration, James was created [[Duke of Albany]] in Scotland, to go along with his English title, Duke of York.<ref>[[George Edward Cokayne]], ed.

M. Trevelyan]] (Macaulay's great-nephew) and [[David Ogg (historian)|David Ogg]], while more balanced than Macaulay, still characterised James as a tyrant, his attempts at religious tolerance as a fraud, and his reign as an aberration in the course of British history.<ref>See Prall, vii\u2013xv, for a more detailed historiography.</ref> In 1892, [[A. W. Ward]] wrote for the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] that James was \"obviously a political and religious bigot\", although never devoid of \"a vein of patriotic sentiment\"; \"his conversion to the church of Rome made the emancipation of his fellow-catholics in the first instance, and the recovery of England for catholicism in the second, the governing objects of his policy.\"<ref>{{DNB Cite|wstitle=James II of England}}</ref>\n\n[[Hilaire Belloc]], a writer and Catholic apologist, broke with this tradition in 1928, casting James as an honourable man and a true advocate for freedom of conscience, and his enemies \"men in the small clique of great fortunes&nbsp;... which destroyed the ancient monarchy of the English\".<ref>Belloc, vii</ref> However, he observed that James \"concluded the Catholic church to be the sole authoritative voice on earth, and thenceforward&nbsp;... he not only stood firm against surrender but on no single occasion contemplated the least compromise or by a word would modify the impression made.\"\n\nBy the 1960s and 1970s, [[Maurice Ashley (historian)|Maurice Ashley]] and Stuart Prall began to reconsider James's motives in granting religious toleration, while still taking note of James's autocratic rule.<ref>See Ashley, 196\u2013198; Prall, 291\u2013293</ref> Modern historians have moved away from the school of thought that preached the continuous march of progress and democracy, Ashley contending that \"history is, after all, the story of human beings and individuals, as well as of the classes and the masses.\"<ref name=ashley9>Ashley, 9</ref> He cast James II and William III as \"men of ideals as well as human weaknesses\".<ref name=ashley9/> John Miller, writing in 2000, accepted the claims of James's absolutism, but argued that \"his main concern was to secure religious liberty and civil equality for Catholics. Any 'absolutist' methods&nbsp;... were essentially means to that end.\"<ref>Miller, ix</ref>\n\nIn 2004, [[W. A. Speck]] wrote in the new [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] that \"James was genuinely committed to religious toleration, but also sought to increase the power of the crown.\"<ref name=speck>W. A. Speck, \"[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/14593 James II and VII (1633\u20131701)]\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, May 2006. Retrieved 15 October 2007. He \"wished that all his subjects could be as convinced as he was that the Catholic church was the one true church. He was also convinced that the established church was maintained artificially by penal laws that proscribed nonconformity. If these were removed, and conversions to Catholicism were encouraged, then many would take place.  In the event his optimism was misplaced, for few converted.  James underestimated the appeal of Protestantism in general and the Church of England in particular. His was the zeal and even bigotry of a narrow-minded convert...\"</ref> He added that, unlike the government of the Netherlands, \"James was too autocratic to combine freedom of conscience with popular government. He resisted any check on the monarch's power. That is why his heart was not in the concessions he had to make in 1688. He would rather live in exile with his principles intact than continue to reign as a limited monarch.\"<ref name=speck/>\n\n[[Timothy J. G. Harris|Tim Harris's]] conclusions from his 2006 book summarised the ambivalence of modern scholarship towards James II:{{quote|The jury will doubtless remain out on James for a long time&nbsp;... Was he an egotistical bigot&nbsp;... a tyrant who rode roughshod over the will of the vast majority of his subjects (at least in England and Scotland)&nbsp;... simply na\u00efve, or even perhaps plain stupid, unable to appreciate the realities of political power&nbsp;... Or was he a well-intentioned and even enlightened ruler\u2014an enlightened despot well ahead of his time, perhaps\u2014who was merely trying to do what he thought was best for his subjects?<ref>Harris, 478\u2013479</ref>}}\n\nIn 2009, [[Steven Pincus]] confronted that scholarly ambivalence in ''1688: The First Modern Revolution.'' Pincus claims that James's reign must be understood within a context of economic change and European politics, and makes two major assertions about James II. The first of these is that James purposefully \"followed the French Sun King, Louis XIV, in trying to create a modern Catholic polity. This involved not only trying to Catholicize England&nbsp;... but also creating a modern, centralizing, and extremely bureaucratic state apparatus.\"<ref>Pincus, 475</ref> The second is that James was undone in 1688 far less by Protestant reaction against Catholicization than by nationwide hostile reaction against his intrusive bureaucratic state and taxation apparatus, expressed in massive popular support for William of Orange's armed invasion of England. Pincus presents James as neither na\u00efve nor stupid nor egotistical. Instead, readers are shown an intelligent, clear-thinking strategically motivated monarch whose vision for a French authoritarian political model and alliance clashed with, and lost out to, alternative views that favoured an entrepreneurial Dutch economic model, feared French power, and were outraged by James's authoritarianism.\n\n[[Scott Sowerby]] countered Pincus's thesis in 2013 in ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution.''  He noted that English taxes remained low during James II's reign, at about 4% of the English national income, and thus it was unlikely that James could have built a bureaucratic state on the model of Louis XIV's France, where taxes were at least twice as high as a proportion of GDP.<ref>Sowerby, 51\u201353</ref>  Sowerby also contends that James's policies of religious toleration attracted substantial support from religious nonconformists, including Quakers, Baptists, Congregationalists and Presbyterians, who were attracted by the king's push for a new \"Magna Carta for liberty of conscience\".<ref>Sowerby, 43\u201344</ref> The king was overthrown, in Sowerby's view, largely because of fears among the Dutch and English elites that James might be aligning himself with Louis XIV in a supposed \"holy league\" to destroy Protestantism across northern Europe.<ref>Sowerby, 227\u2013239</ref> Sowerby presents James's reign as a struggle between those who believed that the king was sincerely devoted to liberty of conscience and those who were sceptical of the king's espousals of toleration and believed that he had a hidden agenda to overthrow English Protestantism.\n\n==Titles, styles, honours, and arms==\n[[File:James2coin.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Half crown (British coin)|Half crown coin]] of James II, 1686]]\n===Titles and styles===\n* 14 October 1633 \u2013 6 February 1685: <!--sources from the time call him HRH after 1680 but not before 1660--> The Duke of York\n* 10 May 1659 \u2013 6 February 1685: The Earl of Ulster<ref name=\"weir\">[[Alison Weir|Weir, Alison]] (1996). 258.

The oldest works of art which remained from the early [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and [[liturgy]] (e.g., frescoes in the Crypts of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], decorated [[hymn]]s books). Walls paintings from the 16th centuries were also discovered in Vilnius (e.g., painting of the [[Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard, Vilnius|Church of St. Francis and St. Bernard]] vaults or in the [[Church of Saint Nicholas, Vilnius|Church of Saint Nicholas]]).<ref name=\"tapybavle\">{{cite web |title=Lietuvos tapyba |url=https://www.vle.lt/Straipsnis/Lietuvos-tapyba-117712 |website=vle.lt |accessdate=10 November 2019 |language=lt}}</ref> Gothic wooden, mostly polychrome sculptures were used to decorate the altars of the churches of Vilnius.

In the Renaissance period, portrait tombstones and medals were highly valued (e.g., marle tomb of [[Albertas Go\u0161tautas]], 1548, by B. Z. da Gianotti, tomb of [[Povilas Al\u0161\u0117ni\u0161kis]], 1555, by G. Cini, both located in the Vilnius Cathedral). The works of Italian sculptors are characterized by a naturalistic treatment of forms, precise proportions, tectonicity, a realistic representation of the deceased. The local sculptors took over only the iconographic scheme of the Renaissance tomb; their works (e.g., tomb of [[Lew Sapieha]], ca. 1633, at [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|Church of St. Michael]]) are characterized by conditionality of forms, stylization.<ref name=\"skulptura\" /> During this period local and [[Western Europe]]an painters created religious, mythologic compositions, portraits, which were intertwined with late Gothic and Baroque features. Illustrated prayer books illustrations and miniatures have survived.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" />\n\nThe [[Baroque]] period which began in the late 16th century was exceptional for Vilnius as wall painting blossomed in the city. Most of the palaces and churches were decorated with frescoes characterized by bright colors, sophisticated angles and [[dramatism]] style. Also during this period the secular painting spread \u2013 representational, imaginative, epitaph portraits, scenes of battles, politically important events. It is characterized by detailed realistic style.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" /> This period sculptures dominated in the [[sacred architecture]] (tombstones with sculptural portraits, exterior and interior decorative sculptures), made of wood, marble and [[stucco]]. Italian sculptors (e.g., G. P. Perti, G. M. Galli, A. S. Capone) were exceptionally important in the 17th century Grand Duchy's sculptures development and were invited there by the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. Their works are characterized by the features of mature baroque: expressiveness of forms, sensuality, atectonic composition (e.g., sculptural decor of the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Vilnius|Church of St. Peter and St. Paul]]). The local sculptors emphasized the decorative features of the baroque, and the expressiveness and emotionality of the baroque was less characteristic in their works.<ref name=\"skulptura\" />\n\n[[File:Rusiecki-Litwinka z wierzbami.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds]]'' by [[Kanutas Ruseckas]]]]\nAt the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Lithuanian painting was largely influenced by the [[:lt:Vilniaus meno mokykla|Vilnius Art School]] which introduced manifestations of [[Classicism]] art and later of [[Romanticism]] art.

Its history begins from the [[Neolithic period]]. During it, the glacial hills were intermittently occupied and a wooden castle, at the confluence of the [[Neris]] and [[Vilnia]] rivers, was built around 1000 AD to fortify [[Gedimino Hill]]. The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the [[pagan]] [[Baltic people]] were invaded by [[Western Europeans|the Westerners]] during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]]. Around 1323, when the first written sources about Vilnia occurred, it was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was formed from various cultures and nationalities residents. At this time, it only had some brick structures. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had become one of the most powerful and the largest country in [[Europe]] with its territory stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]] (mostly, present-day [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] lands). The historic centre consists of [[Vilnius Castle Complex|three castles]] territories (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area that was previously encircled by a [[Wall of Vilnius]]. Its plan is mostly circular with its center in the original castle site. The streets pattern is [[medieval]] and has small, narrow streets, however large squares were also developed in later periods.<ref name=\"unesco\" /> [[Pilies Street]], the main artery, links the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] with [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Vilnius Town Hall]].

Employment reached a record high of 77.5% in the third quarter of 2018 while unemployment was 6.3% in the fourth quarter, a rate last observed in 2008. Nevertheless, this has to be seen in the context of a shrinking working age population. The activity rate reached 82% in 2017. Vilnius and [[Kaunas]] counties offer better labour market opportunities than other counties, and this drives the internal interregional migration. However, in other regions employment opportunities remain scarce. Unemployment rates remained persistently high in the least developed regions (14.9% in [[Utena County]] as compared to 4.8% in [[Vilnius County]]). Other key labour market indicators have improved, returning to [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|pre-crisis]] levels. Long-term unemployment fell to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 (EU average: 2.9%).

However, it remains among the highest in the EU (29.6% in 2017, compared to 22.4% in the EU). The risk of poverty or social exclusion in rural areas is nearly double that of urban areas, which corresponds to the gap in the unemployment rate between cities and rural areas (4.5% versus 11% in 2017). In particular the metropolitan areas of Vilnius and Kaunas, where significant economic activity is centred, drive a significant gap between AROPE rates in urban and rural areas.

The oldest works of art which remained from the early [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] (14th century) are paintings dedicated to churches and [[liturgy]] (e.g., frescoes in the Crypts of [[Vilnius Cathedral]], decorated [[hymn]]s books).

In the Renaissance period, portrait tombstones and medals were highly valued (e.g., marle tomb of [[Albertas Go\u0161tautas]], 1548, by B. Z. da Gianotti, tomb of [[Povilas Al\u0161\u0117ni\u0161kis]], 1555, by G. Cini, both located in the Vilnius Cathedral). The works of Italian sculptors are characterized by a naturalistic treatment of forms, precise proportions, tectonicity, a realistic representation of the deceased. The local sculptors took over only the iconographic scheme of the Renaissance tomb; their works (e.g., tomb of [[Lew Sapieha]], ca. 1633, at [[Church of St. Michael, Vilnius|Church of St. Michael]]) are characterized by conditionality of forms, stylization.<ref name=\"skulptura\" /> During this period local and [[Western Europe]]an painters created religious, mythologic compositions, portraits, which were intertwined with late Gothic and Baroque features. Illustrated prayer books illustrations and miniatures have survived.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" />\n\nThe [[Baroque]] period which began in the late 16th century was exceptional for Vilnius as wall painting blossomed in the city. Most of the palaces and churches were decorated with frescoes characterized by bright colors, sophisticated angles and [[dramatism]] style. Also during this period the secular painting spread \u2013 representational, imaginative, epitaph portraits, scenes of battles, politically important events. It is characterized by detailed realistic style.<ref name=\"tapybavle\" /> This period sculptures dominated in the [[sacred architecture]] (tombstones with sculptural portraits, exterior and interior decorative sculptures), made of wood, marble and [[stucco]]. Italian sculptors (e.g., G. P. Perti, G. M. Galli, A. S. Capone) were exceptionally important in the 17th century Grand Duchy's sculptures development and were invited there by the [[Lithuanian nobility]]. Their works are characterized by the features of mature baroque: expressiveness of forms, sensuality, atectonic composition (e.g., sculptural decor of the [[Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, Vilnius|Church of St. Peter and St. Paul]]). The local sculptors emphasized the decorative features of the baroque, and the expressiveness and emotionality of the baroque was less characteristic in their works.<ref name=\"skulptura\" />\n\n[[File:Rusiecki-Litwinka z wierzbami.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|''[[Lithuanian Girl with Palm Sunday Fronds]]'' by [[Kanutas Ruseckas]]]]\nAt the late 18th and 19th centuries, the Lithuanian painting was largely influenced by the [[:lt:Vilniaus meno mokykla|Vilnius Art School]] which introduced manifestations of [[Classicism]] art and later of [[Romanticism]] art.

During it, the glacial hills were intermittently occupied and a wooden castle, at the confluence of the [[Neris]] and [[Vilnia]] rivers, was built around 1000 AD to fortify [[Gedimino Hill]]. The settlement developed into a town in the 13th century, when the [[pagan]] [[Baltic people]] were invaded by [[Western Europeans|the Westerners]] during the [[Lithuanian Crusade]]. Around 1323, when the first written sources about Vilnia occurred, it was the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which was formed from various cultures and nationalities residents. At this time, it only had some brick structures. By the 15th century, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had become one of the most powerful and the largest country in [[Europe]] with its territory stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]] (mostly, present-day [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]] lands). The historic centre consists of [[Vilnius Castle Complex|three castles]] territories (Upper, Lower and Curved) and the area that was previously encircled by a [[Wall of Vilnius]]. Its plan is mostly circular with its center in the original castle site. The streets pattern is [[medieval]] and has small, narrow streets, however large squares were also developed in later periods.<ref name=\"unesco\" /> [[Pilies Street]], the main artery, links the [[Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania]] with [[Town Hall, Vilnius|Vilnius Town Hall]].

Employment reached a record high of 77.5% in the third quarter of 2018 while unemployment was 6.3% in the fourth quarter, a rate last observed in 2008. Nevertheless, this has to be seen in the context of a shrinking working age population. The activity rate reached 82% in 2017. Vilnius and [[Kaunas]] counties offer better labour market opportunities than other counties, and this drives the internal interregional migration. However, in other regions employment opportunities remain scarce. Unemployment rates remained persistently high in the least developed regions (14.9% in [[Utena County]] as compared to 4.8% in [[Vilnius County]]). Other key labour market indicators have improved, returning to [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132008|pre-crisis]] levels. Long-term unemployment fell to 2.1% in the third quarter of 2018 (EU average: 2.9%). Youth unemployment (13.3%) and the rate of young people not in employment, education or training ([[NEET]], at 9.1%) were below the EU average in 2017.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=8 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[File:K29 business centre in Vilnius.jpg|thumb|left|K29 business centre is the first office in the [[Baltic states]] which received excellent [[BREEAM]] rating<ref>{{cite web |title=Biur\u0173 pastatui Konstitucijos prospekte suteiktas auk\u0161\u010diausias Baltijos \u0161alyse tvarumo \u012fvertinimas |url=https://www.15min.lt/verslas/naujiena/kvadratinis-metras/nekilnojamasis-turtas/biuru-pastatui-k29-suteiktas-auksciausias-baltijos-salyse-tvarumo-ivertinimas-973-799132 |website=[[15min.lt]] |accessdate=31 August 2019 |language=lt}}</ref>]]\nOverall, the share of the population at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE) has decreased since Lithuania joined the EU in 2004. However, it remains among the highest in the EU (29.6% in 2017, compared to 22.4% in the EU). The risk of poverty or social exclusion in rural areas is nearly double that of urban areas, which corresponds to the gap in the unemployment rate between cities and rural areas (4.5% versus 11% in 2017). In particular the metropolitan areas of Vilnius and Kaunas, where significant economic activity is centred, drive a significant gap between AROPE rates in urban and rural areas. In 2017, the AROPE rate in rural areas was 37.2%, compared to 19.9% in cities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Country Report Lithuania 2019 |date=27 February 2019 |publisher=European Commission |location=Brussels |page=9 |url=https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/file_import/2019-european-semester-country-report-lithuania_en.pdf |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nOver the past 15 years, Lithuania has experienced the fastest convergence in the EU, but the benefits of economic growth are uneven across regions.

While [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita reached nearly 110% of the EU average in the capital region of Vilnius, it is only between 42% and 77% in other regions. The country's rapid convergence is mainly fuelled by two regions&nbsp;\u2013 the capital region of Vilnius and [[Kaunas County]]&nbsp;\u2013 producing 42% and 20% of the national GDP, respectively.

Its capital is [[Marseille]]. The region is roughly coterminous with the former [[Provinces of France|French province]] of [[Provence]], with the addition of the following adjacent areas: the former [[Pope|papal]] territory of [[Avignon]], known as [[Comtat Venaissin]]; the former [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinian-Piedmontese]] county of [[Nice]], whose coastline is known in English as the [[French Riviera]], and in French as the ''C\u00f4te d'Azur''; and the southeastern part of the former French province of [[Dauphin\u00e9]], in the [[French Alps]]. Previously known by the acronym PACA, the region adopted the name ''R\u00e9gion Sud'' as a commercial name or nickname in December 2017.<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2017/12/16/la-provence-alpes-cote-d-azur-ne-sera-plus-surnommee-paca-mais-region-sud_5230750_3224.html</ref> 5,007,977 people live in the region according to the 2015 census.\n\nIt encompasses six [[Departments of France|departments]] in Southeastern France: [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]], [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Hautes-Alpes]], [[Var (department)|Var]] and [[Vaucluse]]. It is bounded to the east by the [[France-Italy border]], to the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and by the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]], to the north by [[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]], and to the west by [[Occitanie]], with the [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]] river marking its westernmost border.\n\nThe region logotype displays the coat of arms created in the 1990s and which combines the coats of arms of the old provinces making up Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur. The region's economy is the third largest in France, just behind [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. Its GDP in 2012 was \u20ac142.4 billion (US$183.1 billion) while its per capita GDP was \u20ac28,861 ($US 37,121).\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Population===\nAccording to a 2015 census, the population in the region was 5,007,977; [[Marseille]] and its metropolitan area is the most populous in the region with a city population of 850,636, an urban population of 1,560,921 and a metropolitan population of 1,720,941. Marseille is the second largest city in France after [[Paris]], and has the third largest metropolitan population, behind those of Paris and [[Lyon]] respectively.\n\n[[Nice]] is host to the second-largest population concentration in the region, with a city population of 344,875 and an urban population of 1,005,230, making it the fifth-most populous city in France.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe absolute majority of the population speaks French and there are many minority languages.

Along with Marseille, Nice is the second most populous city in the region with a city proper population of about 350,000 and an urban population exceeding 1 million.\n\nMarseille, with an urban area of 2 million inhabitants, is the largest and capital city of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region. It is also the second most populated city in France, just behind [[Paris]] and the city with the third largest metropolitan population in France, behind Paris and [[Lyon]] respectively.\n\nAlong with Nice and Marseille the region is also made internationally popular with [[Cannes]] which, though not a large city (population of 73,603 in 2012), hosts the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]] which has highly popularized the region. Also, [[Arles]] has become renowned as the city in which [[Vincent van Gogh]] lived and painted 300 paintings.\n\nToulon is a large military harbour on the Mediterranean coast, with the French naval base placed there. It is the capital of the Var department in the region. Also, Aix-en-Provence has long been a university town, and to this day remains the most important educational centre in the region.\n\nBelow is a list of the most populated cities in the region along with their population (city proper) according to the most recent census.\n\n* [[Aix-en-Provence]] \u2013 142,743\n* [[Antibes]] (includes [[Juan-les-Pins]]) \u2013 76,994\n* [[Arles]] \u2013 52,729\n* [[Aubagne]] \u2013 46,423\n* [[Avignon]] \u2013 90,194\n* [[Cannes]] \u2013 73,603\n* [[Draguignan]] \u2013 38,258\n* [[Fr\u00e9jus]] \u2013 52,389\n* [[Grasse]] \u2013 51,580\n* [[Hy\u00e8res]] \u2013 56,275\n* [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]] \u2013 64,903\n* [[Le Cannet]] \u2013 40,940\n* [[Mandelieu-la-Napoule]] \u2013 22,714\n* [[Marseille]] \u2013 861,636\n* [[Martigues]] \u2013 76,471\n* [[Mougins]] \u2013 19,703\n* [[Nice]] \u2013 343,875\n* [[Toulon]] \u2013 167,729\n* [[Villeneuve-Loubet]] \u2013 14,427\n\n==Geography==\n\nThis region has a total area of {{convert|31400|km2|abbr=on}}. It has a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[Alps]] mountains to plains and coastal areas like [[Nice]] and [[Marseille]], which form the majority of the land area. The region has a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline on the south, on which the majority of its population lives. It borders [[Italy]] ([[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]]) to the east, [[Monaco]] ([[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]], [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], [[La Rousse]], [[Larvotto]], [[Les Moneghetti]], [[Les R\u00e9voires]], [[Saint Michel, Monaco|Saint Michel]]) in the south-east, and the French regions of [[Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes]] to the north and [[Occitanie]] to the west. The Rh\u00f4ne, Var and Arc rivers run through the region. The borders were unaffected by the 2016 French regional reforms.\n\nThis region is famous for the C\u00f4te d'Azur ([[French Riviera]]), which spans the glamorous cities of [[Nice]], [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]], [[Antibes]], [[Juan-les-Pins]], [[Cannes]], [[Fr\u00e9jus]], [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]], [[Sainte-Maxime]] and [[Saint-Tropez]].\n\n==Regional government and politics==\n\nThe [[Regional council (France)|Regional council]] is the legislative body of the region. The President of the regional council has been [[Renaud Muselier]] (LR) since 2017.\n\n===Political tendencies===\nIn the recent years [[Les R\u00e9publicains]] have gained strong support in the region and following the 2015 departmental elections, they control the region, which had been narrowly controlled by the [[Parti Socialiste (France)|Parti Socialiste]] with Michel Vauzelle previously.\n\nThe [[Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais|French Communist Party]] historically had several strongholds in the region from the 1920s onward, including [[Aubagne]], [[Draguignan]], [[La Ciotat]], [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], [[Martigues]], [[Gardanne]], [[Arles]] and some suburbs of [[Marseille]]. Though not enough to win the regional elections, the party usually received about 10% of the vote. Beginning with 2002 this declined to 4% and by 2012, dropped below 2%.\n\nThe main competition seen in the politics of this region is between Les R\u00e9publicains and the Parti Socialiste (PS), both deferring in its opinions. According to the most recent elections, the political tendencies are as follows-\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n! \u00c9lection / collectivit\u00e9s !! Les R\u00e9publicains (centre-right) !!

Income inequality however is higher than in other regions: the region is ranked 4th by percent of population living above the poverty line. The region is ranked third by GDP. Between 2007 and 2011, the region registered an average annual growth rate of 1.6% of GDP (Eurostat), close to the national average annual growth rate of 1.5%. Representing 7.2% of the national GDP over the period, the region is an important economic powerhouse.\n\nIn 2013, the region was responsible for 7.4% of national employment, with an employment rate of 89.2%. The region's employment success has a main characteristic: a higher concentration of elderly people than in the rest of France (respectively 27.1% and 24.1% in 2013).\n\nWith more than 80% of regional employment in the service sector in 2010, the regional economy is mostly oriented towards service activities, above the national average of 76.3%. The sector grew between 2000 and 2010 (3.1% on annual average vs. 2.1% in France). The region concentrates more on commercial activities than financial ones than the rest of France does; principally because of tourism. 34% of the labour force is employed in retail and trade, against 32% at the national level. Moreover, the sector strongly contributes to growth of added value (81.5% vs. 77.3% at the national level). The industrial sector (existing mainly through the [[Marseille-Fos Port]]), including construction, consists of 17.1% of regional employment (vs. 20.6% in the rest of France), and contributes to 9.3% of gross added value, 3.2 points below the French level.\n\nEmployment in the agricultural sector is lower than the national level (2.4% against 3.1%). However, it grew at a rate of 4.1% annually on average between 2000 and 2008, while the rest of the country saw its agricultural employment decline by 2.4%. According to the [[Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques]], the region is characterised by a strong presence of SMEs of less than 500 employees, which represent 91.2% of local businesses (higher than the national average of 90.9%). Retail activities and tourism explain these figures.\n\nThe region's economy is dependent on tourism like most coastal places but also a majority of its economy is dependent on coastal activities. PACA is the 3rd richest French region and ranks 19th on the European scale. Its prosperity is mainly thanks to its attractiveness in terms of tourism; it is indeed one of the world's favourite tourist destinations, welcoming about 34 million tourists every year. The service sector predominates and provides many good jobs. In 2009, the region was admittedly affected by the global economic crisis, albeit to a small extent. It is (after the Paris area) the 2nd French region with regards to business startups.\n\nIf tourism is the driving force of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, the region is also a leader when it comes to innovative sectors, such as high technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. Education, for its part, is well developed with the region's various universities, international schools, preparatory classes for specialist university courses, and engineering and business schools. All these institutions of higher learning help contribute to the human capital needed by the region to meet current technological challenges.\n\nThe region has a total GDP (2012) of \u20ac142.4 billion (US$183.1 bn), the third highest in France. It has a per capita GDP of \u20ac28,861 (US$37,121), slightly higher than the French average. According to a recent survey, a person living in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur has an average annual income of about \u20ac37,489 (US$45,755).\n\nThe region has been part of [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion]] since 10 July 2007.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:DS4 9354.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations]] in Marseille]]\nThe region is one of the most visited of France, and has therefore many well-known museums, mostly in Marseille: the [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Cantini]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Grobet-Labadi\u00e9]], the [[Marseille History Museum]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Marseille]], the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Fa\u00efence de Marseille]] and the [[Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle de Marseille]] are some of the tourist spots of the city. However, other museums are internationally recognised, like the [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]], the [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], the [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice]], the [[Mus\u00e9e National du Sport]] and the [[Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle de Nice]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Nice airport.jpg|thumb|Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]]\n=== Airports ===\nPACA has two of the busiest airports in France: [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (ranking 3rd after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]]) and [[Marseille Provence Airport]] (ranking 5th after [[Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport]]). Nice saw 13,850,000 people travelling through its airport in 2018, while 8,478,541 used Marseille to fly.\n\nMinor airports include [[Montpellier\u2013M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Airport]] (1,671,545 passengers in 2016) and [[Toulon\u2013Hy\u00e8res Airport]] (500,046).\n\n=== Motorways ===\nThe region is at the centre of a complex and dense motorway network, in the heart of Mediterranean coast. Motorways are operated by ASF, ESCOTA, SMTC, MPM (Marseille Metropolis) and DIR Med (State). In PACA, motorways have the particularity to serve the city centres of big towns, unlike other big cities of France. This is due to their comparatively early construction in relation to the motorways of France's other regions.\n* [[A7 autoroute|A7]] - Autoroute du Soleil \"Motorway of the Sun\" links the region to Lyon and on to the North of France. This motorway starts in central [[Marseille]] at the Porte d'Aix. The road widens at Sept\u00e8mes Valleys and meets the  A51.

Two stations are situated on the HSL [[LGV M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e]] opened in 2001: Avignon TGV and Aix-en-Provence TGV. The others stations served by high-speed services are Avignon-Centre, Arles, Miramas, Marseille-Saint-Charles, Toulon, Les Arcs-Draguignan, Saint-Rapha\u00ebl-Valescure, Cannes, Antibes, Nice-Ville and Menton.\n\nServices operated by SNCF TGV:\n* Paris GDL to Avignon-Centre / Miramas\n* Paris GDL to Marseille, Toulon, Nice, Monaco and Ventimiglia (Italy)\n* Nantes / Rennes to Marseille\n* Strasbourg to Marseille\n* Lille to Marseille\n* Nancy / Metz / Dijon to Marseille / Nice\n* Le Havre to Marseille\n\nServices operated by SNCF Ouigo:\n* Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e \u2013 Chessy to Marseille\n* Lyon-Perrache to Marseille\n\nServices operated by SNCB/NMBS TGV:\n* Bruxelles Midi/Brussel Zuid (Belgium) to Marseille and Nice\n\nServices operated by CFF Lyria:\n* Gen\u00e8ve (Switzerland) to Marseille and Nice\n\nServices operated by DB Alleo:\n* Frankfurt am Main (Germany) to Marseille\n\nServices operated by Renfe AVE:\n* Madrid-Atocha (Spain) to Barcelona (Spain) to Marseille\n\nServices operated by Eurostar:\n* London Saint Pancras Int.

The Regional Council of Provence-Alpes C\u00f4te d'Azur is the transport authority and defines the services in all region. An attractive fare permits to transport more than 100,000 passengers every day in 750 trains. Trains are leaving every 15, 20, 30, 60 or 120 minutes on each line.\n\nWith only one big line, the tracks are saturated causing delays or cancellations. The region has to rent other trains from other regions to respond at the offer. In 2016, during the second Council of the Year at the Region Hall in Marseille, in front of politicians and the new president of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur [[Christian Estrosi]], the SNCF CEO, [[Guillaume Pepy]], has announced the impossibility of the company to respond to the demand. The [[Marseille-Saint-Charles Station]], the Marseille's main railway station can't support more than 23 trains an hour and the tracks are too old and not enough to accept an average of the capacity. The project of new high-speed line called [[LGV Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur|LGV PACA]] in 2030 could permit to increase trains on tracks with a new crossing of Marseille with a tunnel. Two new stations will be created in the territory of the city and a new line between Cannes and [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]].\n\nServices operated by CP:\n* Nice CP to Colomars and Plan du Var\n* Nice CP to Digne-les-Bains\n\nServices operated by SNCF are declined with two appellations unlike other regions : TER, normally suburban trains and Intervilles, long-distance regional trains.\nServices operated by SNCF Intervilles:\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Toulon, Nice and Monaco\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Gap and Brian\u00e7on\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Avignon and Lyon-Part-Dieu\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n* Brian\u00e7on to Gap, Valence TGV, Valence-Ville and Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re\n* Avignon-Centre to Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n\nServices operated by SNCF TER:\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Port-de-Bouc and Miramas\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Vitrolles MP Airport, Miramas and Avignon-Centre\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Vitrolles MP Airport, Miramas, N\u00eemes and Montpellier-Saint-Roch\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Vitrolles MP Airport, Salon-de-Provence, Avignon-Centre and Avignon TGV\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Saint-Antoine, Aix-en-Provence and Pertuis\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Saint-Antoine, Aix-en-Provence and Sisteron\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde and Aubagne\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde, Aubagne, Toulon and Hy\u00e8res\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde, Aubagne, Toulon and Les Arcs-Draguignan\n* Avignon-Centre, Valence and Lyon-Perrache\n* Avignon-Centre to N\u00eemes, Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n* Avignon TGV to Avignon-Centre and Carpentras\n* Les Arcs-Draguignan to Cannes, Nice, Monaco and Menton\n* Grasse to Cannes, Nice, Monaco, Menton and Ventimiglia (Italy)\n* Nice-Ville to Breil-sur-Roya and Cuneo (Italy)\n* Brian\u00e7on to Gap and Grenoble\n\n==Environment==\nThe mining company Alteo processes [[bauxite]] to produce aluminium, resulting in various waste materials such as \"boues rouges\" (red mud) and [[arsenic]]. The dumping of this waste in the marine reserve of the [[Calanques National Park]] for 6 years was authorised by the French government in 2015. Company representatives have dismissed environmental concerns as exaggerated and uninformed.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/pollution/article/2015/12/29/le-prefet-autorise-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques_4839315_1652666.html Le Monde]</ref> \n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/12/30/01016-20151230ARTFIG00195-querelle-gouvernementale-sur-les-boues-rouges.php Le Figaro]</ref>\n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alteo-environnement-gardanne.fr/-Arret-des-rejets-de-boues-rouges-61- boues rouges]</ref>\n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/nature-environnement/pollution/20151230.OBS2067/paca-le-prefet-autorise-pour-6-ans-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques.html Le prefet autorise pour 6 ans le rejet des boues rouges]</ref> The region also includes another National Park, the [[Port-Cros National Park]] near Toulon.\n\nDue to motor vehicle traffic, the urban areas are often saturated on a daily basis, but cities are investing in public transport networks such as Marseille's [[Marseille Metro|subway]] (2 lines) and [[Marseille tramway|tramway]] (3 lines), Aubagne's [[Aubagne tramway|tramway]] (1 line) and Nice's [[Nice tramway|tramway]] (1 line). Other networks existed at the beginning of the 20th century in smaller cities such as [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[La Ciotat]] and [[Toulon]] but are now gone.\n\n==Education==\nMajor universities of the region include the [[Aix-Marseille University]], the [[University of Toulon]], the [[University of Avignon]] and the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]].

Previously known by the acronym PACA, the region adopted the name ''R\u00e9gion Sud'' as a commercial name or nickname in December 2017.<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2017/12/16/la-provence-alpes-cote-d-azur-ne-sera-plus-surnommee-paca-mais-region-sud_5230750_3224.html</ref> 5,007,977 people live in the region according to the 2015 census.\n\nIt encompasses six [[Departments of France|departments]] in Southeastern France: [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], [[Alpes-Maritimes]], [[Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne]], [[Hautes-Alpes]], [[Var (department)|Var]] and [[Vaucluse]]. It is bounded to the east by the [[France-Italy border]], to the south by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and by the [[Monaco|Principality of Monaco]], to the north by [[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]], and to the west by [[Occitanie]], with the [[Rh\u00f4ne River|Rh\u00f4ne]] river marking its westernmost border.\n\nThe region logotype displays the coat of arms created in the 1990s and which combines the coats of arms of the old provinces making up Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur. Economically, the region is the third most important in France, just behind [[\u00cele-de-France (region)|\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]]. Its GDP in 2012 was \u20ac142.4 billion (US$183.1 billion) while its per capita GDP was \u20ac28,861 ($US 37,121).\n\n==Demographics==\n\n===Population===\nAccording to a 2015 census, the population in the region was 5,007,977; [[Marseille]] and its metropolitan area is the most populous in the region with a city population of 850,636, an urban population of 1,560,921 and a metropolitan population of 1,720,941. Marseille is the second largest city in France after [[Paris]], and has the third largest metropolitan population, behind those of Paris and [[Lyon]] respectively.\n\n[[Nice]] is host to the second-largest population concentration in the region, with a city population of 344,875 and an urban population of 1,005,230, making it the fifth-most populous city in France.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe absolute majority of the population speaks French and there are many minority languages. According to the 1999 Census, 4.39% (or 197.820 people) spoke English and 2.63% (or 118.512 people) spoke Italian with their relatives, friends or peers. Other minority languages were Spanish (2.38%, 107.247 people), Arabic (2.22%, 100.037 people), [[Proven\u00e7al dialect|Proven\u00e7al]] (2.20% or 99.136 people) and [[Corsican language|Corsican]] (0.58% or 26.135 people).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2007|title=Langues et cit\u00e9 - L'occitan|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/content/download/93537/841041/version/4/file/lc_10_occitan_def.pdf|journal=Minist\u00e8re de la Culture|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Immigration===\nAccording to a 2009 study, nearly 40% of all newborns in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur in 2007 had at least one parent of an immigrant background, mostly Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Maghrebi.

Along with Marseille, Nice is the second most important city in the region with a city proper population of about 350,000 and an urban population exceeding 1 million.\n\nMarseille, with an urban area of 2 million inhabitants, is the largest and capital city of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur region. It is also the second most populated city in France, just behind [[Paris]] and the city with the third largest metropolitan population in France, behind Paris and [[Lyon]] respectively.\n\nAlong with Nice and Marseille the region is also made internationally popular with [[Cannes]] which, though not a large city (population of 73,603 in 2012), hosts the annual [[Cannes Film Festival]] which has highly popularized the region. Also, [[Arles]] has become renowned as the city in which [[Vincent van Gogh]] lived and painted 300 paintings.\n\nToulon is a large military harbour on the Mediterranean coast, with the French naval base placed there. It is the capital of the Var department in the region. Also, Aix-en-Provence has long been a university town, and to this day remains the most important educational centre in the region.\n\nBelow is a list of the most populated cities in the region along with their population (city proper) according to the most recent census.\n\n* [[Aix-en-Provence]] \u2013 142,743\n* [[Antibes]] (includes [[Juan-les-Pins]]) \u2013 76,994\n* [[Arles]] \u2013 52,729\n* [[Aubagne]] \u2013 46,423\n* [[Avignon]] \u2013 90,194\n* [[Cannes]] \u2013 73,603\n* [[Draguignan]] \u2013 38,258\n* [[Fr\u00e9jus]] \u2013 52,389\n* [[Grasse]] \u2013 51,580\n* [[Hy\u00e8res]] \u2013 56,275\n* [[La Seyne-sur-Mer]] \u2013 64,903\n* [[Le Cannet]] \u2013 40,940\n* [[Mandelieu-la-Napoule]] \u2013 22,714\n* [[Marseille]] \u2013 861,636\n* [[Martigues]] \u2013 76,471\n* [[Mougins]] \u2013 19,703\n* [[Nice]] \u2013 343,875\n* [[Toulon]] \u2013 167,729\n* [[Villeneuve-Loubet]] \u2013 14,427\n\n==Geography==\n\nThis region has a total area of {{convert|31400|km2|abbr=on}}. It has a wide variety of landscapes, from the [[Alps]] mountains to plains and coastal areas like [[Nice]] and [[Marseille]], which form the majority of the land area. The region has a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline on the south, on which the majority of its population lives. It borders [[Italy]] ([[Liguria]] and [[Piedmont]]) to the east, [[Monaco]] ([[Fontvieille, Monaco|Fontvieille]], [[La Colle, Monaco|La Colle]], [[La Rousse]], [[Larvotto]], [[Les Moneghetti]], [[Les R\u00e9voires]], [[Saint Michel, Monaco|Saint Michel]]) in the south-east, and the French regions of [[Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes]] to the north and [[Occitanie]] to the west. The Rh\u00f4ne, Var and Arc rivers run through the region. The borders were unaffected by the 2016 French regional reforms.\n\nThis region is famous for the C\u00f4te d'Azur ([[French Riviera]]), which spans the glamorous cities of [[Nice]], [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]], [[Antibes]], [[Juan-les-Pins]], [[Cannes]], [[Fr\u00e9jus]], [[Saint-Rapha\u00ebl, Var|Saint-Rapha\u00ebl]], [[Sainte-Maxime]] and [[Saint-Tropez]].\n\n==Regional government and politics==\n\nThe [[Regional council (France)|Regional council]] is the legislative body of the region. The President of the regional council has been [[Renaud Muselier]] (LR) since 2017.\n\n===Political tendencies===\nIn the recent years [[Les R\u00e9publicains]] have gained strong support in the region and following the 2015 departmental elections, they control the region, which had been narrowly controlled by the [[Parti Socialiste (France)|Parti Socialiste]] with Michel Vauzelle previously.\n\nThe [[Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais|French Communist Party]] historically had several strongholds in the region from the 1920s onward, including [[Aubagne]], [[Draguignan]], [[La Ciotat]], [[Beausoleil, Alpes-Maritimes|Beausoleil]], [[Martigues]], [[Gardanne]], [[Arles]] and some suburbs of [[Marseille]]. Though not enough to win the regional elections, the party usually received about 10% of the vote. Beginning with 2002 this declined to 4% and by 2012, dropped below 2%.\n\nThe main competition seen in the politics of this region is between Les R\u00e9publicains and the Parti Socialiste (PS), both deferring in its opinions. According to the most recent elections, the political tendencies are as follows-\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n! \u00c9lection / collectivit\u00e9s !! Les R\u00e9publicains (centre-right) !!

Income inequality however is higher than in other regions: the region is ranked 4th by percent of population living above the poverty line. The region is ranked third by GDP. Between 2007 and 2011, the region registered an average annual growth rate of 1.6% of GDP (Eurostat), close to the national average annual growth rate of 1.5%. Representing 7.2% of the national GDP over the period, the region is an important economic powerhouse.\n\nIn 2013, the region was responsible for 7.4% of national employment, with an employment rate of 89.2%. The region's employment success has a main characteristic: a higher concentration of elderly people than in the rest of France (respectively 27.1% and 24.1% in 2013).\n\nWith more than 80% of regional employment in the service sector in 2010, the regional economy is mostly oriented towards service activities, above the national average of 76.3%. The sector grew between 2000 and 2010 (3.1% on annual average vs. 2.1% in France). The region concentrates more on commercial activities than financial ones than the rest of France does; principally because of tourism. 34% of the labour force is employed in retail and trade, against 32% at the national level. Moreover, the sector strongly contributes to growth of added value (81.5% vs. 77.3% at the national level). The industrial sector (existing mainly through the [[Marseille-Fos Port]]), including construction, consists of 17.1% of regional employment (vs. 20.6% in the rest of France), and contributes to 9.3% of gross added value, 3.2 points below the French level.\n\nEmployment in the agricultural sector is lower than the national level (2.4% against 3.1%). However, it grew at a rate of 4.1% annually on average between 2000 and 2008, while the rest of the country saw its agricultural employment decline by 2.4%. According to the [[Institut national de la statistique et des \u00e9tudes \u00e9conomiques]], the region is characterised by a strong presence of SMEs of less than 500 employees, which represent 91.2% of local businesses (higher than the national average of 90.9%). Retail activities and tourism explain these figures.\n\nThe region's economy is dependent on tourism like most coastal places but also a majority of its economy is dependent on coastal activities. PACA is the 3rd richest French region and ranks 19th on the European scale. Its prosperity is mainly thanks to its attractiveness in terms of tourism; it is indeed one of the world's favourite tourist destinations, welcoming about 34 million tourists every year. The service sector predominates and provides many good jobs. In 2009, the region was admittedly affected by the global economic crisis, albeit to a small extent. It is (after the Paris area) the 2nd French region with regards to business startups.\n\nIf tourism is the driving force of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, the region is also a leader when it comes to innovative sectors, such as high technology, biotechnology, and microelectronics. Education, for its part, is well developed with the region's various universities, international schools, preparatory classes for specialist university courses, and engineering and business schools. All these institutions of higher learning help contribute to the human capital needed by the region to meet current technological challenges.\n\nThe region has a total GDP (2012) of \u20ac142.4 billion (US$183.1 bn), the third highest in France. It has a per capita GDP of \u20ac28,861 (US$37,121), slightly higher than the French average. According to a recent survey, a person living in Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur has an average annual income of about \u20ac37,489 (US$45,755).\n\nThe region has been part of [[Alps\u2013Mediterranean Euroregion]] since 10 July 2007.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:DS4 9354.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations]] in Marseille]]\nThe region is one of the most visited of France, and has therefore many well-known museums, mostly in Marseille: the [[Museum of European and Mediterranean Civilisations]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Cantini]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Grobet-Labadi\u00e9]], the [[Marseille History Museum]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Marseille]], the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Fa\u00efence de Marseille]] and the [[Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle de Marseille]] are some of the tourist spots of the city. However, other museums are internationally recognised, like the [[Mus\u00e9e Matisse (Nice)|Mus\u00e9e Matisse]], the [[Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]], the [[Mus\u00e9e Marc Chagall]], the [[Mus\u00e9e international d'Art na\u00eff Anatole Jakovsky]], the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Nice]], the [[Mus\u00e9e National du Sport]] and the [[Mus\u00e9um d'histoire naturelle de Nice]].\n\n== Transportation ==\n[[File:Nice airport.jpg|thumb|Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]]\n=== Airports ===\nPACA has two of the busiest airports in France: [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]] (ranking 3rd after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]]) and [[Marseille Provence Airport]] (ranking 5th after [[Lyon\u2013Saint-Exup\u00e9ry Airport]]). Nice saw 13,850,000 people travelling through its airport in 2018, while 8,478,541 used Marseille to fly.\n\nMinor airports include [[Montpellier\u2013M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Airport]] (1,671,545 passengers in 2016) and [[Toulon\u2013Hy\u00e8res Airport]] (500,046).\n\n=== Motorways ===\nThe region is at the centre of a complex and dense motorway network, in the heart of Mediterranean coast. Motorways are operated by ASF, ESCOTA, SMTC, MPM (Marseille Metropolis) and DIR Med (State). In PACA, motorways have the particularity to serve the city centres of big towns, unlike other big cities of France. This is due to their comparatively early construction in relation to the motorways of France's other regions.\n* [[A7 autoroute|A7]] - Autoroute du Soleil \"Motorway of the Sun\" links the region to Lyon and on to the North of France.

The Regional Council of Provence-Alpes C\u00f4te d'Azur is the transport authority and defines the services in all region. An attractive fare permits to transport more than 100,000 passengers every day in 750 trains. Trains are leaving every 15, 20, 30, 60 or 120 minutes on each line.\n\nWith only one big line, the tracks are saturated causing delays or cancellations. The region has to rent other trains from other regions to respond at the offer. In 2016, during the second Council of the Year at the Region Hall in Marseille, in front of politicians and the new president of the Regional Council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur [[Christian Estrosi]], the SNCF CEO, [[Guillaume Pepy]], has announced the impossibility of the company to respond to the demand. The [[Marseille-Saint-Charles Station]], the Marseille's main railway station can't support more than 23 trains an hour and the tracks are too old and not enough to accept an average of the capacity. The project of new high-speed line called [[LGV Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur|LGV PACA]] in 2030 could permit to increase trains on tracks with a new crossing of Marseille with a tunnel. Two new stations will be created in the territory of the city and a new line between Cannes and [[Nice C\u00f4te d'Azur Airport]].\n\nServices operated by CP:\n* Nice CP to Colomars and Plan du Var\n* Nice CP to Digne-les-Bains\n\nServices operated by SNCF are declined with two appellations unlike other regions : TER, normally suburban trains and Intervilles, long-distance regional trains.\nServices operated by SNCF Intervilles:\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Toulon, Nice and Monaco\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Gap and Brian\u00e7on\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Avignon and Lyon-Part-Dieu\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n* Brian\u00e7on to Gap, Valence TGV, Valence-Ville and Romans-sur-Is\u00e8re\n* Avignon-Centre to Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n\nServices operated by SNCF TER:\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Port-de-Bouc and Miramas\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Vitrolles MP Airport, Miramas and Avignon-Centre\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Vitrolles MP Airport, Miramas, N\u00eemes and Montpellier-Saint-Roch\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Eurom\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, Vitrolles MP Airport, Salon-de-Provence, Avignon-Centre and Avignon TGV\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Saint-Antoine, Aix-en-Provence and Pertuis\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Saint-Antoine, Aix-en-Provence and Sisteron\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde and Aubagne\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde, Aubagne, Toulon and Hy\u00e8res\n* Marseille-Saint-Charles to Marseille-Blancarde, Aubagne, Toulon and Les Arcs-Draguignan\n* Avignon-Centre, Valence and Lyon-Perrache\n* Avignon-Centre to N\u00eemes, Montpellier, Narbonne and Perpignan\n* Avignon TGV to Avignon-Centre and Carpentras\n* Les Arcs-Draguignan to Cannes, Nice, Monaco and Menton\n* Grasse to Cannes, Nice, Monaco, Menton and Ventimiglia (Italy)\n* Nice-Ville to Breil-sur-Roya and Cuneo (Italy)\n* Brian\u00e7on to Gap and Grenoble\n\n==Environment==\nThe mining company Alteo processes [[bauxite]] to produce aluminium, resulting in various waste materials such as \"boues rouges\" (red mud) and [[arsenic]]. The dumping of this waste in the marine reserve of the [[Calanques National Park]] for 6 years was authorised by the French government in 2015. Company representatives have dismissed environmental concerns as exaggerated and uninformed.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lemonde.fr/pollution/article/2015/12/29/le-prefet-autorise-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques_4839315_1652666.html Le Monde]</ref> \n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/12/30/01016-20151230ARTFIG00195-querelle-gouvernementale-sur-les-boues-rouges.php Le Figaro]</ref>\n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.alteo-environnement-gardanne.fr/-Arret-des-rejets-de-boues-rouges-61- boues rouges]</ref>\n<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/nature-environnement/pollution/20151230.OBS2067/paca-le-prefet-autorise-pour-6-ans-le-rejet-des-boues-rouges-dans-le-parc-national-des-calanques.html Le prefet autorise pour 6 ans le rejet des boues rouges]</ref> The region also includes another National Park, the [[Port-Cros National Park]] near Toulon.\n\nDue to motor vehicle traffic, the urban areas are often saturated on a daily basis, but cities are investing in public transport networks such as Marseille's [[Marseille Metro|subway]] (2 lines) and [[Marseille tramway|tramway]] (3 lines), Aubagne's [[Aubagne tramway|tramway]] (1 line) and Nice's [[Nice tramway|tramway]] (1 line). Other networks existed at the beginning of the 20th century in smaller cities such as [[Aix-en-Provence]], [[Avignon]], [[La Ciotat]] and [[Toulon]] but are now gone.\n\n==Education==\nMajor universities of the region include the [[Aix-Marseille University]], the [[University of Toulon]], the [[University of Avignon]] and the [[University of Nice Sophia Antipolis]]. Other towns have higher education classes but no universities.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur}}\n{{wikivoyage|Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur}}\n<!-- please keep this link: Dmoz page holds a Wikipedia back link -->\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130317114527/http://www.france.fr/en/regions-and-cities/provence-alpes-cote-dazur-soft-singsong-accents Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur : soft singsong accents]- Official French website (in English)\n* {{ODP|Regional/Europe/France/Regions/Provence-Alpes-Cote_d%27Azur/|Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur}}\n* [http://www.regionpaca.fr/ Conseil r\u00e9gional Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur] Official website\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20111011055328/http://www.francesouth.com/map/provence.htm FranceSouth.com] Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur Guide\n\n{{Regions of France|current}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Provence-Alpes-Cote D'azur}}\n[[Category:Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur| ]]\n[[Category:Regions of France]]\n[[Category:NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union]]\n", "name_user": "Assouplir", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixed two instances of \"important,\" a slightly incorrect translation from French to English", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence-Alpes-C%C3%B4te_d%27Azur"}
