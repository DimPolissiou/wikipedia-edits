A high-end device, the Galaxy Alpha is Samsung's first smartphone to incorporate a metallic frame and more premium materials, although the remainder of its physical appearance still resembles previous models such as the [[Galaxy S5]]. It also incorporates the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 801 or Samsung's new [[Exynos]] 5430 system-on-chip, which is the first mobile system-on-chip to use a 20 [[nanometer]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing process]]. However, the Galaxy Alpha received mixed reviews: although praised for its higher quality build and design in comparison to earlier Galaxy models' utilitarian plastic construction, the device was criticized for its modest specifications in comparison to the flagship Galaxy S5, with the Alpha being criticized for lacking water resistance, lower resolution screen (720p versus 1080p) and no MicroSD slot for expandable storage. The Alpha also debuted at a price too high for what some considered to be a \"mid-range\" smartphone, as although it did share the same Snapdragon 801 as the Galaxy S5, most earlier phones with the Snapdragon 801 had already been on the market for months and saw price drops. Following its launch, Samsung Electronics CEO JK Shin explained that the Alpha was \"built and designed based on the specific desires of the consumer market.\" The company touted that the Galaxy Alpha would mark a \"new design approach\" for Samsung's products, and that elements from the Alpha could appear on future Samsung models.<ref name=\"verge-unveil\">{{cite web|title=Samsung ditches all-plastic design with metal Galaxy Alpha|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5997769/samsung-galaxy-alpha-release-date-pictures-video|website=The Verge|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}</ref> Its operating system is based on [[Android KitKat|Android 4.4.4 \"KitKat\"]] with its own version of [[TouchWiz]] UI.

A high-end device, the Galaxy Alpha is Samsung's first smartphone to incorporate a metallic frame and more premium materials, although the remainder of its physical appearance still resembles previous models such as the [[Galaxy S5]]. It also incorporates the [[Qualcomm Snapdragon]] 801 or Samsung's new [[Exynos]] 5430 system-on-chip, which is the first mobile system-on-chip to use a 20 [[nanometer]] [[Semiconductor device fabrication|manufacturing process]]. However, the Galaxy Alpha received mixed reviews: although praised for its higher quality build and design in comparison to earlier Galaxy models' utilitarian plastic construction, the device was criticized for its modest specifications in comparison to the flagship Galaxy S5, with the Alpha being criticized for lacking water resistance, lower resolution screen (720p versus 1080p) and no MicroSD slot for expandable storage. The Alpha also debuted at a price too high for what some considered to be a \"mid-range\" smartphone, as although it did share the same Snapdragon 801 as the Galaxy S5, most earlier phones with the Snapdragon 801 had already been on the market for months and saw price drops. Following its launch, Samsung Electronics CEO JK Shin explained that the Alpha was \"built and designed based on the specific desires of the consumer market.\" The company touted that the Galaxy Alpha would mark a \"new design approach\" for Samsung's products, and that elements from the Alpha could appear on future Samsung models.<ref name=\"verge-unveil\">{{cite web|title=Samsung ditches all-plastic design with metal Galaxy Alpha|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/13/5997769/samsung-galaxy-alpha-release-date-pictures-video|website=The Verge|accessdate=16 August 2014|date=13 August 2014}}</ref> Its operating system is based on [[Android KitKat|Android 4.4.4 \"KitKat\"]] with its own version of [[TouchWiz]] UI.

It was originally broadcast in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (American Broadcasting Company) on May 22, 2005. The episode was directed by [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] and written by [[John Pardee]], [[Joey Murphy]], series creator [[Marc Cherry]], [[Tom Spezialy]], and [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]].\n\nIn the episode, the mystery surrounding the suicide of series narrator [[Mary Alice Young]] ([[Brenda Strong]]) is resolved. [[Carlos Solis|Carlos]] ([[Ricardo Antonio Chavira]]) finally discovers the truth about [[Gabrielle Solis|Gabrielle's]] ([[Eva Longoria]]) affair while [[Bree Van de Kamp|Bree]] ([[Marcia Cross]]) learns that her husband has died. Meanwhile, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Zach Young|Zach]] ([[Cody Kasch]]) holds [[Susan Delfino|Susan]] ([[Teri Hatcher]]) hostage and [[Tom Scavo|Tom]] ([[Doug Savant]]) forces [[Lynette Scavo|Lynette]] ([[Felicity Huffman]]) to go back to work.\n\nAccording to [[Nielsen ratings]], the episode drew over 30 million viewers upon its initial broadcasting in the United States, becoming the most-watched program of the night across all networks, as well as the highest-rated episode of ''Desperate Housewives''. The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, most of whom complimented the writers for wrapping up the season's major story arcs. However, Ann Hodgman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' criticized the episode for being predictable and spending too much time on the Mary Alice storyline.  In 2009, ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed \"One Wonderful Day\" as the 55th [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time|best television episode of all-time]].\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Background===\n''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' focuses on the lives of several residents of [[Wisteria Lane]] and primarily on the friends of [[Mary Alice Young]] ([[Brenda Strong]]), whose suicide in the [[Pilot (Desperate Housewives)|first episode]] serves as the subject of the season's mystery.<ref>\"[[Pilot (Desperate Housewives)|Pilot]]\".

Zach violently attacks Felicia, forcing her to reveal that Mike has taken Paul away to kill him. Later that day, Susan goes to Mike's house to feed his dog and discovers Zach waiting with a gun. He holds Susan hostage and explains his plan to kill Mike when he returns home. Meanwhile, Mike takes Paul to a desert and coerces him into explaining the truth behind Dierdre's death. Paul explains that twelve years earlier, Dierdre, a drug addict, sold Mary Alice and Paul her baby. The couple relocate to Wisteria Lane to avoid the discovery of their crime. Sometime later, a sober Dierdre finally tracked down the Young family and attempted to take her son back. Mary Alice stabbed and killed Dierdre to prevent her from taking Zach. Together, Mary Alice and Paul buried Dierdre's body beneath their pool.\n\nRex learns that he will have to undergo surgery following his heart attack. Before the operation, Rex's doctor suggests that Bree may have been poisoning him, citing their marital issues as a possible motive. Rex writes a note informing Bree that he understands and forgives her and dies soon after. During Carlos's trial, John informs Carlos that he had been having an affair with Gabrielle, sending Carlos into a violent outburst in the courthouse. Elsewhere, Lynette learns that Tom has quit his job as a result of Lynette's betrayal. He then decides that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brenda Strong at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Brenda Strong]] portrays [[Mary Alice Young]], the series' deceased narrator. \"One Wonderful Day\" answers the season-long questions surrounding her mysterious suicide]]\n\n\"One Wonderful Day\" was directed by [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] and written by [[John Pardee]], [[Joey Murphy]], series creator [[Marc Cherry]], [[Tom Spezialy]], and [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]]. It was filmed in April 2005. The writers were still working on the script when filming began; as a result, the ending narration was written based on the visuals that had been filmed.<ref name=\"audio\">Audio commentary on \"One Wonderful Day\" with [[Marc Cherry]] and [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]]. [[List of Desperate Housewives DVD releases#Season 1|''Desperate Housewives'': The Complete First Season]]. [DVD]. [[Touchstone Pictures]].</ref> The episode focused largely on the conclusion of the Mary Alice mystery storyline. Cherry had wanted there to be a \"definite end\" to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The storyline relied on two flashback sequences, which featured Jolie Jenkins as Dierdre Taylor. Though \"One Wonderful Day\" was her first on-screen appearance in the series, Jenkins was cast in the role in the fall of 2004, as scenes earlier in the season required photographs of the Dierdre character. Because no material had been written for the character at the time, Jenkins did not have to audition for the role.<ref name=\"audio\" /> ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill Dierdre, prompting the writers to make Dierdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The writers struggled with whether or not to include a gunshot at the end of the episode when Mike returns to his house where Zach is holding Susan hostage. Ultimately, Spezialy convinced the other writers not to include it.<ref name=\"audio\" />\n\n\"One Wonderful Day\" also introduced the second-season mystery surrounding [[Betty Applewhite]] ([[Alfre Woodard]]) and [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Matthew Applewhite|Matthew Applewhite]] ([[Mehcad Brooks]]).

The episode received mostly positive reviews from critics, most of whom complimented the writers for wrapping up the season's major story arcs. However, Ann Hodgman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' criticized the episode for being predictable and spending too much time on the Mary Alice storyline.

Zach violently attacks Felicia, forcing her to reveal that Mike has taken Paul away to kill him. Later that day, Susan goes to Mike's house to feed his dog and discovers Zach waiting with a gun. He holds Susan hostage and explains his plan to kill Mike when he returns home. Meanwhile, Mike takes Paul to a desert and coerces him into explaining the truth behind Dierdre's death. Paul explains that twelve years earlier, Dierdre, a drug addict, sold Mary Alice and Paul her baby. The couple relocate to Wisteria Lane to avoid the discovery of their crime. Sometime later, a sober Dierdre finally tracked down the Young family and attempted to take her son back. Mary Alice stabbed and killed Dierdre to prevent her from taking Zach. Together, Mary Alice and Paul buried Dierdre's body beneath their pool.\n\nRex learns that he will have to undergo surgery following his heart attack. Before the operation, Rex's doctor suggests that Bree may have been poisoning him, citing their marital issues as a possible motive. Rex writes a note informing Bree that he understands and forgives her and dies soon after. During Carlos's trial, John informs Carlos that he had been having an affair with Gabrielle, sending Carlos into a violent outburst in the courthouse. Elsewhere, Lynette learns that Tom has quit his job as a result of Lynette's betrayal. He then decides that she will go back to work and he will be a stay-at-home father.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Brenda Strong at PaleyFest 2013.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Brenda Strong]] portrays [[Mary Alice Young]], the series' deceased narrator. \"One Wonderful Day\" answers the season-long questions surrounding her mysterious suicide]]\n\n\"One Wonderful Day\" was directed by [[Larry Shaw (director)|Larry Shaw]] and written by [[John Pardee]], [[Joey Murphy]], series creator [[Marc Cherry]], [[Tom Spezialy]], and [[Kevin Murphy (screenwriter)|Kevin Murphy]].

Cherry had wanted there to be a \"definite end\" to the mystery, hoping to avoid similar viewer fatigue that ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' suffered after drawing out its central mystery past its first season.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The storyline relied on two flashback sequences, which featured Jolie Jenkins as Dierdre Taylor. Though \"One Wonderful Day\" was her first on-screen appearance in the series, Jenkins was cast in the role in the fall of 2004, as scenes earlier in the season required photographs of the Dierdre character. Because no material had been written for the character at the time, Jenkins did not have to audition for the role.<ref name=\"audio\" /> ABC executives initially protested the writers' decision to have Mary Alice purposefully kill Dierdre, prompting the writers to make Dierdre violent in order to justify Mary Alice's actions.<ref name=\"audio\" /> The writers struggled with whether or not to include a gunshot at the end of the episode when Mike returns to his house where Zach is holding Susan hostage. Ultimately, Spezialy convinced the other writers not to include it.<ref name=\"audio\" />\n\n\"One Wonderful Day\" also introduced the second-season mystery surrounding [[Betty Applewhite]] ([[Alfre Woodard]]) and [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Matthew Applewhite|Matthew Applewhite]] ([[Mehcad Brooks]]).

In 2008, he was introduced to an acting agency by longterm friend [[Jim Sweeney (actor)|Jim Sweeney]] and landed the role of Sean in the Scottish soap opera ''[[River City]]'' and went on to appear in a number of episodes before departing in 2011.<ref>[http://glasgow.stv.tv/articles/259371-from-river-city-to-the-city-of-angels-the-young-scot-taking-on-hollywood/ STV News Article: 'From River City to the City of Angels: The young Scot taking on Hollywood']</ref> The following year he starred in the critically acclaimed short film, ''The Lost Purse'' in which Laird played the leading role of The Kid.<ref>[http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film/scotlands-young-film-and-tv-stars-l.2012108493 Herald Scotland Article: 'Scotland's Young Film and TV Stars']</ref><ref>[http://www.bafta.org/scotland/awards/new-talent/nominees-winners/british-academy-scotland-new-talent-award-winners-in-2013#jump9 Lost Purse Bafta Nomination for Best Original Music]</ref> The film told the story a young deaf man who notices that a pretty girl sitting across from him on the train has left behind her purse on the seat.
