Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in [[C (programming language)|C]]. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with [[Swing (Java)|Swing]], [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] or [[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]]. Jython compiles Python source code to [[Java bytecode]] (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.\n\n==History==\nJython was initially created in late 1997 to replace [[C (programming language)|C]] with [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, moving to [[SourceForge]] in October 2000. The [[Python Software Foundation]] awarded a grant in January 2005.  Jython 2.5 was released in June 2009.<ref name=\"2.5.0\">{{cite web\n|url=http://fwierzbicki.blogspot.com/2009/06/jython-250-final-is-out.html\n|title=Jython 2.5.0 Final is out!\n|date=2009-06-16\n|accessdate=2009-07-02\n|last=Wierzbicki|first=Frank\n}}</ref>\n\n==Status and roadmap==\nThe most recent release is Jython 2.7.2.

Except for some standard modules, Jython programs use Java classes instead of Python modules. Jython includes almost all of the modules in the standard [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] distribution, lacking only some of the modules implemented originally in [[C (programming language)|C]]. For example, a user interface in Jython could be written with [[Swing (Java)|Swing]], [[Abstract Window Toolkit|AWT]] or [[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]]. Jython compiles Python source code to [[Java bytecode]] (an intermediate language) either on demand or statically.\n\n==History==\nJython was initially created in late 1997 to replace [[C (programming language)|C]] with [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for performance-intensive code accessed by Python programs, moving to [[SourceForge]] in October 2000. The [[Python Software Foundation]] awarded a grant in January 2005.

Allen Jerkens Memorial Stakes]].\n\n==Background==\nPractical Joke is a bay colt with a star and no other white markings who was bred in Kentucky by Whispering Oaks. He is from the fifth crop of foals by [[Into Mischief]], a stakes winning son of [[Harlan's Holiday]] and out of Leslie's Lady, who later produced champion [[Beholder (horse)|Beholder]]. Into Mischief originally stood for only $12,500, but his profile increased when he sired two-time Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner [[Goldencents]]. Practical Joke is the fourth foal out of the stakes placed mare Halo Humor, by [[Distorted Humor]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sparkman|first1=John P.|title=Practical Joke is Into Mischief's latest serious runner|url=http://www.drf.com/news/sparkman-practical-joke-mischiefs-latest-serious-runner|website=Daily Racing Form|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref> He was sold twice as a yearling in 2015, first in the [[Keeneland Sales|Keeneland]] January mixed sale for $135,000 and then at the Keeneland September sale for $240,000.<ref name=EquibaseProfile />\n\n==Racing career==\n===2016: two-year-old season===\nPractical Joke started his career in a 6 furlong [[Maiden race|Maiden Special Weight]] at [[Saratoga Race Course|Saratoga]] on August 6. He was sent off as the 5\u201312 favorite ridden by [[Irad Ortiz Jr.]]. Leaving the gate, he bumped with another horse and was near the back of the pack down the backstretch. He went wide on the turn and started to close quickly on the early leaders, then drew away in the stretch to win by 5 lengths.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chart for Saratoga - August 6, 2016|url=http://www.equibase.com/premium/chartEmb.cfm?track=SAR&raceDate=08/06/2016&cy=USA&rn=2|website=www.equibase.com|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nHe then entered the [[Hopeful Stakes]] on September 9 where he was the 2-1 second choice in a field of six behind [[Classic Empire]]. Ridden by [[Jose Ortiz (jockey)|Jose Ortiz]], he settled at the back of the pack behind a slow early pace, then swung wide around the turn. In the stretch, he battled with Royal Copy and Pretty Boy Flash but inched away late in the final furlong to win by a neck. Ortiz said after the race, \"He was running the whole way. He gave me a great turn of foot when I got him in the clear but the other two horses were in front and they kept fighting a little bit.

What a great moment for me and my staff... It's been a pleasure to train him.

He was the 5-2 second choice behind Syndergaard at 9-5. Now ridden by [[Joel Rosario]], he broke awkwardly and ducked in toward the rail, then settled into mid-pack. He made his move around the turn and in the stretch he got even with Syndergaard and dueled down to the wire to win a head bobbing finish by a nose in a time of 1:34.68. It was the fourth fastest [[Champagne Stakes (United States)|Champagne Stakes]] in the history of the race.<ref>http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/215689/practical-joke-edges-syndergaard-in-champagne</ref> Rosario stated after the race, \"He kind of broke awkward on the inside and I had to use him a little through the chute. He was looking around and it took him a little time to get back in the race but he was fine after that. They were going really fast up front but it looks like the more distance he gets to run into the better he gets. For a second when I got to the other horse (Syndergaard) he waited a little bit. He's still a young horse if anything but looks good going forward.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Angst|first1=Frank|title=Practical Joke Edges Syndergaard in Champagne|url=http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/215689/practical-joke-edges-syndergaard-in-champagne|website=BloodHorse.com|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Breeders' Cup Juvenile]] was held at Santa Anita race track on November 5. Practical Joke was one of several horses at 7-1 odds in a highly competitive field of thirteen that included Grade I winners [[Klimt (horse)|Klimt]] (Del Mar Futurity), [[Gormley (horse)|Gormley]] (FrontRunner) and [[Classic Empire]] (Breeders' Futurity). At the break, Practical Joke bumped with Not This Time, then settled into mid pack.

Into Mischief originally stood for only $12,500, but his profile increased when he sired two-time Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile winner [[Goldencents]].
