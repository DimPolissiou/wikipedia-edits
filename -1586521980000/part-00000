This statement was in response to publicity surrounding LGBT rights event that was held in Amman.  A rough translation of the statement is as follows;  \" The first clause: The Jordanian state is keen on respecting the Islamic dogma and the true islamic religion's doctrine which was clearly affirmed in the first article of the Jordanian Constitution that states: \"Islam is the religion of the Jordanian State\" and the provisions of the Jordanian civil law are in line with the provisions of the Islamic Sharia law, jurisprudence and customs as they are the source of legislation; therefore, recognizing LGBT groups is considered as a breach of the Islamic Sharia and subsequently the Jordanian Constitution. Any proposals by the sexually perverted to breach the provisions of Sharia Law and the general order, and for that the aforementioned proposals are considered a crime punishable by law. Second clause: Concerning the IDAHOT meeting; the government did not give its consent for it to be held, knowing that the Law of General Meetings number 7 of year 2004 and its amendments is responsible in organizing any public meeting and so the administrative governor should be informed about the meeting should it be held, which did not happen. Third clause: The Government does not possess any assuring intelligence for the existence of and official sponsorship by a foreign mission including the Embassy of the United States to the aforementioned meeting. Final clause: The government won't tolerate in enforcing the law's provisions to maintain security order and decorum while preserving its Muslim Arab principles and traditions; Therefore, we shall pursue whoever is proven to have breached these principles and submit them to the judiciary to execute the necessary legal action against them.\"\n\nIn 2017, [[Mashrou' Leila|Mashrou\u2019 Leila]], a Lebanese-based band, was banned from performing in Jordan.

Any proposals by the sexually perverted to breach the provisions of Sharia Law and the general order, and for that the aforementioned proposals are considered a crime punishable by law. Second clause: Concerning the IDAHOT meeting; the government did not give its consent for it to be held, knowing that the Law of General Meetings number 7 of year 2004 and its amendments is responsible in organizing any public meeting and so the administrative governor should be informed about the meeting should it be held, which did not happen. Third clause: The Government does not possess any assuring intelligence for the existence of and official sponsorship by a foreign mission including the Embassy of the United States to the aforementioned meeting. Final clause: The government won't tolerate in enforcing the law's provisions to maintain security order and decorum while preserving its Muslim Arab principles and traditions; Therefore, we shall pursue whoever is proven to have breached these principles and submit them to the judiciary to execute the necessary legal action against them.\"\n\nIn 2017, [[Mashrou' Leila|Mashrou\u2019 Leila]], a Lebanese-based band, was banned from performing in Jordan.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

Bulked-up versions of Monotype's pre-existing but rather dainty [[Baskerville]] and [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typefaces were considered for a basis, and the [[Legibility Group]] designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor [[Eric Gill]] at Morison's urging, is considered a 'transitional' design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that \"Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=202}}\n\nMorison's biographer [[Nicolas Barker]] has written that Morison's memos of the time wavered over a variety of options before it was ultimately concluded that Plantin formed the best basis for a condensed font that could nonetheless be made to fill out the full size of the letter space as far as possible. (Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was 'too basically circular' to be practical to condense in an attractive way.{{efn|Dreyfus shows proofs of the experimental recut of Perpetua with shortened descenders to allow tighter linespacing.<ref name=\"The Evolution of Times New Roman\" /> Morison later commented that \"it stared at the reader\".}})\n\n[[Walter Tracy]] and James Moran, who discussed the design's creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by [[Christophe Plantin]].

Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to [[Social history of the United Kingdom (1945\u2013present)#Age of Austerity|pressures of austerity]], took a post as editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'' which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison's only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the [[Bauer Type Foundry]] of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. (Morison's friend Brooke Crutchley recorded in his diary being told by Morison that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be \"analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.\"<ref name=\"From a Cambridge Diary\">{{cite journal |last1=Crutchley |first1=Brooke |title=From a Cambridge Diary |journal=Matrix |date=1990 |volume=10 |publisher=[[Whittington Press]]}}</ref>)\n\n==Metal type versions==\nA large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular families of titling capitals for headlines.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=39}} Walter Tracy in ''Letters of Credit'', Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=270}}{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}{{sfn|Hutt|1960|p=107}}\n\n===Titling===\nMonotype also created some caps-only 'titling' designs to match Times New Roman itself, which was intended for body text.<ref name=\"The Times: New roman and related founts.\" /> These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype's Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.<ref name=\"Linotype Times Eighteen\" />\n{{clear}}\n===Times Hever Titling===\n[[File:Times Hever Titling.jpg|thumb|right|Times Hever Titling from a Monotype specimen.]]\nAn elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a [[Caslon|Caslon-style]] A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype's previous [[Bembo|Poliphilus]] design as an influence.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=208}} Named after [[Hever Castle]], the home of the ''Times''' owner [[John Jacob Astor|Lord Astor]] and designed early on, it was used by the ''Times'' for headings in the lighter sections such as [[Society reporting|society pages]], arts and fashion.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=207}}<ref name=\"Comments on Typophile thread Savoie Hudson\">{{cite web|last1=Savoie|first1=Alice|last2=Hudson|first2=John|title=Comments on Typophile thread |url=http://typophile.com/node/101099 |website=Typophile |accessdate=16 September 2015 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717150729/http://typophile.com/node/101099 |archivedate=17 July 2014 }}</ref> It has not been digitised.\n\n===Times Wide (1938, series 427)===\nA variant intended for book printing, avoiding the slight condensation of the original Times New Roman.<ref name=\"Monotype Recorder first showing\">{{cite journal|title=Typographic Problems of the Illustrated Book|journal=Monotype Recorder|date=1938|volume=37|issue=2|page=31|url=http://www.metaltype.co.uk/downloads/mr/mr_37_2.pdf|quote=Some types look larger, size for size, than others, because they have unusually short descenders and ascenders.

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: \"Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.\"{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} He described it as particularly used in \"book work, especially non-fiction\" such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]]''.{{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} Allen Hutt also commented that Times New Roman's relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used\u2013but ''The Times'', whose [[Style guide|house style]] in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.{{sfn|Hutt|1970|p=264}}\n\nTimes New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing.{{sfn|Williamson|1956|p=102}}<ref name=\"Es gilt das gesprochene Wort\">{{cite web |last1=Bergmann |first1=Christopher |title=Es gilt das gesprochene Wort: Schriftarten f\u00fcr IPA-Transkriptionen |url=https://www.isoglosse.de/2014/03/schriftarten-ipa-transkriptionen/ |website=Isoglosse |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref> For example, the [[American Psychological Association]] suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its [[APA style]].<ref name=\"APA Style Blog\">{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Chelsea |title=Fonts of Knowledge |url=https://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2013/03/fonts-of-knowledge.html |website=APA Style Blog |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |accessdate=14 November 2018}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n==Linotype releases==\n[[File:Many accented a (8277806822).jpg|thumb|Working drawings for a Linotype release of \"Times Roman\".

Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media.

It was commissioned by the British newspaper ''[[The Times]]'' in 1931 and conceived by [[Stanley Morison]], the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company [[Monotype Imaging|Monotype]], in collaboration with [[Victor Lardent]], a lettering artist in ''The Times's'' advertising department. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most [[desktop computer]]s.\n\nAsked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that ''The Times'' change their text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]] as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin's dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in ''The Times'' on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman's name, Roman is a reference to the regular or [[Roman type|roman]] style (sometimes also called [[Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute|Antiqua]]), the first part of the Times New Roman family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman's design has no connection to [[Rome]] or to the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\n''The Times'' stayed with Times New Roman for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from [[broadsheet]] to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] in 2004 have caused it to switch typeface five times from 1972 to 2007. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman typeface.\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Times New Roman and predecessor.jpg|thumb|right|Twenty-two lines in Times New Roman compared to its predecessor \"modern\" serif font.{{efn|\"Modern\" in typography is a generic term referring to designs in the [[Didone (typography)|modern or Didone]] style of the nineteenth century.}} Times appears larger on the page, with tighter linespacing and more solid in appearance.<ref name=\"Printing the Times 1932\">{{cite book |title=Printing the Times: A record of the changes introduced in the issue for October 3, 1932 |date=1932 |location=London}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Times ancestors.png|thumb|A digitisation of Times New Roman below the three typefaces originally considered as a basis for the ''Times'' project: [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]], [[Baskerville]] and [[Plantin (typeface)|Plantin]].

The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic v and w so that italic v could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nThe 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point [[Body (typography)|bodies]]. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a [[kern (typography)|kern]] which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of \"advertising figures\" (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n\nPreviously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, the typeface Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose.<ref>T. W. Chaundy, P. R. Barett, Charles Batey, ''The Printing of Mathematics'', Oxford University Press (1954, 1957)</ref> Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).<ref name=\"The Monotype 4-Line System for Setting Mathematics\" />\n{{clear}}\n\n==Usage==\n[[File:Colliers Times New Roman letter perfect.jpg|thumb|right|A 1943 brochure used by Crowell-Collier, one of the first major American users of Times New Roman, to promote the changeover.<ref name=\"Happiness is Times New Roman\" />]]\nTimes New Roman's popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing.

Linotype referred to the design as ''Times'' or ''Times Roman''. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but slight differences have split the lineage of Times into two subtly different designs.\n\nAlthough Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to [[cold type|photo]] and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted [[serif]]s on the capital S, while Monotype's are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5.<ref name=\"Strizver TypeTalk\">{{cite web|first=Ilene|last=Strizver|url=http://www.creativepro.com/blog/typetalk-times-roman-vs-times-new-roman|title=TypeTalk: Times Roman vs Times New Roman|work=CreativePro.com}}</ref> Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart.<ref name=\"times-development\" /> Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight, (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight){{sfn|Tracy|2003|p=204}} and in the percent sign in all weights. (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not.) Monotype's 'J' is non-descending, but Linotype's in the bold weight descends below the baseline.\n\nLinotype licensed its version to [[Xerox]] and then [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the [[PostScript]] page description language.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Some history about Arial|url=http://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2011/09/blue-pencil-no-18%E2%80%94some-history-about-arial/|website=Paul Shaw Letter Design|accessdate=22 May 2015}}</ref> Microsoft's version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name.

In the 1980s, there was an attempt by a group of entrepreneurs to seek from [[Rupert Murdoch]], who owned ''The Times'', the right to use the Times Roman name; separately, a legal action was also initiated to clarify the right of Monotype to use the name in the US despite Linotype's registration. As a result of legal action, Linotype and its licensees continued to use the name Times Roman, while Monotype and its licensees used the name Times New Roman.<ref name=\"times-development\">{{cite web |url= http://www.truetype-typography.com/articles/times.htm |title=Times (New) Roman and its part in the Development of Scalable Font Technology |author=Charles Bigelow |year=1994 |accessdate=4 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Modern releases==\n\n===As Times New Roman===\nMonotype sells a wider range of styles and [[Font#Optical size|optical sizes]] for Times New Roman than are offered with Windows, in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.<ref name=\"Changing the Times\" /> Its current release includes Regular, Medium, Semi Bold and Bold weights with matching italics, Extra Bold, Condensed (in regular, italic and bold), Seven (for smaller text, in regular, italic, bold and bold italic) and Small Text (for very small text, in regular, italic and bold).<ref>{{cite web|title=Monotype Library: Times New Roman|url=http://www.linotype.com/1540/TimesNewRoman-family.html|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref> The four-weight version included with Windows was also distributed as part of Microsoft's [[Core Fonts for the Web]] package.<ref name=\"apple-techspot\">{{cite web | url=http://www.techspot.com/news/26438-microsoft-and-apple-extend-font-licensing-agreement.html |title=Microsoft and Apple extend font licensing agreement |author=Jose Vilches |date=2007-08-03 |accessdate=2011-06-25}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2017, the version of Times New Roman included with [[Windows 10]], version 6.96, includes [[small capitals]], [[text figures]], and italic [[swash capitals]].<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\">{{cite AV media | people = | date =\n | title = Times New Roman, v. 6.96 | medium = Font digitisation }}</ref><ref name=\"FIU New Roman Times Swash capital comment\">{{cite web |last1=Thiago |last2=Hardwig |first2=Florian |title=New Roman Times \u2013 Camper Van Beethoven |url=https://fontsinuse.com/uses/25135/new-roman-times-camper-van-beethoven#comment-631475 |website=Fonts in Use |accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> The Microsoft/Monotype digitisation of Times New Roman omits automatic [[typographic ligature|ligature]] insertion (although as of v. 6.96 it is selectable),<ref name=\"TNR 6.96\" /> which the version of Times installed with macOS has.

office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway.

Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

F; Mitterrand cloture sa campagne \u00e0 Toulouse. (1965) - 53Fi3417.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in [[Toulouse]] on 17 December 1965 during the [[1965 French presidential election|1965 presidential election]] campaign]]\n\nIn the [[1962 French legislative election|1962 election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand regained his seat in the National Assembly with the support of the PCF and the SFIO. Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982.

As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

Tighter regulations on the powers of police to stop, search and arrest were introduced, and the \"loi s\u00e9curit\u00e9 et libert\u00e9\" (a controversial public order act) was repealed.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period.<ref>''The Death of Politics: France under Mitterrand'' by John Laughland {{page needed|date=May 2017}}</ref> Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment. Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Cultural policy====\nWith respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Hijab and the Republic: Uncovering the French Headscarf Debate|author=Winter, B.|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-5132-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint/page/113 113]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Mitterrand [[Liberalization|liberalized]] the media, created the [[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]] media regulation agency, and authorized [[pirate radios in France|pirate radio]] and the first private TV ([[Canal+]]), giving rise to the [[Media of France|private broadcasting]] sector.\n\nIn terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]]. On 16 February 1993, President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand inaugurated in [[Fr\u00e9jus]] a memorial to the [[Indochina War|wars in Indochina]].\n\nBut the second term was also marked by rivalries within the PS and the split of the ''Mitterrandist'' group (at the [[Rennes Congress]], where supporters of [[Laurent Fabius]] and [[Lionel Jospin]] clashed bitterly for control of the party), the scandals about the financing of the party, the [[Infected blood scandal (France)|contaminated blood scandal]] which implicated Laurent Fabius and former ministers Georgina Dufoix and Emond Herv\u00e9, and the Elys\u00e9e wiretaps affairs.\n\n====Second Cohabitation====\nDisappointed with Rocard's apparent failure to enact the Socialists' programme, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand dismissed Michel Rocard in 1991 and appointed [[\u00c9dith Cresson]] to replace him. She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]]. Socialist candidate [[Lionel Jospin]] lost the presidential election.\n\nOverall, as President, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand maintained the \"basic characteristic of a strong welfare base underpinned by a strong state.\" A United Nations Human Development report concluded that, from 1979 to 1989, France was the only country in the OECD (apart from Portugal) in which income inequalities did not get worse.<ref>''France since 1870: Culture, Politics, and Society'' by Charles Sowerine</ref> During his second term as president, however, the gap between rich and poor widened in France,<ref>''One Hundred Years of Socialism: The West European Left in the Twentieth Century'' by Donald Sassoon</ref> with both unemployment and poverty rising in the awake of the economic recession of 1991\u20131993.<ref>''The Mitterrand Years: Legacy and Evaluation'' edited by Mairi Maclean</ref> According to other studies, though, the percentage of the French population living in poverty (based on various criteria) fell between the mid-Eighties and the mid-Nineties.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bT-3laKFEUsC&pg=PA149&dq=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995#v=onepage&q=poverty%20in%20france%201981-1995&f=false|title=Statistical Handbook on the Social Safety Net|first=Fernando Francisco|last=Padr\u00f3|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|via=Google Books|isbn=9781573565165}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cajWAgAAQBAJ|title=Innovations in Labour Market Policies The Australian Way: The Australian Way|last=OECD|date=17 July 2001|publisher=OECD Publishing|via=Google Books|isbn=9789264194502}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\n{{Main|Foreign policy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand}}\n\n====East/West relations====\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand supported closer European collaboration and the preservation of France's special relationship with its former colonies, which he feared were falling under \"[[Anglosphere|Anglo-Saxon]] influence.\" His drive to preserve French power in Africa led to controversies concerning Paris' role during the [[Rwandan genocide]].<ref name=\"rwanda\">[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece Mitterrand's role revealed in Rwandan genocide warning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706182535/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2730430.ece |date=6 July 2008 }}, 3 July 2007.

When the [[European Court of Human Rights]] finally ruled against the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand doctrine, the policy had already led to most of the criminals never being punished for their crimes.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n====1990 speech at La Baule====\nResponding to a democratic movement in Africa after the 1989 fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he made his La Baule speech in June 1990 which tied [[development aid]] to democratic efforts from former French colonies, and during which he opposed the devaluation of the [[CFA Franc]]. Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, {{ill|Centre de recherches internationales|fr}} (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference. [[Omar Bongo]], President of Gabon, declared that he would rather have \"events counsel him;\" [[Abdou Diouf]], President of Senegal, said that, according to him, the best solution was a \"strong government\" and a \"good faith opposition;\" the President of Chad, [[Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9]] (nicknamed the \"African [[Augusto Pinochet|Pinochet]]\") claimed that it was contradictory to demand that African states should simultaneously carry on a \"democratic policy\" and \"social and economic policies which limited their sovereignty\", in a clear allusion to the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]]'s \"[[structural adjustment]] programs\". [[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte.

With French assistance, the Rwandan army grew from a force of 9,000 men in October 1990 to 28,000 in 1991.

to 1995, the longest time in office in the [[history of France]]. As First Secretary of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], he was the first [[Left-wing politics|left-wing politician]] to assume the presidency under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]].\n\nReflecting family influences, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand started political life on the Catholic nationalist right. He served under the [[Vichy Regime]] during its earlier years. Subsequently he joined the [[French Resistance|Resistance]], moved to the left, and held ministerial office several times under the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand opposed [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]]'s establishment of the Fifth Republic. Although at times a politically isolated figure, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand outmanoeuvered rivals to become the left's standard bearer at every presidential election from 1965\u201388; with the exception of 1969. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was elected President at the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]]. He was [[1988 French presidential election|re-elected in 1988]] and remained in office until 1995.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand invited the [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] into his first government, which was a controversial decision at the time. In the event, the Communists were boxed in as junior partners and, rather than taking advantage, saw their support erode. They left the cabinet in 1984. Early in his first term, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand followed a radical left-wing economic agenda, including nationalisation of key firms, but after two years, with the economy in crisis, he reversed course. He pushed a socially liberal agenda with reforms such as the abolition of the [[death penalty]], the 39-hour work week, and the end of a government monopoly in radio and television broadcasting. His foreign and defense policies built on those of his Gaullist predecessors. His partnership with [[German Chancellor]] [[Helmut Kohl]] advanced European integration via the [[Maastricht Treaty]], but he reluctantly accepted [[German reunification]]. During his time in office, he was a strong promoter of culture and implemented a range of costly \"[[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|Grands Projets]]\". He is the only French President to ever have named a female Prime Minister, [[\u00c9dith Cresson]], in 1991. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was twice forced by the loss of a parliamentary majority into \"[[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation governments]]\" with conservative cabinets led, respectively, by [[Jacques Chirac]] (1986\u20131988), and [[\u00c9douard Balladur]] (1993\u20131995). Less than eight months after leaving office, Mitterrand died from the [[prostate cancer]] he had successfully concealed for most of his presidency.\n\nBeyond making the French left electable, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand presided over the rise of the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] to dominance of the left, and the decline of the once-mighty [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] (as a share of the popular vote in the first presidential round, the Communists shrank from a peak of 21.27% in 1969 to 8.66% in 1995, at the end of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's second term).\n\n==Family==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was born in [[Jarnac]], [[Charente]], and [[baptism|baptized]] '''Fran\u00e7ois Maurice Adrien Marie Mitterrand''', the son of Joseph Mitterrand and Yvonne Lorrain. His family was devoutly Catholic<ref>Tiersky, Ronald. ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President''. 2003, Rowman and Littlefield. pp. 38\u201342.</ref> and conservative. His father worked as an engineer for the [[Chemin de Fer de Paris \u00e0 Orl\u00e9ans|Compagnie Paris Orl\u00e9ans]] railway. He had three brothers, Robert, Jacques, and Philippe, and four sisters, Antoinette, Marie-Jos\u00e8phe, Colette, and Genevi\u00e8ve.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's wife, [[Danielle Mitterrand]] (''n\u00e9e'' Gouze, 1924\u20132011), came from a socialist background and worked for various left-wing causes. They married on 24 October 1944 and had three sons: Pascal (10 June \u2013 17 September 1945), [[Jean-Christophe Mitterrand|Jean-Christophe]], born in 1946, and Gilbert, born on 4 February 1949. He also had two children as results of extra-marital affairs: an acknowledged daughter, [[Mazarine Pingeot|Mazarine]] (born 1974), with his mistress [[Anne Pingeot]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/francois-mitterrands-love-letters-to-secret-mistress-to-be-published |title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's love letters to secret mistress to be published|first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis|date=5 October 2016|work=The Guardian}}</ref> and an unacknowledged son, [[Hravn Forsne]] (born 1988), with Swedish journalist [[Christina Forsne]].<ref>{{cite news|title='Okay, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was my dad,' Swedish politician reveals|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|accessdate=10 August 2014|publisher=France 24|date=9 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810011156/http://www.france24.com/en/20140809-swedish-politician--french-president-mitterrand-son-illegitimate/|archive-date=10 August 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's nephew [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand]] is a journalist, Minister of Culture and Communications under [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] (and a supporter of [[Jacques Chirac]], former French President), and his wife's brother-in-law [[Roger Hanin]] was a well-known French actor.\n\n==Early life==\n{{Further|France in the twentieth century|French Third Republic|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and the far right}}\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand studied from 1925 to 1934 in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Paul in [[Angoul\u00eame]], where he became a member of the [[Jeunesse Etudiante Chr\u00e9tienne]] (JEC), the student organisation of ''[[Catholic Action|Action catholique]]''. Arriving in Paris in autumn 1934, he then went to the [[\u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques]] until 1937, where he obtained his diploma in July of that year. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took membership for about a year in the ''Volontaires nationaux'' (National Volunteers), an organisation related to [[Fran\u00e7ois de la Rocque]]'s far-right league, the ''[[Croix de Feu]]''; the league had just participated in the [[6 February 1934 riots]] which led to the fall of the second ''[[Cartel des Gauches]]'' (Left-Wing Coalition).<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\">[[Pierre P\u00e9an]], ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'' (biography on Mitterrand), p.23\u201335</ref>\n\nContrary to some reports, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand never became a formal member of the ''[[Parti Social Fran\u00e7ais]]'' (PSF) which was the successor to the Croix de Feu and may be considered the first French right-wing mass party.<ref name=\"P\u00e9an\" /> However, he did write news articles in the ''[[L'Echo de Paris]]'' newspaper, which was close to the PSF. He participated in the demonstrations against the \"''[[m\u00e9t\u00e8que]] invasion''\" in February 1935 and then in those against law teacher [[Gaston J\u00e8ze]], who had been nominated as juridical counsellor of [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Negus]], in January 1936.\n\nWhen Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's involvement in these conservative nationalist movements was revealed in the 1990s, he attributed his actions to the milieu of his youth. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand furthermore had some personal and family relations with members of the [[La Cagoule|Cagoule]], a far-right terrorist group in the 1930s.<ref>[[Henry Rousso]], ''Le Syndrome de Vichy'', p.365</ref>\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand then served his [[Conscription in France|conscription]] from 1937 to 1939 in the 23rd r\u00e9giment d'infanterie coloniale. In 1938, he became the best friend of [[Georges Dayan]], a Jewish socialist, whom he saved from anti-Semitic aggressions by the national-royalist movement ''[[Action fran\u00e7aise]]''.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb, pp. 46/48</ref> His friendship with Dayan caused Mitterrand to begin to question some of his nationalist ideas. Finishing his law studies, he was sent in September 1939 to the [[Maginot line]] near [[Montm\u00e9dy]], with the rank of Sergeant-chief (infantry sergeant). He became engaged to Marie-Louise Terrasse (future actress and television presenter [[Catherine Langeais]]) in May 1940, when she was 16, but she broke it off in January 1942. Following an observation of Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became an [[agnostic]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiHLZQ6XtzEC|title=Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand: A Very French President|first=Ronald|last=Tiersky |date=1 January 2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|via=Google Books|isbn=9780742524736}}</ref>\n\n==Second World War==\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's actions during [[World War II]] were the cause of much controversy in France during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\n===Prisoner of War: 1940\u20131941===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was at the end of his national service when the war broke out.

During this period, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was aware of Thierrens's activities and may have helped in his [[disinformation]] campaign{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}.

In April, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Fric caused a major disturbance in a public meeting held by the collaborator [[Georges Claude]]. From mid-1942, he sent false papers to POWs in Germany{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and on 12 June and 15 August 1942, he joined meetings at the Ch\u00e2teau de Montmaur which formed the base of his future network for the resistance.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', op. cit., pp. 75/79 et Franz-Olivier Giesbert, ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, une vie'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, \u00ab Points \u00bb, 1996, pp. 77/79</ref> From September, he made contact with [[Free France|Free French Forces]], but clashed with {{ill|Michel Cailliau|fr}}, General [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s nephew (and de Gaulle's candidate to head-up all POW-related resistance organizations).<ref>Pierre P\u00e9an, ''Une jeunesse fran\u00e7aise'', op. cit., pp. 217/218 et Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', op. cit., p. 81</ref> On 15 October 1942, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Marcel Barrois (a member of the resistance deported in 1944) met Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] along with other members of the ''Comit\u00e9 d'entraide aux prisonniers rapatri\u00e9s de l'Allier'' (Help group for repatriated POWs in the department of Allier).<ref>a photograph taken at this meeting is on the cover of Pierre P\u00e9an's book.

B\u00e9nouville was a member of the resistance groups ''[[Combat (French Resistance)|Combat]]'' and ''[[Noyautage des administrations publiques]]'' (NAP).\n\nIn late 1942, the non-occupied zone was invaded by the Germans. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand left the Commissariat in January 1943, when his boss {{ill|Maurice Pinot|fr}}, another vichysto-r\u00e9sistant, was replaced by the collaborator Andr\u00e9 Masson, but he remained in charge of the ''centres d'entraides''. In the spring of 1943, along with [[Gabriel Jeantet]], a member of Marshal P\u00e9tain's cabinet, and [[Simon Arbellot]] (both former members of La Cagoule), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received the [[Order of the Francisque]] (the honorific distinction of the Vichy Regime).\n\nDebate rages in France as to the significance of this.

The meeting was about allowing French POWs to go home if they were [[Service du travail obligatoire|replaced by young French men forced to go and work in Germany]] (in French this was called \"''la rel\u00e8ve''\"). When Andr\u00e9 Masson began to talk about \"''la trahison des gaullistes''\" (the Gaullist treason), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand stood up in the audience and shouted him down, saying Masson had no right to talk on behalf of POWs and calling ''la rel\u00e8ve'' a \"''con''\" (i.e., something stupid). Mitterrand avoided arrest as Piatzook covered his escape.<ref>On 12 July 1944 [[Maurice Schumann]] (la voice of the Free French) recounted this event on BBC radio.</ref>\n\nIn November 1943 the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) raided a flat in [[Vichy]], where they hoped to arrest Fran\u00e7ois Morland, a member of the resistance.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', op. cit., pp. 97 et 99</ref> \"Morland\" was Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's cover name. He also used Purgon, Monnier, Laroche, Captain Fran\u00e7ois, Arnaud et Albre as cover names. The man they arrested was [[Pol Pilven]], a member of the resistance who was to survive the war in a concentration camp. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was in Paris at the time.\n\nWarned by his friends, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand escaped to London aboard a [[Westland Lysander|Lysander]] plane on 15 November 1943 (piloted by then-[[Squadron Leader]] [[Lewis Hodges]]). He promoted his movement to the British and American Authorities, but he was sent to [[Algiers]], where he met de Gaulle, by then the uncontested leader of the Free French. The two men clashed, de Gaulle refused to jeopardize the Resistance by including a movement that gathered information from POWs.<ref name=\"Franz-Olivier Giesbert 1996, p. 100\">Franz-Olivier Giesbert, ''Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, une vie'', \u00e9d. du Seuil, 1996, p. 100</ref><ref>Charles de Gaulle, ''M\u00e9moires de guerre \u2013 L'Unit\u00e9 : 1942-1944'' (tome II)</ref> Later Mitterrand refused to merge his group with other POW movements if de Gaulle's nephew Cailliau was to be the leader.<ref name=\"Franz-Olivier Giesbert 1996, p. 100\"/> Under the influence of Henri Frenay, de Gaulle finally agreed to merge his nephew's network and the RNPG with Mitterrand in charge.<ref>Pierre P\u00e9an book pp. 364/365</ref> Thus the RNPG was listed in the French Force organization from spring 1944.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand returned to France by boat via England. In Paris, the three Resistance groups made up of POWs (Communists, Gaullists, RNPG) finally merged as the POWs and Deportees National Movement (''{{ill|Mouvement national des prisonniers de guerre et d\u00e9port\u00e9s|fr}}'', MNPGD) and Mitterrand took the lead. In his memoirs, he says that he had started this organisation while he was still officially working for the Vichy Regime. From 27 November 1943 Mitterrand worked for the [[Bureau central de renseignements et d'action]].<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', tome 1, p. 102</ref> In December 1943 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ordered the execution of Henri Marlin (who was about to order attacks on the \"[[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]\") by Jacques Paris and Jean Munier, who later hid out with Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's father.\n\nAfter a second visit to London in February 1944, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took part in the liberation of Paris in August; he took over the headquarters of Commissariat g\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux prisonniers de guerre (general office for POW, the ministry he was working for), immediately he took up the vacant post of secretary general of POWs. When de Gaulle entered Paris following the [[Liberation of Paris|Liberation]], he was introduced to various men who were to be part of the provisional government. Among them was Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, when they came face to face, de Gaulle is said to have muttered: \"You again!\" He dismissed Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 2 weeks later.\n\nIn October 1944 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and [[Jacques Foccart]] developed a plan to liberate the POW and concentration camps. This was called operation ''Vicarage''. On the orders of de Gaulle, in April 1945 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand accompanied General Lewis as the French representative at the liberation of the camps at [[Kaufering concentration camp|Kaufering]] and [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]]. By chance Mitterrand discovered his friend and member of his network, [[Robert Antelme]], suffering from [[typhus]]. Antelme was restricted to the camp to prevent the spread of disease, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand arranged for his \"escape\" and sent him back to France for treatment.<ref>Jean Lacouture, ''Mitterrand, une histoire de Fran\u00e7ais'', \u00e9d.

At the [[June 1946 French legislative election|June 1946 legislative election]], he led the list of the [[Rally of the Republican Lefts]] (''Rassemblement des gauches r\u00e9publicaines'', RGR) in the Western suburb of Paris, but he was not elected. The RGR was an electoral entity composed of the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical Party]], the centrist [[Democratic and Socialist Union of the Resistance]] (''Union d\u00e9mocratique et socialiste de la R\u00e9sistance'', UDSR) and several conservative groupings. It opposed the policy of the \"[[Three-parties]] alliance\" (Communists, Socialists and Christian Democrats).\n\nIn the [[November 1946 French legislative election|November 1946 legislative election]], he succeeded in winning a seat as deputy from the [[Ni\u00e8vre]] ''d\u00e9partement''. To be elected, he had to win a seat at the expense of the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF). As leader of the RGR list, he led a very [[anti-communist]] campaign. He became a member of the UDSR party. In January 1947, he joined the cabinet as War Veterans Minister. He held various offices in the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] as a Deputy and as a Minister (holding eleven different portfolios in total), including as a [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] of [[Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon (Ville)|Ch\u00e2teau-Chinon]] from 1959 to 1981.\n\nIn May 1948 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand participated in the [[Congress of The Hague]], together with [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], [[Albert Copp\u00e9]] and [[Altiero Spinelli]]. It originated the European Movement.\n\nAs Overseas Minister (1950\u20131951), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand opposed the colonial lobby to propose a reform program. He connected with the left when he resigned from the cabinet after the arrest of [[Morocco]]'s sultan (1953). As leader of the progressive wing of the UDSR, he took the head of the party in 1953, replacing the conservative [[Ren\u00e9 Pleven]].\n\nIn June 1953 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand attended the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Seated next to the elderly [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]], he reported having spent much of the ceremony being psychoanalyzed by her.\n\n===Senior minister during the Algerian War: 1954\u201358===\n\nAs [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Interior Minister]] in [[Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France]]'s cabinet (1954\u20131955), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had to direct the response to the [[Algerian War of Independence]]. He claimed: \"[[French Algeria|Algeria is France]].\" He was suspected of being the [[informant|informer]] of the Communist Party in the cabinet. This rumour was spread by the former Paris police prefect, who had been dismissed by him. The suspicions were dismissed by subsequent investigations.\n\nThe UDSR joined the [[Republican Front (France)|Republican Front]], a centre-left coalition, which won the [[1956 French legislative election|1956 legislative election]]. As [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Justice Minister]] (1956\u20131957), Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand allowed the expansion of martial law in the Algerian conflict. Unlike other ministers (including Mend\u00e8s-France), who criticised the repressive policy in Algeria, he remained in [[Guy Mollet]]'s cabinet until its end. As Minister of Justice, he had a role in 45 executions of the Algerian natives, recommending President [[Rene Coty]] to reject clemency in 80% of the cases, an action he later came to regret.<ref name=\"lepoint\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/les-guillotines-de-mitterrand-31-08-2001-56908_20.php|title=Les guillotin\u00e9s de Mitterrand \u2013 Le Point|publisher=lepoint.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|date=2001-08-31}}</ref> Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's role in confirming the death sentences of FLN rebels convicted by French courts of terrorism and later in abolishing the death penalty in 1981 led the British writer Anthony Daniels (writing under his pseudonym of [[Theodore Dalrymple]]) to accuse Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand of being an unprincipled opportunist, a cynical politician who proudly confirmed death sentences of FLN terrorists in the 1950s when it was popular and who only came to champion abolishing the death penalty when was popular with the French people.<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =  Dalrmymple\n  | first = Theodore\n  | title= The Battle of Algiers\n  | magazine = The New English Review\n  | date=March 2015| url = http://www.newenglishreview.org/Theodore_Dalrymple/A_Battle_of_Algiers/\n  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}</ref>\n\nAs Minister of Justice he was an official representative of France during the wedding of [[Rainier III]], [[Prince of Monaco]], and actress [[Grace Kelly]].

He appeared as a possible future Prime Minister.\n\n==Opposition during the Fifth Republic==\n{{Further|French Fifth Republic}}\n\n===Crossing the desert: 1958\u201364===\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1959.JPG|left|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in 1959]]\nIn 1958, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was one of the few to object to the nomination of [[Charles de Gaulle]] as head of government, and to de Gaulle's plan for a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]. He justified his opposition by the circumstances of de Gaulle's comeback: the [[May 1958 crisis|13 May 1958 quasi-putsch]] and military pressure. In September 1958, determinedly opposed to Charles de Gaulle, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand made an appeal to vote \"no\" in the [[1958 French constitutional referendum|referendum over the Constitution]], which was nevertheless adopted on 4 October 1958. This defeated coalition of the \"No\" was composed of the PCF and some left-wing republican politicians (such as Pierre Mend\u00e8s-France and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\nThis attitude may have been a factor in Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's losing his seat in the [[1958 French legislative election|1958 elections]], beginning a long \"crossing of the desert\" (this term is usually applied to de Gaulle's decline in influence for a similar period). Indeed, in the second round of the legislative election, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported by the Communists but the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) refused to withdraw its candidate. This division caused the election of the [[Gaullist Party|Gaullist]] candidate. One year later, he was [[1959 French Senate election|elected]] to represent [[Ni\u00e8vre]] in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he was part of the [[Democratic Left (France)|Group of the Democratic Left]]. At the same time, he was not admitted to the ranks of the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste unifi\u00e9'', PSU) which was created by Mend\u00e8s-France, former internal opponents of Mollet and reform-minded former members of the Communist Party. The PSU leaders justified their decision by referring to his non-resignation from Mollet's cabinet and by his past in Vichy.\n\n[[File:Portret van Francois Mitterrand, Bestanddeelnr 910-7485.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 16 October 1959]]\nAlso in that same year, on the Avenue de l'Observatoire in Paris, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand claimed to have escaped an assassin's bullet by diving behind a hedge, in what became known as the ''Observatory Affair''.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE4D9173BF93BA15755C0A961948260 | work=The New York Times | title=The Mitterrand Mystery | first1=Robert O. | last1=Paxton | date=28 June 1987 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}{{sic}}</ref> The incident brought him a great deal of publicity, initially boosting his political ambitions. Some of his critics claimed, however, that he had staged the incident himself, resulting in a backlash against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. He later said he had earlier been warned by right-wing deputy [[Robert Pesquet]] that he was the target of an ''[[Alg\u00e9rie fran\u00e7aise]]'' death squad and accused Prime Minister [[Michel Debr\u00e9]] of being its instigator. Before his death, Pesquet claimed that Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand had set up a fake attempt on his life. Prosecution was initiated against Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand but was later dropped. Nonetheless, the Observatory Affair cast a lasting shadow over Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's reputation. Years later in 1965, when Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand emerged as the challenger to de Gaulle in the second round of the presidential elections, de Gaulle was urged by an aide to use the Observatory Affair to discredit his opponent. \"No, and don't insist\" was the General's response, \"It would be wrong to demean the office of the Presidency, since one day he [Mitterrand] may have the job.\"<ref>Tiersky, Ronald.

Practicing left unity in Ni\u00e8vre, he advocated the rallying of left-wing forces at the national level, including the PCF, in order to challenge Gaullist domination. Two years later, he became the president (chairman) of the General Council of Ni\u00e8vre. While the opposition to De Gaulle organized in clubs, he founded his own group, the [[Convention of Republican Institutions]] (''Convention des institutions r\u00e9publicaines'', CIR). He reinforced his position as a left-wing opponent to [[Charles de Gaulle]] in publishing ''Le Coup d'\u00c9tat permanent'' (The permanent coup, 1964), which criticized de Gaulle's personal power, the weaknesses of Parliament and of the government, the President's exclusive control of foreign affairs, and defence, etc.\n\nIn 1965, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was the first left-wing politician who saw the [[1965 French presidential election|presidential election]] by universal suffrage as a way to defeat the opposition leadership. Not a member of any specific political party, his candidacy for presidency was accepted by all left-wing parties (the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO), [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (PR) and [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Unified Socialist Party]] (PSU)). He ended the ''[[cordon sanitaire]]'' of the PCF which the party had been subject to since 1947. For the SFIO leader [[Guy Mollet]], Mitterrand's candidacy prevented [[Gaston Defferre]], his rival in the SFIO, from running for the presidency. Furthermore, Fran\u00e7ois Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was a lone figure, so he did not appear as a danger to the left-wing parties' staff members.\n\nDe Gaulle was expected to win in the first round, but Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 31.7% of the vote, denying De Gaulle a first-round victory. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was supported in the second round by the left and other anti-Gaullists:  centrist [[Jean Monnet]], moderate conservative [[Paul Reynaud]] and [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], an extreme right-winger and the lawyer who had defended [[Raoul Salan]], one of the four generals who had organized the 1961 [[Algiers putsch]] during the [[Algerian War]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 44.8% of votes in the second round and de Gaulle, with the majority, was thus elected for another term, but this defeat was regarded as honourable, for no one was really expected to defeat de Gaulle. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand took the lead of a centre-left alliance: the [[Federation of the Democratic and Socialist Left]] (''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de la gauche d\u00e9mocrate et socialiste'', FGDS). It was composed of the SFIO, the Radicals and several left-wing republican clubs (such the CIR of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand).\n\n[[File:Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1968.jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand on 29 May 1968]]\nIn the [[1967 French legislative election|legislative election of March 1967]], the system where all candidates who failed to pass a 10% threshold in the first round were eliminated from the second round favoured the pro-Gaullist majority, which faced a split opposition (PCF, FGDS and centrists of [[Jacques Duhamel]]). Nevertheless, the parties of the left managed to gain 63 seats more than previously for a total of 194. The Communists remained the largest left-wing group with 22.5% of votes. The governing coalition won with its majority reduced by only one seat (247 seats out of 487).\n\nIn Paris, the Left (FGDS, PSU, PCF) managed to win more votes in the first round than the two governing parties (46% against 42.6%) while the [[Democratic Centre (France)|Democratic Centre]] of Duhamel got 7% of votes. But with 38% of votes, de Gaulle's [[Union des D\u00e9mocrates pour la R\u00e9publique|Union for the Fifth Republic]] remained the leading French party.<ref>[[Ren\u00e9 R\u00e9mond]], ''Notre si\u00e8cle'', 1988, Fayard, p.664 ff.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[May 1968 events in France|May 1968]] governmental crisis, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand held a press conference to announce his candidacy if a new presidential election was held. But after the Gaullist demonstration on the [[Champs-Elys\u00e9es]], de Gaulle dissolved the Assembly and called for a legislative election instead. In [[1968 French legislative election|this election]], the right wing won its largest majority since the ''[[National Bloc (France)|Bloc National]]'' [[1919 French legislative election|in 1919]].\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was accused of being responsible for this huge legislative defeat and the FGDS split. In 1969, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand could not run for the Presidency: [[Guy Mollet]] refused to give him the support of the SFIO. The left wing was eliminated in the first round, with the Socialist candidate Gaston Defferre winning a humiliating 5.1 percent of the total vote. [[Georges Pompidou]] faced the centrist [[Alain Poher]] in the [[1969 French presidential election|second round]].\n\n===Socialist Party leader: 1971\u201381===\nAfter the FGDS's implosion, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand turned to the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] (''Parti socialiste'' or PS). In June 1971, at the time of the [[Epinay Congress]], the CIR joined the PS, which had succeeded the SFIO in 1969. The executive of the PS was then dominated by [[Guy Mollet]]'s supporters. They proposed an \"ideological dialogue\" with the Communists. For Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, an electoral alliance with the Communists was necessary to rise to power. With this in mind, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand obtained the support of all the internal opponents to Mollet's faction and was elected as the first secretary of the PS. At the 1971 congress, he declared: \"Whoever does not accept the break with the established order, with capitalist society, cannot be an adherent of the Socialist Party.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x4t3wo_congres-d-epinay-1971-francois-mitt_news|title=Congr\u00e8s d'Epinay (1971)|last=|first=|date=2008-03-22|website=Dailymotion|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22|quote=Celui qui n\u2019accepte pas la rupture avec l\u2019ordre \u00e9tabli, avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 capitaliste, celui l\u00e0, il ne peut pas \u00eatre adh\u00e8rent du Parti Socialiste.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/francois-mitterrand-socialist-party-common-program-communist-pcf-1981-elections-austerity/|title=The Many Lives of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand|last=Birch|first=Jonah|date=19 August 2015|website=[[Jacobin]]|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1972, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand signed the [[Programme commun|Common Programme of Government]] with the Communist [[Georges Marchais]] and the [[Left Radical Party|Left Radical]] [[Robert Fabre]]. With this programme, he led the [[1973 French legislative election|1973 legislative campaign]] of the \"Union of the Left\".\n\n[[File:Strasbourg-1979-05-06 (3758237073).jpg|thumb|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in Strasbourg on 5 May 1979]]\nAt the [[1974 French presidential election|1974 presidential election]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand received 43.2% of the vote in the first round, as the common candidate of the left. He faced [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] in the second round. During the national TV debate, Giscard d'Estaing criticised him as being \"a man of the past\", due to his long political career. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was narrowly defeated by Giscard d'Estaing, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand receiving 49.19% and Giscard 50.81%.\n\nIn 1977, the Communist and Socialist parties failed to update the ''Common Programme'', then lost the [[1978 French legislative election|1978 legislative election]]. While the Socialists took the leading position on the left, by obtaining more votes than the Communists for the first time [[1936 French legislative election|since 1936]], the leadership of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was challenged by an internal opposition led by [[Michel Rocard]] who criticized the programme of the PS as being \"archaic\" and \"unrealistic\". The polls indicated Rocard was more popular than Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand. Nevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand won the vote at the Party's [[Metz Congress]] (1979) and Rocard renounced his candidacy for the [[1981 French presidential election|1981 presidential election]].\n\nFor his third candidacy for presidency, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was not supported by the PCF but only by the PS. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand projected a reassuring image with the slogan \"the quiet force\". He campaigned for \"another politics\", based on the Socialist programme ''[[110 Propositions for France]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1981/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1981 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> and denounced the performance of the incumbent president. Furthermore, he benefited from divisions in the right-wing majority. He obtained 25.85% of votes in the first round (against 15% for the PCF candidate [[Georges Marchais]]), then defeated President Giscard d'Estaing in the second round, with 51.76%. He became the first left-wing politician elected [[President of France]] by universal suffrage.\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===First term: 1981\u20131988===\n[[File:Ronald Reagan Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand with U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], 1984]]\nIn the [[1981 French presidential election|presidential election of 10 May 1981]], Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand became the first socialist President of the Fifth Republic, and his government became the first left-wing government in 23 years. He named [[Pierre Mauroy]] as Prime Minister and organised a new [[1981 French legislative election|legislative election]]. The Socialists obtained an absolute parliamentary majority, and four Communists joined the cabinet.\n\n====Economic policy====\nThe beginning of his first term was marked by a left-wing [[economic policy]] based on the [[110 Propositions for France]] and the 1972 Common Programme between the Socialist Party, the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]] and the [[Left Radical Party]]. This included several nationalizations, a 10% increase in the ''[[salaire minimum interprofessionnel de croissance|SMIC]]'' (minimum wage), a 39-hour work week, 5 weeks holiday per year, the creation of the [[solidarity tax on wealth]], an increase in social benefits, and the extension of workers' rights to consultation and information about their employers (through the [[Jean Auroux|Auroux Act]]). The objective was to boost economic demand and thus economic activity ([[Keynesianism]]), but the stimulative fiscal policy implemented by the Mauroy government was in contradiction with the constrained [[monetary policy]] implemented by the [[Bank of France]].<ref>Reichart, Alexandre (2015). \"[http://www.jeeh.it/articolo?urn=urn:abi:abi:RIV.JOU:2015;1.11 French Monetary Policy (1981\u20131985), A Constrained Policy, between Volcker Shock, the EMS and Macroeconomic Imbalances]\".

Housing allocations for the low-paid were raised by 25% in 1981, and in the two years following May 1981 family allowances were increased by 44% for families with 3 children and by 81% for families with 2 children. In 1981, the purchasing power of social transfers went up by 4.5% and by 7.6% in 1982. In addition, the minimum wage (which affected 1.7&nbsp;million employees) was increased by 15% in real terms between May 1981 and December 1982.<ref>''Socialism, the State and Public Policy'' in France edited by Philip G. Cerny and Martin A.

As a means of increasing political participation, the government increased the financial allowances of local politicians, who also became entitled to paid leave from their jobs to attend courses in public administration. Allowances for the handicapped were improved, while improvements were also made in the pay and conditions for those serving in the army. A decree of January 1982 provided for \"solidarity contracts\" whereby firms would be subsidised for introducing part-time work or early retirement if they also allowed the creation of new jobs, while a decree of March 1982 provided employees with the right to retire at the age of 60 on 50% of average earnings during their 10 best years of employment. In 1983, legislation was passed to encourage greater equality in the private sector. Firms now had to make an annual report on the training opportunities and employment conditions for women and present a statistical analysis of their position in the firm, whilst the works committee had to ensure that equality promoting measures are taken.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''Mitterrand's France'' Edited by Sonia Mazey and Michael Newman</ref> In addition, a new benefit was introduced for unemployed workers who had exhausted their eligibility for unemployment insurance.<ref name=\"Vail2009\">{{cite book |title=Recasting Welfare Capitalism Economic Adjustment in Contemporary France and Germany |first=Mark I. |last=Vail |year=2009 |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-59213-967-5}}</ref> In December 1982, a law was passed that restored to workers the right to elect administrators to social security funds, which had been eliminated by Charles De Gaulle in 1967.<ref>''Contemporary France: Politics and Society Since 1945'' by D.

Priority was given to the struggle against inflation in order to remain competitive in the [[European Monetary System]]. Although there were two periods of mild economic reflation (first from 1984 to 1986 and again from 1988 to 1990), monetary and fiscal restraint was the essential policy orientation of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's presidency from 1983 onwards.<ref name=\"Smith1998\">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=W.

The government agreed at the same time to improve the pension position of some public sector employees and to increase the real value of the minimum pension. In addition, later negotiations brought retirement at 60 years into the occupational schemes although the financial terms for doing so could only be agreed for a 7-year period. A comparison between 1981 and 1986 showed that the minimum state pension had increased by 64% for a couple and by 81% for one person. During that same period, family allowances had increased by 71% for three children and by 112% for two children. In addition, the single-parent allowance for mothers or fathers with one child had been increased by 103% and for two or more children by 52% for each child\n\nIn order to mark the importance of the problems of the elderly, the government appointed a Secretary of State (attached to the Ministry of Social Affairs and National Solidarity) to carry special responsibility for them, and in an effort to try to relate policy to the felt needs of the elderly, it set up a central advisory committee to examine social policy from their point of view and carry out special studies and enquiries. This body became especially concerned with monitoring the attempts at coordination and encouraging policies which were aimed at helping he elderly stay at home instead of entering residential care.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn the field of health care, some prescription charges were abolished, hospital administration was decentralised, workers\u2019 rights in the health service were reaffirmed, and equipment was provided for researchers.<ref>''The French Socialist Party: Resurgence and Victory'' by D. S. Bell and Byron Criddle</ref> From 1983 onwards, wage-earners who had contributed to a pension fund for 37.5 years became eligible to retire on a full pension. This right was extended to the self-employed in 1984 and to farmers in 1986. People who had retired at the age of 60 were, however, not initially eligible for reductions on public transport until they reached the age of 65. The qualifying age for these reductions was, however, reduced to 62 in 1985.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">France during the socialist years by Gino Raymond</ref> A number of illegal immigrants had their position regularized under the Socialists and the conditions pertaining to residence and work permits were eased. Educational programmes were implemented to help immigrant communities, while immigrants were allowed the right to free association. The Socialist government also opened up talks with the authorities in some of the main countries of origin, easing nationality rules in the public sector, associating representatives of migrant groups with public authority work, and established an Immigrants Council in 1984.\n\nAlthough the income limit for allowances varied according to the position of the child in the family and the number of dependent children, these ceilings were made more favourable in cases where both parents were working or where a single parent was in charge and were linked to changes in wage levels. Those taking parental leave to care for three or more children (provided that they fulfilled the rules for eligibility) also received certain benefits in kind, such as a non-taxable, non-means-tested benefit and priority on vocational training courses. A new boost was also given to research into family problems including an interest in the effects of changing family structures, of women\u2019s employment and the impact of local social policies on family life.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> In addition, while a law on equal opportunities in employment was passed in July 1983 which prohibited all forms of unequal treatment regardless of the circumstances, together with providing for positive action plans to be established in major companies.

By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families to get back into employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with extra-marital births and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other\u2019s debts.\n\nChildcare facilities were also expanded, with the number of places in cr\u00e8ches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased.

Between 1981 and 1986, there had been just over 800,000 young people placed on special work schemes, 800,000 early retirements, 200,000 enterprise allowance successes, and 30,000 retrained workers from declining industrial sectors.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Cultural policy====\nWith respect to cultural policies, grants were allocated to non-profit associations and community cultural initiatives,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Hijab and the Republic: Uncovering the French Headscarf Debate|author=Winter, B.|date=2008|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-5132-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/hijabrepublicunc0000wint/page/113 113]|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Mitterrand [[Liberalization|liberalized]] the media, created the [[Conseil sup\u00e9rieur de l'audiovisuel|CSA]] media regulation agency, and authorized [[pirate radios in France|pirate radio]] and the first private TV ([[Canal+]]), giving rise to the [[Media of France|private broadcasting]] sector.\n\nIn terms of the theatre, some transfer of resources was made from the subsidy of the national theatres to the support for theatre companies which did not necessarily have an institutional home. A significant investment was made in music education with the creation of 5 new music schools in the departements and the revamping of the Conservatoire National de la Musique at Lyon, while the range and capacity of performance facilities in Paris was considerably increased, with the Cite Musicale de la Villette and the Opera de la Bastille allowing for specialist performance in a way that was lacking in Paris previously, and a 2,000 seat concert hall called le Zenith, which was designed primarily for rock music concerts but adapted for all uses.\n\nThe Socialists continued the policies of their predecessors with the Grand Louvre project and the opening of the Picasso Museum at the Hotel Sale, while the museum budget was quadrupled and particular sums were set aside for the first time for large regional projects including the establishment of a number of new museums in the provinces such as the Ecomuseum at Chartres and the Museum of Prehistory at Carnac. A fonds regional des Acquisitions was established to assist provincial museums in the purchase of works of art, while the state actively continued an existing policy of encouraging bequests in lieu of death duties.\n\nLibraries and publishing benefited from new thinking and an injection of funds, while aid to authors and publishers was restructured and book prices were fixed once again, with the objective being to assist smaller publishing houses and specialist bookshops. The network of regional lending libraries was significantly reinforced, while financial assistance was provided for the export of French books. In addition, archaeology, ethnography and historical buildings and monuments all benefited from the general increase in resources.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n====Domestic difficulties====\nThe Left lost the 1983 municipal elections and the 1984 European Parliament election. At the same time, the [[Alain Savary|Savary Bill]], to limit the financing of private schools by local communities, caused a political crisis. It was abandoned and Mauroy resigned in July 1984. [[Laurent Fabius]] succeeded him, and the Communists left the cabinet.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand did not significantly deviate from his predecessors and he continued nuclear weapons testing in the South Pacific in spite of protests from various peace and environmentalist organizations. In 1985, French agents sank the [[Greenpeace]]-owned ex-[[Fishing trawler|trawler]] [[Rainbow Warrior (1955)|''Rainbow Warrior'']] while it was docked in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]] which the group had used in demonstrations against nuclear tests, [[whaling]], and [[seal hunting]]. One Greenpeace member was killed, and when news broke of the event, a major scandal erupted that led to the resignation of Defense Minister [[Charles Hernu]]. France subsequently paid reparations of 1.8&nbsp;million USD to Greenpeace.\n\n====First Cohabitation====\nBefore the [[1986 French legislative election|1986 legislative campaign]], [[proportional representation]] was instituted in accordance with the 110 Propositions. It did not prevent, however, the victory of the [[Rally for the Republic]]/[[Union for French Democracy]] (RPR/UDF) coalition. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus named the RPR leader [[Jacques Chirac]] as Prime Minister. This period of government, with a President and a Prime Minister who came from two opposite coalitions, was the first time that such a combination had occurred under the Fifth Republic, and came to be known as \"[[Cohabitation (government)|Cohabitation]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |title=Socialist Party |publisher=Spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |date=1914-07-31 |accessdate=11 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130303143326/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FRsocialist.htm |archivedate=3 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nChirac mostly handled domestic policy while Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand concentrated on his \"reserved domain\" of foreign affairs and defence. However, several conflicts erupted between the two. In one example, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand refused to sign executive decrees of liberalization, obliging Chirac to pass the measures through parliament instead. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also reportedly gave covert support to some social movements, notably the student revolt against the university reform ([[Alain Devaquet|Devaquet Bill]]).{{citation needed|date=July 2007}} Benefiting from the difficulties of Chirac's cabinet, the President's popularity increased.\n\nWith the polls running in his favor, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand announced his candidacy in the [[1988 French presidential election|1988 presidential election]]. He proposed a moderate programme (promising \"neither nationalisations nor liberalisation\") and advocated a \"united France,\" and laid out his policy priorities in his \"Letter to the French People.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miroirs.ironie.org/socialisme/www.psinfo.net/elections/president/1988/index.html |title=\u00c9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 1988 |publisher=Miroirs.ironie.org |date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> He obtained 34% of the votes in the first round, then faced Chirac in the second, and was re-elected with 54% of the votes.

Four centre-right politicians joined the cabinet.\n\nThe second term was marked by the creation of the [[Revenu minimum d'insertion|Insertion Minimum Revenue]] (RMI), which ensured a minimum level of income to those deprived of any other form of income; the restoring of the solidarity tax on wealth, which had been abolished by Chirac's cabinet; the institution of the [[Generalized social tax]]; the extension of parental leave up to the child's third birthday;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]]; the 1990 [[Gayssot Act]] on [[hate speech]] and [[Holocaust denial]]; the Besson law of 1990;<ref>[http://www.oecd.org/gov/publicsectorinnovationande-government/2537279.pdf] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the Mermaz Law of 1989;,<ref name=\"justlanded\">{{cite web|url=http://www.justlanded.com/english/France/Articles/Property/Letting-in-France|title=France: Letting in France, Rules & Regulations, Various rules and regulations apply to the letting of|publisher=justlanded.com|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the introduction of a private childcare allowance;<ref name=\"google7\">{{cite book|title=The Politics of Post-Industrial Welfare States: Adapting Post-War Social Policies to New Social Risks|author1=Armingeon, K.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2007|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-134-17910-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTi2SS8egosC|page=218|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> the Urban Orientation Law of 1991;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/247-FR_Housing.pdf |title=National Analytical Study on Housing|date= |accessdate=11 March 2013}}</ref> the [[Pierre Arpaillange|Arpaillange Act]] on the financing of political parties; the reform of the [[penal code]]; the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Matignon Agreements]] concerning [[New Caledonia]]; the [[Loi Evin|Evin Act]] on smoking in public places; the extension of the age limit for family allowances to 18 years in 1990;<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref name=\"securite-sociale\">{{cite web|url=http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|title=Le portail du service public de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 sociale / L'allocation de rentr\u00e9e scolaire est&nbsp;(...)|publisher=securite-sociale.fr|accessdate=7 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501082739/http://www.securite-sociale.fr/L-allocation-de-rentree-scolaire-est-versee-sous-conditions-de-ressources-pour-chaque-enfant?id_mot=67|archive-date=1 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the 1989 Education Act which, amongst other measures, obliged local authorities to educate all children with disabilities.<ref name=\"google8\">{{cite book|title=Implementing Inclusive Education|author=Innovation, C.E.R.|date=1997|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|isbn=9789264155893|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y7N3QP75Q9wC|page=24|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Several large architectural works were pursued, in what would become known as the [[Grands Projets of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] with the building of the [[Louvre Pyramid]], the [[Channel Tunnel]], the [[Grande Arche]] at [[La D\u00e9fense]], the [[Bastille Opera]], the Finance Ministry in [[Bercy]], and the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France|National Library of France]].

She was the first woman to become Prime Minister in France, but proved a costly mistake due to her tendency for making acerbic and racist public remarks. After the Socialists experienced heavy losses in the 1992 regional elections, Cresson resigned from office. Her successor [[Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy]] promised to fight unemployment and corruption but he could not prevent the catastrophic defeat of the left in the [[1993 French legislative election|1993 legislative election]]. The Socialist Party suffered a crushing defeat with the right-wing parties winning 485 seats to the left's 92. He killed himself on 1 May 1993.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand named the former RPR Finance Minister [[Edouard Balladur]] as Prime Minister. The second \"cohabitation\" was less contentious than the first, because the two men knew they were not rivals for the next presidential election. By this point, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was nearly 80 years old and suffering from cancer in addition to the shock of his friend [[Fran\u00e7ois de Grossouvre]]'s suicide. His second and last term ended after the [[1995 French presidential election|1995 presidential election]] in May 1995 with the election of [[Jacques Chirac]].

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand also sharply criticized the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet intervention]] in [[Afghanistan]] as well as the country's nuclear weapons buildup. When Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand visited the USSR in November 1988, the Soviet media claimed to be 'leaving aside the virtually wasted decade and the loss of the [[France-Russia relations|Soviet-French]] 'special relationship' of the Gaullist era'.\n\nNevertheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was worried by the rapidity of the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern bloc's]] [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse]].

When the [[European Court of Human Rights]] finally ruled against the Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand doctrine, the policy had already led to most of the criminals never being punished for their crimes.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n====1990 speech at La Baule====\nResponding to a democratic movement in Africa after the 1989 fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], he made his La Baule speech in June 1990 which tied [[development aid]] to democratic efforts from former French colonies, and during which he opposed the devaluation of the [[CFA Franc]]. Seeing an \"East wind\" blowing in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he stated that a \"Southern wind\" was also blowing in Africa, and that state leaders had to respond to the populations' wishes and aspirations by a \"democratic opening\", which included a [[representative democracy|representative system]], free elections, [[Multi-party system|multipartyism]], [[freedom of the press]], an independent judiciary, and abolition of censorship. Claiming that France was the country making the most important effort concerning development aid, he announced that the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] (LDCs) would henceforth receive only grants from France, as opposed to loans (in order to combat the massive increase of [[Third World debt]] during the 1980s). He likewise limited the [[interest rate]] to 5% on French loans to intermediate-income countries (that is, [[Ivory Coast]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], Cameroon and [[Gabon]]).\n\nHe also criticized interventionism in sovereign matters, which was according to him only another form of \"[[colonialism]]\". However, according to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, this did not imply lessened concern on the part of Paris for its [[French colonial empire|former colonies]]. Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand thus continued with the African policy of de Gaulle inaugurated in 1960, which followed the relative failure of the 1958 creation of the [[French Community]]. All in all, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's La Baule speech, which marked a relative turning point in France's policy concerning its former colonies, has been compared with the 1956 ''loi-cadre [[Gaston Defferre|Defferre]]'' which was responding to [[anti-colonialist]] feelings.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061117230046/http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/CERI/Mitterrand_et_la_democratie_en_Afrique.htm#UN%20DISCOURS%20DE%20CIRCONSTANCE Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand et la d\u00e9mocratie en Afrique, huit ans apr\u00e8s], by Albert Bourgi, [[Centre d'\u00e9tudes et de recherches internationales]] (CERI) (mixed study unit with the [[CNRS]], dependent of the ''[[Fondation Nationale des Sciences Politiques]]'') {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAfrican heads of state themselves reacted to Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's speech at most with indifference.

[[Hassan II]], the king of Morocco, said for his part that \"Africa was too open to the world to remain indifferent to what was happening around it\", but that Western countries should \"help young democracies open out, without putting a knife under their throat, without a brutal transition to multipartyism.\"<ref>[http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/IMG/pdf/B0100_-fiche22sommets.pdf Les 22 premi\u00e8res conf\u00e9rences des chefs d'Etat de France et d'Afrique], on French government website \u2013 URL accessed in January 2007 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n\nAll in all, the La Baule speech has been said to be on one hand \"one of the foundations of political renewal in Africa French speaking area\", and on the other hand \"cooperation with France\", this despite \"incoherence and inconsistency, like any [[public policy]]\".<ref>[http://doc-iep.univ-lyon2.fr/Ressources/Documents/Etudiants/Memoires/detail-memoire.html?ID=310 Le discours de la Baule et le pluralisme en Afrique noire francophone.

Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's family then prosecuted Gubler and his publisher for violating [[Confidentiality#Medical confidentiality|medical confidentiality]].\n\n===P\u00e9tain===\nFran\u00e7ois Mitterrand came under fire in 1992 when it was revealed that he had arranged for the laying of a wreath of flowers on the grave of [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] each [[Armistice Day]] since 1987. P\u00e9tain had been the leader of French forces at the dramatic [[Battle of Verdun]] in World War I, for which he was revered by his contemporaries. Later, however, he became leader of [[Vichy France]] after the French [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|defeat by Germany]] (June 1940) in World War II, collaborating with [[Nazi Germany]] and putting [[anti-semitism|anti-semitic]] measures into place.\n\nThe placing of such a wreath was not without precedent. Presidents [[Charles de Gaulle]] and [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]] had wreaths placed on P\u00e9tain's grave to commemorate the 50th and 60th anniversaries of the end of World War I. Similarly, President [[Georges Pompidou]] had a wreath placed in 1973 when P\u00e9tain's remains were returned to the [[Ile d'Yeu]] after being stolen. Nonetheless, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's regular annual tributes went beyond the marking by his predecessors of exceptional occasions, and offended sensibilities at a time when France was re-examining its role in [[the Holocaust]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}\n\n===Urba===\nThe Urba consultancy was established in 1971 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] to advise Socialist-led [[Communes of France|communes]] on infrastructure projects and public works. The [[Urba affair]] became public in 1989 when two police officers investigating the [[Marseille]] regional office of Urba discovered detailed minutes of the organisation's contracts and division of proceeds between the party and elected officials. Although the minutes proved a direct link between Urba and graft activity, an edict from the office of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, himself listed as a recipient, prevented further investigation. The Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand election campaign of 1988 was directed by [[Henri Nallet]], who then became [[Minister of Justice (France)|Justice Minister]] and therefore in charge of the investigation at national level. In 1990 Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand declared an amnesty for those under investigation, thus ending the affair. Socialist Party treasurer [[Henri Emmanuelli]] was tried in 1997 for corruption offences, for which he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\n===Wiretaps===\nFrom 1982 to 1986, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand established an \"anti-terror cell\" installed as a service of the President of the Republic. This was an unusual set-up, since such law enforcement missions against terrorism are normally left to the [[French National Police|National Police]] and [[French Gendarmerie|''Gendarmerie'']], run under the cabinet and the Prime Minister, and under the supervision of the judiciary. The cell was largely staffed by members of these services, but it bypassed the normal line of command and safeguards. 3000 conversations concerning 150 people (7 for reasons judged to be contestable by the ensuing court process) were recorded between January 1983 and March 1986 by this anti terrorist cell at the Elys\u00e9e Palace. In one of its first actions, the cell was involved in the \"[[Irish of Vincennes]]\" affair, in which it appeared that members of the cell had planted weapons and explosives in the Vincennes apartment of three Irish nationals who were arrested on terrorism charges. Most markedly, it appears that the cell, under illegal [[presidential orders]], obtained [[wiretap]]s on journalists, politicians and other personalities who may have been an impediment for Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand's personal life. The illegal wiretapping was revealed in 1993 by ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]''; the case against members of the cell went to trial in November 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |title=(Subscription) |work=Le Monde |location=France |accessdate=3 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324020235/http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-387334,0.html |archive-date=24 March 2005 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a|title=Le proc\u00e8s des \"\u00e9coutes de l'Elys\u00e9e\" doit commencer lundi \u00e0 Paris|last=Von Derschau|first=Verena|publisher=La Presse Canadienne|access-date=5 December 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083952/http://www.netscape.qc.ca/article/?cat=Monde&article=M111351AU&ch=a#|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIt took 20 years for the 'affaire' to come before the courts because the instructing judge [[Jean-Paul Vallat]] was at first thwarted by the 'affaire' being classed a defence secret, but in December 1999 la [[Commission consultative du secret de la d\u00e9fense nationale]] declassified part of the files concerned. The Judge finished his investigation in 2000, but it still took another four years before coming on 15 November 2004 before the 16th chamber of the ''[[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|Tribunal correctionnel]] de Paris''. 12 people were charged with  \"atteinte \u00e0 la vie priv\u00e9e\" (breach of privacy) and one with selling computer files. 7 were given suspended sentences and fines and 4 were found not guilty.\n\nThe affair finally ended before the ''Tribunal correctionnel de Paris'' with the court's judgement on 9 November 2005. 7 members of the President's anti-terrorist unit were condemned and Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was designated as the \"inspirator and essentially the controller of the operation.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news.fr/actualite/societe/0,3800002050,39369829,00.htm |title=La police fran\u00e7aise d\u00e9ploie ses grandes oreilles, 30 mai 2007 |publisher=News.fr |accessdate=3 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe court's judgement revealed that Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was motivated by keeping elements of his private life secret from the general public, such as the existence of his illegitimate daughter [[Mazarine Pingeot]] (which the writer [[Jean-Edern Hallier]], was threatening to reveal), his cancer which had been diagnosed in 1981, and the elements of his past in the Vichy R\u00e9gime which were not already public knowledge. The court judged that certain people were tapped for \"obscure\" reasons, such as [[Carole Bouquet]]'s companion, a lawyer with family in the Middle East, [[Edwy Plenel]], a journalist for ''le Monde'' who covered the ''Rainbow Warrior'' story and the Vincennes Three affair, and the lawyer Antoine Comte.
