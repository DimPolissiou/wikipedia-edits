The central plot revolves around Haig's disastrous encounters with various poor match-ups and an ideal match a young waitress.\n\nThe film has elements of dark drama and self-pity leading to lost love, but it is primarily a romantic comedy.\n\nMost of the gentle romances are successful, even if it takes a little 'slapstick'  to achieve.\n\nIn the end, the only relationship that fails is the priest and the allure girl, as she sees herself as unworthy of his love and rejects him.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Derek Bond]] as Andrew Scott\n* [[Susan Shaw]] as Pat Cooper\n* [[Patrick Holt]] as Martin Roberts\n* [[Carol Marsh]] as Doris Pearson\n* [[David Tomlinson]] as David Haig\n* [[Zena Marshall]] as Marcelle Duclos\n* [[Guy Middleton]] as Sir Gordon Blake\n* [[Nora Swinburne]] as Enid Lawson\n* [[Brenda Bruce]] as Brenda Delamere\n* [[Jean Cadell]] as Hester Parsons\n* [[Denis O'Dea]] as Saunders\n* [[Alison Leggatt]] as Miss Beamish\n* [[Beatrice Varley]] as Mrs. Perrins\n\n==Reception==\nThe film was a box office flop recording a loss of \u00a367,600.<ref name=\"box\"/>\n\n===Critical===\n[[Bosley Crowther]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the first third of the film \"a delight to watch,\" but despite convincing dialogue and an \"excellent cast\", \"the film as a whole is a disappointingly contrived package job\".

In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century.

In Spain the language lost its last and probably already declining function as a church language when the Visigoths converted to Catholicism in 589.{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=119\u2013121}} The language survived as a domestic language in the Iberian peninsula (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) as late as the 8th century, and [[Franks|Frankish]] author [[Walafrid Strabo]] wrote that it was still spoken in the lower [[Danube]] area in the early 9th century.{{sfn|Pronk-Tiethoff|2013|pp=9-11}}\n\nIn pockets of the Crimea, a related dialect known as [[Crimean Gothic]] survived up until the early modern period, and the 4th-century Bible translation was in use there until at least the 9th century.<ref name=\"Nemalevich\">{{cite web |url=https://meduza.io/feature/2015/12/25/molitvy-na-kamnyah |url-access= |title=\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u044b \u043d\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043c\u043d\u044f\u0445 |last1=Nemalevich |first1=Sergey |author-link1= |date=December 25, 2015 |orig-year= |editor-last1= |editor-first1= |editor1= |editor-link1= |editor2-last= |editor2-first= |editor2-link= |editors= |department= |website=[[Meduza]] |series= |publisher= |agency= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title= |type= |format= |bibcode= |doi= |isbn= |jstor= |archive-url= |archive-date= |url-status= |access-date=September 17, 2019 |via= |quote= |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n===Society===\n{{See|Palace of Omurtag}}\nArchaeological evidence in Visigothic cemeteries shows that social stratification was analogous to that of the village of [[Sabbas the Goth]]. The majority of villagers were common [[peasant]]s. Paupers were buried with funeral rites, unlike slaves. In a village of 50 to 100 people, there were four or five elite couples.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}} In Eastern Europe, houses include sunken-floored dwellings, surface dwellings, and stall-houses. The largest known settlement is the [[Criuleni District]].{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}} Chernyakhov cemeteries feature both [[cremation]] and [[inhumation]] burials; among the latter the head aligned to the north. Some graves were left empty. Grave goods often include pottery, bone combs, and iron tools, but hardly ever weapons.{{sfn|Heather|Matthews|1991|pp=47-96}}\n\nPeter Heather suggests that the freemen constituted the core of Gothic society. These were ranked below the nobility, but above the [[freedmen]] and slaves. It is estimated that around a quarter to a fifth of weapon-bearing Gothic males of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] were freemen.{{sfn|Heather|2010|p=66}}\n\n===Law===\n{{See|Ancient Germanic law|Kindins|Reiks|Edictum Theodorici|Visigothic Code|Code of Euric|Councils of Toledo}}\n\n===Warfare===\n{{Main|Gothic and Vandal warfare}}\n{{See|Gothic Wars|Upper Trajan's Wall|Athanaric's Wall|Montes Serrorum}}\n\n===Economy===\nArchaeology shows that the Visigoths, unlike the Ostrogoths, were predominantly farmers. They sowed wheat, barley, rye, and flax. They also raised pigs, poultry, and goats. Horses and donkeys were raised as working animals and fed with hay. Sheep were raised for their wool, which they fashioned into clothing. Archaeology indicates they were skilled potters and blacksmiths. When peace treaties were negotiated with the Romans, the Goths demanded free trade. Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Ulfilas explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction.

Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\"). In [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colonial period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=67}}\n\nA large amount of literature has been produced on the Goths, with [[Henry Bradley]]'s ''The Goths'' (1888) being the standard English-language text for many decades.

Later, many moved into the Roman Empire, or settled west of the [[Carpathians]] near what is now [[Hungary]].\n\nA people called the ''Gutones''\u2014possibly early Goths\u2014are documented living near the lower [[Vistula River]] in the 1st century, where they are associated with the archaeological [[Wielbark culture]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/><ref name=\"Heather_ODLA\"/> In his book ''[[Getica]]'', the Gothic historian [[Jordanes]] claimed that the Goths originated in southern [[Scandinavia]] more than 1000 years earlier, but his reliability is disputed.<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/> The Wielbark culture expanded southwards towards the [[Black Sea]], where by the late 3rd century it contributed to the formation of the [[Chernyakhov culture]], which is associated with the Goths who were in frequent conflict and contact with the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=\"Heather_OCD\"/>{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}} By the 4th century at the latest, several groups were distinguishable, among whom the [[Thervingi]] and [[Greuthungi]] were the most powerful.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}} During this time, [[Ulfilas]] began the [[Gothic Christianity|conversion]] of Goths to [[Arianism]].{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\nIn the late 4th century, the lands of the Goths were invaded from the east by the [[Huns]]. In the aftermath of this event, several groups of Goths came under Hunnic domination, while others migrated further west or sought refuge inside the Roman Empire. Goths who entered the empire by crossing the [[Danube]] inflicted a devastating defeat upon the Romans at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378. These Goths would form the  [[Visigoths]], and under their king [[Alaric I]] they began a long migration, eventually establishing a [[Visigothic Kingdom]] in Spain at [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. Meanwhile, Goths under Hunnic rule gained their independence in the 5th century, most importantly the [[Ostrogoths]]. Under their king [[Theodoric the Great]], these Goths established an [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in Italy at [[Ravenna]].{{sfn|Heather|2012|p=623}}\n\nThe Ostrogothic Kingdom was [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|destroyed]] by the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] in the 6th century, while the Visigothic Kingdom was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in the early 8th century. Remnants of Gothic communities in the [[Crimea]], known as the [[Crimean Goths]], lingered on for several centuries, although Goths would eventually cease to exist as a distinct people.{{sfn|Heather|2018|p=673}}{{sfn|Pritsak|2005}}\n\n==Name==\nThe origin and meaning of the term ''Goths'' is one of the most discussed topics in [[Germanic philology]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}\n\nIn the [[Gothic language]], the Goths were called the *''[[:wiktionary:gut\u00feiuda|Gut-\u00feiuda]]'' \"Gothic people\" (attested as dative singular ''Gut-\u00feiudai'').{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}} Gutthiuda can also mean \"Land of the Gothic people\".{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The simplex variant of this name, *''Gutans'' (Goth), or possibly *''Gut\u00f4s'', is inferred from a presumed genitive plural form ''gutani'' in the [[Ring of Pietroassa#Inscription|Pietroassa inscription]].{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}}\n\nThe Gothic name is generally believed to have been first attested by [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources in the 1st century AD in the form of ''Gutones'', which was applied to a people who at that time are recorded as living near the lower [[Vistula]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The name ''Gutones'' is certainly recorded by [[Pliny]] in the 1st century AD, and by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century AD.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} Pliny mentions that the 4th century BC traveler [[Pytheas]] reported a people called the ''Guiones'', while the early 1st century geographer [[Strabo]] mentions a people called the ''Butones'', and the late 1st century historian [[Tacitus]] mentions the ''Gotones''.{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} These names mentioned by Pytheas, Strabo and Tacitus are often equated with the name ''Gutones''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=37-41}} ''Gutones'' may have meant \"young\" Goths or \"great\" Goths.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Ptolemy mentions not only the ''Gutones'', but also a people of [[Scandia]] called ''Goutai/Guti'', who are generally equated with the [[Geats]]/Gauts ({{lang-ang|g\u0113atas}}; {{lang-non|gautar}}; {{lang-sv|g\u00f6tar}}) of southern [[Sweden]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} After Ptolemy, the Gothic name is not attested again until the late 3rd century, when the name ''Goths'' ({{lang-la|Gothi}}) is explicitly recorded for the first time for a group of peoples living north of the [[Danube]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} Although no ancient sources make a connection between the names ''Gutones'' and ''Goths'',{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} this connection is nevertheless generally accepted among modern scholars.<ref name=\"Heather_115\"/> The name ''gutani'' is attested in the Pietroassa inscription, and probably reflects a form of the Gothic endonym *''Gutans''.{{sfn|Brink|2008|p=104}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} The Geats/Gauts are recorded in the 6th century by [[Procopius]] and [[Jordanes]] as the ''Gautoi'' and ''Gauthigoths'' respectively.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}}\n\nThe names ''Gutones'' and ''Goths'' in [[Proto-Germanic]] are both *''Gutaniz'' (singular *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/gut\u00f4|Gut\u00f4]]''), which is identical to that of the [[Gutes]] (Old Norse: ''gutnar''; Swedish: ''gutar''), who are natives of the island of [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Andersson|1996|pp=5-21}}{{sfn|Brink|2002|p=688}} A basic [[Word stem|stem]] of both ''Gutones'', ''Goths'', *''Gutans'' and ''Gutthiuda'' is ''gut-''.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} ''Gut-'' is generally thought to be related to the Gothic term *''[[:wiktionary:giutan|giutan]]'', which means \"to pour\".{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|pp=163\u2013164}}{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The stem ''gut-'' is also found in the names of [[G\u00f6ta \u00e4lv]] of [[G\u00f6taland]] (homeland of the Geats/Gauts), the river [[:wiktionary:Guthalus|Guthalus]] of [[Germania]] mentioned by Pliny, and in the name of [[Gaut]], who was considered the mythical ancestor of the Geats/Gauts.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=19-24}} The more specific stem for ''Gutones'', ''Goths'', *''Gutans'', ''Gut-thiuda'' and ''Gutes'' is *''Gutan'', while the corresponding stem for ''Geats''/''Gauts'' is *''Gauta''.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}} Both  are doubtlessly related to the Proto-Germanic verb *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/geutan\u0105|geuta-]]'', which means \"to pour\".{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}}{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}}{{sfn|Wolfram|2004|pp=44-47}} This Proto-Germanic verb is in turn derived from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root [[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/\u01f5\u02b0ewd-|*''*\u01f5\u02b0ewd-'']], which also means \"to pour\".{{sfn|Lehmann|1986|p=156}} Rather than being derived from *''Gauta'', *''Gutan'' probably has a common origin and the same meaning as it.{{sfn|R\u00fcbekeil|2002|pp=603-604}} The Proto-Germanic form of the name ''Geats''/''Gauts'' is *''Gautoz'' (singular *''[[:wiktionary:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/gautaz|Gautaz]]'').{{sfn|Brink|2008|pp=90, 110}}{{sfn|Strid|2011|p=43}} *''Gutaniz'' and *''Gautoz'' corresponds exactly to the Old Norse names ''gutnar'' and ''gautar'', which referred to the Gutes and Geats/Gauts respectively.

Imports from Rome included wine and cooking-oil.{{sfn|B\u00f3na|2001|p=}}\n\n[[File:Bischof Ulfilas erkl\u00e4rt den Goten das Evangelium.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''Ulfilas explains the gospel to the Goths'', 1900]]\n\nRoman writers note that the Goths neither assessed [[taxes]] on their own people nor on their subjects. The early 5th century Christian writer [[Salvian]] compared the Goths' and related people's favourable treatment of the poor to the miserable state of peasants in [[Roman Gaul]]:\n<blockquote>\nFor in the Gothic country the barbarians are so far from tolerating this sort of oppression that not even Romans who live among them have to bear it. Hence all the Romans in that region have but one desire, that they may never have to return to the Roman jurisdiction. It is the unanimous prayer of the Roman people in that district that they may be permitted to continue to lead their present life among the barbarians.{{sfn|Kristinsson|2010|p=172}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Religion===\n{{See|Gothic paganism|Gothic persecution of Christians|Gothic Christianity}}\nInitially practising [[Gothic paganism]], the Goths were gradually converted to [[Arianism]] in the course of the 4th century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}} According to [[Basil of Caesarea]], a prisoner named Eutychus taken captive in a raid on Cappadocia in 260 preached the gospel to the Goths and was martyred.{{sfn|Cassia|2019|p=22}} It was only in the 4th as a result of missionary activity by the Gothic bishop [[Ulfilas]], whose grandparents were Cappadocians taken captive in the raids of the 250s,{{sfn|Cassia|2019|p=22}} that the Goths were gradually converted.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}} Ulfilas devised a [[Gothic alphabet]] and translated the [[Gothic Bible]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nDuring the 370s, Goths converting to Christianity were subject to [[Gothic persecution of Christians|persecution]] by the Thervingian king Athanaric, who was a pagan.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|pp=64\u201372}}\n\nThe Visigothic Kingdom in Hispania converted to Roman Catholicism in the late 6th&nbsp;Century.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=371}}\n\nThe Ostrogoths (and their remnants, the Crimean Goths) were closely connected to the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the 5th century, and became fully incorporated under the [[Metropolitanate of Gothia]] from the 9th century.{{sfn|Vasiliev|1936|pp=117\u2013135}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Estatua de Don Pelayo en Covadonga, Asturias.jpg|thumb|In Spain, the Visigothic nobleman [[Pelagius of Asturias]] who founded the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] and began the [[Reconquista]] at the [[Battle of Covadonga]], is a national hero regarded as the country's first monarch.]]\n{{See|Reconquista|Gothicism}}\nThe Goths' relationship with Sweden became an important part of [[Swedish nationalism]], and until the 19th&nbsp;Century, before the Gothic origin had been thoroughly researched by archaeologists, Swedish scholars considered Swedes to be the direct descendants of the Goths. Today, scholars identify this as a [[cultural movement]] called [[Gothicismus]], which included an enthusiasm for things [[Old Norse]].{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=23}}\n\nIn [[Spain in the Middle Ages|medieval]] and modern Spain, the Visigoths were believed to be the progenitors of the [[Spanish nobility]] (compare [[Gobineau]] for a similar French idea). By the early 7th century, the ethnic distinction between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans had all but disappeared, but recognition of a Gothic origin, e.g. on gravestones, still survived among the nobility. The 7th century Visigothic aristocracy saw itself as bearers of a particular Gothic consciousness and as guardians of old traditions such as Germanic namegiving; probably these traditions were on the whole restricted to the family sphere (Hispano-Roman nobles were doing service for Visigothic nobles already in the 5th century and the two branches of Spanish aristocracy had fully adopted similar customs two centuries later).{{sfn|Pohl|Reimitz|1998|pp=124\u2013126}}\n\nBeginning in 1278, when [[Magnus III of Sweden]] ascended to the throne, a reference to Gothic origins was included in the title of the King of Sweden: {{quote | We N.N. by the Grace of God King of the Swedes, the Goths and the Vends.}} In 1973, with the death of King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], the title was changed to simply \"King of Sweden.\"{{sfn|Luttwak|2009|p=24}}\n\n{{Quote box\n |quote = In all history there is nothing more romantically marvellous than the swift rise of this people to the height of greatness, or than the suddenness and the tragic completeness of their ruin.{{sfn|Bradley|1888|p=3}}\n |author = \u2014 [[Henry Bradley]]\n |source = The Story of the Goths (1888)\n |align =\n |width = 18.5%\n}}\n\nThe Spanish and Swedish claims of Gothic origins led to a clash at the [[Council of Basel]] in 1434. Before the assembled [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and delegations could engage in theological discussion, they had to decide how to sit during the proceedings. The delegations from the more prominent nations argued that they should sit closest to the [[Pope]], and there were also disputes over who were to have the finest chairs and who were to have their chairs on mats. In some cases, they compromised so that some would have half a chair leg on the rim of a mat. In this conflict, [[Nicolaus Ragvaldi]], bishop of the [[Diocese of V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], claimed that the Swedes were the descendants of the great Goths, and that the people of V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland (''Westrogothia'' in Latin) were the Visigoths and the people of \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland (''Ostrogothia'' in Latin) were the Ostrogoths. The Spanish delegation retorted that it was only the \"lazy\" and \"unenterprising\" Goths who had remained in Sweden, whereas the \"heroic\" Goths had left Sweden, invaded the Roman empire and settled in Spain.{{sfn|Wolfram|1990|p=2}}{{sfn|S\u00f6derberg|1896|pp=187\u2013195}}\n\nIn Spain, a man acting with arrogance would be said to be \"''haci\u00e9ndose los godos''\" (\"making himself to act like the Goths\"). In [[Chile]], [[Argentina]] and the [[Canary Islands]], ''godo'' was an [[ethnic slur]] used against European Spaniards, who in the early colonial period often felt superior to the people born locally (''[[Spanish Criollo peoples|criollos]]'').{{sfn|Bell|1993|p=67}}\n\nA large amount of literature has been produced on the Goths, with [[Henry Bradley]]'s ''The Goths'' (1888) being the standard English-language text for many decades.

It is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways' fleet. It is a passenger variant of the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-9|WAG 9]] freight locomotive with a modified [[gear ratio]] to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains. The WAP-7 can also haul loads of 24-26 passenger coaches ({{convert|1430|\u2013|1550|t|abbr=on|disp=or}} at {{convert|130|km/h|abbr=on|disp=or}}). It is the most successful passenger locomotive on the Indian Railways roster after the [[Indian locomotive class WAP-4|WAP 4]].

The locomotives have been used as a regular link for many of the [[Garib Rath Express|Garib Rath express]] and many [[Humsafar Express|Humsafar express]]<nowiki/>services and eventually extended to a significant number of [[AC Express (Indian Railways)|AC Express]] and [[Superfast/Mail Trains in India|Mail/Superfast Express]] services like [[Jaipur Superfast Express]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Mail]], [[Mangalore Mail]], [[Bangalore Mail]], [[Sewagram Express|Sewagram]] express and so on. It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features.

It is the most powerful passenger locomotive in the Indian Railways' fleet. It is a passenger variant of the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-9|WAG 9]] freight locomotive with a modified [[gear ratio]] to pull lighter loads at higher speeds. It is capable of hauling 24 coach trains at speeds ranging {{convert|110|-|140|km/h|abbr=on}}, depending on the MPS (Maximum Permissible Speed) of the sector, and is now largely used by [[Northern Railway (India)|Northern Railways]] (NR), [[South Central Railway zone|South Central Railway]] (SCR), [[Central Railways]] (CR), [[South East Central Railway Zone]] (SECR), [[South Eastern Railway (India)|South Eastern Railways]] (SER), [[West Central Railway zone|West Central Railways]] (WCR), [[Eastern Railway zone|Eastern Railways]] (ER), [[Western Railway zone]] (WR), [[North Central Railway zone]] (NCR), [[South Western Railway zone|South Western Railway]] (SWR) etc among other zones. As of April 2020, there are 1046 locomotives in service, all of which are fitted with [[tightlock coupler]]s (for [[Buffers and chain coupler#Center-buffer-and-chain(s)|central buffer coupling]]) and chain link couplers. In February 2017, [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] built their first WAP 7 class locomotive.<ref name=\"prod_dlw\">{{cite web|title=Brief History of DLW|url=http://www.dlw.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,294,702|publisher=Ministry of Railways, Government of India|accessdate=30 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\nWith a maximum speed rating of {{convert|140|km/h|abbr=on}} the WAP-7 has the highest acceleration figures while hauling mail/express trains.

The locomotives have been used as a regular link for many of the [[Garib Rath Express|Garib Rath express]] and many [[Humsafar Express|Humsafar express]]<nowiki/>services and eventually extended to a significant number of [[AC Express (Indian Railways)|AC Express]] and [[Superfast/Mail Trains in India|Mail/Superfast Express]] services like [[Jaipur Superfast Express]], [[Thiruvananthapuram Mail]], [[Mangalore Mail]], [[Bangalore Mail]], [[Sewagram Express|Sewagram]] express and so on. It is soon to be the most commonly used passenger locomotive. Upgrades are underway to increase power output and maximum speed. The First High Speed version WAP-7 HS loco ( loco no 30750) was launched on 28 February 2019 capable of attaining 160 km/h with overall reduction in weight by 14 tons.\n\n[[File:WAP730333.jpg|thumb|30333 WAP-7 locomotive of RPM ([[Royapuram Railway Station|Royapuram]]) shed at [[Mysore|Mysuru]], [[Karnataka]].]]\nThe WAP-7 locomotive can deliver {{convert|6125|hp|kW|abbr=on|lk=on}} continuously, with [[Regenerative brake|regenerative braking]] being one of its salient features. Regenerative braking is deployed on down gradients conserving energy to the tune of 30-35 percent.
