It was released on 11 September 2000 by [[Parlophone]] as the second single for her seventh studio album, ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000), and distributed in various formats. The track was originally written for Swedish singer [[Pandora (singer)|Pandora]] by Steve Torch, [[Brian Rawling]], [[Graham Stack (record producer)|Graham Stack]], and [[Mark Taylor (music producer)|Mark Taylor]], while production was handled by the latter two, it was handed to Minogue to record. Musically, \"On a Night Like This\" is a [[dance-pop]] song that also incorporates elements of [[disco]]. Its lyrical content delves on experiencing unique, possibly sexual experiences during the night.\n\nUpon its release, \"On a Night Like This\" generally received favourable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Some of them complimented the production and its dance sound, whilst some noted that it didn't stand out among other tracks from ''Light Years''. Commercially, it experienced success in Australia and the United Kingdom, peaking at number one and number two, respectively. Elsewhere, it performed moderately and reached the top 40 in countries such as Sweden, Ireland, Finland, and New Zealand.

It was released on 11 September 2000 by [[Parlophone]] as the second single for her seventh studio album, ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000), and distributed in various formats. The track was originally written for Swedish singer [[Pandora (singer)|Pandora]] by Steve Torch, [[Brian Rawling]], [[Graham Stack (record producer)|Graham Stack]], and [[Mark Taylor (music producer)|Mark Taylor]], while production was handled by the latter two, it was handed to Minogue to record. Musically, \"On a Night Like This\" is a [[dance-pop]] song that also incorporates elements of [[disco]]. Its lyrical content delves on experiencing unique, possibly sexual experiences during the night.\n\nUpon its release, \"On a Night Like This\" generally received favourable reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Some of them complimented the production and its dance sound, whilst some noted that it didn't stand out among other tracks from ''Light Years''. Commercially, it experienced success in Australia and the United Kingdom, peaking at number one and number two, respectively. Elsewhere, it performed moderately and reached the top 40 in countries such as Sweden, Ireland, Finland, and New Zealand. An accompanying music video was shot by Douglas Avery, with its plot being inspired by the [[Martin Scorsese]] 1995 film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]''.\n\nThe song has been performed on all of Minogue's concert tours since its release, with the exception of the [[Anti Tour]]. Since its release, it has been selected by contemporary critics as one of her most recognizable and career-defining tracks. \"On a Night Like This\" was re-distributed as an orchestral version for her 2012 compilation album, ''[[The Abbey Road Sessions (Kylie Minogue album)|The Abbey Road Sessions]]''.\n\n==Background and release==\n[[File:Pandora (artist).JPG|thumbnail|left|Swedish singer [[Pandora (singer)|Pandora]] (''pictured'') initially recorded the single in 1999, but its rejection resulted in Minogue and Anna Vissi re-recording it.]]\nAfter leaving her label [[Deconstruction Records]] in 1999, Minogue signed a deal with British label [[Parlophone]] that same year and began recording her album ''[[Light Years (Kylie Minogue album)|Light Years]]'' (2000). The following year, she released her comeback single, \"[[Spinning Around]]\", which garnered critical and commercial success in Australasia and Europe, and led to her releasing a follow-up single from ''Light Years''.<ref name=\"kyliebioallmusic\">{{cite web|last=True|first=Chris|title=Kylie Minogue - Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kylie-minogue-mn0000776093/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]].
