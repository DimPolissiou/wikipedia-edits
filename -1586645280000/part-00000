It was written by the series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria ([[Lenora Crichlow]]), a woman who does not remember who she is and wakes up in a place where almost everybody is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people ([[Michael Smiley]] and [[Tuppence Middleton]]), she must stop the \"White Bear\" transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers.\n\nBrooker originally wrote the episode in an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] setting, but when the script was about to be filmed at a former [[Royal Air Force]] base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a [[plot twist]] at the end of the script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.\n\nThe episode, first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers and was very well received by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s [[Moors murders]], in which five children were killed. Its horror aspects have been said to be reminiscent of the 1970s film ''[[The Wicker Man]]'' and the video game ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', while some similarities with ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' have also been noted. This [[dystopia]]n episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitisation]], violence as entertainment, [[vigilantism]], the concept of justice and punishment, and the nature of reality.\n\n==Plot==\nA woman ([[Lenora Crichlow]]) wakes up with amnesia, in a house where television screens are showing an unknown symbol. Turning the screens off, she finds photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield), along with one of a small girl (Imani Jackman) which she takes with her. She leaves the house and pleads for help, but people ignore her while recording her on their phones. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem ([[Tuppence Middleton]]). Jem explains that the symbol began appearing on television and mobile phone screens, turning most people into passive [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the \"hunters\", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at \"White Bear\" to destroy it.\n\nAs they travel, Baxter ([[Michael Smiley]]), a man who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where he tries to torture the woman, but Jem kills Baxter first. They continue travelling to the transmitter; when they reach it, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays [[confetti]]. Walls open to reveal that everything was staged.\n\nThe woman is strapped to a chair and informed that her name is Victoria Skillane, and that the girl in the photograph is Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fianc\u00e9, Iain Rannoch, had abducted and murdered. After the pair were arrested, Iain committed suicide in his cell, while Victoria was sentenced to undergo daily psychological punishment at the present facility, which is called White Bear Justice Park.\n\nVictoria is driven back to the compound past an outraged crowd and returned to where she awoke. As she is shown footage of Jemima, Baxter places electrodes on her head, simultaneously torturing her and wiping her memory of the day's events. Over the end credits, the next day's events are seen from the point of view of the park's staff, and its visitors who play the voyeurs.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Charlie Brooker]] came up for the idea while working on the 2008 zombie horror serial ''[[Dead Set]]''. During filming, [[Riz Ahmed]]'s character was being chased by zombies; some schoolchildren noticed the production and begun watching, taking pictures on their phones.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = White Bear | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref> Brooker considered it to be \"an interesting and frightening image, because they're standing there, not intervening\".<!-- <ref name=duca/> --> Brooker converted it to a script for ''Dead Set'', in which a photograph goes [[Viral video|viral]] on social media and \"unlock[s] this primal urge for people to be voyeurs of agony\".

The patient draws a glyph from their dreams, and the psychiatrist files it along with identical symbols drawn by her other patients. This glyph resembles an upside-down \"Y\" and was created by Brooker after much experimentation; it is the one used in the final episode. This draft had the character Baxter in it and resembled the 1973 horror film ''[[The Wicker Man]]''. Executive producer Annabel Jones noted that the theme had shifted more towards voyeurism. By this point, director Carl Tibbetts was involved with the project.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nAfter working on the other series two episodes \"[[Be Right Back]]\" and \"[[The Waldo Moment]]\", the latter of which was in production, there was little of the budget remaining for \"White Bear\". Filming was limited to a military base at [[RAF Daws Hill]] in southeast England, which was formerly a [[United States Air Force]] base. The base contained an abandoned housing estate and buildings that could be repurposed to look like shops and garages. The base was surrounded by [[chicken wire]] and Brooker considered that the fence could be there because the events of the episode were not real. Brooker believed that the public would watch certain people be tortured for entertainment, such as Jimmy Savile\u2014against whom hundreds of [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|sexual abuse allegations]] have been made\u2014or Myra Hindley\u2014a serial killer who committed the [[Moors murders]] with her boyfrend, Ian Brady.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nBrooker then rewrote the script in two days<!-- <ref name=independent/> --> \"in a bit of a fever dream\".<ref name=variety/><ref name=independent/> He noted that he had never changed a script so dramatically so late in the production process,<ref name=variety/> and that this is the first major plot twist in a ''Black Mirror'' episode. Brooker considered making Victoria innocent, but settled on making her unknowingly guilty. [[Lenora Crichlow]] had already been cast as Victoria prior to the rewrite.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nPrior to the twist, the episode is shown from Victoria's perspective. According to Tibbetts, handheld cameras were used to make the episode \"very intense and personal\" and to make the viewer identify with Victoria. Contrastingly, in the end credits scenes filming is \"still and static\" to resemble an observer's perspective. Flashback scenes were balanced to avoid giving away too much information before the twist. The scene in which Victoria is driven through the crowd was cut shorter in the final edit and many of the crowd members were added digitally. Brooker had the idea during editing of displaying Victoria's next day at the park during the credits. The episode is 42 minutes long, slightly shorter than Channel 4's standard of 45\u201348 minutes for an hour-long episode.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nThe episode's soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The score is mostly [[electronic music|electronic]]. To give a different character to the music played as Victoria lives her next day in the theme park, Opstad added acoustic elements, but feeling that this did not fit with the universe he used [[pizzicato]] cello music and overlaid \"spidery\" atonal lines.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nBrooker had other ideas that were removed from the original script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts not to function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.<ref name=independent>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-interview-release-date-joe-wright-nosedive-shut-up-and-dance-a7372841.html|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker interview: 'I'm Loathe to Say This is the Worst Year Ever Because the Next is Coming'|date=21 October 2016|author=Stolworthy, Jacob|website=The Independent|accessdate=21 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nMany reviewers identified an allusion to the [[Moors murders]], committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s.<ref name=avclub/><ref name=geek/><ref name=telegraph/> ''[[The A.V.

It was written by the series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]] and directed by Carl Tibbetts. The episode follows Victoria ([[Lenora Crichlow]]), a woman who does not remember who she is and wakes up in a place where almost everybody is controlled by a television signal. Along with some of the few other unaffected people ([[Michael Smiley]] and [[Tuppence Middleton]]), she must stop the \"White Bear\" transmitter while surviving merciless pursuers.\n\nBrooker originally wrote the episode in an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic]] setting, but when the script was about to be filmed at a former [[Royal Air Force]] base, he changed it because of a fence he saw there. He rewrote the story in two days, removing some details he considered useful for a sequel story. The main change was the addition of a [[plot twist]] at the end of the script, which was noted as the most impressive aspect of the episode by several reviewers.\n\nThe episode, first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 18 February 2013, was watched by 1.2 million viewers and was very well received by critics, particularly for its writing and Middleton's performance. The story draws parallels with real murder cases, primarily the 1960s [[Moors murders]], in which five children were killed. Its horror aspects have been said to be reminiscent of the 1970s film ''[[The Wicker Man]]'' and the video game ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', while some similarities with ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]'' have also been noted. This [[dystopia]]n episode reflects upon several aspects of contemporary society, such as media coverage of murders, technology's effects on people's empathy, [[Desensitization (psychology)|desensitisation]], violence as entertainment, [[vigilantism]], the concept of justice and punishment, and the nature of reality.\n\n==Plot==\nA woman ([[Lenora Crichlow]]) wakes up with amnesia, in a house where television screens are showing an unknown symbol. Turning the screens off, she finds photos of herself and a man (Nick Ofield), along with one of a small girl (Imani Jackman) which she takes with her. She leaves the house and pleads for help, but people ignore her while recording her on their phones. When a masked man opens fire at her with a shotgun, she flees and meets Jem ([[Tuppence Middleton]]). Jem explains that the symbol began appearing on television and mobile phone screens, turning most people into passive [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]]. The woman and Jem are unaffected, but they are also a target for the \"hunters\", unaffected humans who act sadistically. Jem plans to reach a transmitter at \"White Bear\" to destroy it.\n\nAs they travel, Baxter ([[Michael Smiley]]), a man who is also unaffected, picks them up. He holds them at gunpoint in a forest, where he tries to torture the woman, but Jem kills Baxter first. They continue travelling to the transmitter; when they reach it, two hunters attack them. The woman wrestles a shotgun away from a hunter and fires at her attacker, but the gun only sprays [[confetti]]. Walls open to reveal that everything was staged.\n\nThe woman is strapped to a chair and informed that her name is Victoria Skillane, and that the girl in the photograph is Jemima Sykes, whom Victoria and her fianc\u00e9, Iain Rannoch, had abducted and murdered. After the pair were arrested, Iain committed suicide in his cell, while Victoria was sentenced to undergo daily psychological punishment at the present facility, which is called White Bear Justice Park.\n\nVictoria is driven back to the compound past an outraged crowd and returned to where she awoke. As she is shown footage of Jemima, Baxter places electrodes on her head, simultaneously torturing her and wiping her memory of the day's events. Over the end credits, the next day's events are seen from the point of view of the park's staff, and its visitors who play the voyeurs.\n\n==Production==\nSeries creator [[Charlie Brooker]] came up for the idea while working on the 2008 zombie horror serial ''[[Dead Set]]''. During filming, [[Riz Ahmed]]'s character was being chased by zombies; some schoolchildren noticed the production and begun watching, taking pictures on their phones.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = White Bear | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref> Brooker considered it to be \"an interesting and frightening image, because they're standing there, not intervening\".<!-- <ref name=duca/> --> Brooker converted it to a script for ''Dead Set'', in which a photograph goes [[Viral video|viral]] on social media and \"unlock[s] this primal urge for people to be voyeurs of agony\".

The patient draws a glyph from their dreams, and the psychiatrist files it along with identical symbols drawn by her other patients. This glyph resembles an upside-down \"Y\" and was created by Brooker after much experimentation; it is the one used in the final episode. This draft had the character Baxter in it and resembled the 1973 horror film ''[[The Wicker Man]]''. Executive producer Annabel Jones noted that the theme had shifted more towards voyeurism. By this point, director Carl Tibbetts was involved with the project.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nAfter working on the other series two episodes \"[[Be Right Back]]\" and \"[[The Waldo Moment]]\", the latter of which was in production, there was little of the budget remaining for \"White Bear\". Filming was limited to a military base at [[RAF Daws Hill]] in southeast England, which was formerly a [[United States Air Force]] base. The base contained an abandoned housing estate and buildings that could be repurposed to look like shops and garages. The base was surrounded by [[chicken wire]] and Brooker considered that the fence could be there because the events of the episode were not real. Brooker believed that the public would watch certain people be tortured for entertainment, such as Jimmy Savile\u2014against whom hundreds of [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|sexual abuse allegations]] have been made\u2014or Myra Hindley\u2014a serial killer who committed the [[Moors murders]] with her boyfrend, Ian Brady.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nBrooker then rewrote the script in two days<!-- <ref name=independent/> --> \"in a bit of a fever dream\".<ref name=variety/><ref name=independent/> He noted that he had never changed a script so dramatically so late in the production process,<ref name=variety/> and that this is the first major plot twist in a ''Black Mirror'' episode. Brooker considered making Victoria innocent, but settled on making her unknowingly guilty. [[Lenora Crichlow]] had already been cast as Victoria prior to the rewrite.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nPrior to the twist, the episode is shown from Victoria's perspective. According to Tibbetts, handheld cameras were used to make the episode \"very intense and personal\" and to make the viewer identify with Victoria. Contrastingly, in the end credits scenes filming is \"still and static\" to resemble an observer's perspective. Flashback scenes were balanced to avoid giving away too much information before the twist. The scene in which Victoria is driven through the crowd was cut shorter in the final edit and many of the crowd members were added digitally. Brooker had the idea during editing of displaying Victoria's next day at the park during the credits. The episode is 42 minutes long, slightly shorter than Channel 4's standard of 45\u201348 minutes for an hour-long episode.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nThe episode's soundtrack was composed by Jon Opstad. The score is mostly [[electronic music|electronic]]. To give a different character to the music played as Victoria lives her next day in the theme park, Opstad added acoustic elements, but feeling that this did not fit with the universe he used [[pizzicato]] cello music and overlaid \"spidery\" atonal lines.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nBrooker had other ideas that were removed from the original script because they would be complicated to do. He said he could use these ideas in a sequel story which would involve the main character finding messages that she had left for herself on previous days as the process of erasing her mind starts not to function. However, as the location for the episode no longer exists, he felt it would be more practical to create a graphic novel instead of recreating the scenario.<ref name=independent>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/black-mirror-season-3-charlie-brooker-interview-release-date-joe-wright-nosedive-shut-up-and-dance-a7372841.html|title=Black Mirror's Charlie Brooker interview: 'I'm Loathe to Say This is the Worst Year Ever Because the Next is Coming'|date=21 October 2016|author=Stolworthy, Jacob|website=The Independent|accessdate=21 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nMany reviewers identified an allusion to the [[Moors murders]], committed by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, a British couple who killed children in the 1960s.<ref name=avclub/><ref name=geek/><ref name=telegraph/> ''[[The A.V.

It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]], directed by [[Owen Harris (director)|Owen Harris]], and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 11 February 2013.\n\nThe episode tells the story of Martha ([[Hayley Atwell]]), a young woman whose boyfriend Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) is killed in a car accident. As she mourns him, she discovers that technology now allows her to communicate with an artificial intelligence imitating Ash, and reluctantly decides to try it. \"Be Right Back\" had two sources of inspiration: the question of whether to delete a dead friend's phone number from one's contacts, and the idea that [[Twitter]] posts could be made by software mimicking dead people.\n\n\"Be Right Back\" explores the theme of grief; it is a melancholy story similar to the previous episode, \"[[The Entire History of You]]\". The episode received positive reviews, with the performances of Atwell and Gleeson receiving universal acclaim. Some critics believe it to be the best episode of ''Black Mirror'', though the ending was met with criticism. Several real-life artificial intelligence products have been compared to the one shown in the episode, including a Luka chatbot that was partially inspired by the episode.\n\n==Plot==\nMartha Powell ([[Hayley Atwell]]) and Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) are a young couple who have moved to Ash's remote family house in the countryside. The day after moving in, Ash is killed while returning the hire van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah ([[Sinead Matthews]]) talks about a new online service which helped her in a similar situation. Martha yells at her, but Sarah signs Martha up anyway. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries it out. Using all of Ash's past online communications and [[social media]] profiles, the service creates a new virtual \"Ash\". Starting out with [[instant messaging]], Martha uploads more videos and photos and begins to talk with the artificial Ash over the phone. Martha takes it on countryside walks, talking to it constantly while neglecting her sister's messages and calls.\n\nAt a checkup, Martha hears her child's heartbeat, and on her way out accidentally drops her phone and temporarily loses contact with the artificial Ash. After consoling her, the artificial Ash tells her about the service's experimental stage. Following his instructions, Martha turns a blank, synthetic body into an android that looks almost exactly identical to Ash. From the moment the android is activated, Martha is uncomfortable and struggles to accept its existence. Despite the android satisfying her sexually, she is concerned by his inability to sleep and absence of Ash's personality traits. One night, she orders the robot Ash to leave and is annoyed that he does so, as the real Ash would have resisted. The next morning, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders him to jump off. As he begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. The android begs for its own life. Martha screams.\n\nSeveral years later, it is Martha's daughter's (Indira Ainger) birthday. Martha keeps the Ash android locked in the attic and only allows her daughter to see the android on weekends, but she makes an exception for her birthday. Her daughter chats away to the android while Martha stands at the bottom of the attic steps, and forces herself to join them.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld9m8Xrpko0 Be Right Back]\"<br>The trailer for \"Be Right Back\".\n}}\n\"Be Right Back\" was the first episode of the second series of ''[[Black Mirror]]'', produced by Zeppotron for [[Endemol]].

A few months after the death of a person he knew, Brooker was removing unneeded contacts from his phone, and considered it to be \"weirdly disrespectful\" to delete their name. This idea later became an inspiration for \"Be Right Back\", along with another idea Brooker had when using [[Twitter]]: \"what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts?\"<ref name=\"TimeOut\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/tv-and-radio-guide/charlie-brooker-and-hayley-atwell-discuss-black-mirror|title=Charlie Brooker and Hayley Atwell discuss 'Black Mirror'|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|last=Tate|first=Gabriel|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the writing of \"Be Right Back\", Brooker had read about the 1960s artificial intelligence program [[ELIZA]], and how the creator's secretary was engaged in a very personal conversation with ELIZA within minutes of first testing it.<ref name=\"BFI\"/> Brooker also considered the inauthenticity of social media users, commenting in another interview that \"I found myself being inauthentic on there and it reminded me of writing columns for a newspaper\".<ref name=\"wired interview\"/> In 2013, Brooker said that he rationed his Twitter usage as it caused him unhappiness.<ref name=\"TimeOut\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|quote=Several years ago, someone I knew died, and a few months later I was going through my phone, making some space by deleting numbers. It felt weirdly disrespectful to delete this person's name. Then last year after we had a baby I spent a lot of time up late and on Twitter, thinking: what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts?

The couple took it in turns to watch the baby whilst the other slept, and Brooker wrote the episode during his shifts. The script was written quickly, and Brooker commented that having recently had a baby led the writing to be \"more soppy and emotional\" than it may otherwise have been.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = Be Right Back | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[British Film Institute]] panel, Brooker notes that the episode mirrors stages of [[internet dating]], progressing from text conversations to phone calls to real-life interactions, and believes the \"biggest leap\" to be the synthetic flesh version of Ash, while the rest is \"not that far-fetched\". Executive producer Annabel Jones compares the technology to [[mediumship]], as both are used for comfort.<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n\nAn unused idea for the episode was to emphasise the financial nature of the [[artificial intelligence]] company.

Harris describes Martha as a \"[[girl next door]]\" character, whose goal was to lead a \"simple life\" with Ash. Before filming, Atwell and Gleeson met at [[Dans le Noir]], a restaurant in which food is served in darkness.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nHarris wished to make the episode appear as if it could be possible in the near future, as if one could \"walk into the [[Macintosh|Mac]] store tomorrow and it wouldn't be out of place to see people trialling software like this\".<ref name=\"BFI\"/> Production designer Joel Collins said in 2018 that the technology is \"almost real now\", but \"seemed fantastical\" at the time.

Harris suggested a family dinner downstairs, but Brooker and Jones preferred for Martha to allow her daughter to see Ash once per week. Atwell described the ending as \"very pessimistic\", calling her character \"numb\" and perhaps \"medicated\". During filming for the final scene, Gleeson had begun to grow a beard for another project; though there was debate over whether the android could have a beard to mark the passage of time, it was removed in editing. This was a difficult and expensive process, as Ash has to talk and walk through shadows and light.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\n\"Be Right Back\" has grief as a central concept, according to Emily Yoshida of ''[[Grantland]]'' and [[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"grantland\">{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-4-be-right-back-death-and-the-realdoll/|title=Black Mirror Episode 4, 'Be Right Back': Death and the RealDoll|work=[[Grantland]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ew ranking\"/> Luke Owen of ''Flickering Myth'' summarised the episode as a \"sombre, low-key and all together depressing affair about grief and how people deal with it in different ways\",<ref name=\"flickering myth\"/> with Giles Harvey of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commenting on the episode's exploration of postmodern grief possibilities, suggesting that a targeted email to Martha about grief \"stands for an accumulation of such intrusive moments\u2014the death of solitude by a thousand digital cuts\".<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Other themes in the episode are also present. Ryan Lambie of ''Den of Geek'' believed the episode's theme to be \"technology's effects on relationships\".<ref name=\"dog review\"/> Johnston noted that in addition to grief, the episode explores how people behave in \"increasingly mediated public spaces\".<ref name=\"boston globe\"/>\n\nThe episode was described by Brooker as \"a ghost story\"<ref name=\"wired interview\"/> and many critics have commented on its tone. David Sims of ''[[The A.V.

According to Lambie, Ash is \"an affectionate boyfriend\" and Martha is \"blissfully in love\", though Ash is easily distracted by his phone; Martha and Ash only appear together in a few scenes, but we see their love through \"little in-jokes, shared love of cheesy 70s tunes and childhood memories\".<ref name=\"dog review\"/> Bojalad wrote that they are \"one of the most realistically comfortable and happy couples\" in the series,<ref name=\"dog Bojalad\"/> and Owen agreed, writing that though the relationship has little screentime, the audience feel \"an instant connection with them\".<ref name=\"flickering myth\"/> These scenes are later mirrored: examples include the android Ash disliking the [[Bee Gees]] and engaging in sex that feels \"robotic\".<ref name=\"DS\"/> Ash's cause of death is \"neither clear nor important\", though Sims and Sancto thought that it relates to him checking his phone while driving.<ref name=\"avclub\"/><ref name=\"paste\"/>\n\nYoshida said that the presence of the android Ash is \"menacing\" though he has a \"docile\" demeanour, further commenting that Martha is unable to resist him, despite her repulsion at the situation.<ref name=\"grantland\"/> Sims stated that the replica of Ash is \"self-aware\", as it \"knows it cannot replace Ash fully\". Sims also described the robotic Ash as \"like a lost puppy\" who follows Martha obediently.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Swain noted this non-humanness, too, writing that though the android Ash is witty, his personality lacks meaning,<ref name=\"huffpost\"/> with Morgan Jeffery of ''[[Digital Spy]]'' calling him \"hollow\" and commenting that he is missing \"so much of what made Ash the man he was\".<ref name=\"DS\"/> Logan said the episode is about \"the intangibles of humanness that make up the people we love\".<ref name=\"inverse\"/> Sutcliffe believed the robotic Ash fails as a replacement because humans miss their loved ones' \"sourness\" as well as their \"sweetness\".<ref name=\"independent\"/>\n\n===Comparisons to other media===\n[[Image:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|alt=Black and white image of a monstrous man with a bolt through his neck|thumb|upright|The episode has been compared to Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', with the artificial Ash paralleling [[Frankenstein's monster]].]]\nIn contrast to the previous series opener, \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", Brooker described \"Be Right Back\" as \"more earnest than people might expect\" as well as \"melancholy\" and \"very intimate and personal\".<ref name=\"DS interview\"/> Lambie made similar comments.<ref name=\"dog review\"/> Lambie and Jeffery both compared the episode to \"The Entire History of You\", an episode from the first series written by [[Jesse Armstrong]].<ref name=\"dog review\"/><ref name=\"DS\"/> Yoshida noted that \"The Entire History of You\" begins with Liam obsessing over a job interview, which he is able to replay through his grain device.

It was written by series creator and showrunner [[Charlie Brooker]], directed by [[Owen Harris (director)|Owen Harris]], and first aired on [[Channel 4]] on 11 February 2013.\n\nThe episode tells the story of Martha ([[Hayley Atwell]]), a young woman whose boyfriend Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) is killed in a car accident. As she mourns him, she discovers that technology now allows her to communicate with an artificial intelligence imitating Ash, and reluctantly decides to try it. \"Be Right Back\" had two sources of inspiration: the question of whether to delete a dead friend's phone number from one's contacts, and the idea that [[Twitter]] posts could be made by software mimicking dead people.\n\n\"Be Right Back\" explores the theme of grief; it is a melancholy story similar to the previous episode, \"[[The Entire History of You]]\". The episode received positive reviews, with the performances of Atwell and Gleeson receiving universal acclaim. Some critics believe it to be the best episode of ''Black Mirror'', though the ending was met with criticism. Several real-life artificial intelligence products have been compared to the one shown in the episode, including a Luka chatbot that was partially inspired by the episode.\n\n==Plot==\nMartha Powell ([[Hayley Atwell]]) and Ash Starmer ([[Domhnall Gleeson]]) are a young couple who have moved to Ash's remote family house in the countryside. The day after moving in, Ash is killed while returning the hire van. At the funeral, Martha's friend Sarah ([[Sinead Matthews]]) talks about a new online service which helped her in a similar situation. Martha yells at her, but Sarah signs Martha up anyway. After discovering she is pregnant, Martha reluctantly tries it out. Using all of Ash's past online communications and [[social media]] profiles, the service creates a new virtual \"Ash\". Starting out with [[instant messaging]], Martha uploads more videos and photos and begins to talk with the artificial Ash over the phone. Martha takes it on countryside walks, talking to it constantly while neglecting her sister's messages and calls.\n\nAt a checkup, Martha hears her child's heartbeat, and on her way out accidentally drops her phone and temporarily loses contact with the artificial Ash. After consoling her, the artificial Ash tells her about the service's experimental stage. Following his instructions, Martha turns a blank, synthetic body into an android that looks almost exactly identical to Ash. From the moment the android is activated, Martha is uncomfortable and struggles to accept its existence. Despite the android satisfying her sexually, she is concerned by his inability to sleep and absence of Ash's personality traits. One night, she orders the robot Ash to leave and is annoyed that he does so, as the real Ash would have resisted. The next morning, Martha takes the artificial Ash to a cliff and orders him to jump off. As he begins to follow the order, Martha expresses her frustration that Ash would not have simply obeyed. The android begs for its own life. Martha screams.\n\nSeveral years later, it is Martha's daughter's (Indira Ainger) birthday. Martha keeps the Ash android locked in the attic and only allows her daughter to see the android on weekends, but she makes an exception for her birthday. Her daughter chats away to the android while Martha stands at the bottom of the attic steps, and forces herself to join them.\n\n==Production==\n{{external media\n|video1 = \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld9m8Xrpko0 Be Right Back]\"<br>The trailer for \"Be Right Back\".\n}}\n\"Be Right Back\" was the first episode of the second series of ''[[Black Mirror]]'', produced by Zeppotron for [[Endemol]].

A few months after the death of a person he knew, Brooker was removing unneeded contacts from his phone, and considered it to be \"weirdly disrespectful\" to delete their name. This idea later became an inspiration for \"Be Right Back\", along with another idea Brooker had when using [[Twitter]]: \"what if these people were dead and it was software emulating their thoughts?\"<ref name=\"TimeOut\">{{cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/london/tv-and-radio-guide/charlie-brooker-and-hayley-atwell-discuss-black-mirror|title=Charlie Brooker and Hayley Atwell discuss 'Black Mirror'|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|last=Tate|first=Gabriel|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the writing of \"Be Right Back\", Brooker had read about the 1960s artificial intelligence program [[ELIZA]], and how the creator's secretary was engaged in a very personal conversation with ELIZA within minutes of first testing it.<ref name=\"BFI\"/> Brooker also considered the inauthenticity of social media users, commenting in another interview that \"I found myself being inauthentic on there and it reminded me of writing columns for a newspaper\".<ref name=\"wired interview\"/> In 2013, Brooker said that he rationed his Twitter usage as it caused him unhappiness.<ref name=\"TimeOut\"/>\n\n{{Quote box|quote=Several years ago, someone I knew died, and a few months later I was going through my phone, making some space by deleting numbers.

The couple took it in turns to watch the baby whilst the other slept, and Brooker wrote the episode during his shifts. The script was written quickly, and Brooker commented that having recently had a baby led the writing to be \"more soppy and emotional\" than it may otherwise have been.<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | chapter = Be Right Back | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>\n\nIn a [[British Film Institute]] panel, Brooker notes that the episode mirrors stages of [[internet dating]], progressing from text conversations to phone calls to real-life interactions, and believes the \"biggest leap\" to be the synthetic flesh version of Ash, while the rest is \"not that far-fetched\". Executive producer Annabel Jones compares the technology to [[mediumship]], as both are used for comfort.<ref name=\"BFI\"/>\n\nAn unused idea for the episode was to emphasise the financial nature of the [[artificial intelligence]] company.

Harris describes Martha as a \"[[girl next door]]\" character, whose goal was to lead a \"simple life\" with Ash. Before filming, Atwell and Gleeson met at [[Dans le Noir]], a restaurant in which food is served in darkness.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\nHarris wished to make the episode appear as if it could be possible in the near future, as if one could \"walk into the [[Macintosh|Mac]] store tomorrow and it wouldn't be out of place to see people trialling software like this\".<ref name=\"BFI\"/> Production designer Joel Collins said in 2018 that the technology is \"almost real now\", but \"seemed fantastical\" at the time. The petrol station has \"micro cars\", which Collins suggests are [[electric car]]s that could be a part of a \"simple, small, eco-friendly\" future.<ref name=\"ibm\"/> A touch-screen easel is shown briefly in the episode. Brooker commented that \"the design team had a field day with that easel\" and that they suggested copyrighting the idea.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/22/charlie-brooker-black-mirror_n_6508790.html|title='Black Mirror' Intends To 'Actively Unsettle' Audiences, But It's Not Technology That You Should Fear|last=Duca|first=Lauren|work=[[Huffington Post]]|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=16 December 2017}}</ref> Brooker wished to avoid a trope of \"histrionic\" technology interfaces in television, using more subtle cues such as Martha deleting an email on her touch-free laptop with a simple hand movement. One email sent to Martha is a targeted advertisement for books about dealing with grief.<ref name=\"New Yorker\">{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror|title=The Speculative Dread of \"Black Mirror\"|last=Harvey|first=Giles|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=28 November 2016|accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nHarris has said that different endings were discussed, but that \"I think we pretty much ended up where we'd started\". Harris suggested a family dinner downstairs, but Brooker and Jones preferred for Martha to allow her daughter to see Ash once per week. Atwell described the ending as \"very pessimistic\", calling her character \"numb\" and perhaps \"medicated\". During filming for the final scene, Gleeson had begun to grow a beard for another project; though there was debate over whether the android could have a beard to mark the passage of time, it was removed in editing. This was a difficult and expensive process, as Ash has to talk and walk through shadows and light.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\n\"Be Right Back\" has grief as a central concept, according to Emily Yoshida of ''[[Grantland]]'' and [[James Hibberd (writer)|James Hibberd]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.<ref name=\"grantland\">{{cite web|url=http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/black-mirror-episode-4-be-right-back-death-and-the-realdoll/|title=Black Mirror Episode 4, 'Be Right Back': Death and the RealDoll|work=[[Grantland]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|last=Yoshida|first=Emily|date=4 December 2013|accessdate=17 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"ew ranking\"/> Luke Owen of ''Flickering Myth'' summarised the episode as a \"sombre, low-key and all together depressing affair about grief and how people deal with it in different ways\",<ref name=\"flickering myth\"/> with Giles Harvey of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' commenting on the episode's exploration of postmodern grief possibilities, suggesting that a targeted email to Martha about grief \"stands for an accumulation of such intrusive moments\u2014the death of solitude by a thousand digital cuts\".<ref name=\"New Yorker\"/> Other themes in the episode are also present. Ryan Lambie of ''Den of Geek'' believed the episode's theme to be \"technology's effects on relationships\".<ref name=\"dog review\"/> Johnston noted that in addition to grief, the episode explores how people behave in \"increasingly mediated public spaces\".<ref name=\"boston globe\"/>\n\nThe episode was described by Brooker as \"a ghost story\"<ref name=\"wired interview\"/> and many critics have commented on its tone. David Sims of ''[[The A.V.

The small mushroom is characterized by its grooved, grayish-brown to violet-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the slender grayish-brown to reddish-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] covered with minute, fine, soft hairs. The mushroom produces [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores (spores that stain when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]). Microscopic distinguishing features include the smooth, spindle-shaped cheilocystidia and pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge and face, respectively) and the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] elements in the outer layer of the cap and the stem.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\n''Mycena lanuginosa'' was first collected by Haruki Takahashi in 2000, and published as a new species in 2007, along with seven other Japanese ''Mycena'' species. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''lanuginosa'', meaning \"lanugineous\", referring to the hairy stem. The Japanese name for the mushroom is ''Keashi-haiirotake'' (\u30b1\u30a2\u30b7\u30cf\u30a4\u30a4\u30ed\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\nThe fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fragilipedes'' (Fr.)

It is dry, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water). The surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap is dark brown at the center, and gradually changes to reddish-brown and finally to nearly white at the margin. The white [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 0.5&nbsp;mm thick, and does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The slender [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|30|to|60|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.8|to|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, attached to the center of the cap, hollow, and dry. The top portion of the stem is pruinose, while near the base the surface is covered with soft, fine hairs. The stem color is grayish-brown to reddish-brown near the top, changing to reddish-brown near the bottom. The stem base is covered with long, fairly coarse, whitish fibrils. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly attached to the stem, distantly spaced (12\u201318 gills reach the stem), up to 1.5&nbsp;mm broad, thin, and whitish, with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spores]] are roughly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, thin-walled, colorless, and measure 10\u201312 by 5.5\u20136.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are [[amyloid]], meaning they will [[staining|stain]] blue to black when treated with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 35\u201342 by 7\u20139&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, four-spored, and have clamps at their bases.  The abundant cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are thin-walled, and measure 40\u201380 by 5\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m. The smooth, colorless, and thin-walled spindle-shaped cells sometimes come to an abruptly tapering point; they form a sterile gill edge. Like the cheilocystidia, the pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are also spindle-shaped, abundant, smooth and thin-walled; they measure 63\u2013102 by 8\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue (tissue of the [[hymenium]]-bearing structure) is made of smooth, thin-walled element hyphae that are 3\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, roughly cylindrical (often inflated), [[hyaline]] (translucent), and dextrinoid (turning reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, and cylindrical. They can be either smooth, or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like thin-walled brownish [[diverticulum|diverticulae]]. The underlying hyphae have a parallel arrangement, and are hyaline or brownish, dextrinoid, with short and inflated cells that are up to 35&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae measuring 3\u20136&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. These hyphae, as well as the terminal cells (caulocystidia), have characteristics similar to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The flesh of the stem is composed of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae that are 6\u201320&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, smooth, hyaline, and [[dextrinoid]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the cortical layer of cap and stem, and at the basal septa of the basidia.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n''M.&nbsp;lanuginosa'' closely resembles ''[[Mycena pilosella|M.&nbsp;pilosella]]'', a species originally described from Netherlands by Maas Geesteranus,<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1988/> and the European species ''[[Mycena zephirus|M.&nbsp;zephirus]]''; both are in the section ''Fragilipedes''. ''Mycena pilosella'' differs in several microscopic characteristics: it has densely diverticulate elements of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]]; long, cylindrical caulocystidia that diverge at a right angle; and it does not have pleurocystidia. ''Mycena zephirus'' is distinct in forming a whitish cap, a stem that is initially minutely hairly but later becomes smooth, radish-like odor, ellipsoid to cylindrical spores, and cheilocystidia with branches near the tip.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena lanuginosa'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], in [[Honshu]], Japan.

The dark brown irregularly wrinkled [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] measures up to {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The cap is supported by a thin [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, which is covered at the base by a whitish hairlike growth, and attached to white, cord-like [[rhizomorph]]s\u2014aggregations of [[mycelium]] that resemble plant roots. The underside of the cap features thin, distantly spaced grayish [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that have distinct veins running between them. At a microscopic level, distinguishing characteristics include the [[inamyloid]] spores (turning dark blue to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]), the club-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edges) with finger-like appendages, the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] cells in the outer layer of cap and stem, and the presence of [[clamp connection]]s.\n\n==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==\n''Mycena nidificata'' was first collected in 2000 by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi, and reported as new along with seven other Mycenas in a 2007 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''nidificata'', meaning \"nidificate\"\u2014\"to make a nest\". Its Japanese name is ''Yamiiro-kunugitake'' (\u30e4\u30df\u30a4\u30ed\u30af\u30cc\u30ae\u30bf\u30b1).<ref name=Takahashi2007/>\n\nAccording to Takahashi, the inamyloid spores, the diverticulate [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] hyphae, and the dark [[pigment]] in the gill hyphae suggest that the fungus is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Hiemales'' of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''. Because of its medium-sized, partly collybioid fruit bodies (i.e., small to medium-sized with white [[spore print]]s and convex caps, similar to species once placed in the genus ''[[Collybia]]''), the white cord-like [[rhizomorph]]s, and its distinctly intervenose gills, it has an isolated position within the section.<ref name=Takahashi2007/>\n\n==Description==\n\nThe [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially conical to convex to bell-shaped, then flattened in age, ultimately reaching {{convert|10|to|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The center of the cap is irregularly wrinkled to pitted, but less so toward the grooved margin. It is [[hygrophanous]] (changing color as it loses or absorbs water), dry, initially pruinose (covered with what appears to be a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The color is blackish-brown at the center, dark brown to reddish-brown farther outward, and becoming much paler at the margin; sometimes the cap is evenly dark brown. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 1&nbsp;mm thick and white, and does not have any distinctive taste and odor. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|40|to|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.5|to|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} wide, cylindrical, slightly enlarged at the base, central, slender, and hollow. The stem surface is dry, pruinose over the entire length, and does not become smooth with age. It is pale brownish at the top, and gradually becomes dark brown toward the base. The base is covered with a white [[mycelium|mycelial]] hairlike growth (a [[Trichome#Plant trichomes|tomentum]]) that is attached to white cord-like [[rhizomorph]]s on the substratum. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are fused to the stem, and distantly spaced, with between 15 and 18 gills reaching the stem. The gills are up to 2.5&nbsp;mm broad, thin, grayish, and have distinct veins running between them. The gill edges are the same color as the gill faces.<ref name=Takahashi2007/>\n\n===Microscopic characteristics===\nThe [[spore]]s are roughly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] and measure 8\u201311 by 5\u20136&nbsp;[[micrometre|\u00b5m]]. They are smooth, colorless, [[inamyloid]], and thin-walled. The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are 28\u201335 by 7\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m, club-shaped, and mostly four-spored. The abundant cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are club-shaped, measure 30\u201345 by 10\u201315&nbsp;\u00b5m, and form a sterile gill edge. They have several irregularly cylindrical to knob-like apical appendages measuring 3\u201311 by 2\u20135&nbsp;\u00b5m, which are colorless and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent in ''M.&nbsp;nidificata''. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] ([[hymenium]]-bearing) tissue is made of smooth, thin-walled [[hypha]]e that are 6\u201326&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical (but often inflated), and contain brownish [[pigment]] in the [[cytoplasm]]. These hyphae are dextrinoid, meaning they will turn reddish to reddish-brown in the presence of Melzer's reagent. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3\u201310&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, cylindrical. The hyphae are smooth or covered with scattered, warty or finger-like [[diverticulum|diverticulae]]. Under the cap cuticle is a layer of parallel hyphae containing cytoplasmic brownish pigment. The hyphae are dextrinoid, and contain short and inflated cells that are up to 40&nbsp;\u00b5m wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae 3\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, which are similar in appearance to the hyphae of the cap cuticle. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are relatively sporadic; they are cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless, thin-walled, and measure 45\u201360 by 4\u20138&nbsp;\u00b5m. The stem tissue is composed of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae that are 10\u201325&nbsp;\u00b5m wide, dextrinoid, smooth, and have cytoplasmic brownish pigment. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the stem tissues, and at the [[septum|septa]] at the bases of the basidia.<ref name=Takahashi2007/>\n\n===Similar species===\n\n''[[Mycena granulifera]]'', a species originally described from Brazil, is comparable to ''M.&nbsp;nidificata'' in having inamyloid spores, club-shaped cheilocystidia with finger-like outgrowths, and diverticulate cap cuticle hyphae. ''M.&nbsp;granulifera'' differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. ''Mycena nidificata'' also bears some resemblance to the European species ''[[Mycena flos-nivium|M.&nbsp;flos-nivium]]'', which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs.<ref name=Takahashi2007/>\n\n==Habitat and distribution==\n''Mycena nidificata'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan.
