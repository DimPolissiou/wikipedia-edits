The party has set many fundamental policies of Finnish society during its representation in the [[Finnish Government]]. Founded in 1899, the SDP is Finland's oldest active political party. The SDP has a close relationship with Finland's largest trade union confederation, [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]], and is a member of the [[Socialist International]], the [[Party of European Socialists]], and [[SAMAK]].\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Antti Rinne]] in December 2019, [[Sanna Marin]] became the country's 67th [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]]. SDP formed a new [[Marin Cabinet|coalition government]] on the basis of [[Rinne Cabinet|its predecessor]], in effect continuing cooperation with the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], the [[Green League]], the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]]. Seven of the government's nineteen ministers are Social Democrats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/rinne/ministers|title=Ministers|website=Valtioneuvosto|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Emblem of the SDP of Finland.svg|200px|thumb|The traditional emblem of the party]]\nThe SDP was founded as the Finnish Labour Party ({{lang-fi|Suomen Ty\u00f6v\u00e4enpuolue}}) in 1899. The name was changed to the present form in 1903. SDP was closely associated with the [[Finnish Trade Union Federation]] (SAJ), established in 1907, as all of its members were also members of the party.<ref>Tepora, Tuomas & Roselius, Aapo: ''The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy'', p. 32. Brill Academic Publishers, 2014. {{ISBN|978-900-42436-6-8}}.</ref> The party remained a chiefly extra-parliamentary movement until [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906 (before Finland's independence from Russia in 1917), after which the SDP's share of the [[vote]]s reached 47% in [[1916 Finnish parliamentary election|1916]], when the party secured a [[majority government|majority]] in the parliament &mdash; the only time in the history of Finland when one party has had such a majority. The party lost its majority in the 1917 election, and in 1918 it started a rebellion that escalated into the [[Finnish Civil War]].\n\nSDP members declared Finland a [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Socialist Republic]], but were defeated by the forces of [[White Guard (Finland)|the Finnish Senate]]. The war resulted in most of the party leaders being killed, imprisoned or left to seek refuge in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In addition, the process leading to the Civil War and the war itself had stripped the party of its [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] and respectability in the eyes of the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] majority. However, the political support for the party remained strong, and in the [[1919 Finnish parliamentary election|election of 1919]], the party, reorganised by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]], received 80 of the 200 seats of the parliament. Former exiled SDP members founded the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in [[Moscow]] in 1918. Although the Communist Party was banned in Finland until 1944, it was represented by front organizations, leading to the support of the Finnish [[working class]] being divided between the communist party and the SDP.\n\nIt became the life's work of V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner to re-establish the SDP as a serious, governing party. The result was a much more [[patriotism|patriotic]] SDP, which leaned less to the left and was relatively isolated from its [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sister parties the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|the SD in Denmark]], and [[Labour Party (Norway)|the Norwegian Labour Party]]. President [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's]] animosity kept the SDP out of government during [[List of presidents of Finland|his presidency]] from 1931 to 1937. With the exception of a brief period in 1926, when Tanner formed a minority government, SDP was excluded from cabinet participation until [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] was elected president in 1937. During [[World War II]] the party played a central role in a series of broad coalition cabinets, symbolising national unity forged in response to the threat of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Winter War]] in 1939\u20131940.\n\nThe SDP was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] from 1923 to 1940.<ref>Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985.</ref>\n\nDuring the first few months of the [[Continuation War]] (1941\u20131944), the country, the parliament, and the cabinet were divided on the question of whether Finland's army should stop at the old border and thereby demonstratively refrain from any attempt of conquests. However, the country's dangerous position called for national unity, and the SDP's leadership chose to refrain from any visible protests. This decision is sometimes indicated as one of the main reasons behind the post-war division between the main left-wing parties &mdash; the SDP and the Communists &mdash; and the high percentage of Communist voters in the first elections after the Continuation War.\n\nAfter the Continuation War, the Communist Party was allowed to continue working, and the main feature of Finnish political life during the 1944\u20131949 period was the competition between the Social Democrats and the Communists, both for voters and for the control of the labor unions. During this time, the political field was divided roughly equally between the Social Democrats, Communists and the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], each party commanding some 25% of the vote. In the post-war era, the Social Democratic Party adopted a line defending Finnish sovereignty and democracy in line with the Agrarian League and other [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] political parties, finally leading to the expulsion of the Communists from the cabinet in 1948. However,  the [[Soviet Union]] remained more openly critical towards the SDP than the centre-right parties.\n\n[[Image:Sdpmunicipal1933.jpg|frame|SDP municipal election poster from 1933. \"Municipal power to those who work\"]]\n\nBecause of the SDP's [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] activities, the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] supported the party by means of funds laundered through Nordic sister parties, or through organizations that bought \"luxury goods\" such as [[coffee]] abroad, then imported and sold them for a high profit, as post-war [[rationing]] served to inflate prices.\n\nIn the [[1956 Finnish presidential election|presidential election of 1956]], the SDP candidate [[Karl-August Fagerholm]] lost by only one electoral vote to [[Urho Kekkonen]]. Fagerholm would act as Prime Minister in the [[Fagerholm I Cabinet]], which ran from 1956 to 1957, and the [[Fagerholm II Cabinet]], which ran from 1958 to 1959. The latter cabinet was forced to resign due to Soviet pressure, leading to a series of cabinets led by the Agrarian League. In 1958, due to the election of [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]] as party chairman, a faction of the SDP resigned and formed the ''Alliance of Finnish Workers and Small Farmers'' ([[Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders|TPSL]]) around the former SDP chairman [[Emil Skog]]. The dispute was over several issues, namely: whether the party should function as an interest group, and whether it should co-operate with the anti-communists and right-wingers, or with president Kekkonen, the Agrarians and the Communists. During the 1960s, the TPSL dwindled, its members returning one by one to the SDP or joining the Communists. The founder himself, Emil Skog, returned to the SDP in 1965. In the [[1970 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 1970]], the TPSL failed to gain any seats in parliament.\n\nOnly in 1966 was the SDP able to satisfy the Soviet Union about its friendly attitude towards it, and could thus return to the cabinet. Since then, the SDP has been represented in most Finnish cabinets, often cooperating with the [[centrism|centrist]]-[[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (formerly the Agrarian League), but sometimes with the [[liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] [[National Coalition Party]]. The SDP was in opposition from 1991 to 1995, when the main parties in the cabinet were the Centre Party and the National Coalition Party.\n\nThe [[1995 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 1995]] saw a landslide victory for the SDP, achieving their best results since [[World War II]]. The SDP rose to government from the opposition, and leader [[Paavo Lipponen]] headed two consecutive cabinets from 1995 to 2003. During this time, the party adopted a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] stance and contributed actively to the Finnish membership in the [[European Union]] in 1995 in concert with the cabinet. In the [[2003 Finnish parliamentary election|2003 parliamentary election]], the SDP won 53 of the 200 seats, ending up a close second to the Centre Party. As a result, Lipponen became the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of parliament]], and the Centre Party leader [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]] became the new [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]], leading [[J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki Cabinet|a coalition cabinet that included the SDP]], which got eight ministerial posts. After two months in office, J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki resigned due to [[Iraq leak|a scandal relating to the Iraq leak]] and was replaced by [[Matti Vanhanen]], another Centre Party representative, who commanded the [[Vanhanen I Cabinet]].\n\n=== Recent elections ===\n[[File:Finnish Council Presidency priorities debated in plenary (48308299127) (cropped).jpg|thumb|SDP's leader, [[Antti Rinne]]]]\n[[File:Eduskuntavaalit 2011 - Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue.svg|thumb|Support for the Social Democrats by municipality in the 2011 parliamentary election \u2014 the party fared strongest in southern and eastern parts of the country.]]\n\nIn the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the SDP gained the third-most votes. The chairman of the then-largest [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], became the [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]], and formed [[Vanhanen II Cabinet|a coalition cabinet]] consisting of the National Coalition Party, the [[Green League]], and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]], leaving the SDP to the opposition. SDP leader [[Eero Hein\u00e4luoma]] did not immediately resign as party chairman, but he did announce his withdrawal from running for party chairman in the following party conference. He was replaced by [[Jutta Urpilainen]]. The SDP suffered further losses in the 2008 municipal election and the [[2009 European Parliament election in Finland|2009 European Parliament election]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], the SDP lost three more seats, ending up with 19.1 percent of the vote which corresponded to 42 seats, the party's worst-ever result. However, as the Centre Party lost even more voters, the SDP became the second-largest party in the country after the National Coalition Party, receiving only some 1,500 votes more than the [[Finns Party]], which came in third. After lengthy negotiations, a six-party coalition government, the [[Katainen Cabinet]], was formed with the National Coalition Party and the Social Democrats as the two main parties. SDP leader Jutta Urpilainen became the cabinet's [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|Minister of Finance]], with NCP chairman [[Jyrki Katainen]] serving as [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]].\n\nIn 2014 party conference, Urpilainen was narrowly defeated by her challenger, [[Antti Rinne]], in a 257 to 243 vote.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/antti_rinne_on_sdpn_uusi_puheenjohtaja/7230581|title=Antti Rinne on SDP:n uusi puheenjohtaja |publisher=Yle |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> Urpilainen subsequently stepped down as the Minister of Finance, passing the seat on to Rinne.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000002734872.html|title=Antti Rinteest\u00e4 uusi valtiovarainministeri |work=Helsingin Sanomat |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the drop of support continued for the SDP. The party lost eight more seats compared to the 2011 election, ending up with 34 seats and 16.5 percent of the vote. With the repeat of the worst-ever result, the SDP dropped to being the fourth largest political party in Finland, receiving 50,110 fewer votes than the National Coalition Party, yet 237,000 more votes than the [[Green League]]. SDP was left in the opposition, and provided extensive criticism on the actions of the [[Sipil\u00e4 Cabinet]] on matters such as alcohol policy, cuts to education spending, and the so-called active model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9983941|title=Eduskunta hyv\u00e4ksyi ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalain aktiivimalleineen \u2013 Teollisuusliitto tuomitsee ja v\u00e4l\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 lakkoa|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref> On 22 June 2016 Maria Tolppanen, a [[Finns Party]] representative, joined the SDP.

the largest party in [[Finland|Finland's]] [[Parliament of Finland|parliament]] with 40 seats. The party has set many fundamental policies of Finnish society during its representation in the [[Finnish Government]]. Founded in 1899, the SDP is Finland's oldest active political party. The SDP has a close relationship with Finland's largest trade union confederation, [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]], and is a member of the [[Socialist International]], the [[Party of European Socialists]], and [[SAMAK]].\n\nFollowing the resignation of [[Antti Rinne]] in December 2019, [[Sanna Marin]] became the country's 67th [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]]. SDP formed a new [[Marin Cabinet|coalition government]] on the basis of [[Rinne Cabinet|its predecessor]], in effect continuing cooperation with the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], the [[Green League]], the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]]. Seven of the government's nineteen ministers are Social Democrats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://valtioneuvosto.fi/en/rinne/ministers|title=Ministers|website=Valtioneuvosto|language=en-US|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Emblem of the SDP of Finland.svg|200px|thumb|The traditional emblem of the party]]\nThe SDP was founded as the Finnish Labour Party ({{lang-fi|Suomen Ty\u00f6v\u00e4enpuolue}}) in 1899. The name was changed to the present form in 1903. SDP was closely associated with the [[Finnish Trade Union Federation]] (SAJ), established in 1907, as all of its members were also members of the party.<ref>Tepora, Tuomas & Roselius, Aapo: ''The Finnish Civil War 1918: History, Memory, Legacy'', p. 32. Brill Academic Publishers, 2014. {{ISBN|978-900-42436-6-8}}.</ref> The party remained a chiefly extra-parliamentary movement until [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906 (before Finland's independence from Russia in 1917), after which the SDP's share of the [[vote]]s reached 47% in [[1916 Finnish parliamentary election|1916]], when the party secured a [[majority government|majority]] in the parliament &mdash; the only time in the history of Finland when one party has had such a majority. The party lost its majority in the 1917 election, and in 1918 it started a rebellion that escalated into the [[Finnish Civil War]].\n\nSDP members declared Finland a [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Socialist Republic]], but were defeated by the forces of [[White Guard (Finland)|the Finnish Senate]]. The war resulted in most of the party leaders being killed, imprisoned or left to seek refuge in [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In addition, the process leading to the Civil War and the war itself had stripped the party of its [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] and respectability in the eyes of the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] majority. However, the political support for the party remained strong, and in the [[1919 Finnish parliamentary election|election of 1919]], the party, reorganised by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]], received 80 of the 200 seats of the parliament. Former exiled SDP members founded the [[Communist Party of Finland]] in [[Moscow]] in 1918. Although the Communist Party was banned in Finland until 1944, it was represented by front organizations, leading to the support of the Finnish [[working class]] being divided between the communist party and the SDP.\n\nIt became the life's work of V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner to re-establish the SDP as a serious, governing party. The result was a much more [[patriotism|patriotic]] SDP, which leaned less to the left and was relatively isolated from its [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] sister parties the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|the SD in Denmark]], and [[Labour Party (Norway)|the Norwegian Labour Party]]. President [[Pehr Evind Svinhufvud|Pehr Evind Svinhufvud's]] animosity kept the SDP out of government during [[List of presidents of Finland|his presidency]] from 1931 to 1937. With the exception of a brief period in 1926, when Tanner formed a minority government, SDP was excluded from cabinet participation until [[Ky\u00f6sti Kallio]] was elected president in 1937. During [[World War II]] the party played a central role in a series of broad coalition cabinets, symbolising national unity forged in response to the threat of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] in the [[Winter War]] in 1939\u20131940.\n\nThe SDP was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] from 1923 to 1940.<ref>Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985.</ref>\n\nDuring the first few months of the [[Continuation War]] (1941\u20131944), the country, the parliament, and the cabinet were divided on the question of whether Finland's army should stop at the old border and thereby demonstratively refrain from any attempt of conquests. However, the country's dangerous position called for national unity, and the SDP's leadership chose to refrain from any visible protests. This decision is sometimes indicated as one of the main reasons behind the post-war division between the main left-wing parties &mdash; the SDP and the Communists &mdash; and the high percentage of Communist voters in the first elections after the Continuation War.\n\nAfter the Continuation War, the Communist Party was allowed to continue working, and the main feature of Finnish political life during the 1944\u20131949 period was the competition between the Social Democrats and the Communists, both for voters and for the control of the labor unions. During this time, the political field was divided roughly equally between the Social Democrats, Communists and the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Agrarian League]], each party commanding some 25% of the vote. In the post-war era, the Social Democratic Party adopted a line defending Finnish sovereignty and democracy in line with the Agrarian League and other [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] political parties, finally leading to the expulsion of the Communists from the cabinet in 1948. However,  the [[Soviet Union]] remained more openly critical towards the SDP than the centre-right parties.\n\n[[Image:Sdpmunicipal1933.jpg|frame|SDP municipal election poster from 1933. \"Municipal power to those who work\"]]\n\nBecause of the SDP's [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] activities, the [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]] supported the party by means of funds laundered through Nordic sister parties, or through organizations that bought \"luxury goods\" such as [[coffee]] abroad, then imported and sold them for a high profit, as post-war [[rationing]] served to inflate prices.\n\nIn the [[1956 Finnish presidential election|presidential election of 1956]], the SDP candidate [[Karl-August Fagerholm]] lost by only one electoral vote to [[Urho Kekkonen]]. Fagerholm would act as Prime Minister in the [[Fagerholm I Cabinet]], which ran from 1956 to 1957, and the [[Fagerholm II Cabinet]], which ran from 1958 to 1959. The latter cabinet was forced to resign due to Soviet pressure, leading to a series of cabinets led by the Agrarian League. In 1958, due to the election of [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Tanner]] as party chairman, a faction of the SDP resigned and formed the ''Alliance of Finnish Workers and Small Farmers'' ([[Social Democratic Union of Workers and Smallholders|TPSL]]) around the former SDP chairman [[Emil Skog]]. The dispute was over several issues, namely: whether the party should function as an interest group, and whether it should co-operate with the anti-communists and right-wingers, or with president Kekkonen, the Agrarians and the Communists. During the 1960s, the TPSL dwindled, its members returning one by one to the SDP or joining the Communists. The founder himself, Emil Skog, returned to the SDP in 1965. In the [[1970 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 1970]], the TPSL failed to gain any seats in parliament.\n\nOnly in 1966 was the SDP able to satisfy the Soviet Union about its friendly attitude towards it, and could thus return to the cabinet. Since then, the SDP has been represented in most Finnish cabinets, often cooperating with the [[centrism|centrist]]-[[agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (formerly the Agrarian League), but sometimes with the [[liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] [[National Coalition Party]]. The SDP was in opposition from 1991 to 1995, when the main parties in the cabinet were the Centre Party and the National Coalition Party.\n\nThe [[1995 Finnish parliamentary election|parliamentary election of 1995]] saw a landslide victory for the SDP, achieving their best results since [[World War II]]. The SDP rose to government from the opposition, and leader [[Paavo Lipponen]] headed two consecutive cabinets from 1995 to 2003. During this time, the party adopted a [[Pro-Europeanism|pro-European]] stance and contributed actively to the Finnish membership in the [[European Union]] in 1995 in concert with the cabinet. In the [[2003 Finnish parliamentary election|2003 parliamentary election]], the SDP won 53 of the 200 seats, ending up a close second to the Centre Party. As a result, Lipponen became the [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of parliament]], and the Centre Party leader [[Anneli J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki]] became the new [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]], leading [[J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki Cabinet|a coalition cabinet that included the SDP]], which got eight ministerial posts. After two months in office, J\u00e4\u00e4tteenm\u00e4ki resigned due to [[Iraq leak|a scandal relating to the Iraq leak]] and was replaced by [[Matti Vanhanen]], another Centre Party representative, who commanded the [[Vanhanen I Cabinet]].\n\n=== Recent elections ===\n[[File:Finnish Council Presidency priorities debated in plenary (48308299127) (cropped).jpg|thumb|SDP's leader, [[Antti Rinne]]]]\n[[File:Eduskuntavaalit 2011 - Suomen Sosialidemokraattinen Puolue.svg|thumb|Support for the Social Democrats by municipality in the 2011 parliamentary election \u2014 the party fared strongest in southern and eastern parts of the country.]]\n\nIn the [[2007 Finnish parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary election]], the SDP gained the third-most votes. The chairman of the then-largest [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], [[Matti Vanhanen]], became the [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]], and formed [[Vanhanen II Cabinet|a coalition cabinet]] consisting of the National Coalition Party, the [[Green League]], and the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland|Swedish People's Party]], leaving the SDP to the opposition. SDP leader [[Eero Hein\u00e4luoma]] did not immediately resign as party chairman, but he did announce his withdrawal from running for party chairman in the following party conference. He was replaced by [[Jutta Urpilainen]]. The SDP suffered further losses in the 2008 municipal election and the [[2009 European Parliament election in Finland|2009 European Parliament election]].\n\nIn the [[2011 Finnish parliamentary election|2011 parliamentary election]], the SDP lost three more seats, ending up with 19.1 percent of the vote which corresponded to 42 seats, the party's worst-ever result. However, as the Centre Party lost even more voters, the SDP became the second-largest party in the country after the National Coalition Party, receiving only some 1,500 votes more than the [[Finns Party]], which came in third. After lengthy negotiations, a six-party coalition government, the [[Katainen Cabinet]], was formed with the National Coalition Party and the Social Democrats as the two main parties. SDP leader Jutta Urpilainen became the cabinet's [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|Minister of Finance]], with NCP chairman [[Jyrki Katainen]] serving as [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]].\n\nIn 2014 party conference, Urpilainen was narrowly defeated by her challenger, [[Antti Rinne]], in a 257 to 243 vote.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/antti_rinne_on_sdpn_uusi_puheenjohtaja/7230581|title=Antti Rinne on SDP:n uusi puheenjohtaja |publisher=Yle |date=9 May 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref> Urpilainen subsequently stepped down as the Minister of Finance, passing the seat on to Rinne.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hs.fi/politiikka/art-2000002734872.html|title=Antti Rinteest\u00e4 uusi valtiovarainministeri |work=Helsingin Sanomat |date=28 May 2014 |accessdate=5 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2015 Finnish parliamentary election|2015 parliamentary election]], the drop of support continued for the SDP. The party lost eight more seats compared to the 2011 election, ending up with 34 seats and 16.5 percent of the vote. With the repeat of the worst-ever result, the SDP dropped to being the fourth largest political party in Finland, receiving 50,110 fewer votes than the National Coalition Party, yet 237,000 more votes than the [[Green League]]. SDP was left in the opposition, and provided extensive criticism on the actions of the [[Sipil\u00e4 Cabinet]] on matters such as alcohol policy, cuts to education spending, and the so-called active model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/uutiset/3-9983941|title=Eduskunta hyv\u00e4ksyi ty\u00f6tt\u00f6myysturvalain aktiivimalleineen \u2013 Teollisuusliitto tuomitsee ja v\u00e4l\u00e4ytt\u00e4\u00e4 lakkoa|website=Yle Uutiset|language=fi|access-date=2018-01-02}}</ref> On 22 June 2016 Maria Tolppanen, a [[Finns Party]] representative, joined the SDP.

During the second period, [[Tom Wilson (ice hockey)|Tom Wilson]] passed to a speedy [[Jakub Vr\u00e1na|Jakub Vrana]] going past the Golden Knight's defender and beating [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] to take the lead.

[[Alexander Ovechkin]] gave the Capitals the lead again on the power play, firing a shot onto Fleury, bouncing off his back and into the net. With the goal, it broke a tie with [[John Druce]] for most goals in a postseason by a Capitals player with fifteen. [[David Perron]] tied the game for Vegas, scoring his first goal of the postseason via deflection. Coach [[Barry Trotz]] of the Capitals challenged the play on goaltender interference as Perron appeared to hit the skate of Holtby as he was battling for position; the challenge was unsuccessful. An open [[Reilly Smith]] gave the Golden Knights the lead in the final minute of the second period, taking the pass from [[Alex Tuch]]. Halfway through the third period, [[Devante Smith-Pelly]] tied the game for the Capitals. Less than three minutes later, a shot came from the slot and went between Fleury's pads, but, unbeknownst to Fleury and his defensemen, the puck sneaked through and was laying in view just behind him, and [[Lars Eller]] forehanded it into the net to give the Capitals the lead with 7:37 left. With two minutes left, Vegas pulled Fleury for an extra attacker.

During the second period, [[Tom Wilson (ice hockey)|Tom Wilson]] passed to a speedy [[Jakub Vr\u00e1na|Jakub Vrana]] going past the Golden Knight's defender and beating [[Marc-Andr\u00e9 Fleury|Marc-Andre Fleury]] to take the lead. The Golden Knights tied the game soon after as former-Capitals defenceman [[Nate Schmidt]] shot through a flurry of players and the puck deflected off of [[Matt Niskanen]] past [[Braden Holtby]]. [[Alexander Ovechkin]] gave the Capitals the lead again on the power play, firing a shot onto Fleury, bouncing off his back and into the net. With the goal, it broke a tie with [[John Druce]] for most goals in a postseason by a Capitals player with fifteen. [[David Perron]] tied the game for Vegas, scoring his first goal of the postseason via deflection. Coach [[Barry Trotz]] of the Capitals challenged the play on goaltender interference as Perron appeared to hit the skate of Holtby as he was battling for position; the challenge was unsuccessful. An open [[Reilly Smith]] gave the Golden Knights the lead in the final minute of the second period, taking the pass from [[Alex Tuch]]. Halfway through the third period, [[Devante Smith-Pelly]] tied the game for the Capitals. Less than three minutes later, a shot came from the slot and went between Fleury's pads, but, unbeknownst to Fleury and his defensemen, the puck sneaked through and was laying in view just behind him, and [[Lars Eller]] forehanded it into the net to give the Capitals the lead with 7:37 left. With two minutes left, Vegas pulled Fleury for an extra attacker. At 18:11 of the third period, the game clock froze; however, the next stoppage in play occurred at 28.9 seconds remaining, allowing the clock to be readjusted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Petchesky|first=Barry|publisher=Gizmodo Media Group|date=June 7, 2018|title=The Game Clock Broke In Vegas And Caused Total Chaos |url=https://deadspin.com/the-game-clock-broke-in-vegas-and-caused-total-chaos-1826665434|website=Deadspin.com|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the attempts of the Golden Knights were thwarted as the Capitals held on to win the game and their first Stanley Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/news/washington-capitals-vegas-golden-knights-game-5-recap/c-298984386?tid=297173160|title=Capitals win Stanley Cup, defeat Golden Knights in Game 5 of Final|last=Rosen|first=Dan|publisher=NHL Enterprises, L.P.|date=June 7, 2018|website=NHL.com|accessdate=June 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-icehockey-nhl-vgk-wsh/capitals-beat-golden-knights-to-clinch-maiden-stanley-cup-title-idUSKCN1J40AE|title=Capitals beat Golden Knights to win their first Stanley Cup|first=Frank|last=Pingue|publisher=Reuters|date=June 7, 2018|website=reuters.com|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref> Ovechkin was awarded the [[Conn Smythe Trophy]].<ref name=\"connsmythe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/23729499/alex-ovechkin-washington-capitals-wins-conn-smythe-trophy-playoffs-mvp|title=Alex Ovechkin of Washington Capitals wins Conn Smythe Trophy as playoffs MVP|last=Kaplan|first=Emily|publisher= ESPN Internet Ventures|website=ESPN.com|date=June 8, 2018|accessdate=June 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| style=\"width:100%;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are nicknamed ''La Vinotinto'' (\"Red wine\") because of the traditional burgundy color of their shirts. When playing at home in official games, they usually rotate between three stadiums: The [[Polideportivo Cachamay]] in [[Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela|Puerto Ordaz]], the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Antonio Anzo\u00e1tegui]] in [[Puerto La Cruz]] and the [[Estadio Pueblo Nuevo]] in [[San Crist\u00f3bal, T\u00e1chira|San Crist\u00f3bal]]. In friendly matches, they tend to rotate between the rest of the stadiums in the country.\n\nUnlike other South American nations, and akin to some Caribbean nations, [[baseball]] is extremely popular in Venezuela, which diverts athletic talent away from football, contributing to its historic lack of success in [[CONMEBOL]] competitions. As of 2018, they are the only CONMEBOL side to have never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. Often Venezuela would go through entire qualification tournaments without recording a single win, although this has not happened since 1998. Until [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2011]], their best finish at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was fifth in their first entry, in [[South American Championship 1967|1967]]. It is only recently with the spread of the World Cup's popularity in nations where football was not the primary sport (such as Japan, the United States, and Australia) that the national team found incentives to increase player development and fan support. As of December 2019, Venezuela has the highest position on the FIFA World Ranking of any team that has not yet qualified for the World Cup, being ranked 25th.<ref>{{cite web |title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ |website=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of its lackluster senior performance, Venezuela has been notable for being the first country from outside the three traditional CONMEBOL forces (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) to reach the final of any FIFA competition, with its [[Venezuela national under-20 football team|U-20 team]] achieved the feat in [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].<ref>https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/40205178</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Backstory===\nVenezuela did not participate in [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] until the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] qualifiers in which they were drawn with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Peru national football team|Peru]], but failed to register a point in four games. In the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] qualifiers they managed to register a point, and after withdrawing from the [[1974 World Cup|1974]] series, repeated that in the [[1978 World Cup|1978]] qualifiers. The [[1982 World Cup|1982]] qualifiers saw them register their first win, over Bolivia. They wouldn't register another World Cup qualifying win until the [[1994 World Cup|1994]] series when they defeated [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]. A highlight of the [[1998 World Cup|1998]] qualifiers was goalkeeper [[Rafael Dudamel]] scoring against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a 5\u20132 defeat.\n\nDespite poor results during the 1960s and 1970s, outstanding players like [[Luis Mendoza (Venezuelan footballer)|Luis Mendoza]] and [[Rafael Santana (footballer)|Rafael Santana]] achieved recognition. Venezuela at that time also managed to qualify for the [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]], its first ever major international football competition Venezuela participated.\n\n===Richard P\u00e1ez era===\nAfter [[Jos\u00e9 Omar Pastoriza]]'s resignation during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cup qualifyings, [[Richard P\u00e1ez]] took the technical direction of the National Team. Finishing this process, Venezuela achieved 4 victories in a row against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]], and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]; winning more than 1 game in row, their first away game and not finishing in the last place for the first time in their World Cup qualifying history. \n\nHowever, the team failed to qualify for both the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] World Cups, gaining 12 and 18 points respectively. After this, the team advanced to the second round [[Copa America 2007]] in Venezuela, is the first time they could reach it on this competition.\n\nIn November 2007, P\u00e1ez resigned after discrepancies with media and supporters. <ref>https://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2007/11/26/283172/venezuela-se-quedo-sin-dt-renuncio-richard-paez.html</ref>\n\n===C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas era===\nWith a new coach [[C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas]], Venezuela national team improved their performances. At the beginning of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualifying, Venezuela won its first game in World Cup qualifying against long unbeaten Ecuador in [[Quito]]. Something similar happened to Bolivia in [[La Paz]], where Venezuela won for the first time at Bolivian altitude. Also, they received their first point against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in qualifying. Despite not ultimately reaching the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], Venezuela achieved its best result in qualifying. They finished this round with 22 points in 18 matches, surpassing Peru and Bolivia for eighth place in the region.\n\nOn 6 June 2008, Venezuela achieved its second-ever triumph over Brazil, defeating the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' 2\u20130 in a friendly match in [[Boston]], United States. \nVenezuela obtained excellent results in the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] when they finished fourth, their highest finish in the tournament to date. With a squad composed mostly of players playing in Europe, they began [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] with a historic result (1\u20130) against Argentina in [[Puerto La Cruz]], beating the Argentines for the first time.\n\n===Noel Sanvicente era===\nOn 4 September 2014, [[Noel Sanvicente]] was made coach of the Venezuela national team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/240/651/2/index.html|title=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) \u2013 FIFA.com|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=|work=fifa.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> On 5 September 2014, the team lost its first match with Sanvicente under the helm 3\u20131 against [[South Korea National Football Team|South Korea]] in [[Bucheon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/korea-republic-vs-venezuela/1802751/report|title=Korea Republic 3 \u2013 1 Venezuela Match report \u2013 9/5/14 Friendlies \u2013 Goal.com|author=|date=|work=goal.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nSanvicente's first tournament came in the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], with Venezuela drawn in [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group C|Group C]] of the competition. Their opening game finished with an upset victory over tournament favorites [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] by 1\u20130, but subsequent defeats to Peru and Brazil saw '''La Vinotinto''' eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nVenezuela began the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|World Cup qualification]] campaign with a 1\u20130 defeat against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home, and would not earn their first point until their match against Peru, a 2\u20132 draw in [[Lima]] where Venezuela led until the last minute of stoppage time. Their match with Chile ended in a disappointing 4\u20131 defeat, Sanvicente announced his resignation a week later after mutual consent with the FVF.  At the time of Sanvicente's departure, Venezuela was last in the qualification standings with a sole point, and was unofficially eliminated.\n\n===Rafael Dudamel era===\nSanvicente was replaced by former Vinotinto goalkeeper [[Rafael Dudamel]], who decided to revamp the entire national team squad, by injecting the team with the promising young generation of Venezuelan players that finished second at the [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] that was dubbed as the country's first ever football Golden Generation.<ref>https://www.footballparadise.com/jovenes-venezuela-golden-u20-generation/</ref> Under his coaching, ''La Vinotinto'' quickly improved and reached the quarterfinals in the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario]], with two 1\u20130 wins over [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and Uruguay and a 1\u20131 draw against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the group stage and then a 4\u20131 defeat to Argentina in the quarter-finals. In the 7th matchday of the 2018 World Cup qualifier, Venezuela lost to Colombia 2\u20130 in [[Barranquilla]], the first loss against ''Los Cafeteros'' since 2009. Later, on matchday 11, Venezuela won for the first time in the qualifier, 5\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[Matur\u00edn]] with a hat-trick from [[Josef Mart\u00ednez]] and goals from [[Jacobo Kouffati]] and [[R\u00f3mulo Otero]].\n\nOn 2 January 2020, Dudamel resigned from the national team.\n\n==Copa Am\u00e9rica history==\nVenezuela first participated at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[1967 South American Championship|1967]], and finished fifth after defeating Bolivia 3\u20130 with a side containing Mendoza and Santana. The [[1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1975]] tournament saw Venezuela drawn in a group with Brazil and Argentina, and finished bottom with an 11\u20130 defeat to Argentina. In the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1979]] edition, which would be the international swansong for Mendoza and Santana, they drew 0\u20130 with Colombia and 1\u20131 with Chile. A highlight of the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1989]] tournament was midfielder [[Carlos Maldonado (footballer)|Carlos Maldonado]]'s four goals. In the [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1993]] series, Venezuela drew with Uruguay and the United States.\n\nThe team's overall Copa Am\u00e9rica record has been relatively poor (goal difference 33\u2013145 before the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica), but the \"''Auge Vinotinto''\" (Vinotinto Rise) period in the early 2000s (decade) brought increased attention to the sport in the country, which in turn brought increased support from both government and private institutions. Said support contributed greatly to the \"''Vinotinto's''\" rise in quality. In 2007, during the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica|Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Venezuela]], the team progressed to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history after finishing first in a group containing Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay. Venezuela's 2\u20130 victory over Peru during the competition was its first Copa Am\u00e9rica victory since 1967.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nAt the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] championship, Venezuela reached the semi-finals round for the first time by defeating Chile in the quarter-final, 2\u20131. Despite their commanding presence against Paraguay in their semifinal, Venezuela was unable to convert their chances into goals. They would eventually lose 5\u20133 to Paraguay in a penalty shootout after remaining scoreless in normal and extra time.

national football team''' ({{lang-es|Selecci\u00f3n de f\u00fatbol de Venezuela}}) represents [[Venezuela]] in men's [[FIFA|international]] [[association football|football]] and is controlled by the [[Venezuelan Football Federation]] (FVF), the governing body for [[football in Venezuela]]. They are nicknamed ''La Vinotinto'' (\"Red wine\") because of the traditional burgundy color of their shirts. When playing at home in official games, they usually rotate between three stadiums: The [[Polideportivo Cachamay]] in [[Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela|Puerto Ordaz]], the [[Estadio Jos\u00e9 Antonio Anzo\u00e1tegui]] in [[Puerto La Cruz]] and the [[Estadio Pueblo Nuevo]] in [[San Crist\u00f3bal, T\u00e1chira|San Crist\u00f3bal]]. In friendly matches, they tend to rotate between the rest of the stadiums in the country.\n\nUnlike other South American nations, and akin to some Caribbean nations, [[baseball]] is extremely popular in Venezuela, which diverts athletic talent away from football, contributing to its historic lack of success in [[CONMEBOL]] competitions. As of 2018, they are the only CONMEBOL side to have never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]]. Often Venezuela would go through entire qualification tournaments without recording a single win, although this has not happened since 1998. Until [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2011]], their best finish at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] was fifth in their first entry, in [[South American Championship 1967|1967]]. It is only recently with the spread of the World Cup's popularity in nations where football was not the primary sport (such as Japan, the United States, and Australia) that the national team found incentives to increase player development and fan support. As of December 2019, Venezuela has the highest position on the FIFA World Ranking of any team that has not yet qualified for the World Cup, being ranked 25th.<ref>{{cite web |title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/ |website=FIFA.com |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=28 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn spite of its lackluster senior performance, Venezuela has been notable for being the first country from outside the three traditional CONMEBOL forces (Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay) to reach the final of any FIFA competition, with its [[Venezuela national under-20 football team|U-20 team]] achieved the feat in [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup]].<ref>https://www.bbc.com/sport/live/football/40205178</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Backstory===\nVenezuela did not participate in [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] until the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] qualifiers in which they were drawn with [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[Peru national football team|Peru]], but failed to register a point in four games. In the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] qualifiers they managed to register a point, and after withdrawing from the [[1974 World Cup|1974]] series, repeated that in the [[1978 World Cup|1978]] qualifiers. The [[1982 World Cup|1982]] qualifiers saw them register their first win, over Bolivia. They wouldn't register another World Cup qualifying win until the [[1994 World Cup|1994]] series when they defeated [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]. A highlight of the [[1998 World Cup|1998]] qualifiers was goalkeeper [[Rafael Dudamel]] scoring against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in a 5\u20132 defeat.\n\nDespite poor results during the 1960s and 1970s, outstanding players like [[Luis Mendoza (Venezuelan footballer)|Luis Mendoza]] and [[Rafael Santana (footballer)|Rafael Santana]] achieved recognition. Venezuela at that time also managed to qualify for the [[Football at the 1980 Summer Olympics|1980 Summer Olympics]], its first ever major international football competition Venezuela participated.\n\n===Richard P\u00e1ez era===\nAfter [[Jos\u00e9 Omar Pastoriza]]'s resignation during the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cup qualifyings, [[Richard P\u00e1ez]] took the technical direction of the National Team. Finishing this process, Venezuela achieved 4 victories in a row against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[Peru national football team|Peru]], and [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]; winning more than 1 game in row, their first away game and not finishing in the last place for the first time in their World Cup qualifying history. \n\nHowever, the team failed to qualify for both the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], and [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] World Cups, gaining 12 and 18 points respectively. After this, the team advanced to the second round [[Copa America 2007]] in Venezuela, is the first time they could reach it on this competition.\n\nIn November 2007, P\u00e1ez resigned after discrepancies with media and supporters. <ref>https://www.emol.com/noticias/deportes/2007/11/26/283172/venezuela-se-quedo-sin-dt-renuncio-richard-paez.html</ref>\n\n===C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas era===\nWith a new coach [[C\u00e9sar Far\u00edas]], Venezuela national team improved their performances. At the beginning of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] qualifying, Venezuela won its first game in World Cup qualifying against long unbeaten Ecuador in [[Quito]]. Something similar happened to Bolivia in [[La Paz]], where Venezuela won for the first time at Bolivian altitude. Also, they received their first point against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in qualifying. Despite not ultimately reaching the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], Venezuela achieved its best result in qualifying. They finished this round with 22 points in 18 matches, surpassing Peru and Bolivia for eighth place in the region.\n\nOn 6 June 2008, Venezuela achieved its second-ever triumph over Brazil, defeating the ''Sele\u00e7\u00e3o'' 2\u20130 in a friendly match in [[Boston]], United States. \nVenezuela obtained excellent results in the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] when they finished fourth, their highest finish in the tournament to date. With a squad composed mostly of players playing in Europe, they began [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]] with a historic result (1\u20130) against Argentina in [[Puerto La Cruz]], beating the Argentines for the first time.\n\n===Noel Sanvicente era===\nOn 4 September 2014, [[Noel Sanvicente]] was made coach of the Venezuela national team.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/240/651/2/index.html|title=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) \u2013 FIFA.com|first=|last=FIFA.com|date=|work=fifa.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref> On 5 September 2014, the team lost its first match with Sanvicente under the helm 3\u20131 against [[South Korea National Football Team|South Korea]] in [[Bucheon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/match/korea-republic-vs-venezuela/1802751/report|title=Korea Republic 3 \u2013 1 Venezuela Match report \u2013 9/5/14 Friendlies \u2013 Goal.com|author=|date=|work=goal.com|accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nSanvicente's first tournament came in the [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica]], with Venezuela drawn in [[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group C|Group C]] of the competition. Their opening game finished with an upset victory over tournament favorites [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] by 1\u20130, but subsequent defeats to Peru and Brazil saw '''La Vinotinto''' eliminated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nVenezuela began the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|World Cup qualification]] campaign with a 1\u20130 defeat against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] at home, and would not earn their first point until their match against Peru, a 2\u20132 draw in [[Lima]] where Venezuela led until the last minute of stoppage time. Their match with Chile ended in a disappointing 4\u20131 defeat, Sanvicente announced his resignation a week later after mutual consent with the FVF.  At the time of Sanvicente's departure, Venezuela was last in the qualification standings with a sole point, and was unofficially eliminated.\n\n===Rafael Dudamel era===\nSanvicente was replaced by former Vinotinto goalkeeper [[Rafael Dudamel]], who decided to revamp the entire national team squad, by injecting the team with the promising young generation of Venezuelan players that finished second at the [[2017 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] that was dubbed as the country's first ever football Golden Generation.<ref>https://www.footballparadise.com/jovenes-venezuela-golden-u20-generation/</ref> Under his coaching, ''La Vinotinto'' quickly improved and reached the quarterfinals in the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario]], with two 1\u20130 wins over [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and Uruguay and a 1\u20131 draw against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] in the group stage and then a 4\u20131 defeat to Argentina in the quarter-finals. In the 7th matchday of the 2018 World Cup qualifier, Venezuela lost to Colombia 2\u20130 in [[Barranquilla]], the first loss against ''Los Cafeteros'' since 2009. Later, on matchday 11, Venezuela won for the first time in the qualifier, 5\u20130 over [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]] in [[Matur\u00edn]] with a hat-trick from [[Josef Mart\u00ednez]] and goals from [[Jacobo Kouffati]] and [[R\u00f3mulo Otero]].\n\nOn 2 January 2020, Dudamel resigned from the national team.\n\n==Copa Am\u00e9rica history==\nVenezuela first participated at the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] in [[1967 South American Championship|1967]], and finished fifth after defeating Bolivia 3\u20130 with a side containing Mendoza and Santana. The [[1975 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1975]] tournament saw Venezuela drawn in a group with Brazil and Argentina, and finished bottom with an 11\u20130 defeat to Argentina. In the [[1979 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1979]] edition, which would be the international swansong for Mendoza and Santana, they drew 0\u20130 with Colombia and 1\u20131 with Chile. A highlight of the [[1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1989]] tournament was midfielder [[Carlos Maldonado (footballer)|Carlos Maldonado]]'s four goals. In the [[1993 Copa Am\u00e9rica|1993]] series, Venezuela drew with Uruguay and the United States.\n\nThe team's overall Copa Am\u00e9rica record has been relatively poor (goal difference 33\u2013145 before the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica), but the \"''Auge Vinotinto''\" (Vinotinto Rise) period in the early 2000s (decade) brought increased attention to the sport in the country, which in turn brought increased support from both government and private institutions. Said support contributed greatly to the \"''Vinotinto's''\" rise in quality. In 2007, during the [[2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica|Copa Am\u00e9rica held in Venezuela]], the team progressed to the quarterfinals for the first time in its history after finishing first in a group containing Peru, Bolivia, and Uruguay. Venezuela's 2\u20130 victory over Peru during the competition was its first Copa Am\u00e9rica victory since 1967.\n\n===2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\nAt the [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica]] championship, Venezuela reached the semi-finals round for the first time by defeating Chile in the quarter-final, 2\u20131. Despite their commanding presence against Paraguay in their semifinal, Venezuela was unable to convert their chances into goals. They would eventually lose 5\u20133 to Paraguay in a penalty shootout after remaining scoreless in normal and extra time. Venezuela and Peru played for third place at the [[Estadio Ciudad de La Plata]], where Venezuela would suffer their biggest loss of the tournament, losing 4\u20131 to Peru and falling into fourth place overall. Nonetheless, it was their best ever finish at the competition.\n\n'''Group B:'''\n{{main|2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group B}}\n{| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!width=\"165\"|Team\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|Pld|Played}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|W|Won}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|D|Drawn}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|L|Lost}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|GF|Goals}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|GA|Goals against}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|GD|Goal difference}}\n!width=\"20\"|{{Tooltip|Pts|Points}}\n|-bgcolor=#ccffcc\n|align=left|{{fb|BRA}}\n|3||1||2||0||6||4||+2||'''5'''\n|-bgcolor=#ccffcc\n|align=left|{{fb|VEN}}\n|3||1||2||0||4||3||+1||'''5'''\n|-bgcolor=#ccffcc\n|align=left|{{fb|PAR|1990}}\n|3||0||3||0||5||5||0||'''3'''\n|-bgcolor=#ffcccc\n|align=left|{{fb|ECU}}\n|3||0||1||2||2||5||\u22123||'''1'''\n|-\n|}\n'''Results:'''\n{{football box collapsible\n| date     = 3 July 2011\n| time     = 16:00 [[UTC-3]]\n| round    = Group stages\n| team1    = {{fb-rt|BRA}}\n| score    = [[2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica Group B#Brazil v Venezuela|0\u20130]]\n| report   = [https://web.archive.org/web/20110707041900/http://df1.conmebol.com/copaamerica/fichas/ficha99070.html Report]\n| team2    = {{fb|VEN}}\n| stadium  = [[Estadio Ciudad de La Plata]]\n| location = [[La Plata]], Argentina\n| referee  = [[Ra\u00fal Orosco]] ([[Bolivian Football Federation|Bolivia]])\n| result   = D\n}}\n{{football box collapsible\n| date     = 9 July 2011\n| time     = 18:30 [[UTC-3]]\n| round    = Group stages\n| team1    = {{fb-rt|VEN}}\n| goals1   = [[C\u00e9sar Eduardo Gonz\u00e1lez|C.
