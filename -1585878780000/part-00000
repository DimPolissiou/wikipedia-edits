In [[quantum mechanics]], [[particles]] such as [[electrons]] are described by a [[wave function]], a mathematical representation of the quantum state of a system; a probabilistic interpretation of the wave function is used to explain various quantum effects. As long as there exists a definite phase relation between different states, the system is said to be coherent. A definite phase relationship is necessary to perform [[quantum computing]] on quantum information encoded in quantum states. Coherence is preserved under the laws of quantum physics.\n\nIf a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence indefinitely, but it would be impossible to manipulate or investigate it. If it is not perfectly isolated, for example during a measurement, coherence is shared with the environment and appears to be lost with time; a process called quantum decoherence. As a result of this process, quantum behavior is apparently lost, just as energy appears to be lost by friction in classical mechanics.\n\nDecoherence was first introduced in 1970 by the German physicist [[H. Dieter Zeh]]<ref name=\"Zeh\">[[H.

As with any coupling, [[Quantum entanglement|entanglements]] are generated between the system and environment.  These have the effect of sharing [[quantum information]] with\u2014or transferring it to\u2014the surroundings.\n\nDecoherence has been used to understand the [[collapse of the wave function]] in quantum mechanics. Decoherence does not generate ''actual'' wave-function collapse.  It only provides an explanation for ''apparent'' wave-function collapse, as the quantum nature of the system \"leaks\" into the environment.  That is, components of the wave function are decoupled from a [[Quantum coherence|coherent system]] and acquire phases from their immediate surroundings.  A total superposition of the global or [[universal wavefunction]] still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretational issue]].  Specifically, decoherence does not attempt to explain the [[measurement problem]].  Rather, decoherence provides an explanation for the transition of the system to a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixture of states]] that seem to correspond to those states observers perceive.  Moreover, our observation tells us that this mixture looks like a proper [[quantum ensemble]] in a measurement situation, as we observe that measurements lead to the \"realization\" of precisely one state in the \"ensemble\".\n\nDecoherence represents a challenge for the practical realization of [[quantum computer]]s, since such machines are expected to rely heavily on the undisturbed evolution of quantum coherences.  Simply put, they require that the coherence of states be preserved and that decoherence is managed, in order to actually perform quantum computation.  The preservation of coherence, and mitigation of decoherence effects, are thus related to the concept of [[quantum error correction]].\n\n==Mechanisms==\nTo examine how decoherence operates, an \"intuitive\" model is presented.  The model requires some familiarity with quantum theory basics.  Analogies are made between visualisable classical [[phase space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s.  A more rigorous derivation in [[Dirac notation]] shows how decoherence destroys interference effects and the \"quantum nature\" of systems.  Next, the [[density matrix]] approach is presented for perspective.\n\n[[File:Quantum superposition of states and decoherence.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Quantum superposition of states and decoherence measurement through [[Rabi cycle|Rabi oscillations]]]]\n\n===Phase-space picture===\nAn ''N''-particle system can be represented in non-relativistic quantum mechanics by a [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N)</math>, where each ''x<sub>i</sub>'' is a point in 3-dimensional space.  This has analogies with the classical [[phase space]].  A classical phase space contains a real-valued function in 6''N'' dimensions (each particle contributes 3 spatial coordinates and 3 momenta).  Our \"quantum\" phase space, on the other hand, involves a complex-valued function on a 3''N''-dimensional space.  The position and momenta are represented by operators that do not [[Commutativity|commute]], and <math>\\psi</math> lives in the mathematical structure of a [[Hilbert space]].  Aside from these differences, however, the rough analogy holds.\n\nDifferent previously isolated, non-interacting systems occupy different phase spaces. Alternatively we can say that they occupy different lower-dimensional [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] in the phase space of the joint system.  The ''effective'' dimensionality of a system's phase space is the number of ''[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]'' present, which\u2014in non-relativistic models\u2014is 6 times the number of a system's ''free'' particles.  For a [[macroscopic]] system this will be a very large dimensionality.  When two systems (and the environment would be a system) start to interact, though, their associated state vectors are no longer constrained to the subspaces.  Instead the combined state vector time-evolves a path through the \"larger volume\", whose dimensionality is the sum of the dimensions of the two subspaces.  The extent to which two vectors interfere with each other is a measure of how \"close\" they are to each other (formally, their overlap or Hilbert space multiplies together) in the phase space.  When a system couples to an external environment, the dimensionality of, and hence \"volume\" available to, the joint state vector increases enormously. Each environmental degree of freedom contributes an extra dimension.\n\nThe original system's wave function can be expanded in many different ways as a sum of elements in a quantum superposition.  Each expansion corresponds to a projection of the wave vector onto a basis.  The basis can be chosen at will.  Let us choose an expansion where the resulting basis elements interact with the environment in an element-specific way.  Such elements will\u2014with overwhelming probability\u2014be rapidly separated from each other by their natural unitary time evolution along their own independent paths.  After a very short interaction, there is almost no chance of any further interference.  The process is effectively [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]].  The different elements effectively become \"lost\" from each other in the expanded phase space created by coupling with the environment; in phase space, this decoupling is monitored through the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]].  The original elements are said to have ''decohered''.  The environment has effectively selected out those expansions or decompositions of the original state vector that decohere (or lose phase coherence) with each other.  This is called \"environmentally-induced superselection\", or [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zurek | first1 = Wojciech H. | year = 2003 | title = Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical | arxiv = quant-ph/0105127 | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 75 | issue = 3| page = 715 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.75.715 | bibcode=2003RvMP...75..715Z| title-link = einselection }}</ref> The decohered elements of the system no longer exhibit [[quantum interference]] between each other, as in a [[double-slit experiment]].  Any elements that decohere from each other via environmental interactions are said to be [[quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] with the environment.  The converse is not true: not all entangled states are decohered from each other.\n\nAny measuring device or apparatus acts as an environment, since at some stage along the measuring chain, it has to be large enough to be read by humans. It must possess a very large number of hidden degrees of freedom.  In effect, the interactions may be considered to be [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]]. As a result of an interaction, the wave functions of the system and the measuring device become entangled with each other. Decoherence happens when different portions of the system's wave function become entangled in different ways with the measuring device. For two einselected elements of the entangled system's state to interfere, both the original system and the measuring in both elements device must significantly overlap, in the scalar product sense.  If the measuring device has many degrees of freedom, it is ''very'' unlikely for this to happen.\n\nAs a consequence, the system behaves as a classical [[statistical ensemble]] of the different elements rather than as a single coherent [[quantum superposition]] of them. From the perspective of each ensemble member's measuring device, the system appears to have irreversibly collapsed onto a state with a precise value for the measured attributes, relative to that element.\n\n===Dirac notation===\nUsing [[Dirac notation]], let the system initially be in the state\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rang = \\sum_i |i\\rang \\lang i |\\psi\\rang,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>|i\\rang</math>s form an [[einselection|einselected]] [[eigenbasis|basis]] (''environmentally induced selected eigenbasis''<ref name=\"zurek03\"/>), and let the environment initially be in the state <math>|\\epsilon\\rang</math>.  The [[vector basis]] of the combination of the system and the environment consists of the [[tensor product]]s of the basis vectors of the two subsystems.  Thus, before any interaction between the two subsystems, the joint state can be written as\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang = \\sum_i |i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang</math> is shorthand for the tensor product <math>|i\\rang \\otimes |\\epsilon\\rang</math>. There are two extremes in the way the system can interact with its environment: either (1) the system loses its distinct identity and merges with the environment (e.g. photons in a cold, dark cavity get converted into molecular excitations within the cavity walls), or (2) the system is not disturbed at all, even though the environment is disturbed (e.g. the idealized non-disturbing measurement).  In general, an interaction is a mixture of these two extremes that we examine.\n\n====System absorbed by environment====\nIf the environment absorbs the system, each element of the total system's basis interacts with the environment such that\n\n: <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang </math> evolves into <math>|\\epsilon_i\\rang,</math>\n\nand so\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang</math> evolves into <math>|\\text{after}\\rang = \\sum_i |\\epsilon_i\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang.</math>\n\nThe [[unitarity]] of time evolution demands that the total state basis remains [[orthonormal]], i.e. the [[scalar product|scalar]] or [[inner product]]s of the basis vectors must vanish, since <math>\\lang i|j\\rang = \\delta_{ij}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij}.</math>\n\nThis orthonormality of the environment states is the defining characteristic required for [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\"/>\n\n====System not disturbed by environment====\nIn an idealised measurement, the system disturbs the environment, but is itself undisturbed by the environment.\nIn this case, each element of the basis interacts with the environment such that\n\n: <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang</math> evolves into the product <math>|i, \\epsilon_i\\rang = |i\\rang |\\epsilon_i\\rang,</math>\n\nand so\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang</math> evolves into <math>|\\text{after}\\rang = \\sum_i |i, \\epsilon_i\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang.</math>\n\nIn this case, [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] demands that\n\n: <math>\\lang i, \\epsilon_i|j, \\epsilon_j\\rang = \\lang i|j\\rang \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij} \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij} \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_i\\rang = \\delta_{ij},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lang \\epsilon_i | \\epsilon_i \\rang = 1</math> was used. ''Additionally'', decoherence requires, by virtue of the large number of hidden degrees of freedom in the environment, that\n\n: <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\approx \\delta_{ij}.</math>\n\nAs before, this is the defining characteristic for decoherence to become [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\"/> The approximation becomes more exact as the number of environmental degrees of freedom affected increases.\n\nNote that if the system basis <math>|i\\rang</math> were not an einselected basis, then the last condition is trivial, since the disturbed environment is not a function of <math>i</math>, and we have the trivial disturbed environment basis <math>|\\epsilon_j\\rang = |\\epsilon'\\rang</math>.  This would correspond to the system basis being degenerate with respect to the environmentally defined measurement observable.  For a complex environmental interaction (which would be expected for a typical macroscale interaction) a non-einselected basis would be hard to define.\n\n===Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical probabilities===\nThe utility of decoherence lies in its application to the analysis of probabilities, before and after environmental interaction, and in particular to the vanishing of [[quantum interference]] terms after decoherence has occurred.  If we ask what is the probability of observing the system making a [[Quantum state|transition]] from <math>\\psi</math> to <math>\\phi</math> ''before'' <math>\\psi</math> has interacted with its environment, then application of the [[Born probability]] rule states that the transition probability is the squared modulus of the scalar product of the two states:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{before}(\\psi \\to \\phi) = \\left|\\lang\\psi|\\phi\\rang\\right|^2 = \\left|\\sum_i \\psi^*_i \\phi_i\\right|^2 = \\sum_i |\\psi_i^* \\phi_i|^2 + \\sum_{ij; i \\ne j} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\phi^*_j \\phi_i ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi_i = \\lang i|\\psi\\rang</math>, <math>\\psi_i^* = \\lang\\psi|i\\rang</math>, and <math>\\phi_i = \\lang i|\\phi\\rang</math> etc.\n\nThe above expansion of the transition probability has terms that involve <math>i \\ne j</math>; these can be thought of as representing ''interference'' between the different basis elements or quantum alternatives.  This is a purely quantum effect and represents the non-additivity of the probabilities of quantum alternatives.\n\nTo calculate the probability of observing the system making a quantum leap from <math>\\psi</math> to <math>\\phi</math> ''after'' <math>\\psi</math> has interacted with its environment, then application of the [[Born probability]] rule states that we must sum over all the relevant possible states <math>|\\epsilon_i\\rang</math> of the environment ''before'' squaring the modulus:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{after}(\\psi \\to \\phi) = \\sum_j \\,\\left|\\lang\\text{after}\\right| \\phi, \\epsilon_j \\rang|^2 = \\sum_j \\,\\left|\\sum_i \\psi_i^* \\lang i, \\epsilon_i|\\phi, \\epsilon_j\\rang\\right|^2 = \\sum_j\\left|\\sum_i \\psi_i^* \\phi_i \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\right|^2.</math>\n\nThe internal summation vanishes when we apply the decoherence/[[einselection]] condition <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\approx \\delta_{ij}</math>, and the formula simplifies to\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{after}(\\psi \\to \\phi) \\approx \\sum_j |\\psi_j^* \\phi_j|^2 =\n\\sum_i |\\psi^*_i \\phi_i|^2.</math>\n\nIf we compare this with the formula we derived before the environment introduced decoherence, we can see that the effect of decoherence has been to move the summation sign <math>\\textstyle\\sum_i</math> from inside of the modulus sign to outside.  As a result, all the cross- or [[quantum interference]]-terms\n\n: <math>\\sum_{ij; i \\ne j} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\phi^*_j \\phi_i</math>\n\nhave vanished from the transition-probability calculation.

Let <math>\\mathcal H_S</math> and <math>\\mathcal H_B</math> be the system's and bath's Hilbert spaces respectively. Then the Hamiltonian for the combined system is\n\n: <math>\\hat{H} = \\hat H_S \\otimes \\hat I_B + \\hat I_S \\otimes \\hat H_B + \\hat H_I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat H_S, \\hat H_B</math> are the system and bath Hamiltonians respectively, <math>\\hat H_I</math> is the interaction Hamiltonian between the system and bath, and <math>\\hat I_S, \\hat I_B</math> are the identity operators on the system and bath Hilbert spaces respectively. The time-evolution of the [[density operator]] of this closed system is unitary and, as such, is given by\n\n: <math>\\rho_{SB}(t) = \\hat U(t) \\rho_{SB}(0) \\hat U^\\dagger(t),</math>\n\nwhere the unitary operator is <math>\\hat U = e^{-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar}</math>. If the system and bath are not [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] initially, then we can write <math>\\rho_{SB} = \\rho_S \\otimes \\rho_B</math>. Therefore, the evolution of the system becomes\n\n: <math>\\rho_{SB}(t) = \\hat U (t)[\\rho_S(0) \\otimes \\rho_B(0)] \\hat U^\\dagger(t).</math>\n\nThe system\u2013bath interaction Hamiltonian can be written in a general form as\n\n: <math>\\hat H_I = \\sum_i \\hat S_i \\otimes \\hat B_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat S_i \\otimes \\hat B_i</math> is the operator acting on the combined system\u2013bath Hilbert space, and <math>\\hat S_i, \\hat B_i</math> are the operators that act on the system and bath respectively. This coupling of the system and bath is the cause of decoherence in the system alone. To see this, a [[partial trace]] is performed over the bath to give a description of the system alone:\n\n: <math>\\rho_S(t) = \\operatorname{Tr}_B\\big[\\hat U(t)[\\rho_S(0) \\otimes \\rho_B(0)] \\hat U^\\dagger(t)\\big].</math>\n\n<math>\\rho_S(t)</math> is called the ''reduced density matrix'' and gives information about the system only. If the bath is written in terms of its set of orthogonal basis kets, that is, if it has been initially diagonalized, then <math>\\textstyle\\rho_B(0) = \\sum_j a_j |j\\rangle \\langle j|</math>. Computing the partial trace with respect to this (computational) basis gives\n\n: <math>\\rho_S(t) = \\sum_l \\hat A_l \\rho_S(0) \\hat A^\\dagger_l,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat A_l, \\hat A^\\dagger_l</math> are defined as the ''Kraus operators'' and are represented as\n\n: <math>\\hat A_l = \\sqrt{a_j} \\langle k| \\hat U |j\\rangle.</math>\n\nThis is known as the ''[[Decoherence-free subspaces#Operator-sum representation formulation|operator-sum representation]]'' (OSR). A condition on the Kraus operators can be obtained by using the fact that <math>\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_S(t)] = 1</math>; this then gives\n\n: <math>\\sum_l \\hat A^\\dagger_l \\hat A_l = \\hat I_S.</math>\n\nThis restriction determines whether decoherence will occur or not in the OSR. In particular, when there is more than one term present in the sum for <math>\\rho_S(t)</math>, then the dynamics of the system will be non-unitary, and hence decoherence will take place.\n\n===Semigroup approach===\nA more general consideration for the existence of decoherence in a quantum system is given by the ''master equation'', which determines how the density matrix of the ''system alone'' evolves in time (see also the [[Belavkin equation]]<ref name=Belavkin89>{{cite journal\n | author = V.

In particular, the non-unitary dynamics are represented by <math>L_D</math>, whereas the unitary dynamics of the state are represented by the usual [[Heisenberg commutator]]. Note that when <math>L_D\\big[\\rho_S(t)\\big] = 0</math>, the dynamical evolution of the system is unitary. The conditions for the evolution of the system density matrix to be described by the master equation are:<ref name=\"Lidar and Whaley\"/>\n# the evolution of the system density matrix is determined by a one-parameter [[semigroup]],\n# the evolution is \"completely positive\" (i.e. probabilities are preserved),\n# the system and bath density matrices are ''initially'' decoupled.\n\n==Examples of non-unitary modelling of decoherence==\n[[Decoherence]] can be modelled as a non-[[Unitary operator|unitary]] process by which a system couples with its environment (although the combined system plus environment evolves in a unitary fashion).<ref name=\"Lidar and Whaley\"/> Thus the [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of the system alone, treated in isolation, are non-unitary and, as such, are represented by [[irreversibility|irreversible transformations]] acting on the system's [[Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathcal{H}</math>. Since the system's dynamics are represented by irreversible representations, then any information present in the quantum system can be lost to the environment or [[heat bath]]. Alternatively, the decay of quantum information caused by the coupling of the system to the environment is referred to as decoherence.<ref name=\"Bacon\"/> Thus decoherence is the process by which information of a quantum system is altered by the system's interaction with its environment (which form a closed system), hence creating an [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] between the system and heat bath (environment). As such, since the system is entangled with its environment in some unknown way, a description of the system by itself cannot be made without also referring to the environment (i.e. without also describing the state of the environment).\n\n===Rotational decoherence===\nConsider a system of ''N'' qubits that is coupled to a bath symmetrically. Suppose this system of ''N'' qubits undergoes a rotation around the <math>|{\\uparrow}\\rangle \\langle{\\uparrow}|, |{\\downarrow}\\rangle \\langle{\\downarrow}|</math> <math>\\big(|0\\rangle \\langle0|, |1\\rangle \\langle1|\\big)</math> eigenstates of <math>\\hat{J_z}</math>. Then under such a rotation, a random [[Phase factor|phase]] <math>\\phi</math> will be created between the eigenstates <math>|0\\rangle</math>, <math>|1\\rangle</math> of <math>\\hat{J_z}</math>. Thus these basis qubits <math>|0\\rangle</math> and <math>|1\\rangle</math> will transform in the following way:\n\n: <math>|0\\rangle \\to |0\\rangle, \\quad |1\\rangle \\to e^{i\\phi} |1\\rangle.</math>\n\nThis transformation is performed by the rotation operator\n\n: <math>R_z(\\phi) =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n 1 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & e^{i\\phi} \n\\end{pmatrix}\n.</math>\n\nSince any qubit in this space can be expressed in terms of the basis qubits, then all such qubits will be transformed under this rotation.\nConsider a qubit in a pure state <math>|\\psi_j\\rangle = a |0_j\\rangle + b |1_j\\rangle</math>. This state will decohere, since it is not \"encoded\" with the dephasing factor <math>e^{i\\phi}</math>. This can be seen by examining the [[density matrix]] averaged over all values of <math>\\phi</math>:\n\n: <math>\\rho_j = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty R_z(\\phi) |\\psi_j\\rangle \\langle\\psi_j|R_z^\\dagger(\\phi) p(\\phi) \\,d\\phi,</math>\n\nwhere <math>p(\\phi)</math> is a [[probability density]]. If <math>p(\\phi)</math> is given as a [[Gaussian distribution]]\n\n: <math>p(\\phi) = (4\\pi\\alpha)^{-1/2} e^{\\frac{-\\phi^2}{4\\alpha}},</math>\n\nthen the density matrix is\n\n:<math> \\rho_j =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n |a|^2 & ab^* e^{-\\alpha} \\\\\n a^*be^{-\\alpha} & |b|^2 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n.</math>\n\nSince the off-diagonal elements\u2014the coherence terms\u2014decay for increasing <math>\\alpha</math>, then the density matrices for the various qubits of the system will be indistinguishable. This means that no measurement can distinguish between the qubits, thus creating decoherence between the various qubit states. In particular, this dephasing process causes the qubits to collapse onto the <math>|0\\rangle \\langle0|, |1\\rangle \\langle1|</math> axis.\nThis is why this type of decoherence process is called '''collective dephasing''', because the ''mutual'' phases between ''all'' qubits of the ''N''-qubit system are destroyed.\n\n===Depolarizing===\n'''Depolarizing''' is a non-unitary transformation on a quantum system which [[Linear map|maps]] pure states to mixed states. This is a non-unitary process, because any transformation that reverses this process will map states out of their respective Hilbert space thus not preserving positivity (i.e. the original [[Probability|probabilities]] are mapped to negative probabilities, which is not allowed). The 2-dimensional case of such a transformation would consist of mapping pure states on the surface of the [[Bloch sphere]] to mixed states within the Bloch sphere. This would contract the Bloch sphere by some finite amount and the reverse process would expand the Bloch sphere, which cannot happen.\n\n===Dissipation===\n{{Main| Quantum dissipation}}\n'''Dissipation''' is a decohering process by which the populations of quantum states are changed due to entanglement with a bath. An example of this would be a quantum system that can exchange its energy with a bath through the [[Decoherence-free subspaces#Operator-sum representation formulation|interaction Hamiltonian]]. If the system is not in its [[ground state]] and the bath is at a temperature lower than that of the system's, then the system will give off energy to the bath, and thus higher-energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian will decohere to the ground state after cooling and, as such, will all be non-[[Degenerate form|degenerate]]. Since the states are no longer degenerate, they are not distinguishable, and thus this process is irreversible (non-unitary).\n\n==Timescales==\nDecoherence represents an extremely fast process for macroscopic objects, since these are interacting with many microscopic objects, with an enormous number of degrees of freedom, in their natural environment. The process explains why we tend not to observe quantum behaviour in everyday macroscopic objects. It also explains why we do see classical fields emerge from the properties of the interaction between matter and radiation for large amounts of matter.  The time taken for off-diagonal components of the density matrix to effectively vanish is called the '''decoherence time'''. It is typically extremely short for everyday, macroscale processes.<ref name=\"zurek03\"/><ref name=\"zurek91\"/><ref name=\"Zurek02\"/>\n\n==Measurement==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe discontinuous \"wave-function collapse\" postulated in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] to enable the theory to be related to the results of laboratory measurements cannot be understood as an aspect of the normal dynamics of quantum mechanics via the decoherence process.  Decoherence is an important part of some modern refinements of the Copenhagen interpretation. Decoherence shows how a macroscopic system interacting with many microscopic systems (e.g. collisions with air molecules or photons) moves from being in a pure quantum state\u2014which in general will be a coherent superposition (see [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]])\u2014to being in an incoherent improper mixture of these states. The weighting of each outcome in the mixture in case of measurement is exactly that which gives the probabilities of the different results of such a measurement.\n\nHowever, decoherence by itself may not give a complete solution of the [[measurement problem]], since all components of the wave function still exist in a global [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], which is explicitly acknowledged in the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. All decoherence explains, in this view, is why these coherences are no longer available for inspection by local observers. To present a solution to the measurement problem in most [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]], decoherence must be supplied with some nontrivial interpretational considerations (as for example [[Wojciech H. Zurek|Wojciech Zurek]] tends to do in his ''existential interpretation'').  However, according to [[Hugh Everett|Everett]] and [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]], the many-worlds interpretation can be derived from the formalism alone, in which case no extra interpretational layer is required.\n\n==Mathematical details==\nWe assume for the moment that the system in question consists of a subsystem ''A'' being studied and the \"environment\" <math>\\epsilon</math>, and the total [[Hilbert space]] is the [[tensor product]] of a Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H_A</math> describing ''A'' and a Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H_\\epsilon</math> describing <math>\\epsilon</math>, that is,\n\n:<math>\\mathcal H = \\mathcal H_A \\otimes \\mathcal H_\\epsilon.</math>\n\nThis is a reasonably good approximation in the case where ''A'' and <math>\\epsilon</math> are relatively independent (e.g. there is nothing like parts of ''A'' mixing with parts of <math>\\epsilon</math> or conversely). The point is, the interaction with the environment is for all practical purposes unavoidable (e.g. even a single excited atom in a vacuum would emit a photon, which would then go off). Let's say this interaction is described by a [[unitary transformation]] ''U'' acting upon <math>\\mathcal H</math>. Assume that the initial state of the environment is <math>|\\text{in}\\rangle</math>, and the initial state of ''A'' is the superposition state\n\n: <math>c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2 |\\psi_2\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|\\psi_1\\rangle</math> and <math>|\\psi_2\\rangle</math> are orthogonal, and there is no [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] initially. Also, choose an orthonormal basis <math>\\{ |e_i\\rangle \\}_i</math> for <math>\\mathcal H_A</math>. (This could be a \"continuously indexed basis\" or a mixture of continuous and discrete indexes, in which case we would have to use a [[rigged Hilbert space]] and be more careful about what we mean by orthonormal, but that's an inessential detail for expository purposes.) Then, we can expand\n\n: <math>U\\big(|\\psi_1\\rangle \\otimes |\\text{in}\\rangle\\big)</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>U\\big(|\\psi_2\\rangle \\otimes |\\text{in}\\rangle\\big)</math>\n\nuniquely as\n\n: <math>\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\otimes |f_{1i}\\rangle</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\otimes |f_{2i}\\rangle</math>\n\nrespectively. One thing to realize is that the environment contains a huge number of degrees of freedom, a good number of them interacting with each other all the time. This makes the following assumption reasonable in a handwaving way, which can be shown to be true in some simple toy models. Assume that there exists a basis for <math>\\mathcal H_\\epsilon</math> such that <math>|f_{1i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{1j}\\rangle</math> are all approximately orthogonal to a good degree if ''i'' \u2260 ''j'' and the same thing for <math>|f_{2i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{2j}\\rangle</math> and also for <math>|f_{1i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{2j}\\rangle</math> for any ''i'' and ''j'' (the decoherence property).\n\nThis often turns out to be true (as a reasonable conjecture) in the position basis because how ''A'' interacts with the environment would often depend critically upon the position of the objects in ''A''. Then, if we take the [[partial trace]] over the environment, we would find the density state{{clarify|date=October 2018}} is approximately described by\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\big(\\langle f_{1i}|f_{1i}\\rangle + \\langle f_{2i}|f_{2i}\\rangle\\big) |e_i\\rangle \\langle e_i|,</math>\n\nthat is, we have a diagonal [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]], there is no constructive or destructive interference, and the \"probabilities\" add up classically. The time it takes for ''U''(''t'') (the unitary operator as a function of time) to display the decoherence property is called the '''decoherence time'''.\n\n==Experimental observations==\n\n===Quantitative measurement===\nThe decoherence rate depends on a number of factors, including temperature or uncertainty in position, and many experiments have tried to measure it depending on the external environment.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.stahlke.org/dan/phys-papers/qm652-project.pdf\n| title=Quantum Decoherence and the Measurement Problem\n| author=Dan Stahlke\n| accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe process of a quantum superposition gradually obliterated by decoherence was quantitatively measured for the first time by [[Serge Haroche]] and his co-workers at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in [[Paris]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal\n | authors =M.

The two quantum states both cause shifts in the phase of the microwave field, but by different amounts, so that the field itself is also put into a superposition of two states. Due to photon scattering on cavity-mirror imperfection, the cavity field loses phase coherence to the environment.\n\nHaroche and his colleagues measured the resulting decoherence via correlations between the states of pairs of atoms sent through the cavity with various time delays between the atoms.\n\n===Reducing environmental decoherence===\nIn July 2011, researchers from [[University of British Columbia]] and [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] were able to reduce environmental decoherence rate \"to levels far below the threshold necessary for quantum information processing\" by applying high magnetic fields in their experiment.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/07/20/discovery-may-overcome-obstacle-for-quantum-computing-ubc-california-researchers/\n| title=Discovery may overcome obstacle for quantum computing: UBC, California researchers\n| publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]\n| quote=Our theory also predicted that we could suppress the decoherence, and push the decoherence rate in the experiment to levels far below the threshold necessary for quantum information processing, by applying high magnetic fields.

Decoherence provides an ''explanatory mechanism'' for the ''appearance'' of wave function collapse and was first developed by [[David Bohm]] in 1952, who applied it to [[Louis DeBroglie]]'s [[pilot-wave]] theory, producing [[Bohmian mechanics]],<ref name=\"bohm52a\">[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\", I, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp. 166\u2013179.</ref><ref name=\"bohm52b\">[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\", II, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp. 180\u2013193.</ref> the first successful hidden-variables interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Decoherence explains why a quantum system begins to obey classical probability rules after interacting with its environment (due to the suppression of the interference terms when applying Born's probability rules to the system).\n\n==Outside instances of decoherence==\nDecoherent is also a popular online personality, primarily known for his gaming videos on [[Youtube]], beyond the naming, there is no correlation between Decoherent and Quantum Decoherence\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Dephasing]]\n* [[Dephasing rate SP formula]]\n* [[Einselection]]\n* [[Ghirardi\u2013Rimini\u2013Weber theory]]\n* [[H.

As long as there exists a definite phase relation between different states, the system is said to be coherent. A definite phase relationship is necessary to perform [[quantum computing]] on quantum information encoded in quantum states. Coherence is preserved under the laws of quantum physics.\n\nIf a quantum system were perfectly isolated, it would maintain coherence indefinitely, but it would be impossible to manipulate or investigate it. If it is not perfectly isolated, for example during a measurement, coherence is shared with the environment and appears to be lost with time; a process called quantum decoherence. As a result of this process, quantum behavior is apparently lost, just as energy appears to be lost by friction in classical mechanics.\n\nDecoherence was first introduced in 1970 by the German physicist [[H. Dieter Zeh]]<ref name=\"Zeh\">[[H.

As with any coupling, [[Quantum entanglement|entanglements]] are generated between the system and environment.  These have the effect of sharing [[quantum information]] with\u2014or transferring it to\u2014the surroundings.\n\nDecoherence has been used to understand the [[collapse of the wave function]] in quantum mechanics. Decoherence does not generate ''actual'' wave-function collapse.  It only provides an explanation for ''apparent'' wave-function collapse, as the quantum nature of the system \"leaks\" into the environment.  That is, components of the wave function are decoupled from a [[Quantum coherence|coherent system]] and acquire phases from their immediate surroundings.  A total superposition of the global or [[universal wavefunction]] still exists (and remains coherent at the global level), but its ultimate fate remains an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretational issue]].  Specifically, decoherence does not attempt to explain the [[measurement problem]].  Rather, decoherence provides an explanation for the transition of the system to a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixture of states]] that seem to correspond to those states observers perceive.  Moreover, our observation tells us that this mixture looks like a proper [[quantum ensemble]] in a measurement situation, as we observe that measurements lead to the \"realization\" of precisely one state in the \"ensemble\".\n\nDecoherence represents a challenge for the practical realization of [[quantum computer]]s, since such machines are expected to rely heavily on the undisturbed evolution of quantum coherences.  Simply put, they require that the coherence of states be preserved and that decoherence is managed, in order to actually perform quantum computation.  The preservation of coherence, and mitigation of decoherence effects, are thus related to the concept of [[quantum error correction]].\n\n==Mechanisms==\nTo examine how decoherence operates, an \"intuitive\" model is presented.  The model requires some familiarity with quantum theory basics.  Analogies are made between visualisable classical [[phase space]]s and [[Hilbert space]]s.  A more rigorous derivation in [[Dirac notation]] shows how decoherence destroys interference effects and the \"quantum nature\" of systems.  Next, the [[density matrix]] approach is presented for perspective.\n\n[[File:Quantum superposition of states and decoherence.ogv|thumb|upright=1.5|Quantum superposition of states and decoherence measurement through [[Rabi cycle|Rabi oscillations]]]]\n\n===Phase-space picture===\nAn ''N''-particle system can be represented in non-relativistic quantum mechanics by a [[wave function]] <math>\\psi(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_N)</math>, where each ''x<sub>i</sub>'' is a point in 3-dimensional space.  This has analogies with the classical [[phase space]].  A classical phase space contains a real-valued function in 6''N'' dimensions (each particle contributes 3 spatial coordinates and 3 momenta).  Our \"quantum\" phase space, on the other hand, involves a complex-valued function on a 3''N''-dimensional space.  The position and momenta are represented by operators that do not [[Commutativity|commute]], and <math>\\psi</math> lives in the mathematical structure of a [[Hilbert space]].  Aside from these differences, however, the rough analogy holds.\n\nDifferent previously isolated, non-interacting systems occupy different phase spaces. Alternatively we can say that they occupy different lower-dimensional [[Linear subspace|subspaces]] in the phase space of the joint system.  The ''effective'' dimensionality of a system's phase space is the number of ''[[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]'' present, which\u2014in non-relativistic models\u2014is 6 times the number of a system's ''free'' particles.  For a [[macroscopic]] system this will be a very large dimensionality.  When two systems (and the environment would be a system) start to interact, though, their associated state vectors are no longer constrained to the subspaces.  Instead the combined state vector time-evolves a path through the \"larger volume\", whose dimensionality is the sum of the dimensions of the two subspaces.  The extent to which two vectors interfere with each other is a measure of how \"close\" they are to each other (formally, their overlap or Hilbert space multiplies together) in the phase space.  When a system couples to an external environment, the dimensionality of, and hence \"volume\" available to, the joint state vector increases enormously. Each environmental degree of freedom contributes an extra dimension.\n\nThe original system's wave function can be expanded in many different ways as a sum of elements in a quantum superposition.  Each expansion corresponds to a projection of the wave vector onto a basis.  The basis can be chosen at will.  Let us choose an expansion where the resulting basis elements interact with the environment in an element-specific way.  Such elements will\u2014with overwhelming probability\u2014be rapidly separated from each other by their natural unitary time evolution along their own independent paths.  After a very short interaction, there is almost no chance of any further interference.  The process is effectively [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|irreversible]].  The different elements effectively become \"lost\" from each other in the expanded phase space created by coupling with the environment; in phase space, this decoupling is monitored through the [[Wigner quasi-probability distribution]].  The original elements are said to have ''decohered''.  The environment has effectively selected out those expansions or decompositions of the original state vector that decohere (or lose phase coherence) with each other.  This is called \"environmentally-induced superselection\", or [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\">{{cite journal | last1 = Zurek | first1 = Wojciech H. | year = 2003 | title = Decoherence, einselection, and the quantum origins of the classical | arxiv = quant-ph/0105127 | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 75 | issue = 3| page = 715 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.75.715 | bibcode=2003RvMP...75..715Z| title-link = einselection }}</ref> The decohered elements of the system no longer exhibit [[quantum interference]] between each other, as in a [[double-slit experiment]].  Any elements that decohere from each other via environmental interactions are said to be [[quantum entanglement|quantum-entangled]] with the environment.  The converse is not true: not all entangled states are decohered from each other.\n\nAny measuring device or apparatus acts as an environment, since at some stage along the measuring chain, it has to be large enough to be read by humans. It must possess a very large number of hidden degrees of freedom.  In effect, the interactions may be considered to be [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]]. As a result of an interaction, the wave functions of the system and the measuring device become entangled with each other. Decoherence happens when different portions of the system's wave function become entangled in different ways with the measuring device. For two einselected elements of the entangled system's state to interfere, both the original system and the measuring in both elements device must significantly overlap, in the scalar product sense.  If the measuring device has many degrees of freedom, it is ''very'' unlikely for this to happen.\n\nAs a consequence, the system behaves as a classical [[statistical ensemble]] of the different elements rather than as a single coherent [[quantum superposition]] of them. From the perspective of each ensemble member's measuring device, the system appears to have irreversibly collapsed onto a state with a precise value for the measured attributes, relative to that element.\n\n===Dirac notation===\nUsing [[Dirac notation]], let the system initially be in the state\n\n: <math>|\\psi\\rang = \\sum_i |i\\rang \\lang i |\\psi\\rang,</math>\n\nwhere the <math>|i\\rang</math>s form an [[einselection|einselected]] [[eigenbasis|basis]] (''environmentally induced selected eigenbasis''<ref name=\"zurek03\"/>), and let the environment initially be in the state <math>|\\epsilon\\rang</math>.  The [[vector basis]] of the combination of the system and the environment consists of the [[tensor product]]s of the basis vectors of the two subsystems.  Thus, before any interaction between the two subsystems, the joint state can be written as\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang = \\sum_i |i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang</math> is shorthand for the tensor product <math>|i\\rang \\otimes |\\epsilon\\rang</math>. There are two extremes in the way the system can interact with its environment: either (1) the system loses its distinct identity and merges with the environment (e.g. photons in a cold, dark cavity get converted into molecular excitations within the cavity walls), or (2) the system is not disturbed at all, even though the environment is disturbed (e.g. the idealized non-disturbing measurement).  In general, an interaction is a mixture of these two extremes that we examine.\n\n====System absorbed by environment====\nIf the environment absorbs the system, each element of the total system's basis interacts with the environment such that\n\n: <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang </math> evolves into <math>|\\epsilon_i\\rang,</math>\n\nand so\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang</math> evolves into <math>|\\text{after}\\rang = \\sum_i |\\epsilon_i\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang.</math>\n\nThe [[unitarity]] of time evolution demands that the total state basis remains [[orthonormal]], i.e. the [[scalar product|scalar]] or [[inner product]]s of the basis vectors must vanish, since <math>\\lang i|j\\rang = \\delta_{ij}</math>:\n\n: <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij}.</math>\n\nThis orthonormality of the environment states is the defining characteristic required for [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\"/>\n\n====System not disturbed by environment====\nIn an idealised measurement, the system disturbs the environment, but is itself undisturbed by the environment.\nIn this case, each element of the basis interacts with the environment such that\n\n: <math>|i\\rang |\\epsilon\\rang</math> evolves into the product <math>|i, \\epsilon_i\\rang = |i\\rang |\\epsilon_i\\rang,</math>\n\nand so\n\n: <math>|\\text{before}\\rang</math> evolves into <math>|\\text{after}\\rang = \\sum_i |i, \\epsilon_i\\rang \\lang i|\\psi\\rang.</math>\n\nIn this case, [[unitarity (physics)|unitarity]] demands that\n\n: <math>\\lang i, \\epsilon_i|j, \\epsilon_j\\rang = \\lang i|j\\rang \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij} \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij} \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_i\\rang = \\delta_{ij},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\lang \\epsilon_i | \\epsilon_i \\rang = 1</math> was used. ''Additionally'', decoherence requires, by virtue of the large number of hidden degrees of freedom in the environment, that\n\n: <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\approx \\delta_{ij}.</math>\n\nAs before, this is the defining characteristic for decoherence to become [[einselection]].<ref name=\"zurek03\"/> The approximation becomes more exact as the number of environmental degrees of freedom affected increases.\n\nNote that if the system basis <math>|i\\rang</math> were not an einselected basis, then the last condition is trivial, since the disturbed environment is not a function of <math>i</math>, and we have the trivial disturbed environment basis <math>|\\epsilon_j\\rang = |\\epsilon'\\rang</math>.  This would correspond to the system basis being degenerate with respect to the environmentally defined measurement observable.  For a complex environmental interaction (which would be expected for a typical macroscale interaction) a non-einselected basis would be hard to define.\n\n===Loss of interference and the transition from quantum to classical probabilities===\nThe utility of decoherence lies in its application to the analysis of probabilities, before and after environmental interaction, and in particular to the vanishing of [[quantum interference]] terms after decoherence has occurred.  If we ask what is the probability of observing the system making a [[Quantum state|transition]] from <math>\\psi</math> to <math>\\phi</math> ''before'' <math>\\psi</math> has interacted with its environment, then application of the [[Born probability]] rule states that the transition probability is the squared modulus of the scalar product of the two states:\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{before}(\\psi \\to \\phi) = \\left|\\lang\\psi|\\phi\\rang\\right|^2 = \\left|\\sum_i \\psi^*_i \\phi_i\\right|^2 = \\sum_i |\\psi_i^* \\phi_i|^2 + \\sum_{ij; i \\ne j} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\phi^*_j \\phi_i ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\psi_i = \\lang i|\\psi\\rang</math>, <math>\\psi_i^* = \\lang\\psi|i\\rang</math>, and <math>\\phi_i = \\lang i|\\phi\\rang</math> etc.\n\nThe above expansion of the transition probability has terms that involve <math>i \\ne j</math>; these can be thought of as representing ''interference'' between the different basis elements or quantum alternatives.  This is a purely quantum effect and represents the non-additivity of the probabilities of quantum alternatives.\n\nTo calculate the probability of observing the system making a quantum leap from <math>\\psi</math> to <math>\\phi</math> ''after'' <math>\\psi</math> has interacted with its environment, then application of the [[Born probability]] rule states that we must sum over all the relevant possible states <math>|\\epsilon_i\\rang</math> of the environment ''before'' squaring the modulus:\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{after}(\\psi \\to \\phi) = \\sum_j \\,\\left|\\lang\\text{after}\\right| \\phi, \\epsilon_j \\rang|^2 = \\sum_j \\,\\left|\\sum_i \\psi_i^* \\lang i, \\epsilon_i|\\phi, \\epsilon_j\\rang\\right|^2 = \\sum_j\\left|\\sum_i \\psi_i^* \\phi_i \\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\right|^2.</math>\n\nThe internal summation vanishes when we apply the decoherence/[[einselection]] condition <math>\\lang\\epsilon_i|\\epsilon_j\\rang \\approx \\delta_{ij}</math>, and the formula simplifies to\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{prob}_\\text{after}(\\psi \\to \\phi) \\approx \\sum_j |\\psi_j^* \\phi_j|^2 =\n\\sum_i |\\psi^*_i \\phi_i|^2.</math>\n\nIf we compare this with the formula we derived before the environment introduced decoherence, we can see that the effect of decoherence has been to move the summation sign <math>\\textstyle\\sum_i</math> from inside of the modulus sign to outside.  As a result, all the cross- or [[quantum interference]]-terms\n\n: <math>\\sum_{ij; i \\ne j} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\phi^*_j \\phi_i</math>\n\nhave vanished from the transition-probability calculation.

Let <math>\\mathcal H_S</math> and <math>\\mathcal H_B</math> be the system's and bath's Hilbert spaces respectively. Then the Hamiltonian for the combined system is\n\n: <math>\\hat{H} = \\hat H_S \\otimes \\hat I_B + \\hat I_S \\otimes \\hat H_B + \\hat H_I,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat H_S, \\hat H_B</math> are the system and bath Hamiltonians respectively, <math>\\hat H_I</math> is the interaction Hamiltonian between the system and bath, and <math>\\hat I_S, \\hat I_B</math> are the identity operators on the system and bath Hilbert spaces respectively. The time-evolution of the [[density operator]] of this closed system is unitary and, as such, is given by\n\n: <math>\\rho_{SB}(t) = \\hat U(t) \\rho_{SB}(0) \\hat U^\\dagger(t),</math>\n\nwhere the unitary operator is <math>\\hat U = e^{-i\\hat{H}t/\\hbar}</math>. If the system and bath are not [[Quantum entanglement|entangled]] initially, then we can write <math>\\rho_{SB} = \\rho_S \\otimes \\rho_B</math>. Therefore, the evolution of the system becomes\n\n: <math>\\rho_{SB}(t) = \\hat U (t)[\\rho_S(0) \\otimes \\rho_B(0)] \\hat U^\\dagger(t).</math>\n\nThe system\u2013bath interaction Hamiltonian can be written in a general form as\n\n: <math>\\hat H_I = \\sum_i \\hat S_i \\otimes \\hat B_i,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat S_i \\otimes \\hat B_i</math> is the operator acting on the combined system\u2013bath Hilbert space, and <math>\\hat S_i, \\hat B_i</math> are the operators that act on the system and bath respectively. This coupling of the system and bath is the cause of decoherence in the system alone. To see this, a [[partial trace]] is performed over the bath to give a description of the system alone:\n\n: <math>\\rho_S(t) = \\operatorname{Tr}_B\\big[\\hat U(t)[\\rho_S(0) \\otimes \\rho_B(0)] \\hat U^\\dagger(t)\\big].</math>\n\n<math>\\rho_S(t)</math> is called the ''reduced density matrix'' and gives information about the system only. If the bath is written in terms of its set of orthogonal basis kets, that is, if it has been initially diagonalized, then <math>\\textstyle\\rho_B(0) = \\sum_j a_j |j\\rangle \\langle j|</math>. Computing the partial trace with respect to this (computational) basis gives\n\n: <math>\\rho_S(t) = \\sum_l \\hat A_l \\rho_S(0) \\hat A^\\dagger_l,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\hat A_l, \\hat A^\\dagger_l</math> are defined as the ''Kraus operators'' and are represented as\n\n: <math>\\hat A_l = \\sqrt{a_j} \\langle k| \\hat U |j\\rangle.</math>\n\nThis is known as the ''[[Decoherence-free subspaces#Operator-sum representation formulation|operator-sum representation]]'' (OSR). A condition on the Kraus operators can be obtained by using the fact that <math>\\operatorname{Tr}[\\rho_S(t)] = 1</math>; this then gives\n\n: <math>\\sum_l \\hat A^\\dagger_l \\hat A_l = \\hat I_S.</math>\n\nThis restriction determines whether decoherence will occur or not in the OSR. In particular, when there is more than one term present in the sum for <math>\\rho_S(t)</math>, then the dynamics of the system will be non-unitary, and hence decoherence will take place.\n\n===Semigroup approach===\nA more general consideration for the existence of decoherence in a quantum system is given by the ''master equation'', which determines how the density matrix of the ''system alone'' evolves in time (see also the [[Belavkin equation]]<ref name=Belavkin89>{{cite journal\n | author = V.

In particular, the non-unitary dynamics are represented by <math>L_D</math>, whereas the unitary dynamics of the state are represented by the usual [[Heisenberg commutator]]. Note that when <math>L_D\\big[\\rho_S(t)\\big] = 0</math>, the dynamical evolution of the system is unitary. The conditions for the evolution of the system density matrix to be described by the master equation are:<ref name=\"Lidar and Whaley\"/>\n# the evolution of the system density matrix is determined by a one-parameter [[semigroup]],\n# the evolution is \"completely positive\" (i.e. probabilities are preserved),\n# the system and bath density matrices are ''initially'' decoupled.\n\n==Examples of non-unitary modelling of decoherence==\n[[Decoherence]] can be modelled as a non-[[Unitary operator|unitary]] process by which a system couples with its environment (although the combined system plus environment evolves in a unitary fashion).<ref name=\"Lidar and Whaley\"/> Thus the [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] of the system alone, treated in isolation, are non-unitary and, as such, are represented by [[irreversibility|irreversible transformations]] acting on the system's [[Hilbert space]] <math>\\mathcal{H}</math>. Since the system's dynamics are represented by irreversible representations, then any information present in the quantum system can be lost to the environment or [[heat bath]]. Alternatively, the decay of quantum information caused by the coupling of the system to the environment is referred to as decoherence.<ref name=\"Bacon\"/> Thus decoherence is the process by which information of a quantum system is altered by the system's interaction with its environment (which form a closed system), hence creating an [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] between the system and heat bath (environment). As such, since the system is entangled with its environment in some unknown way, a description of the system by itself cannot be made without also referring to the environment (i.e. without also describing the state of the environment).\n\n===Rotational decoherence===\nConsider a system of ''N'' qubits that is coupled to a bath symmetrically. Suppose this system of ''N'' qubits undergoes a rotation around the <math>|{\\uparrow}\\rangle \\langle{\\uparrow}|, |{\\downarrow}\\rangle \\langle{\\downarrow}|</math> <math>\\big(|0\\rangle \\langle0|, |1\\rangle \\langle1|\\big)</math> eigenstates of <math>\\hat{J_z}</math>. Then under such a rotation, a random [[Phase factor|phase]] <math>\\phi</math> will be created between the eigenstates <math>|0\\rangle</math>, <math>|1\\rangle</math> of <math>\\hat{J_z}</math>. Thus these basis qubits <math>|0\\rangle</math> and <math>|1\\rangle</math> will transform in the following way:\n\n: <math>|0\\rangle \\to |0\\rangle, \\quad |1\\rangle \\to e^{i\\phi} |1\\rangle.</math>\n\nThis transformation is performed by the rotation operator\n\n: <math>R_z(\\phi) =\n\\begin{pmatrix} \n 1 & 0 \\\\ \n 0 & e^{i\\phi} \n\\end{pmatrix}\n.</math>\n\nSince any qubit in this space can be expressed in terms of the basis qubits, then all such qubits will be transformed under this rotation.\nConsider a qubit in a pure state <math>|\\psi_j\\rangle = a |0_j\\rangle + b |1_j\\rangle</math>. This state will decohere, since it is not \"encoded\" with the dephasing factor <math>e^{i\\phi}</math>. This can be seen by examining the [[density matrix]] averaged over all values of <math>\\phi</math>:\n\n: <math>\\rho_j = \\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^\\infty R_z(\\phi) |\\psi_j\\rangle \\langle\\psi_j|R_z^\\dagger(\\phi) p(\\phi) \\,d\\phi,</math>\n\nwhere <math>p(\\phi)</math> is a [[probability density]]. If <math>p(\\phi)</math> is given as a [[Gaussian distribution]]\n\n: <math>p(\\phi) = (4\\pi\\alpha)^{-1/2} e^{\\frac{-\\phi^2}{4\\alpha}},</math>\n\nthen the density matrix is\n\n:<math> \\rho_j =\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n |a|^2 & ab^* e^{-\\alpha} \\\\\n a^*be^{-\\alpha} & |b|^2 \n\\end{pmatrix}\n.</math>\n\nSince the off-diagonal elements\u2014the coherence terms\u2014decay for increasing <math>\\alpha</math>, then the density matrices for the various qubits of the system will be indistinguishable. This means that no measurement can distinguish between the qubits, thus creating decoherence between the various qubit states. In particular, this dephasing process causes the qubits to collapse onto the <math>|0\\rangle \\langle0|, |1\\rangle \\langle1|</math> axis.\nThis is why this type of decoherence process is called '''collective dephasing''', because the ''mutual'' phases between ''all'' qubits of the ''N''-qubit system are destroyed.\n\n===Depolarizing===\n'''Depolarizing''' is a non-unitary transformation on a quantum system which [[Linear map|maps]] pure states to mixed states. This is a non-unitary process, because any transformation that reverses this process will map states out of their respective Hilbert space thus not preserving positivity (i.e. the original [[Probability|probabilities]] are mapped to negative probabilities, which is not allowed). The 2-dimensional case of such a transformation would consist of mapping pure states on the surface of the [[Bloch sphere]] to mixed states within the Bloch sphere. This would contract the Bloch sphere by some finite amount and the reverse process would expand the Bloch sphere, which cannot happen.\n\n===Dissipation===\n{{Main| Quantum dissipation}}\n'''Dissipation''' is a decohering process by which the populations of quantum states are changed due to entanglement with a bath. An example of this would be a quantum system that can exchange its energy with a bath through the [[Decoherence-free subspaces#Operator-sum representation formulation|interaction Hamiltonian]]. If the system is not in its [[ground state]] and the bath is at a temperature lower than that of the system's, then the system will give off energy to the bath, and thus higher-energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian will decohere to the ground state after cooling and, as such, will all be non-[[Degenerate form|degenerate]]. Since the states are no longer degenerate, they are not distinguishable, and thus this process is irreversible (non-unitary).\n\n==Timescales==\nDecoherence represents an extremely fast process for macroscopic objects, since these are interacting with many microscopic objects, with an enormous number of degrees of freedom, in their natural environment. The process explains why we tend not to observe quantum behaviour in everyday macroscopic objects. It also explains why we do see classical fields emerge from the properties of the interaction between matter and radiation for large amounts of matter.  The time taken for off-diagonal components of the density matrix to effectively vanish is called the '''decoherence time'''. It is typically extremely short for everyday, macroscale processes.<ref name=\"zurek03\"/><ref name=\"zurek91\"/><ref name=\"Zurek02\"/>\n\n==Measurement==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nThe discontinuous \"wave-function collapse\" postulated in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] to enable the theory to be related to the results of laboratory measurements cannot be understood as an aspect of the normal dynamics of quantum mechanics via the decoherence process.  Decoherence is an important part of some modern refinements of the Copenhagen interpretation. Decoherence shows how a macroscopic system interacting with many microscopic systems (e.g. collisions with air molecules or photons) moves from being in a pure quantum state\u2014which in general will be a coherent superposition (see [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]])\u2014to being in an incoherent improper mixture of these states. The weighting of each outcome in the mixture in case of measurement is exactly that which gives the probabilities of the different results of such a measurement.\n\nHowever, decoherence by itself may not give a complete solution of the [[measurement problem]], since all components of the wave function still exist in a global [[Quantum superposition|superposition]], which is explicitly acknowledged in the [[many-worlds interpretation]]. All decoherence explains, in this view, is why these coherences are no longer available for inspection by local observers. To present a solution to the measurement problem in most [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics|interpretations of quantum mechanics]], decoherence must be supplied with some nontrivial interpretational considerations (as for example [[Wojciech H. Zurek|Wojciech Zurek]] tends to do in his ''existential interpretation'').  However, according to [[Hugh Everett|Everett]] and [[Bryce DeWitt|DeWitt]], the many-worlds interpretation can be derived from the formalism alone, in which case no extra interpretational layer is required.\n\n==Mathematical details==\nWe assume for the moment that the system in question consists of a subsystem ''A'' being studied and the \"environment\" <math>\\epsilon</math>, and the total [[Hilbert space]] is the [[tensor product]] of a Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H_A</math> describing ''A'' and a Hilbert space <math>\\mathcal H_\\epsilon</math> describing <math>\\epsilon</math>, that is,\n\n:<math>\\mathcal H = \\mathcal H_A \\otimes \\mathcal H_\\epsilon.</math>\n\nThis is a reasonably good approximation in the case where ''A'' and <math>\\epsilon</math> are relatively independent (e.g. there is nothing like parts of ''A'' mixing with parts of <math>\\epsilon</math> or conversely). The point is, the interaction with the environment is for all practical purposes unavoidable (e.g. even a single excited atom in a vacuum would emit a photon, which would then go off). Let's say this interaction is described by a [[unitary transformation]] ''U'' acting upon <math>\\mathcal H</math>. Assume that the initial state of the environment is <math>|\\text{in}\\rangle</math>, and the initial state of ''A'' is the superposition state\n\n: <math>c_1 |\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2 |\\psi_2\\rangle,</math>\n\nwhere <math>|\\psi_1\\rangle</math> and <math>|\\psi_2\\rangle</math> are orthogonal, and there is no [[Quantum entanglement|entanglement]] initially. Also, choose an orthonormal basis <math>\\{ |e_i\\rangle \\}_i</math> for <math>\\mathcal H_A</math>. (This could be a \"continuously indexed basis\" or a mixture of continuous and discrete indexes, in which case we would have to use a [[rigged Hilbert space]] and be more careful about what we mean by orthonormal, but that's an inessential detail for expository purposes.) Then, we can expand\n\n: <math>U\\big(|\\psi_1\\rangle \\otimes |\\text{in}\\rangle\\big)</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>U\\big(|\\psi_2\\rangle \\otimes |\\text{in}\\rangle\\big)</math>\n\nuniquely as\n\n: <math>\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\otimes |f_{1i}\\rangle</math>\n\nand\n\n: <math>\\sum_i |e_i\\rangle \\otimes |f_{2i}\\rangle</math>\n\nrespectively. One thing to realize is that the environment contains a huge number of degrees of freedom, a good number of them interacting with each other all the time. This makes the following assumption reasonable in a handwaving way, which can be shown to be true in some simple toy models. Assume that there exists a basis for <math>\\mathcal H_\\epsilon</math> such that <math>|f_{1i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{1j}\\rangle</math> are all approximately orthogonal to a good degree if ''i'' \u2260 ''j'' and the same thing for <math>|f_{2i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{2j}\\rangle</math> and also for <math>|f_{1i}\\rangle</math> and <math>|f_{2j}\\rangle</math> for any ''i'' and ''j'' (the decoherence property).\n\nThis often turns out to be true (as a reasonable conjecture) in the position basis because how ''A'' interacts with the environment would often depend critically upon the position of the objects in ''A''. Then, if we take the [[partial trace]] over the environment, we would find the density state{{clarify|date=October 2018}} is approximately described by\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\big(\\langle f_{1i}|f_{1i}\\rangle + \\langle f_{2i}|f_{2i}\\rangle\\big) |e_i\\rangle \\langle e_i|,</math>\n\nthat is, we have a diagonal [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]], there is no constructive or destructive interference, and the \"probabilities\" add up classically. The time it takes for ''U''(''t'') (the unitary operator as a function of time) to display the decoherence property is called the '''decoherence time'''.\n\n==Experimental observations==\n\n===Quantitative measurement===\nThe decoherence rate depends on a number of factors, including temperature or uncertainty in position, and many experiments have tried to measure it depending on the external environment.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.stahlke.org/dan/phys-papers/qm652-project.pdf\n| title=Quantum Decoherence and the Measurement Problem\n| author=Dan Stahlke\n| accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe process of a quantum superposition gradually obliterated by decoherence was quantitatively measured for the first time by [[Serge Haroche]] and his co-workers at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]] in [[Paris]] in 1996.<ref>{{cite journal\n | authors =M.

The two quantum states both cause shifts in the phase of the microwave field, but by different amounts, so that the field itself is also put into a superposition of two states. Due to photon scattering on cavity-mirror imperfection, the cavity field loses phase coherence to the environment.\n\nHaroche and his colleagues measured the resulting decoherence via correlations between the states of pairs of atoms sent through the cavity with various time delays between the atoms.\n\n===Reducing environmental decoherence===\nIn July 2011, researchers from [[University of British Columbia]] and [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] were able to reduce environmental decoherence rate \"to levels far below the threshold necessary for quantum information processing\" by applying high magnetic fields in their experiment.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=http://www.publicaffairs.ubc.ca/2011/07/20/discovery-may-overcome-obstacle-for-quantum-computing-ubc-california-researchers/\n| title=Discovery may overcome obstacle for quantum computing: UBC, California researchers\n| publisher=[[University of British Columbia]]\n| quote=Our theory also predicted that we could suppress the decoherence, and push the decoherence rate in the experiment to levels far below the threshold necessary for quantum information processing, by applying high magnetic fields.

Decoherence provides an ''explanatory mechanism'' for the ''appearance'' of wave function collapse and was first developed by [[David Bohm]] in 1952, who applied it to [[Louis DeBroglie]]'s [[pilot-wave]] theory, producing [[Bohmian mechanics]],<ref name=\"bohm52a\">[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\", I, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp. 166\u2013179.</ref><ref name=\"bohm52b\">[[David Bohm]], A Suggested Interpretation of the Quantum Theory in Terms of \"Hidden Variables\", II, ''Physical Review'', (1952), 85, pp. 180\u2013193.</ref> the first successful hidden-variables interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Some versions of the Copenhagen interpretation have been modified to include decoherence.\n\nDecoherence does not claim to provide a mechanism for the actual wave-function collapse; rather it puts forth a reasonable mechanism for the appearance of wave-function collapse.

[...] We think of the environment as extremely complicated and essentially 'random' [...], accordingly we sum over the unknown states in the environment to obtain a density matrix [...] Under normal circumstances, one must regard the density matrix as some kind of approximation to the whole quantum truth.

Decoherence explains why a quantum system begins to obey classical probability rules after interacting with its environment (due to the suppression of the interference terms when applying Born's probability rules to the system).\n\n==Outside instances of decoherence==\n</ref>Decoherent is also a popular online personality, primarily known for his gaming videos on </ref>[[Youtube]], beyond the naming, there is no correlation between Decoherent and Quantum Decoherence \n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Dephasing]]\n* [[Dephasing rate SP formula]]\n* [[Einselection]]\n* [[Ghirardi\u2013Rimini\u2013Weber theory]]\n* [[H.
