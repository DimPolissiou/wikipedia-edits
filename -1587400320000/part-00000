Established in 1901, by U.S. Ambassador [[Bartlett Tripp]] and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Sterling]]. The law school is home to approximately 168 students and has more than 3,000 alumni. With 168 J.D. candidates, it is currently the second-smallest law school and smallest public law school student population among the [[American Bar Association]] accredited law schools.<ref name=\"abaenrollment\"/>\n\nThe University of South Dakota School of Law has produced eight [[Governor of South Dakota|Governors of South Dakota]] including as well as other key figures important to the development of the state, nearly the historical entirety of the [[South Dakota Supreme Court]] and [[United States District Court for the District of South Dakota|U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota]], thirteen members of the [[United States congressional delegations from South Dakota|U.S. Congress]], nineteen [[Attorney General of South Dakota|Attorney Generals of South Dakota]], and thirteen [[United States Attorney for the District of South Dakota|U.S. Attorneys for the District of South Dakota]], earning it the nickname \"the Alma Mater of the State.\"\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2\n| caption_align=center\n| header   = Law School Founders\n| image1   = Thomas Sterling cph.3b18891.jpg\n| width1   = 99\n| caption1 = U.S. Senator<br/>[[Thomas Sterling]]\n| alt1     = Thune\n\n| image2   = Bartlett Tripp 001.jpg\n| width2   = 151\n| caption2 = U.S. Ambassador<br/>[[Bartlett Tripp]]\n| alt2     = Rounds\n| footer = Sterling served as school's first dean from 1901-1911. Tripp served as the first professor until his death in 1911.\n}}\n\n===1901-1911 (The Sterling Years)===\n\nThe '''University of South Dakota College of Law''' was founded in 1901. [[Thomas Sterling]] served as the law school's first dean until 1911 when he left to become the third [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|U.S. Senator from South Dakota]]. During the [[Thomas Sterling|Sterling years]], the law school proved successful in developing attorneys for the new state. In fact, by the time Sterling was in Congress, two of his earliest graduates [[William Williamson (politician)|William Williamson]] and [[Royal C. Johnson]] were Congressmen themselves. Before Sterling and the College of Law, the few lawyers there were, came from eastern states or read law for admission into the bar.\n\nAlong with Sterling, U.S. Ambassador to Austria [[Bartlett Tripp]], was an integral part of establishing the school. Tripp was returning to South Dakota from his diplomatic post in Austria at the turn of the century. Tripp had been initially considered to be the running mate of President [[William McKinley]], his friend and [[Albany Law School]] classmate, but was overlooked in lieu of then-Governor of New York [[Teddy Roosevelt]]. With no other political opportunities left to him, Tripp devoted his full attention to establishing the College of Law. He played many roles in the law school, not only was he the school's first taxation and constitutional law professor but he had served as President of the first bar association, the Constitutional Convention of South Dakota & the commission to codify South Dakota's laws, as well as the last Chief Justice of the [[List of justices of the South Dakota Supreme Court#Past Justices|Dakota Territory Supreme Court]]. Tripp and his son-in-law [[Charles Hall Dillon]], a fellow professor, provided much of the law library's contents and upon Tripp's death donated much of his estate to the College of Law. It is speculated that had [[William McKinley]] not overlooked him for [[Vice President of the United States]] the College of Law may not have been founded as soon as it was. Thomas Sterling's 1911 departure was partly led by the death of his friend and colleague Bartlett Tripp.\n\n===1911-1984===\n[[File:South_Dakota_Congressional_Delegation_87th_Congress_1961-1963.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States congressional delegations from South Dakota|U.S. congressional delegation from South Dakota]] for the [[87th United States Congress|87th Congress]] contained three alumni from the class of 1927: Rep. [[Ellis Yarnal Berry|E.Y. Berry]], Sen. [[Joseph H. Bottum|Joseph Bottum]], and Rep. [[Harold Lovre]].]]\n\nIn 1911, Marshall McKusick became the school's second and subsequent longest-serving dean, serving until his death in 1950. The 1927 class proved to be one of the strongest classes in USD Law history, producing [[South Dakota Supreme Court|Frank Biegelmeier]], [[George T. Mickelson]], [[Ellis Yarnal Berry|E.Y. Berry]], [[Joseph H. Bottum|Joseph Bottum]], and [[Harold Lovre]]. A stronger class did not come until 1975, when USD Law produced [[Steven L. Zinter]], [[David Gilbertson]], [[Glen A. Severson]], [[Steve T. Kirby]], and [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota politician)|Tim Johnson]]. In 1982, the College of Law moved from its then-82-year-old building to a new building and was renamed the 'School of Law'. During this period the law school was led by the 11th [[Deputy Attorney General of the United States]] from the Nixon Administration, [[Ralph E. Erickson]].\n\n===1984-2016===\nIn 1984, South Dakota Supreme Court abolished the nearly century old practice of [[diploma privilege]], which previously admitted School of Law graduates into South Dakota bar without examination.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Dakota Codified Laws|publisher=West|pages=SD Sup Ct Rule 3 (1973); SDCL 16-16-6.1 (1983 Supp) (amended by 1983 SD Sess Laws ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 82-25); repealed by 1987 SD Sess Laws ch 406 (Supreme Court Rule 86-32))}}</ref> Also in 1984, [[The Camden 28|Camden 28]] member and Indian Law scholar [[Frank Pommersheim]] joined the faculty. From 1991 until 2011 Barry Vickery, a [[Vanderbilt University Law School|Vanderbilt]] law alumni, served as Dean of the School of Law.  During Vickery's tenure, noted federalist professor [[Patrick Garry]] joined the faculty in 2003.  Former CEO of the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Mayo Clinic|Mike Myers]] served on the faculty as an elder law professor. Myers, known for his eccentric behavior, resigned in 2012 and ran for Governor of South Dakota in [[2014 South Dakota gubernatorial election|the next election]]. In 2013, Thomas Earl Geu a [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Law|Nebraska]] law alumni, was hired from his previous position of interim dean into full dean.<ref>[http://www.jdjournal.com/2013/05/21/usd-hires-their-interim-dean-into-permanent-role/ June, Daniel,\"USD Hires Their Interim Dean into Permanent Role\"]</ref>\n\n===2016-present===\nIn June 2017, [[Mark Mickelson|George \"Mark\" Mickelson]], son and grandson of alumnus [[George S.

Established in 1901, by U.S. Ambassador [[Bartlett Tripp]] and U.S. Senator [[Thomas Sterling]]. The law school is home to approximately 168 students and has more than 3,000 alumni. With 168 J.D. candidates, it is currently the second-smallest law school and smallest public law school student population among the [[American Bar Association]] accredited law schools.<ref name=\"abaenrollment\"/> \n\nThe University of South Dakota School of Law has produced eight [[Governor of South Dakota|Governors of South Dakota]] including as well as other key figures important to the development of the state, nearly the historical entirety of the [[South Dakota Supreme Court]] and [[United States District Court for the District of South Dakota|U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota]], thirteen members of the [[United States congressional delegations from South Dakota|U.S. Congress]], nineteen [[Attorney General of South Dakota|Attorney Generals of South Dakota]], and thirteen [[United States Attorney for the District of South Dakota|U.S. Attorneys for the District of South Dakota]], earning it the nickname \"the Alma Mater of the State.\"\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2\n| caption_align=center\n| header   = Law School Founders\n| image1   = Thomas Sterling cph.3b18891.jpg\n| width1   = 99\n| caption1 = U.S. Senator<br/>[[Thomas Sterling]]\n| alt1     = Thune\n\n| image2   = Bartlett Tripp 001.jpg\n| width2   = 151\n| caption2 = U.S. Ambassador<br/>[[Bartlett Tripp]]\n| alt2     = Rounds\n| footer = Sterling served as school's first dean from 1901-1911. Tripp served as the first professor until his death in 1911.\n}}\n\n===1901-1911 (The Sterling Years)===\n\nThe '''University of South Dakota College of Law''' was founded in 1901. [[Thomas Sterling]] served as the law school's first dean until 1911 when he left to become the third [[List of United States Senators from South Dakota|U.S. Senator from South Dakota]]. During the [[Thomas Sterling|Sterling years]], the law school proved successful in developing attorneys for the new state. In fact, by the time Sterling was in Congress, two of his earliest graduates [[William Williamson (politician)|William Williamson]] and [[Royal C. Johnson]] were Congressmen themselves. Before Sterling and the College of Law, the few lawyers there were, came from eastern states or read law for admission into the bar.\n\nAlong with Sterling, U.S. Ambassador to Austria [[Bartlett Tripp]], was an integral part of establishing the school. Tripp was returning to South Dakota from his diplomatic post in Austria at the turn of the century. Tripp had been initially considered to be the running mate of President [[William McKinley]], his friend and [[Albany Law School]] classmate, but was overlooked in lieu of then-Governor of New York [[Teddy Roosevelt]]. With no other political opportunities left to him, Tripp devoted his full attention to establishing the College of Law. He played many roles in the law school, not only was he the school's first taxation and constitutional law professor but he had served as President of the first bar association, the Constitutional Convention of South Dakota & the commission to codify South Dakota's laws, as well as the last Chief Justice of the [[List of justices of the South Dakota Supreme Court#Past Justices|Dakota Territory Supreme Court]]. Tripp and his son-in-law [[Charles Hall Dillon]], a fellow professor, provided much of the law library's contents and upon Tripp's death donated much of his estate to the College of Law. It is speculated that had [[William McKinley]] not overlooked him for [[Vice President of the United States]] the College of Law may not have been founded as soon as it was. Thomas Sterling's 1911 departure was partly led by the death of his friend and colleague Bartlett Tripp.\n\n===1911-1984===\n[[File:South_Dakota_Congressional_Delegation_87th_Congress_1961-1963.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States congressional delegations from South Dakota|U.S. congressional delegation from South Dakota]] for the [[87th United States Congress|87th Congress]] contained three alumni from the class of 1927: Rep. [[Ellis Yarnal Berry|E.Y. Berry]], Sen. [[Joseph H. Bottum|Joseph Bottum]], and Rep. [[Harold Lovre]].]]\n\nIn 1911, Marshall McKusick became the school's second and subsequent longest-serving dean, serving until his death in 1950. The 1927 class proved to be one of the strongest classes in USD Law history, producing [[South Dakota Supreme Court|Frank Biegelmeier]], [[George T. Mickelson]], [[Ellis Yarnal Berry|E.Y. Berry]], [[Joseph H. Bottum|Joseph Bottum]], and [[Harold Lovre]]. A stronger class did not come until 1975, when USD Law produced [[Steven L. Zinter]], [[David Gilbertson]], [[Glen A. Severson]], [[Steve T. Kirby]], and [[Tim Johnson (South Dakota politician)|Tim Johnson]]. In 1982, the College of Law moved from its then-82-year-old building to a new building and was renamed the 'School of Law'. During this period the law school was led by the 11th [[Deputy Attorney General of the United States]] from the Nixon Administration, [[Ralph E. Erickson]].\n\n===1984-2016===\nIn 1984, South Dakota Supreme Court abolished the nearly century old practice of [[diploma privilege]], which previously admitted School of Law graduates into South Dakota bar without examination.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Dakota Codified Laws|publisher=West|pages=SD Sup Ct Rule 3 (1973); SDCL 16-16-6.1 (1983 Supp) (amended by 1983 SD Sess Laws ch 398 (Supreme Court Rule 82-25); repealed by 1987 SD Sess Laws ch 406 (Supreme Court Rule 86-32))}}</ref> Also in 1984, [[The Camden 28|Camden 28]] member and Indian Law scholar [[Frank Pommersheim]] joined the faculty.

During Vickery's tenure, noted federalist professor [[Patrick Garry]] joined the faculty in 2003.  Former CEO of the [[Mayo Clinic]], [[Mayo Clinic|Mike Myers]] served on the faculty as an elder law professor.

The school of law was founded in 1867, and remains the only public and non-profit law school in the state of [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=www.sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> The school has been accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] since 1925 and has been a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1924.<ref>[http://www.aals.org/about_memberschools.php AALS memberschools], aals.org, retrieved on 2-3-2010</ref>\n\nThe entering class of first-year law students in 2019 was composed of 212 students from 22 states. Fifty-two percent of students were from South Carolina, and minority students made up twenty percent of the class. Forty-six percent of incoming students were female, while Fifty-four percent were male.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/admissions/class_profile/index.php|title=Entering Class Profile - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=www.sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> In the 2020 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Law Schools,\" the South Carolina School of Law ranked #91.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-south-carolina-columbia-03143|title=Best Law Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe discussion of starting a law program began as early as 1810 when President [[Jonathan Maxcy]] recommended to the board of trustees of South Carolina College that the school establish a professorship of the law.  A resolution of the statehouse in 1823 requested the college to consider \"the propriety and advantage of establishing a Professorship of Law in that institution, and to report to this house, at the next session, the manner in which such a Professorship may be established, so as to be most advantageous to the community, and least expensive to the State.\"  The trustees replied that a professor should be hired, but that the courses should be offered only to graduates.  With that, the matter ended.\n\nWhen the modern University of South Carolina was formed from South Carolina College in December 1865, the act doing so also authorized the trustees to hire one or more persons to form classes to instruct on the law under such terms as the trustees should decide.  In 1866, the act was amended to require the trustees to do so on the quickest possible terms.\n\nIn January 1867, the trustees offered Chancellor J.A. Inglis the position, but he declined.  In 1868, the offer was next made to Col. A.C. Haskell who accepted and held the post until August 1868.  The course of study included the various branches of common law and equity, commercial, international, and constitutional law.  Although the program was meant to cover two years, many students completed it in one.  A moot court was also overseen by the professor to train students in the details of actual practice.  Four students started in the program, and two graduated in June 1868.\n\nThe program lapsed during the 1868-1869 academic year, but resumed the following term under the direction of the Hon. C.D. Melton.  The program continued until it was shuttered following the death of a subsequent professor, Chief Justice [[Franklin J. Moses, Sr.|Franklin J. Moses]], in 1877.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1868-1876), the law school graduated thirty-nine students. Eleven of these graduates were African-American.<ref name=\"sc.edu\">{{Cite web|url=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\nThe school resumed in 1884 under Col. Joseph Daniel Pope with a two-year program that again was often completed in one.  Professor Pope was given a small salary and the fees generated from tuition.  Special provision was made for the teaching of short courses by leading members of the bar.  The school also added minimum entrance standards at that time: An applicant had to be at least nineteen years old, have a good English education, and known enough Latin to readily understand legal terms and maxims.  Juniors were instructed in the following subjects: \"Organization and Jurisdiction of Courts of United States (Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts) and South Carolina (Supreme, Common Pleas, Sessions, Probate, and Trial Justice Courts); Sources of Municipal Law; Domestic Relations; Personal Property, and title to same; Administration, Wills, Contracts, Bailments, Bills and Notes, Principal and Agent, Corporations; Criminal Law, and herein of Torts and nuisances; Public and Private Law, Law of Evidence.\"  Seniors were instructed in the following: \"Pleadings and Practice; Law of Real Property; Equity Jurisprudence; Law of Conveyancing; Trial of Title to Land; Maritime Law and Law of Nations; State of Law of the State on subjects not read with the text and lectures of the course; Deeds, Recording, Habeas Corpus, etc.\"  In addition, the juniors were required to write essays, while seniors were trained in court details in a moot court.\n\nIn 1918, Claudia James Sullivan became the first female graduate of the law school.<ref name=\"sc.edu\"/> During the 1920s, the school continued to modernize under the [[American Bar Association]]'s guidelines for law schools. In 1964, the school of law is Integrated and in 1967 Jasper Cureton became the first African-American graduate of the law school since Reconstruction.<ref name=\"sc.edu\"/>\n\n== Facilities ==\nFrom its opening in 1867 until 1875, the law school held classes in what now are the South Caroliniana Library and DeSaussure College. In 1891, the Law Department was moved to Legare College. From 1919 to 1950, the law school was located in Petigru College (in 1950, renamed to Currell College). From 1950 to 1974, the law school was located in the new Petigru College. From 1974 to 2017, the law school was located in the University of South Carolina Law Center at 701 Main Street.<ref>[http://law.sc.edu/library/about/history.pdf Library History]</ref>\n\nOn July 27, 2011, the law school officially announced plans for a new building, to be located on a block between Senate, Gervais, Bull and Pickens streets in downtown Columbia.<ref>http://www.thestate.com/2011/07/27/1912592/usc-chooses-new-site-for-law-school.html#storylink=misearch</ref>  In February 2013, the university's board of trustees voted to pay more than half of the $80 million cost of the 187,500 square foot building with bonds backed by students' tuition payments.<ref>[http://www.thestate.com/2013/02/28/2653898/u-of-sc-moves-ahead-with-law-school.html]</ref> The new state-of-the-art building opened in June 2017, with space to accommodate over 660 students with instructional spaces including 17 classrooms ranging from 20 to 95 seats, a ceremonial courtroom, and law library.

The school of law was founded in 1867, and remains the only public and non-profit law school in the state of [[South Carolina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=www.sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> The school has been accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] since 1925 and has been a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1924.<ref>[http://www.aals.org/about_memberschools.php AALS memberschools], aals.org, retrieved on 2-3-2010</ref>\n\nThe entering class of first-year law students in 2019 was composed of 212 students from 22 states. Fifty-two percent of students were from South Carolina, and minority students made up twenty percent of the class. Forty-six percent of incoming students were female, while Fifty-four percent were male.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/admissions/class_profile/index.php|title=Entering Class Profile - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=www.sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> In the 2020 edition of U.S. News & World Report's \"Best Law Schools,\" the South Carolina School of Law ranked #91.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/university-of-south-carolina-columbia-03143|title=Best Law Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nThe discussion of starting a law program began as early as 1810 when President [[Jonathan Maxcy]] recommended to the board of trustees of South Carolina College that the school establish a professorship of the law.  A resolution of the statehouse in 1823 requested the college to consider \"the propriety and advantage of establishing a Professorship of Law in that institution, and to report to this house, at the next session, the manner in which such a Professorship may be established, so as to be most advantageous to the community, and least expensive to the State.\"  The trustees replied that a professor should be hired, but that the courses should be offered only to graduates.  With that, the matter ended.\n\nWhen the modern University of South Carolina was formed from South Carolina College in December 1865, the act doing so also authorized the trustees to hire one or more persons to form classes to instruct on the law under such terms as the trustees should decide.  In 1866, the act was amended to require the trustees to do so on the quickest possible terms.\n\nIn January 1867, the trustees offered Chancellor J.A. Inglis the position, but he declined.  In 1868, the offer was next made to Col. A.C. Haskell who accepted and held the post until August 1868.  The course of study included the various branches of common law and equity, commercial, international, and constitutional law.  Although the program was meant to cover two years, many students completed it in one.  A moot court was also overseen by the professor to train students in the details of actual practice.  Four students started in the program, and two graduated in June 1868.\n\nThe program lapsed during the 1868-1869 academic year, but resumed the following term under the direction of the Hon. C.D. Melton.  The program continued until it was shuttered following the death of a subsequent professor, Chief Justice [[Franklin J. Moses, Sr.|Franklin J. Moses]], in 1877.\n\nDuring the [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction Era]] (1868-1876), the law school graduated thirty-nine students. Eleven of these graduates were African-American.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\nThe school resumed in 1884 under Col. Joseph Daniel Pope with a two-year program that again was often completed in one.  Professor Pope was given a small salary and the fees generated from tuition.  Special provision was made for the teaching of short courses by leading members of the bar.  The school also added minimum entrance standards at that time: An applicant had to be at least nineteen years old, have a good English education, and known enough Latin to readily understand legal terms and maxims.  Juniors were instructed in the following subjects: \"Organization and Jurisdiction of Courts of United States (Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts) and South Carolina (Supreme, Common Pleas, Sessions, Probate, and Trial Justice Courts); Sources of Municipal Law; Domestic Relations; Personal Property, and title to same; Administration, Wills, Contracts, Bailments, Bills and Notes, Principal and Agent, Corporations; Criminal Law, and herein of Torts and nuisances; Public and Private Law, Law of Evidence.\"  Seniors were instructed in the following: \"Pleadings and Practice; Law of Real Property; Equity Jurisprudence; Law of Conveyancing; Trial of Title to Land; Maritime Law and Law of Nations; State of Law of the State on subjects not read with the text and lectures of the course; Deeds, Recording, Habeas Corpus, etc.\"  In addition, the juniors were required to write essays, while seniors were trained in court details in a moot court.\n\nIn 1918, Claudia James Sullivan became the first female graduate of the law school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> During the 1920s, the school continued to modernize under the [[American Bar Association]]'s guidelines for law schools. In 1964, the school of law is Integrated and in 1967 Jasper Cureton became the first African-American graduate of the law school since Reconstruction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/about/history/index.php|title=History - School of Law {{!}} University of South Carolina|website=sc.edu|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\n== Facilities ==\nFrom its opening in 1867 until 1875, the law school held classes in what now are the South Caroliniana Library and DeSaussure College. In 1891, the Law Department was moved to Legare College. From 1919 to 1950, the law school was located in Petigru College (in 1950, renamed to Currell College). From 1950 to 1974, the law school was located in the new Petigru College.
