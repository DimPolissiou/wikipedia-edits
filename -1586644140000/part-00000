[[Ronald Ross]] discovered its transmission by mosquito in 1897. [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] elucidated the complete transmission from a female [[Anopheles|anopheline mosquito]] to humans in 1898. In 1897, [[William H. Welch]] created the name ''Plasmodium falciparum'', which [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] formally adopted in 1954. ''P. falciparum'' assumes several different forms during its life cycle. The human-infective stage are [[Apicomplexan life cycle|sporozoites]] from the [[Salivary gland#Other animals|salivary gland of a mosquito]]. The sporozoites grow and multiply in the [[liver]] to become merozoites. These merozoites invade the [[Red blood cell|erythrocytes]] (RBCs) to form trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes, during which the symptoms of malaria are produced. In the mosquito, the [[Gametocyte|gametocytes]] undergo sexual reproduction to a [[zygote]], which turns into ookinete. Ookinete forms [[Oocyte|oocyts]] from which sporozoites are formed.\n\nAs of the [[World Health Organization]] ''World Malaria Report 2019'', there were 228 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2018, resulting in an estimated 405,000 deaths.

In 1847 he reported the presence of black pigment granules from the blood and spleen of a patient who died of malaria. The French Army physician [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]], while working at B\u00f4ne Hospital (now [[Annaba]] in Algeria), correctly identified the parasite as a causative pathogen of malaria in 1880. He presented his discovery before the [[French Academy of Medicine]] in Paris, and published it in ''[[The Lancet]]'', in 1881.

Laveran's discovery was widely accepted only after five years when [[Camillo Golgi]] confirmed the parasite using better microscope and staining technique. Laveran was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1907 for his work. In 1900, the Italian zoologist [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] categorized ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species based on the timing of fever in the patient; malignant tertian malaria was caused by ''Laverania malariae'' (now ''P. falciparum''), benign tertian malaria by ''Haemamoeba vivax'' (now ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]]''), and quartan malaria by ''Haemamoeba malariae'' (now ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Francis EG|title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites & Vectors|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5|pmid=20205846|pmc=2825508}}{{open access}}</ref> \n\nThe British physician [[Patrick Manson]] formulated the [[mosquito-malaria theory]] in 1894; until that time, malarial parasites were believed to be spread in air as [[Miasma theory|miasma]], a Greek word for pollution.<ref name=lalchhandama/>  His colleague [[Ronald Ross]], a British Army surgeon, travelled to India to test the theory.

A trophozoites feed on the haemoglobin and forms a granular pigment called [[haemozoin]]. Unlike those of other ''Plasmodium'' species, the gametocytes of ''P. falciparum'' are elongated and crescent-shaped, by which they are sometimes identified. A mature gametocyte is 8-12 \u03bcm long and 3-6 \u03bcm wide. The ookinete is also elongated measuring about 18-24 \u03bcm.

[[Ronald Ross]] discovered its transmission by mosquito in 1897. [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] elucidated the complete transmission from a female [[Anopheles|anopheline mosquito]] to humans in 1898. In 1897, [[William H. Welch]] created the name ''Plasmodium falciparum'', which [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]] formally adopted in 1954. ''P. falciparum'' assumes several different forms during its life cycle. The human-infective stage are [[Apicomplexan life cycle|sporozoites]] from the [[Salivary gland#Other animals|salivary gland of a mosquito]]. The sporozoites grow and multiply in the [[liver]] to become merozoites. These merozoites invade the [[Red blood cell|erythrocytes]] (RBCs) to form trophozoites, schizonts and gametocytes, during which the symptoms of malaria are produced. In the mosquito, the [[Gametocyte|gametocytes]] undergo sexual reproduction to a [[zygote]], which turns into ookinete. Ookinete forms [[Oocyte|oocyts]] from which sporozoites are formed.\n\nAs of the [[World Health Organization]] ''World Malaria Report 2019'', there were 228 million cases of malaria worldwide in 2018, resulting in an estimated 405,000 deaths.

In 1847 he reported the presence of black pigment granules from the blood and spleen of a patient who died of malaria. The French Army physician [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]], while working at B\u00f4ne Hospital (now [[Annaba]] in Algeria), correctly identified the parasite as a causative pathogen of malaria in 1880. He presented his discovery before the [[French Academy of Medicine]] in Paris, and published it in ''[[The Lancet]]'', in 1881.

Laveran's discovery was widely accepted only after five years when [[Camillo Golgi]] confirmed the parasite using better microscope and staining technique. Laveran was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1907 for his work. In 1900, the Italian zoologist [[Giovanni Battista Grassi]] categorized ''[[Plasmodium]]'' species based on the timing of fever in the patient; malignant tertian malaria was caused by ''Laverania malariae'' (now ''P. falciparum''), benign tertian malaria by ''Haemamoeba vivax'' (now ''[[Plasmodium vivax|P. vivax]]''), and quartan malaria by ''Haemamoeba malariae'' (now ''[[Plasmodium malariae|P. malariae]]'').<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cox|first1=Francis EG|title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites & Vectors|date=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5|pmid=20205846|pmc=2825508}}{{open access}}</ref> \n\nThe British physician [[Patrick Manson]] formulated the [[mosquito-malaria theory]] in 1894; until that time, malarial parasites were believed to be spread in air as [[Miasma theory|miasma]], a Greek word for pollution.<ref name=lalchhandama/>  His colleague [[Ronald Ross]], a British Army surgeon, travelled to India to test the theory.

The virus was subsequently proved to be the direct cancer agent, and is now classified as [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Group 1 carcinogen]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bouvard|first1=V\u00e9ronique|last2=Baan|first2=Robert|last3=Straif|first3=Kurt|last4=Grosse|first4=Yann|last5=Secretan|first5=B\u00e9atrice|last6=Ghissassi|first6=Fatiha El|last7=Benbrahim-Tallaa|first7=Lamia|last8=Guha|first8=Neela|last9=Freeman|first9=Crystal|last10=Galichet|first10=Laurent|last11=Cogliano|first11=Vincent|title=A review of human carcinogens\u2014Part B: biological agents|journal=The Lancet Oncology|date=2009|volume=10|issue=4|pages=321\u2013322|doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70096-8|pmid=19350698|display-authors=8}}</ref> In 1989, it was realised that EBV requires other infections such as with malaria to cause lymphocyte transformation.

Grigorescu\"''<ref>[[Nicolae Grigorescu]], unrelated</ref>), an important figure in Romanian art. He was the brother of [[Ion Grigorescu]] and the husband of the painter [[Georgeta N\u0103p\u0103ru\u0219]].<ref>Co\u015foveanu, Dorana, Album \"Octav Grigorescu\", Ed. Meridiane, 1985</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOctav Grigorescu was born on May 22, 1933, to Anastase Grigorescu (b. 1905) and Maria (b. 1906, n\u00e9e Gu\u015ferescu), the second among four brothers and one sister. His father, a chemical engineer, had weak eyesight due to an early accident when experimenting with chemicals as a boy. This, together with the number of children of young age, prevented him from being drafted during the war. The family story lets believe that Anastase met Maria when his brother was a law trainee in Octav Guserescu's office (her father) . This is where the boy's name borrowed the name. In spite of initially opposing the marriage, the elder Octav went along with what appeared to be a true love story, and, ironically, the young family settled and raised all children in his house located on a picturesque, now slightly out of shape part of the old town, on Vasile Alecsandri street,<ref>The house is registered on the city's architectural landmarks, being built in characteristic neoromanian style by Architect....</ref> still owned in part by the family. Anastase Grigorescu's family hails from Bengesti-Ciocadia, [[Gorj]], in the province of Oltenia, from a family of landowners who ran a mill on the Ciocadia river. They rose to a degree a local prominence to build a small church in town and sending all children to the university. Fortunately for them, the economic fate of the family had a downturn before and during the war, so they avoided the immediate bull's eye of the communist revolution, which waged a fierce war on the well-endowed peasantry and so called small bourgeoisie during the initial stages of the Soviet imposed rule.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAnastase's mother side was of Aromanian origin, having settled from south of the Danube in the province via Turnu Severin, and owning a property at Strehaia in the township of Corcova, Mehedinti county. The father's side were local with possible roots over the Carpathians in Transylvania.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOn the mother's side, Guserescu was from northern Bukovina, born in Todire\u0219ti (jude\u021bul Boto\u0219ani), in a family of free land-owning peasants (razesi) who boasted having been granted land by the legendary medieval king of Moldavia, Stephen the Great, after an ancestor earned it in battle. In any case, later on, the artist remembered his grandfather as a dominating, boastful character, with a penchant for bad financial deals and infidelity toward his wife who was an artistic, delicate and inspiring character to the children. Herself addicted to gambling, but very well read and educated, with a passion for romantic novels and a whiff of elegance, coming from a wealthier merchant family with mixed Greek ancestry, she was the favorite of the rest of the family who gradually set the older Octav Guserescu in a sort of domestic exile. Her daughter, Maria, the painter's mother, was not in good terms with her own father. The unconventional, cigar smoking grandfather exerted a \"bad boy\" attraction on the grandchildren during Octav's middle school years. He let his grandson puff cigarettes a tad too early, a habit that the future painter unfortunately never quit and most likely contributed to his early death at 53. During the short famine following the war and an exceptionally cold winter, the family burned some of the law school volumes, out of need but perhaps in an act of defiance as well. The lawyer had died in 1945.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOctav, together with his brothers, attended what was a boy's only top school, starting with what was at that time the maternal school no. 18, followed in the same building by the \"Titu Maiorescu\" high school. He graduated with a  baccalaureate in 1951. In some sense the school was a higher education institution, with an elite of very talented pupils with accomplished future careers; social position played a role, but the group was apparently mixed, with children belonging to the royal court intermingled with the middle class. The communist revolution altered this mix, but did not destroy the outstanding quality of the school. His literature teacher was an accomplished, even though  traditionalist poet, with interest in art and who encouraged his students to pursue higher grounds. Octav was talented in art, starting to draw endlessly by copying museum postcards, browsing black and white art and travel albums with monuments and renaissance sculptures, found in the house, borrowed from friends or from school. One has to remember that he was fourteen in 1947, a fateful moment for the country, when the king abdicated and the immediate years after the war were marked by severe political upheaval and economic shortages. Yet he disclosed thinking that philosophy was his calling, perhaps due to the stimulating classes of his teachers. All along, a natural interest in literature, especially poetry, was present, and he continued writing all his life, even though he never published his work during his lifetime. The only published poetry volume is Lotofagii, a posthumous artist book printed in a font inspired by his distinctive, Da Vinci - like handwriting, edited by his brother [[Ion Grigorescu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nEntering the fine arts school in the class of [[Rudolf Schweitzer-Cump\u0103na]] at the Institute, following up with sculpture in Dimitrie Onofrei's class, he finally chooses to specialize in graphic arts with [[Vasile Kazar]]. He graduates his M.A. (1958) with a diploma project depicting scenes from the lives of workers from the coal works in Maramures county, as required by the times. He is happy to accept, right upon graduation, being a lecturer in the graphic arts section. Later on he becomes a reader (conferentiar) and keeps his position till the end, in a distinguished career, many students, with a short interruption around 1968\u20131971.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The sixties ==\nHis solo debut is in 1959, entering the Artists' Guild (Uniunea Artistilor Plastici) in 1961; he even served at some point on the steering committee, and was a member until the end. In 1965 he married hir former college fellow and painter [[Georgeta N\u0103p\u0103ru\u0219]], and they had a son in 1967.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBetween 1955-1984 he travels extensively, both independently and with support for scholarly activity, for art shows and exhibitions, at the beginning primarily in Eastern Europe: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, German Democratic Republic (1962, 1965, 1974); but later on to Italy, France, Austria (1968, 1969\u201370, 1977, 1978, 1980); and again U.S.S. R. (1972); Cuba, Spain (1979); Franta, United Kingdom, Greece (1983).<ref>Co\u015foveanu, Dorana, \"Octav Grigorescu\", Date Biografice, p.43. Ed. Meridiane, 1985</ref>\n\nIt is in 1968 that he is representing Romania at the Venice Biennale for the first time (the second is in 1980), a turning point in his career. He is noticed by critics and is invited to have a solo exhibition. Back and forth between home and Italy, some of the excitement of his initial success is tempered by the unkind practices of gallerists who confiscate all his work, claiming it is normal to compensate for expenses. It is not clear if he was duped or simply naively misunderstanding the brutal realities of the art trade, being raised in the sterilized vacuum of a country, let's say, without a market economy. He decides to fight, prove himself and at the same time pursue a deep love for Italy, which he regarded as the land of art, an object of desire for the child who used to train his hand sketching postcards from Rome and the [[Uffizi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The seventies - after the Biennale ==\nThe Italian period is marked by extreme creativity and productivity. He settles in Venice for most of the time, but travels to Milan, to Bologna (with shows), Rome and several back and forth ventures to Vienna, a city he liked deeply (Rielke was a leitmotif of his sensibility, and an early German literature and fair knowledge of the language helped), has some longer interludes in Paris, where he meets some old friends, but does not seem to adhere to any place. Possibly the most fateful decision of his career came on the New Year's Eve of 1971 when he lands in Bucharest, with an expired passport, at a time when the regime was considering overstaying an exit visa (in this case by years) simply a crime. A stash of letters to his wife, explaining in part some of his torments in Venice, is lost, and what seems to sum up events is that he might not have felt able to support his new family (his only child was born in 1967) in Italy and his wife, Georgeta, was increasingly feeling under pressure to ask him to return, both because of the authorities which perceived his defection as suspect, harassing her, and her own insecurities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDisillusionment with the art practices he was exposed to is soon replaced by losing his job at the art institute, where he was demoted to a pay by the hour status, a condition that even though he later overcame delayed his promotion to full professorship. Due to his passing away at 53, it never happened. In some other sense, he had time to work and the few next years had the consolation of a certain calm of family life. Gradually he re-integrates in the artistic community and tends to work in many directions: etching, drawing, watercolor, book illustration; painting and of course teaching, where he gets attracted by technical explorations, e.g. preparing compounds, foundations and canvasses from scratch using ancient trade books. The paintings become much larger than before, he talks about the dream of painting alfresco vast surfaces in the outdoors. This never happens but he experiments a lot, to the point that he feared occasionally that his works may be vulnerable in time.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nMarking the signal of retrenchment to a rigid form of socialism, 1973 brings also a term to the artist's hope that the liberalization seen after 1965 will lead to an end of the regime. The only difference is that a brutal ideology is now serving a personal dictatorship. The major earthquake of 1977 (March 4) moves the political climate another notch to the extreme. The eighties were also a cultural agony, to say the least. It is not that his career was not moving forward; in 1980 he is representing Romania in the National Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, for the second time. In a relaxation with the Italian government, it is deemed acceptable by the authorities that he accepts the Order of Cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana, which was an appreciated honor, but somehow came as a belated consolation for his older adventures. It must be said that on his death bed he took with him to the hospital a thick book of short stories by Alberto Moravia, in a testament to his deeply felt affinity with that experience.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The eighties  ==\nIn a deteriorating political climate, it is a chance encounter that sets the ground for a consequential and lasting relationship with a businessman from Hamburg, Ernst Michael Winter, who had asked to see an artist studio. Possibly due to the coincidence of names between the classical painter N. Grigorescu and himself (as the joke goes), or rather because Octav's brother, Constantin, worked as an engineer at the firm the Germans were selling equipment to, the visit was a true meeting of the minds, or artistic sensibilities. In fact, soon after, Mr. Winter dedicated himself to art opening a gallery. Two exhibitions in Hamburg, the third scheduled but stopped by the artist's death, followed, a relationship of trust and long standing support ensued. This success brought various forms of harassment from the government. The unbearable last years of the regime, doubled by the offensive cult of personality, pushed the painter one more time to seek exile. It is not clear, but his physical health may have contributed to giving up staying in Paris, as he had planned, in the summer of 1985. By next fall, he walked the last time home from his studio, and died after a short but painful struggle with cancer at the Elias hospital in Bucharest, on a day of February 1987  when the snow storm had brought the city to a standstill.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWinter recognized a certain stature in the pale, figurative paintings Grigorescu had in his studio, with mythological subjects, inspired by ancient accounts in Herodotus, Biblical and Hellenistic fables. Octav Grigorescu loved the sea, spent long hours strolling the rocky, narrow beach hoping to find ancient bits of history among the seashells, going to the beach with a copy of the [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] of [[Herodotus]], highly annotated or maybe [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''Alexiad'' which he treated as an inspiring \"grazing\" material. In the raw landscape, unusually dry fields of [[Dobruja]], bordering the intriguingly unglamorous Black Sea, were mysterious mounds said to shelter tombs of [[Scythians|Scythian]] warriors. All this was inciting, and he would have spent many months during the summer break dreaming about a legendary past; as the last advance of Darius, the most powerful man on Earth, who had to stop his march at the Danube after the locals sent him three omens he could not bear - this is Herodotus, and he painted it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nA bookish nature, refuge from political reality, maybe even the illusion of reaching a compromise with the demands of the official ideology that seemed to excuse estheticism as long as it would not challenge the dogma of one man rule, an almost nostalgic reach to Christianity, not as dogma, but as a cultural guarantor, led him to this stage of his work where large paintings depict in evanescent colors mythological scenes loaded with ciphers and metaphors. Embedded in the historicizing orbit was the recurring depiction of king Brancoveanu's sacrifice, the founder of Romanian renaissance, the last king of an ancient dynasty, who was killed in Istanbul by forcing him to witness the beheadings of all his sons, who would have been spared, had they forsaken their Christian faith; including the youngest, whom he advises to choose death instead of submission. The event, in 1714, exposes a pivotal moment, looking almost against the course of history, a cusp between the Middle Ages and modernity, perhaps even for the Ottoman Empire. After that, even though nominally under the High Porte, the Romanian principalities are essentially carving independence after an episode of Russian tutelage, and politically, certainly culturally, enter under French and to a lesser extent, German influence. Turkish interference is seen with relaxation today in Romania, and the story was rather perceived as nostalgic for a better moral condition of the country. Brancoveanu is the last good king, the path we did not have the chance to follow, the art loving prince, and above all, legitimate. In 1980, an illegitimate troglodyte was slowly destroying the country, who, adding insult to his ineptitude, demolished may churches to build a nondescript neo-classical/brutalist mix of government buildings that scar the capital's urban planning ambitions even today. The theme of illegitimacy concerning the communist regime is an active area of discussion. The artist shared the view that was its main failure. It was also fatal, as we now understand, but he died two years short of having the proof.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== Book illustration ==\nIn some sense a minor side of his activity, book illustration was a core activity nonetheless. It was intimately related to literature; even in the few children's books there was purpose: to the extent that The Happy Prince was meant for children, it is the most recognizable work of his, and there are younger artists who learned about him from this book. Grigorescu took the process very seriously, and combining with his didactical work, it was the most public, in a wider sense, endeavor and at the heart of a graphic artist's raison d'etre. It was time-consuming but certainly developing the imaginary of larger works. It may be unusual for a modern artist, but he was indeed an intellectual, in that he needed a circular flow between fantasy and intellect, and the link was usually a book. Rilke's writings were perfectly fitting his taste, imbued with melancholy and a certain masculine vulnerability. Many children's books were natural choices also because he spoke German, French, and later on Italian and to a lesser extent English (a man of another century, in that), confessing that Russian, although assimilated during school in the fifties, remained rudimentary.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Solo exhibitions - selection==\n*1967 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Galateea, Bucure\u0219ti\n*1969 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Laminima, Torino, Italia\n*1969 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Ravagnan si Galeria d\u2019 Arte, Vene\u021bia, Italia\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Trinita, Roma, Italia;\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Sagittario, Milano;\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria d\u2019Arte Forni, Bologna, Italia\n*1971 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria La Chiocciola, Padova Italia\n*1971 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Apollo, Bucuresti\n*1972 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Sala Dalles, Bucuresti\n*1972 Expozi\u021bie de Grafic\u0103 Octav Grigorescu - Constantin Piliu\u021b\u0103\", Muzeul de Art\u0103 Ploie\u0219ti,\n*1974 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu \u0219i Vasile Kazar, Galeria Galateea, Bucure\u0219ti\n*1976 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 si grafic\u0103, Galeria Amfora Bucure\u0219ti\n*1977 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu (Zilele culturii rom\u00e2nesti) Dortmundt, Germania\n*1984 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 \u0219i grafic\u0103, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1984 Expozitie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 si grafica, Galeria Ernst Michael Winter, Hamburg\n\n==Solo exhibitions in Romania==\n*1960 Expozi\u021bia anual\u0103 de Grafic\u0103, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1963 Expozi\u021bia anual\u0103 de Grafic\u0103 Bucure\u0219ti, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1973 Artistul contemporan \u0219i universul s\u0103u, Muzeul de Art\u0103 Gala\u021bi;\n*1974 Aspecte ale desenului rom\u00e2nesc contemporan, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1978 Expozi\u021bia Pontica '78 pictur\u0103 grafic\u0103, Galeriile de Art\u0103 U.

He worked enormously. Draftsman, graphical artist, and painter, his oeuvre is much more vast than what became public along the years with the occasion of various exhibitions. Hundreds of drawings, starting with adolescence and college years lasting until his last years of life, are not yet known to the public. A small part accompanies the poem volume.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe complicity between writing and drawing in the case of Octav Grigorescu is pushed very far. Writing and drawing maintain a complex relationship, spanning several intermingling levels. Sometimes annotations accompany the drawings without any meaning relation among them. There are ideas born in parallel with signs. Their connection is random, at least seemingly so. Some other times writing is speculated only as grapheme, as purely ornamental essence. In the case of book illustrations subtle transfers occur, genuine illuminations of the text through image, if we recall the etymology of the concept of illustration. His historically and Biblical themed painting is also a relation to text, and at the most strict level of technique, the drawn and painted images are true palimpsests and not just their illusion. The publication of his poems opens up a new chapter of this relation that remains to be investigated.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the person and art of Octav Grigorescu met the typically avantgarde of the beginnings and the culture of the elementary with a taste for the crepuscular delicacies and the premonition of death and postmodernism. He regards with suspicion the so-called triumphs of the modernism and seeks remedies to the impoverishment of the image issued from the sequence of iconoclastic moves of the 19th and 20th centuries. The regenerating solutions are the acceptance of time and the memory intertwined with forgetfulness. In his remarks I found this note, a prayer: \" God, give me the strength to live in the world of my dreams\". The Lotophages, encountered by Ulysses in his travels, discover the mirage of forgetfulness. Poetry is for Octav Grigorescu a strategy of forgetfulness and immersion in the dream, as part of the \"integral realism\" he was aspiring to - the recapture of the fullness of the world and the escape from the fascinating spell of \"the fragment\".<ref>Lotofagii lui Octav Grigorescu 23 martie 2007, text de [[Ioana Vlasiu]], Ziarul de Duminica http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8026</ref>[[Ioana Vlasiu]]\n\n=== Retrospective at Mogosoaia palace, 2006 ===\n\nHistory as dream in Octav Grigorescu's painting: (...) In a fairly short time span of approximately a decade, from the mid-seventies to his dismissal in 1987, Octav Grigorescu paints a remarkable number of vast compositions, of large size, among which I mention the sequence of eight paintings dedicated to Brancovenau, Arderea Arhondologiei la 1848 (The burning of the Chronicle at 1848), The Echo (1907), The letter from the Scythes to Darius. Other paintings like the Peace Allegory and The Allegory of the War and the Good Peace or The Symbolic Burial, even though not making direct reference to a certain historical event, are through their substance, glossing interpreting historical themes. In parallel with history, Octav Grigorescu rediscovers the Biblical thematic, but on the side of both appear very elaborate compositions, with many characters, with a complicated symbolism in which many scholarly sources merge.

So, his art, so imbued of loneliness, acquires the sense and significance of a different choice at a time dominated by impertinent shouting, of cynical ambitions.  It is the ambition of a very proud man, in spite of a fragility that seems defenseless, it is the choice of the one who believes in the truth of his own message and does not fall for compromises with his own conscience.  When the echos of the most absurd polemics in the empty space of the useless and lost words will be reached, the sheets drawn and painted by Octav  Grigorescu will apper as rare and precious documents - confessions of a man who dug into himself in order to make out of his nature (the life tale) the most profound and  truthful fabric of an intensely plastic work.

Grigorescu\"''<ref>[[Nicolae Grigorescu]], unrelated</ref>), an important figure in Romanian art. He was the brother of [[Ion Grigorescu]] and the husband of the painter [[Georgeta N\u0103p\u0103ru\u0219]].<ref>Co\u015foveanu, Dorana, Album \"Octav Grigorescu\", Ed. Meridiane, 1985</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOctav Grigorescu was born on May 22, 1933, to Anastase Grigorescu (b. 1905) and Maria (b. 1906, n\u00e9e Gu\u015ferescu), the second among four brothers and one sister. His father, a chemical engineer, had weak eyesight due to an early accident when experimenting with chemicals as a boy. This, together with the number of children of young age, prevented him from being drafted during the war. The family story lets believe that Anastase met Maria when his brother was a law trainee in Octav Guserescu's office (her father) . This is where the boy's name borrowed the name. In spite of initially opposing the marriage, the elder Octav went along with what appeared to be a true love story, and, ironically, the young family settled and raised all children in his house located on a picturesque, now slightly out of shape part of the old town, on Vasile Alecsandri street,<ref>The house is registered on the city's architectural landmarks, being built in characteristic neoromanian style by Architect....</ref> still owned in part by the family. Anastase Grigorescu's family hails from Bengesti-Ciocadia, [[Gorj]], in the province of Oltenia, from a family of landowners who ran a mill on the Ciocadia river. They rose to a degree a local prominence to build a small church in town and sending all children to the university. Fortunately for them, the economic fate of the family had a downturn before and during the war, so they avoided the immediate bull's eye of the communist revolution, which waged a fierce war on the well-endowed peasantry and so called small bourgeoisie during the initial stages of the Soviet imposed rule.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAnastase's mother side was of Aromanian origin, having settled from south of the Danube in the province via Turnu Severin, and owning a property at Strehaia in the township of Corcova, Mehedinti county. The father's side were local with possible roots over the Carpathians in Transylvania.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOn the mother's side, Guserescu was from northern Bukovina, born in Todire\u0219ti (jude\u021bul Boto\u0219ani), in a family of free land-owning peasants (razesi) who boasted having been granted land by the legendary medieval king of Moldavia, Stephen the Great, after an ancestor earned it in battle. In any case, later on, the artist remembered his grandfather as a dominating, boastful character, with a penchant for bad financial deals and infidelity toward his wife who was an artistic, delicate and inspiring character to the children. Herself addicted to gambling, but very well read and educated, with a passion for romantic novels and a whiff of elegance, coming from a wealthier merchant family with mixed Greek ancestry, she was the favorite of the rest of the family who gradually set the older Octav Guserescu in a sort of domestic exile. Her daughter, Maria, the painter's mother, was not in good terms with her own father. The unconventional, cigar smoking grandfather exerted a \"bad boy\" attraction on the grandchildren during Octav's middle school years. He let his grandson puff cigarettes a tad too early, a habit that the future painter unfortunately never quit and most likely contributed to his early death at 53. During the short famine following the war and an exceptionally cold winter, the family burned some of the law school volumes, out of need but perhaps in an act of defiance as well. The lawyer had died in 1945.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nOctav, together with his brothers, attended what was a boy's only top school, starting with what was at that time the maternal school no. 18, followed in the same building by the \"Titu Maiorescu\" high school. He graduated with a  baccalaureate in 1951. In some sense the school was a higher education institution, with an elite of very talented pupils with accomplished future careers; social position played a role, but the group was apparently mixed, with children belonging to the royal court intermingled with the middle class. The communist revolution altered this mix, but did not destroy the outstanding quality of the school. His literature teacher was an accomplished, even though  traditionalist poet, with interest in art and who encouraged his students to pursue higher grounds. Octav was talented in art, starting to draw endlessly by copying museum postcards, browsing black and white art and travel albums with monuments and renaissance sculptures, found in the house, borrowed from friends or from school. One has to remember that he was fourteen in 1947, a fateful moment for the country, when the king abdicated and the immediate years after the war were marked by severe political upheaval and economic shortages. Yet he disclosed thinking that philosophy was his calling, perhaps due to the stimulating classes of his teachers. All along, a natural interest in literature, especially poetry, was present, and he continued writing all his life, even though he never published his work during his lifetime. The only published poetry volume is Lotofagii, a posthumous artist book printed in a font inspired by his distinctive, Da Vinci - like handwriting, edited by his brother [[Ion Grigorescu]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nEntering the fine arts school in the class of [[Rudolf Schweitzer-Cump\u0103na]] at the Institute, following up with sculpture in Dimitrie Onofrei's class, he finally chooses to specialize in graphic arts with [[Vasile Kazar]]. He graduates his M.A. (1958) with a diploma project depicting scenes from the lives of workers from the coal works in Maramures county, as required by the times. He is happy to accept, right upon graduation, being a lecturer in the graphic arts section. Later on he becomes a reader (conferentiar) and keeps his position till the end, in a distinguished career, many students, with a short interruption around 1968-1971.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The sixties ==\nHis solo debut is in 1959, entering the Artists' Guild (Uniunea Artistilor Plastici) in 1961; he even served at some point on the steering committee, and was a member until the end. In 1965 he married hir former college fellow and painter [[Georgeta N\u0103p\u0103ru\u0219]], and they had a son in 1967.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nBetween 1955-1984 he travels extensively, both independently and with support for scholarly activity, for art shows and exhibitions, at the beginning primarily in Eastern Europe: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, German Democratic Republic (1962, 1965, 1974); but later on to Italy, France, Austria (1968, 1969\u201370, 1977, 1978, 1980); and again U.S.S. R. (1972); Cuba, Spain (1979); Franta, United Kingdom, Greece (1983).<ref>Co\u015foveanu, Dorana, \"Octav Grigorescu\", Date Biografice, p.43. Ed. Meridiane, 1985</ref>\n\nIt is in 1968 that he is representing Romania at the Venice Biennale for the first time (the second is in 1980), a turning point in his career. He is noticed by critics and is invited to have a solo exhibition. Back and forth between home and Italy, some of the excitement of his initial success is tempered by the unkind practices of gallerists who confiscate all his work, claiming it is normal to compensate for expenses. It is not clear if he was duped or simply naively misunderstanding the brutal realities of the art trade, being raised in the sterilized vacuum of a country, let's say, without a market economy. He decides to fight, prove himself and at the same time pursue a deep love for Italy, which he regarded as the land of art, an object of desire for the child who used to train his hand sketching postcards from Rome and the [[Uffizi]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The seventies - after the Biennale ==\nThe Italian period is marked by extreme creativity and productivity. He settles in Venice for most of the time, but travels to Milan, to Bologna (with shows), Rome and several back and forth ventures to Vienna, a city he liked deeply (Rielke was a leitmotif of his sensibility, and an early German literature and fair knowledge of the language helped), has some longer interludes in Paris, where he meets some old friends, but does not seem to adhere to any place. Possibly the most fateful decision of his career came on the New Year's Eve of 1971 when he lands in Bucharest, with an expired passport, at a time when the regime was considering overstaying an exit visa (in this case by years) simply a crime. A stash of letters to his wife, explaining in part some of his torments in Venice, is lost, and what seems to sum up events is that he might not have felt able to support his new family (his only child was born in 1967) in Italy and his wife, Georgeta, was increasingly feeling under pressure to ask him to return, both because of the authorities which perceived his defection as suspect, harassing her, and her own insecurities.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nDisillusionment with the art practices he was exposed to is soon replaced by losing his job at the art institute, where he was demoted to a pay by the hour status, a condition that even though he later overcame delayed his promotion to full professorship. Due to his passing away at 53, it never happened. In some other sense, he had time to work and the few next years had the consolation of a certain calm of family life. Gradually he re-integrates in the artistic community and tends to work in many directions: etching, drawing, watercolor, book illustration; painting and of course teaching, where he gets attracted by technical explorations, e.g. preparing compounds, foundations and canvasses from scratch using ancient trade books. The paintings become much larger than before, he talks about the dream of painting alfresco vast surfaces in the outdoors. This never happens but he experiments a lot, to the point that he feared occasionally that his works may be vulnerable in time.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nMarking the signal of retrenchment to a rigid form of socialism, 1973 brings also a term to the artist's hope that the liberalization seen after 1965 will lead to an end of the regime. The only difference is that a brutal ideology is now serving a personal dictatorship. The major earthquake of 1977 (March 4) moves the political climate another notch to the extreme. The eighties were also a cultural agony, to say the least. It is not that his career was not moving forward; in 1980 he is representing Romania in the National Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, for the second time. In a relaxation with the Italian government, it is deemed acceptable by the authorities that he accepts the Order of Cavaliere della Repubblica Italiana, which was an appreciated honor, but somehow came as a belated consolation for his older adventures. It must be said that on his death bed he took with him to the hospital a thick book of short stories by Alberto Moravia, in a testament to his deeply felt affinity with that experience.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== The eighties  ==\nIn a deteriorating political climate, it is a chance encounter that sets the ground for a consequential and lasting relationship with a businessman from Hamburg, Ernst Michael Winter, who had asked to see an artist studio. Possibly due to the coincidence of names between the classical painter N. Grigorescu and himself (as the joke goes), or rather because Octav's brother, Constantin, worked as an engineer at the firm the Germans were selling equipment to, the visit was a true meeting of the minds, or artistic sensibilities. In fact, soon after, Mr. Winter dedicated himself to art opening a gallery. Two exhibitions in Hamburg, the third scheduled but stopped by the artist's death, followed, a relationship of trust and long standing support ensued. This success brought various forms of harassment from the government. The unbearable last years of the regime, doubled by the offensive cult of personality, pushed the painter one more time to seek exile. It is not clear, but his physical health may have contributed to giving up staying in Paris, as he had planned, in the summer of 1985. By next fall, he walked the last time home from his studio, and died after a short but painful struggle with cancer at the Elias hospital in Bucharest, on a day of February 1987  when the snow storm had brought the city to a standstill.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWinter recognized a certain stature in the pale, figurative paintings Grigorescu had in his studio, with mythological subjects, inspired by ancient accounts in Herodotus, Biblical and Hellenistic fables. Octav Grigorescu loved the sea, spent long hours strolling the rocky, narrow beach hoping to find ancient bits of history among the seashells, going to the beach with a copy of the [[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] of [[Herodotus]], highly annotated or maybe [[Anna Komnene]]'s ''Alexiad'' which he treated as an inspiring \"grazing\" material. In the raw landscape, unusually dry fields of [[Dobruja]], bordering the intriguingly unglamorous Black Sea, were mysterious mounds said to shelter tombs of [[Scythians|Scythian]] warriors. All this was inciting, and he would have spent many months during the summer break dreaming about a legendary past; as the last advance of Darius, the most powerful man on Earth, who had to stop his march at the Danube after the locals sent him three omens he could not bear - this is Herodotus, and he painted it.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nA bookish nature, refuge from political reality, maybe even the illusion of reaching a compromise with the demands of the official ideology that seemed to excuse estheticism as long as it would not challenge the dogma of one man rule, an almost nostalgic reach to Christianity, not as dogma, but as a cultural guarantor, led him to this stage of his work where large paintings depict in evanescent colors mythological scenes loaded with ciphers and metaphors. Embedded in the historicizing orbit was the recurring depiction of king Brancoveanu's sacrifice, the founder of Romanian renaissance, the last king of an ancient dynasty, who was killed in Istanbul by forcing him to witness the beheadings of all his sons, who would have been spared, had they forsaken their Christian faith; including the youngest, whom he advises to choose death instead of submission. The event, in 1714, exposes a pivotal moment, looking almost against the course of history, a cusp between the Middle Ages and modernity, perhaps even for the Ottoman Empire. After that, even though nominally under the High Porte, the Romanian principalities are essentially carving independence after an episode of Russian tutelage, and politically, certainly culturally, enter under French and to a lesser extent, German influence. Turkish interference is seen with relaxation today in Romania, and the story was rather perceived as nostalgic for a better moral condition of the country. Brancoveanu is the last good king, the path we did not have the chance to follow, the art loving prince, and above all, legitimate. In 1980, an illegitimate troglodyte was slowly destroying the country, who, adding insult to his ineptitude, demolished may churches to build a nondescript neo-classical/brutalist mix of government buildings that scar the capital's urban planning ambitions even today. The theme of illegitimacy concerning the communist regime is an active area of discussion. The artist shared the view that was its main failure. It was also fatal, as we now understand, but he died two years short of having the proof.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== Book illustration ==\nIn some sense a minor side of his activity, book illustration was a core activity nonetheless. It was intimately related to literature; even in the few children's books there was purpose: to the extent that The Happy Prince was meant for children, it is the most recognizable work of his, and there are younger artists who learned about him from this book. Grigorescu took the process very seriously, and combining with his didactical work, it was the most public, in a wider sense, endeavor and at the heart of a graphic artist's raison d'etre. It was time consuming but certainly developing the imaginary of larger works. It may be unusual for a modern artist, but he was indeed an intellectual, in that he needed a circular flow between fantasy and intellect, and the link was usually a book. Rilke's writings were perfectly fitting his taste, imbued with melancholy and a certain masculine vulnerability. Many children's books were natural choices also because he spoke German, French, and later on Italian and to a lesser extent English (a man of an other century, in that), confessing that Russian, although assimilated during school in the fifties, remained rudimentary.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n==Solo exhibitions - selection==\n*1967 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Galateea, Bucure\u0219ti\n*1969 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Laminima, Torino, Italia\n*1969 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Ravagnan si Galeria d\u2019 Arte, Vene\u021bia, Italia\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Trinita, Roma, Italia;\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Sagittario, Milano;\n*1970 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria d\u2019Arte Forni, Bologna, Italia\n*1971 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria La Chiocciola, Padova Italia\n*1971 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Galeria Apollo, Bucuresti\n*1972 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, Sala Dalles, Bucuresti\n*1972 Expozi\u021bie de Grafic\u0103 Octav Grigorescu - Constantin Piliu\u021b\u0103\", Muzeul de Art\u0103 Ploie\u0219ti,\n*1974 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu \u0219i Vasile Kazar, Galeria Galateea, Bucure\u0219ti\n*1976 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 si grafic\u0103, Galeria Amfora Bucure\u0219ti\n*1977 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu (Zilele culturii rom\u00e2nesti) Dortmundt, Germania\n*1984 Expozi\u021bie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 \u0219i grafic\u0103, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1984 Expozitie Octav Grigorescu, pictur\u0103 si grafica, Galeria Ernst Michael Winter, Hamburg\n\n==Solo exhibitions in Romania==\n*1960 Expozi\u021bia anual\u0103 de Grafic\u0103, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1963 Expozi\u021bia anual\u0103 de Grafic\u0103 Bucure\u0219ti, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1973 Artistul contemporan \u0219i universul s\u0103u, Muzeul de Art\u0103 Gala\u021bi;\n*1974 Aspecte ale desenului rom\u00e2nesc contemporan, Muzeul Na\u021bional de Art\u0103 al Republicii Socialiste Rom\u00e2nia;\n*1978 Expozi\u021bia Pontica '78 pictur\u0103 grafic\u0103, Galeriile de Art\u0103 U.

Writing and drawing maintain a complex relationship, spanning several intermingling levels. Sometimes annotations accompany the drawings without any meaning relation among them. There are ideas born in parallel with signs. Their connection is random, at least seemingly so. Some other times writing is speculated only as grapheme, as purely ornamental essence. In the case of book illustrations subtle transfers occur, genuine illuminations of the text through image, if we recall the etymology of the concept of illustration. His historically and Biblical themed painting is also a relation to text, and at the most strict level of technique, the drawn and painted images are true palimpsests and not just their illusion. The publication of his poems opens up a new chapter of this relation that remains to be investigated.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nIn the person and art of Octav Grigorescu met the typically avantgarde of the beginnings and the culture of the elementary with a taste for the crepuscular delicacies and the premonition of death and postmodernism. He regards with suspicion the so-called triumphs of the modernism and seeks remedies to the impoverishment of the image issued from the sequence of iconoclastic moves of the 19th and 20th centuries. The regenerating solutions are the acceptance of time and the memory intertwined with forgetfulness. In his remarks I found this note, a prayer: \" God, give me the strength to live in the world of my dreams\". The Lotophages, encountered by Ulysses in his travels, discover the mirage of forgetfulness. Poetry is for Octav Grigorescu a strategy of forgetfulness and immersion in the dream, as part of the \"integral realism\" he was aspiring to - the recapture of the fullness of the world and the escape from the fascinating spell of \"the fragment\".<ref>Lotofagii lui Octav Grigorescu 23 martie 2007, text de [[Ioana Vlasiu]], Ziarul de Duminica http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=8026</ref>[[Ioana Vlasiu]]\n\n=== Retrospective at Mogosoaia palace, 2006 ===\n\nHistory as dream in Octav Grigorescu's painting: (...) In a fairly short time span of approximately a decade, from the mid-seventies to his dismissal in 1987, Octav Grigorescu paints a remarkable number of vast compositions, of large size, among which I mention the sequence of eight paintings dedicated to Brancovenau, Arderea Arhondologiei la 1848 (The burning of the Chronicle at 1848), The Echo (1907), The letter from the Scythes to Darius. Other paintings like the Peace Allegory and The Allegory of the War and the Good Peace or The Symbolic Burial, even though not making direct reference to a certain historical event, are through their substance, glossing interpreting historical themes. In parallel with history, Octav Grigorescu rediscovers the Biblical thematic, but on the side of both appear very elaborate compositions, with many characters, with a complicated symbolism in which many scholarly sources merge.

So, his art, so imbued of loneliness, acquires the sense and significance of a different choice at a time dominated by impertinent shouting, of cynical ambitions.  It is the ambition of a very proud man, in spite of a fragility that seems defenseless, it is the choice of the one who believes in the truth of his own message and does not fall for compromises with his own conscience.  When the echos of the most absurd polemics in the empty space of the useless and lost words will be reached, the sheets drawn and painted by Octav  Grigorescu will apper as rare and precious documents - confessions of a man who dug into himself in order to make out of his nature (the life tale) the most profound and  truthful fabric of an intensely plastic work.

His imagination reaches the far end sections of the conscience projecting outwards a passionate, phantasm rich universe, meant to cover the real one and occult it to us, in grasping fashion. He is a poet with great graphical skill, a seducingly engaged poet through his mere subjective excesses. His undivided character between cerebral and affective urges him, through unmitigated prodding, to find, in a symbolic language, spontaneously, its translation. Ion Frunzetti.<ref>Co\u015foveanu, Dorana, \"Octav Grigorescu\", Antologie Critic\u0103, fragment de text de, Ion Frunzetti, reprodus la p. 42, Ed.

Octav Grigorescu is a poet: a poet of the shape, of the line, of the color. A poet of a great sensitivity. Cultured and demanding with himself, of an exemplary modesty, he etches in the Romanian cultural environment the signs of a lucid and clear participation. Precisely contoured personality, he creates a body of work representing a steady beacon of true value.

It originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on March 27, 2020 as the fourth and final part of the [[series finale]].<ref name=\"LosAngelesTimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-02-20/steven-universe-future-series-finale|title=The end of a world: 'Steven Universe' finale coming soon on Cartoon Network|date=February 20, 2020|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis final episode takes place in the aftermath of the events of the series, which focuses on protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]]'s unresolved trauma and need to feel needed by his friends and family. In the penultimate episode, Steven's stress builds up to the point that he becomes a monster and attacks his hometown of Beach City, until the unconditional emotional support of his loved ones brings him back to normal. In the finale, Steven finally decides to leave Beach City, but he worries that [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]], [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] won't miss him after his departure.\n\n== Plot ==\nSteven discusses with his friend Connie his plan to leave Beach City and travel the country; he has told everyone about his decision except the Gems. He worries that they will be upset and hopes he can let them down easy.\n\nLater that day, Steven shares homemade Cookie Cat ice cream sandwiches with Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. The Gems sing the Cookie Cat advertising jingle, according to which Cookie Cat \"left his family behind\". Steven uses that to segue into his announcement that he's decided to move out the next day. He urges the Gems not to talk him out of his decision; but they seem to take his decision very lightly and are proud of him showing a desire to be independent. \u00a0\n\nBismuth, Lapis, and Peridot burst into tears when he gives them the news. Steven gives them farewell gifts: his old pink shirt for Peridot, a drawing and painting kit for Lapis, and the Crystal Gems' old battle flag for Bismuth.\n\nJasper insists on coming with him to protect him, but he assures her that he can protect himself.\n\nBack at the Temple, Steven gives Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet their farewell gifts: Amethyst gets his old video games, Pearl his ukulele, and Garnet the wedding plan book he used to plan Ruby and Sapphire's wedding. All three accept the gifts nonchalantly, showing little concern about Steven's impending departure. Steven's father Greg tells him they are probably just trying to be supportive. As his parting gift for Greg, Steven encourages his father to move into Steven's room in the beach house.\n\nSteven says his goodbyes and drives off toward his next destination, but soon stops the car and returns to confront the Gems, demanding to know why they are taking the situation so lightly. The Gems burst into tears and explain that they didn't want their sad thoughts to prevent Steven from leaving. They assure him that, whatever happens in his future, they'll be part of it too. Everyone says they love each other, they give Steven one more goodbye, and he leaves his old home to a new path in his future. The people of Beach City wave goodbye as Steven begins his road trip, ending the episode, the series, and the ''Steven Universe'' franchise.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Viewership ===\nThe episode was watched by 0.74 million people.<ref name=\"FinalEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-27-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.27.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Future ==\nWhile Rebecca Sugar has confirmed that this is the series finale and that there is no continuation in development, nor any ongoing projects, she has hinted that possible future stories exist. \"The story is continuing off screen and I do know what happens next...But I would have to decide how and when I'd want to dig into that, or if it's best to give them their privacy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/27/21197679/steven-universe-future-ending-finale-new-seasons-rebecca-sugar-interview|title=The reason Rebecca Sugar made Steven Universe Future, and why it\u2019s the actual end|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|date=March 27, 2020|website=Polygon|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSugar later told ''[[Fast Company]]'' \"I'm certainly interested in spending more time in this world with these characters.

It originally aired on [[Cartoon Network]] on March 27, 2020 as the fourth and final part of the [[series finale]].<ref name=\"LosAngelesTimes\">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2020-02-20/steven-universe-future-series-finale|title=The end of a world: 'Steven Universe' finale coming soon on Cartoon Network|date=February 20, 2020|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=February 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis final episode takes place in the aftermath of the events of the series, which focuses on protagonist [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]]'s unresolved trauma and need to feel needed by his friends and family. In the penultimate episode, Steven's stress builds up to the point that he becomes a monster and attacks his hometown of Beach City, until the unconditional emotional support of his loved ones brings him back to normal. In the finale, Steven finally decides to leave Beach City, but he worries that [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]], [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]], and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] won't miss him after his departure.\n\n== Plot ==\nSteven discusses with his friend Connie his plan to leave Beach City and travel the country; he has told everyone about his decision except the Gems. He worries that they will be upset and hopes he can let them down easy.\n\nLater that day, Steven shares homemade Cookie Cat ice cream sandwiches with Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl. The Gems sing the Cookie Cat advertising jingle, according to which Cookie Cat \"left his family behind\". Steven uses that to segue into his announcement that he's decided to move out the next day. He urges the Gems not to talk him out of his decision; but they seem to take his decision very lightly and are proud of him showing a desire to be independent. \u00a0\n\nBismuth, Lapis, and Peridot burst into tears when he gives them the news. Steven gives them farewell gifts: his old pink shirt for Peridot, a drawing and painting kit for Lapis, and the Crystal Gems' old battle flag for Bismuth.\n\nJasper insists on coming with him to protect him, but he assures her that he can protect himself.\n\nBack at the Temple, Steven gives Amethyst, Pearl, and Garnet their farewell gifts: Amethyst gets his old video games, Pearl his ukulele, and Garnet the wedding plan book he used to plan Ruby and Sapphire's wedding. All three accept the gifts nonchalantly, showing little concern about Steven's impending departure. Steven's father Greg tells him they are probably just trying to be supportive. As his parting gift for Greg, Steven encourages his father to move into Steven's room in the beach house.\n\nSteven says his goodbyes and drives off toward his next destination, but soon stops the car and returns to confront the Gems, demanding to know why they are taking the situation so lightly. The Gems burst into tears and explain that they didn't want their sad thoughts to prevent Steven from leaving. They assure him that, whatever happens in his future, they'll be part of it too. Everyone says they love each other, they give Steven one more goodbye, and he leaves his old home to a new path in his future. The people of Beach City wave goodbye as Steven begins his road trip, ending the episode, the series, and the ''Steven Universe'' franchise.\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Viewership ===\nThe episode was watched by 0.74 million people.<ref name=\"FinalEpisodes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-friday-cable-originals-network-finals-3-27-2020.html|title=Top 150 Friday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 3.27.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=March 30, 2020|access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Future ==\nWhile Rebecca Sugar has confirmed that this is the series finale and that there is no continuation in development, nor any ongoing projects, she has hinted that possible future stories exist. \"The story is continuing off screen and I do know what happens next...But I would have to decide how and when I'd want to dig into that, or if it's best to give them their privacy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/27/21197679/steven-universe-future-ending-finale-new-seasons-rebecca-sugar-interview|title=The reason Rebecca Sugar made Steven Universe Future, and why it\u2019s the actual end|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|date=March 27, 2020|website=Polygon|accessdate=March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSugar later told ''[[Fast Company]]'' \"I'm certainly interested in spending more time in this world with these characters.

This means less immunoreceptors CD32 (a member of the Fc family of immunoreceptors) could bind to IgG and turn the white blood cell into a macrophage.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

With the 2007 launch of [[BBC HD]], UK viewers can now watch the championship in that format. [[BBC Sport]] held the TV and radio rights through to 2010.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/golf/7041714.stm |title=BBC Sport keeps Masters contract |work=[[BBC Sport]] |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |date=October 12, 2007}}</ref> The BBC's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a [[licence fee]]. From the 2011 Masters, [[Sky Sports]] began broadcasting all four days, as well as the par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time ever, in 3D. The BBC continued to air live coverage of the weekend rounds in parallel with Sky until 2019, when it was announced that Sky will hold exclusive rights to live coverage of all four rounds beginning 2020. The BBC will only hold rights to delayed highlights. With its loss of live rights to the Open Championship to Sky in 2016, it marks the first time since 1955 that the BBC no longer holds any rights to live professional golf.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/broadcasting/sky-sports-shuts-bbc-out-of-live-golf-with-masters-deal/5144895.article|title=Sky Sports shuts BBC out of live golf with Masters deal|last=Dams|first=Tim|website=Broadcast|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://insidersport.com/2019/11/20/sky-sports-lands-exclusive-live-uk-masters-rights-from-2020/|title=Sky Sports lands exclusive live UK Masters rights from 2020|last=Streeter|first=Joe|date=2019-11-20|website=Insider Sport|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/sky-seizes-share-of-the-masters-from-bbc-2085608.html |location=London |newspaper=The Independent |first=James |last=Corrigan |title=Sky seizes share of the Masters from BBC |date=September 22, 2010}}</ref>  \n\nIn Ireland, [[Setanta Sports|Setanta Ireland]] previously showed all four rounds, and now since 2017 [[Eir Sport]] broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] broadcasting the weekend coverage.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/we-are-fully-committed-to-providing-a-public-service--without-public-funding-1241227.html |title=We are fully committed to providing a public service \u2013 without public funding |date=August 12, 2007 |newspaper=Irish Independent |accessdate=December 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Canada]], broadcast rights to the Masters are held by [[Bell Media]], with coverage divided between [[The Sports Network|TSN]] (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, [[CTV Television|CTV]] (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and [[R\u00e9seau des sports|RDS]], which carries French-language coverage.

This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as [[ESPN International]] (ESPN owns a minority stake in TSN). In 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and co-produced supplemental programs covering the tournament (while still carrying U.S. coverage for the tournament itself).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mediaincanada.com/2013/04/10/tsn-and-global-partner-to-sell-the-masters/ |title=TSN and Global partner to sell The Masters |work=Media in Canada |first=Val |last=Maloney |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bellmediapr.ca/tsn/releases/release.asp?id=16323&yyyy=2013 |title=TSN and Global Partner to Give Canadians Complete Coverage of The Masters |author=[[The Sports Network]] and [[Global Television Network]] |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn December 15, 2015, TSN parent company Bell Media announced that it had acquired exclusive Canadian rights to the tournament beginning 2016 under a multi-year deal.

Even the practice rounds can be difficult to get into. Applications for practice round tickets have to be made nearly a year in advance and the successful applicants are chosen by random ballot. Tickets to the actual tournament are sold only to members of a patrons list, which is closed. A waiting list for the patrons list was opened in 1972 and closed in 1978. It was reopened in 2000 and subsequently closed once again. In 2008, the Masters also began allowing children (between the ages of 8 and 16) to enter on tournament days free if they are accompanied by the patron who is the owner of his or her badge.<ref name=tickets>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |publisher=Masters.org |title=Ticket Information |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410081216/http://www.masters.org/en_US/about/ticket.html |archivedate=April 10, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe difficulty in acquiring Masters badges has made the tournament one of the largest events on the secondary-ticket market.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 43609580|last1 = Deloca|first1 = Paul J.|title = Reviewed work: The Masters: Golf Money and Power in Augusta, Georgia, Curt Sampson|journal = Journal of Sport History|volume = 27|issue = 2|pages = 333\u2013335|year = 2000}}</ref> A majority of the badges for the Masters are delivered to the same group of patrons, fans, and members each year, and these perennial ticket holders sometimes decide to sell their badges through large ticket marketplaces such as StubHub, TicketCity, and VividSeats.
