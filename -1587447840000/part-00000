It may be because they came overland from the North and won decisively in land battles. This scenario changed, however, when the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] arrived in India and started monopolizing and controlling trade on the western coast of the continent. Chhatrapati Shivaji realized the importance of a strong navy; the first keel of a  Maratha naval vessel was laid down in a creek near [[Kalyan]] circa 1654.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Naravane|first1=M.

He organized two fleets \u2013 one under the command of [[Maynak Bhandari|Admiral Mainak Bhandari]] and the other under Daulet Khan. The Maratha Navy consisted mostly of native [[Konkani]] sailors; however, it was commanded mostly by [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], including [[Siddi]] and [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sridharan|first1=K|title=Sea: Our Saviour|publisher=New Age International (P) Ltd.|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9PiwJF7V4EQC&pg=PA43&dq=kanhoji+angre&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=kanhoji%20angre&f=false}}</ref> Circa 1659, the Maratha Navy consisted of around 20 warships. Hiring [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] was relatively common in Maratha military culture and the Navy was no exception to this practice.  Portuguese naval officer ''Rui Leit\u00e3o Viegas'' was hired as fleet commander, in part because the Maratha wanted to get insight into the Portuguese naval technology and capabilities. The Maratha knew the Portuguese had a powerful navy.  The Portuguese convinced their mercenary officers to leave the service of the Maratha; however, the Portuguese allied with the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] when the latter went to war against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cooper|first1=Randolf GS|title=The Anglo-Maratha Campaigns and the Contest for India|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qweZWra_tbwC&pg=PA31&dq=shivaji+navy&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=shivaji%20navy&f=false}}</ref>\n \n[[File:Diorama showing maratha naval tactics, National Museum, New Delhi (cropped).jpg |thumb|right|A diorama showing Maratha naval tactics, on display at the [[National Museum, New Delhi]]]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Surat]] of 1664 was a well-coordinated one, whereby the Maratha used their [[Maratha Army|Army]] and Navy in a coordinated way.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=September 2016}} .

However, in recent years ESPN2 has broadcast increasingly more mainstream sporting events, including [[MLB on ESPN|Major League Baseball]] games, the [[East\u2013West Shrine Game]], much of the 2006 [[World Baseball Classic]], many [[Major League Soccer]] games, [[NCAA football]] games, [[NCAA basketball]] games, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], the [[Arena Football League]], regular season [[KHL]] games, and Saturday afternoon [[Nationwide Series|NASCAR Nationwide Series]] races. In 2011, ESPN2 also acquired broadcast rights to delayed coverage for some [[American Le Mans Series]] events, with series' major events airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nThe channel has also become ESPN's home for tennis coverage. The showpieces are all four of the \"Grand Slam\" tournaments: the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open (tennis)|French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. U.S.-based tournaments, including the [[ATP Masters 1000]] events at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] and [[Miami Masters|Miami]], as well as the [[US Open Series]], are also broadcast on the channel.\n\nMost of ESPN's soccer output has been broadcast on ESPN2, including [[Major League Soccer]], [[Premier League]] and [[La Liga]] matches; the channel also broadcast the United States' [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers in 2009. ESPN2 formerly broadcast matches of the [[UEFA Champions League]], until rights for that tournament moved to [[Fox Soccer]] and its sister networks. In 2003, ESPN2 began broadcasting [[Major League Lacrosse]] games. In March 2007, ESPN2 and the league agreed on a new broadcast contract that ran until the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480 |title=Full News Archive |publisher=Major League Lacrosse |accessdate=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103125955/http://majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 4 October 2017, ESPN announced that it had acquired rights to the [[Formula One World Championship]]; the majority of the races are carried by ESPN2.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/formula-1-says-goodbye-to-nbc-hello-to-espn-in-2018/|title=Formula 1 says goodbye to NBC, hello to ESPN in 2018|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nESPN2's former flagship show, the morning sports/entertainment program ''[[Cold Pizza]]'', achieved minimal success and saw several format and host changes. In January 2006, it was supplanted by the television simulcast of [[ESPN Radio]]'s ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' (which moved from [[ESPNews]]) and moved to a later time slot (10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time). In May 2007, ''Cold Pizza'' moved from New York City to the ESPN headquarters in [[Bristol, Connecticut]] and was renamed ''[[ESPN First Take]]''. After ESPN became part of a new broadcast contract with the association, ESPN2 also premiered the new daily show ''[[NASCAR Now]]'' (similar to the previous ''[[RPM 2Night]]'', except only focusing on NASCAR) in February 2007. ''[[Quite Frankly with Stephen A.

ESPN2 also simulcasts some programming from ESPNews, often during local [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]] of scheduled national game telecasts, and for a while provided a simulcast of [[ESPN Deportes]]' edition of ''SportsCenter'' on Sundays. In return, ESPN2 programming is often seen on ESPN during blackouts of games in certain markets.\n\nESPN2 also often carries ''[[SportsCenter]]'' at times when the broadcast on ESPN is delayed by a sporting event that overruns into one of the program's scheduled timeslots. ESPN and ESPN2 also jointly aired two episodes of a documentary special called ''This is SportsCenter'', in which ESPN showed a documentary showing the production of an edition of ''SportsCenter'', while the finished product aired on ESPN2. The documentary would usually air for two hours, where the first hour would cover the preliminary production of the night's show on ESPN, while ESPN2 aired ESPN's regular programming. The second hour usually spent time at [[production control]] while covering reaction to the night's developments.\n\nBoth ESPN and ESPN2 carried [[ABC News]]' coverage of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon]] (and the related crash of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]) on September 11, 2001. ESPN2 also aired the [[2008 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]] championship game in 2008 to most of the nation, since [[2008 Atlanta tornado|a storm]] damaged the original game site, the [[Georgia Dome]], causing the schedule to be rearranged and site to be moved to the smaller [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]]. The new schedule was in conflict with CBS's coverage of the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Championship]] Game; the game was produced by CBS. In the territory of the [[Southeastern Conference]], the Big Ten game aired on ESPN2.\n\nESPN2 has occasionally been used to carry simulcasts of ESPN Deportes' Spanish-language coverage of events, in an effort to boost availability of the Spanish broadcast and promote the ESPN Deportes channel (as ESPN2 is available in a significantly larger number of homes than ESPN Deportes), and reduce the need to [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] with lesser-viewed programs. Examples since 2016 have included [[NBA on Christmas Day|NBA Christmas Day games]], the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]] (whose English rights were exclusively held by [[MLB Network]]), and an [[International Champions Cup]] game between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seen on Screen: ESPN2 to Simulcast NBA Christmas Day Game in Spanish; CSN Chicago Reairs Cubs World Series Run|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/12/15/seen-on-screen-espn2-to-simulcast-nba-christmas-day-game-in-spanish-csn-chicago-reairs-cubs-world-series-run/|website=Sports Video Group|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish-language \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 coming to ESPN2|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/09/05/spanish-language-monday-night-football-espn2.html|website=New York Business Journal|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> Since the [[2017 NFL season]], ESPN2 has simulcast ESPN Deportes' Spanish-language ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' during the first nine weeks of the season, including its pre-game show ''NFL Esta Noche'', and [[ESPN Latin America]]'s ''SportsCenter'' from Mexico City.

ESPN2 also featured several half-hour news programs focused on specific sports, such as ''[[NFL Live|NFL 2Night]]'' ([[National Football League|football]]), ''[[NHL 2Night]]'' ([[National Hockey League|hockey]]) and ''[[RPM 2Night]]'' ([[auto racing]]). Event coverage would focus on coverage of mainstream sports popular within the 18\u201334 age demographic, such as auto racing, [[ESPN College Basketball|college basketball]] and [[ESPN National Hockey Night|NHL hockey]] (which was branded as ''NHL Fire on Ice''),<ref name=bsun-youthminded>{{cite news|title=For youth-minded ESPN2, casual is in when they're talking 'puck'|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-11-09/sports/1993313162_1_tom-mees-quenzel-beavis-and-butt-head|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=Baltimore Sun}}</ref> while also covering atypical sports such as [[BMX]] and other [[extreme sport]]s.<ref name=\"baltimoresun-espn2\"/>\n\nESPN2 would also be used to showcase new technology and experimental means of broadcasting events: on September 18, 1994, ESPN2 simulcast [[Champ Car|CART]]'s [[Firestone Indy 225|Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix]] using only [[onboard camera]] feeds. In 1995, ESPN2 introduced the \"[[ESPN BottomLine|BottomLine]]\", a persistent [[news ticker]] which displayed sports news and scores.

On-screen graphics (such as the BottomLine) used a blue color scheme instead of red to differentiate it from ESPN. On February 12, 2007, the ESPN2 branding was stripped from most on-air presentation and replaced with ESPN: the ESPN2 brand is now solely used for station identification.<ref name=deadspin-lastdays>{{cite web|title=The Last Days Of ESPN2|url=http://deadspin.com/233272/the-last-days-of-espn2|work=February 1, 2012|publisher=Deadspin|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Programming==\n{{See also|List of programs broadcast by ESPN|List of ESPN sports properties}}\nSports events presented on ESPN2 originally tended to be alternative sports such as [[poker]], [[billiards]], [[wood chopping|lumberjacking]], [[extreme sports]] and, more recently, [[Drum Corps International|drum and bugle corps]]. However, in recent years ESPN2 has broadcast increasingly more mainstream sporting events, including [[MLB on ESPN|Major League Baseball]] games, the [[East\u2013West Shrine Game]], much of the 2006 [[World Baseball Classic]], many [[Major League Soccer]] games, [[NCAA football]] games, [[NCAA basketball]] games, the [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]], the [[Arena Football League]], regular season [[KHL]] games, and Saturday afternoon [[Nationwide Series|NASCAR Nationwide Series]] races. In 2011, ESPN2 also acquired broadcast rights to delayed coverage for some [[American Le Mans Series]] events, with series' major events airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]].\n\nThe channel has also become ESPN's home for tennis coverage. The showpieces are all four of the \"Grand Slam\" tournaments: the [[Australian Open]], the [[French Open (tennis)|French Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] and the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. U.S.-based tournaments, including the [[ATP Masters 1000]] events at [[Indian Wells Masters|Indian Wells]] and [[Miami Masters|Miami]], as well as the [[US Open Series]], are also broadcast on the channel.\n\nMost of ESPN's soccer output has been broadcast on ESPN2, including [[Major League Soccer]], [[Premier League]] and [[La Liga]] matches; the channel also broadcast the United States' [[2010 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] qualifiers in 2009. ESPN2 formerly broadcast matches of the [[UEFA Champions League]], until rights for that tournament moved to [[Fox Soccer]] and its sister networks. In 2003, ESPN2 began broadcasting [[Major League Lacrosse]] games. In March 2007, ESPN2 and the league agreed on a new broadcast contract that ran until the 2016 season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480 |title=Full News Archive |publisher=Major League Lacrosse |accessdate=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103125955/http://majorleaguelacrosse.com/news/pressreleases/index.html?article_id=480 |archivedate=January 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 4 October 2017, ESPN announced that it had acquired rights to the [[Formula One World Championship]]; the majority of the races are carried by ESPN2.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/formula-1-says-goodbye-to-nbc-hello-to-espn-in-2018/|title=Formula 1 says goodbye to NBC, hello to ESPN in 2018|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-us}}</ref>\n\nESPN2's former flagship show, the morning sports/entertainment program ''[[Cold Pizza]]'', achieved minimal success and saw several format and host changes. In January 2006, it was supplanted by the television simulcast of [[ESPN Radio]]'s ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' (which moved from [[ESPNews]]) and moved to a later time slot (10:00&nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time). In May 2007, ''Cold Pizza'' moved from New York City to the ESPN headquarters in [[Bristol, Connecticut]] and was renamed ''[[ESPN First Take]]''. After ESPN became part of a new broadcast contract with the association, ESPN2 also premiered the new daily show ''[[NASCAR Now]]'' (similar to the previous ''[[RPM 2Night]]'', except only focusing on NASCAR) in February 2007. ''[[Quite Frankly with Stephen A. Smith]]'', a program that featured interviews with popular sports figures, had averaged extremely low ratings,<ref>[http://www.deadspin.com/sports/espn/quite-frankly-theres-no-one-watching-your-show-129710.php Quite Frankly...

ESPN2 also simulcasts some programming from ESPNews, often during local [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackouts]] of scheduled national game telecasts, and for a while provided a simulcast of [[ESPN Deportes]]' edition of ''SportsCenter'' on Sundays. In return, ESPN2 programming is often seen on ESPN during blackouts of games in certain markets.\n\nESPN2 also often carries ''[[SportsCenter]]'' at times when the broadcast on ESPN is delayed by a sporting event that overruns into one of the program's scheduled timeslots. ESPN and ESPN2 also jointly aired two episodes of a documentary special called ''This is SportsCenter'', in which ESPN showed a documentary showing the production of an edition of ''SportsCenter'', while the finished product aired on ESPN2. The documentary would usually air for two hours, where the first hour would cover the preliminary production of the night's show on ESPN, while ESPN2 aired ESPN's regular programming. The second hour usually spent time at [[production control]] while covering reaction to the night's developments.\n\nBoth ESPN and ESPN2 carried [[ABC News]]' coverage of the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] and [[The Pentagon]] (and the related crash of [[United Airlines Flight 93]] in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]) on September 11, 2001. ESPN2 also aired the [[2008 SEC Men's Basketball Tournament]] championship game in 2008 to most of the nation, since [[2008 Atlanta tornado|a storm]] damaged the original game site, the [[Georgia Dome]], causing the schedule to be rearranged and site to be moved to the smaller [[Alexander Memorial Coliseum]]. The new schedule was in conflict with CBS's coverage of the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Championship]] Game; the game was produced by CBS. In the territory of the [[Southeastern Conference]], the Big Ten game aired on ESPN2.\n\nESPN2 has occasionally been used to carry simulcasts of ESPN Deportes' Spanish-language coverage of events, in an effort to boost availability of the Spanish broadcast and promote the ESPN Deportes channel (as ESPN2 is available in a significantly larger number of homes than ESPN Deportes), and reduce the need to [[Counterprogramming (television)|counterprogram]] with lesser-viewed programs. Examples since 2016 have included [[NBA on Christmas Day|NBA Christmas Day games]], the [[2017 World Baseball Classic]] (whose English rights were exclusively held by [[MLB Network]]), and an [[International Champions Cup]] game between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|title=Seen on Screen: ESPN2 to Simulcast NBA Christmas Day Game in Spanish; CSN Chicago Reairs Cubs World Series Run|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2016/12/15/seen-on-screen-espn2-to-simulcast-nba-christmas-day-game-in-spanish-csn-chicago-reairs-cubs-world-series-run/|website=Sports Video Group|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Spanish-language \u2018Monday Night Football\u2019 coming to ESPN2|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/newyork/news/2017/09/05/spanish-language-monday-night-football-espn2.html|website=New York Business Journal|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> Since the [[2017 NFL season]], ESPN2 has simulcast ESPN Deportes' Spanish-language ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' during the first nine weeks of the season, including its pre-game show ''NFL Esta Noche'', and [[ESPN Latin America]]'s ''SportsCenter'' from Mexico City.

A number of well-known people have had the disorder. While depression was sometimes seen as a shameful secret until the 1970s, society has since begun discussing depression more openly. Earlier figures were often reluctant to discuss or seek treatment for depression due to [[social stigma]] about the condition, or due to ignorance of diagnosis or treatments. Some historical personalities are presumed to have had depression based on analysis or interpretation of letters, journals, artwork, writings or statements of family and friends.\n{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}\n\n==A==\n<!-- Note: Please cite sources when adding entries to this list, unsourced entries will be removed -->\n*[[Ben Affleck]], American actor<ref>{{cite web|last=Ryder|first=Taryn|title=Ben Affleck has been on antidepressants since age 26: 'They're very helpful for me' |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/ben-affleck-antidepressants-26-very-helpful-to-me-174343682.html|website=Yahoo|accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n*[[Caroline Aherne]], British comedian<ref>{{cite news|url=http://bbc.net.uk/comedy/news/20021001.shtml |title=Caroline Aherne quits sitcom |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=1 October 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20021216123614/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/news/20021001.shtml |archivedate=16 December 2002 |accessdate=30 November 2016 }}</ref>\n* [[Lil Peep|Gustav \u00c5hr]], American rapper, known as Lil Peep<ref>{{cite web |date=17 November 2017 |author=John Paul Brammer |agency=Associated Press |title=Death of bisexual rapper Lil Peep a reminder of mental health disparities |publisher=NBC News |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/death-bisexual-rapper-lil-peep-highlights-mental-health-disparities-n821861}}</ref>\n*[[Chantal Akerman]], Belgian [[avant-garde]] filmmaker<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/arts/chantal-akerman-belgian-filmmaker-dies-65.html| title=Chantal Akerman, Whose Films Examined Women's Inner Lives, Dies at 65 | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=6 October 2015}}</ref>\n*[[Damon Albarn]], English musician, lead vocalist of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] and [[Gorillaz]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-modern-lad-has-it-bad-1276688.html|title=The modern lad has it bad|date=1997-02-03|website=The Independent|language=en|first=Andrew|last=Marshall|access-date=2019-10-12}}</ref>\n*[[Alan Alda]], American actor and author<ref>{{cite news | url= https://abcnews.go.com/2020/Entertainment/story?id=1126307&page=1&singlePage=true | title=Another Side of Alan Alda | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=15 September 2005}}</ref>\n*[[Buzz Aldrin]], American [[astronaut]], the second person to walk on the moon<ref>Marc Lee, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/5779145/Buzz-Aldrin-the-dark-times-that-followed-that-historic-flight.html Buzz Aldrin: the dark times that followed that historic flight], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (8 July 2009).</ref>\n*[[Woody Allen]], American film director and actor<ref>[http://thecreativemind.net/2968/woody-allen-on-filmmaking-as-therapy-for-depression/ Woody Allen On Filmmaking As Therapy For Depression]</ref>\n*[[Claus von Amsberg]], German diplomat and husband of [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands]]<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1174778,00.html | title=Queen Juliana of the Netherlands | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=22 March 2004 | accessdate= 9 August 2006 | location=London}}</ref>\n*[[Hans Christian Andersen]], Danish writer<ref>Bloom, Harold [http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006606 Hans Christian Andersen wrote dark, timeless fairytales\u2014for children and grown-ups] [[The Wall Street Journal]] 20 April 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001082628/http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006606 |date=1 October 2009}}</ref>\n*[[Hideaki Anno]], Japanese animator and film director<ref name=\"What-were-we-making\">{{cite book | last = Sadamoto | first = Yoshiyuki |authorlink=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto | others = Essay by [[Hideaki Anno]];

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke (1728{{ndash}}1792), an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret (1729{{ndash}}1796), n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Francis  was the third son of John Cooke and Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Sayer, both of [[Winchester]], Hampshire.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}. Francis had married Margaret, of the Parish of [[St Christopher le Stocks]], in the [[City of London]], at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. The gold medal and vase were gifted to the nation by Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, after her on death on 14 January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke had leased Donhead Lodge from Baron [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]] in 1803 and Louisa remained in residence there until 1813.{{r|\"JC:Donhead Lodge Release\"|\"DH:30\"}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|\"LCC:Marriage\"}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|\"LCC:Death\"}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n* [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry, for the parish of St{{nbsp}}Mary, Whitechapel, records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February\" and baptised \"in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"John Cooke Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of the [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]], [[London]]. [[Joseph Jackson Howard| J. J. Howard's]] ''Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica'' states the same birth and baptism date (as well as naming godparents), and goes further, by stating that the baptism took place at the Cooke's home.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Furthermore, Cooke's father, Francis, is recorded in the 1762 [[English Land Tax|Land Tax Assessment]] Book for the Parish of Saint Mary, Whitechapel, as residing between [[Alie Street]] and [[Leman Street|Leman Street (West side)]], close to the corner of North and East Tenter streets.{{r|\"Land Tax\"|\"Location of Tenterground\"}} At the time, Francis worked as a ledger writer at the nearby [[Navy Pay Office (Royal Navy)|Navy Pay Office]] on [[Broad Street (ward)|Broad Street]].{{r|\"GAZ:Navy Pay Office\"}}{{r|Examination}} Lastly, Cooke's elder brother, Christopher, was also baptised at the Cooke's home in the parish of St{{nbsp}}Mary, on 8 August 1759, and the baptism register entry records that he was baptised \"in the Tenter Ground Goodman {{sic}} Fields\".{{r|\"JJH:51\"|\"Christopher Cooke Baptism\"}}\n\n'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} Probably Jane Pigott the wife of Thomas Pigott. Jane was godmother to Cooke's younger sister Jane.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke (1728{{ndash}}1792), an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret (1729{{ndash}}1796), n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Francis  was the third son of John Cooke and Elizabeth, n\u00e9e Sayer, both of [[Winchester]], Hampshire.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}. Francis had married Margaret, of the Parish of [[St Christopher le Stocks]], in the [[City of London]], at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. The gold medal and vase were gifted to the nation by Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, after her on death on 14 January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke had leased Donhead Lodge from Baron [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]] in 1803 and Louisa remained in residence there until 1813.{{r|\"JC:Donhead Lodge Release\"|\"DH:30\"}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|\"LCC:Marriage\"}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|\"LCC:Death\"}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n* [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry, for the parish of St{{nbsp}}Mary, Whitechapel, records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February\" and baptised \"in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"John Cooke Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of the [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]], [[London]].
