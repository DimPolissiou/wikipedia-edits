From north to south, they are [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent County]], and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex County]]. While the southern two counties have historically been predominantly agricultural, New Castle County is more urbanized.\n\nBefore its coastline was explored by Europeans in the 16th century, Delaware was inhabited by several groups of Native Americans, including the [[Lenape]] in the north and [[Nanticoke Indian Tribe|Nanticoke]] in the south. It was initially colonized by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] traders at [[Zwaanendael Colony|Zwaanendael]], near the present town of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], in 1631.<ref>{{cite book|title=Narratives of Early Pennsylvania, West New Jersey and Delaware, 1630\u20131707, Volume 13|author=Myers, Albert Cook|publisher=C.

On December 7, 1787, Delaware became the first state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], and has since been known as \"The First State\".<ref>\"The First to Ratify\" would be more accurate, as the beginnings of the states themselves date back to the Declaration of Independence, celebrated July 4, 1776, when what was to become the State of Delaware was still the three lower counties of Pennsylvania with the governor in Philadelphia, and not establishing independence from that body until [[Delaware Constitution of 1776#Background|September 20, 1776]]. According to Delaware's own website, \"Delaware became a state in 1776, just two months after the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\" (ref-[http://delaware.gov/facts/DelawareFactsandSymbols.pdf pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223143442/http://delaware.gov/facts/DelawareFactsandSymbols.pdf |date=December 23, 2016 }}) Therefore Delaware was actually the ''last'' of the thirteen colonies to establish itself as a state. Additionally, the [[50 State Quarters#Designs|Delaware State Quarter]] is minted with this nickname, yet shows [[Caesar Rodney#American Revolution|Caesar Rodney]] on horseback in commemoration of how he was the ''last'' delegate to show up to the Continental Congress for the historic vote for independence. And with regard to the original Articles of Confederation, Delaware was the [[Articles of Confederation#Ratification|12th of the 13 states to ratify]].</ref>\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe state was named after the [[Delaware River#Origin of the name|Delaware River]], which in turn derived its name from [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]] (1577\u20131618) who was the ruling governor of the [[Colony of Virginia]] at the time Europeans first explored the river. The [[Delaware Indians]], a name used by [[Europeans]] for [[Lenape]] people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.\n\nThe surname ''de La Warr'' comes from [[Sussex]] and is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ware DeGidio |first=Wanda |year=2011 |title=Ware Family History: Descendants from Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Kings and Queens, and Presidents of the United States |editor-first=Wanda |editor-last=Ware DeGidio |location= |edition=|volume= |page=10 |ref= |isbn=978-1-4010-9930-5 }}</ref> It came probably from a Norman [[lieu-dit]] ''La Guerre''. This [[toponymic]] could derive from the Latin word ''[[wikt:ager#Latin|ager]]'', from the Breton ''[[wikt:gwern#Breton|gwern]]'' or from the [[Late Latin]] ''varectum'' ([[fallow]]). The toponyms Gara, Gare, Gaire (the sound [[Open central unrounded vowel|[\u00e4]]] often mutated in [[Near-open front unrounded vowel|[\u00e6]]]) also appear in old texts cited by [[Lucien Musset]], where the word ''ga(i)ra'' means [[Gore (road)|gore]].

They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Colonial Delaware===\n{{Main|New Netherland|New Sweden|Delaware Colony}}\n[[File:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|New Sweden\u2014encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware]]\n\nThe [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Native American tribes]]. In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].<ref name=hod>{{cite book|title=History of Delaware|first =John A |last = Munroe|edition = 5th, illustrated|publisher= University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87413-947-1|page=45|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&lpg=PA45&dq=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22 | chapter = 3.

Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland|Proprietor of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania province]] and leased what then came to be known as the \"Lower Counties on the Delaware\"<ref name = hod /> from the Duke.\n\nPenn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.<ref>{{Citation |last = Lurie |first = Mappen M |title = Encyclopedia of New Jersey |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8135-3325-4 |page = 327}}</ref> Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.<ref>{{Citation |last = Mayo |first = LS |title = John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767\u20131775 |publisher = Harvard University Press |year = 1921 |page = 5}}</ref>\n\nDependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English [[immigrants]] decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.\n\n===American Revolution===\n{{Main|American Revolutionary War|Lee Resolution|United States Declaration of Independence|Philadelphia campaign|Articles of Confederation#Ratification|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nLike the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.\n\nSo it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the \"Penman of the Revolution\". Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.\n\nInitially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the \"Delaware Blues\" and nicknamed the \"[[Blue Hen Chicken|Blue Hen's Chicks]]\". In August 1777 [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County, although there was a [[Clow Rebellion|minor Loyalist rebellion]] in 1778.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.<ref>{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Schama | author-link = Simon Schama | title = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution | place = New York | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2006| title-link = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.\n\n===Slavery and race===\nMany colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African [[slaves]] because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.\n\nMost of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | first = Paul | last = Heinegg | title = Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware | accessdate = February 15, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100807191511/http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | archive-date = August 7, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref> Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.\n\nBy the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 78, 81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7% of the black population were free;{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 81\u201382}} 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 \"free colored persons\".<ref>{{Citation |url = http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |title = Historical Census Browser |contribution = 1860 Federal Census |publisher = University of Virginia Library |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate = October 11, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAn independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)|Peter Spencer]] as the \"[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]\". This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] by [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|first=Peter T.|last=Dalleo|title=The Growth of Delaware's Antebellum Free African Community|publisher=University of Delaware|date=June 27, 1997|access-date=June 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905050734/http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|archive-date=September 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> This was renamed as the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P.

While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[Maryland Civil War Confederate units|Maryland]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units|Virginia]] Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War, but rejected the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{see also|Largest municipalities in Delaware}}\n[[File:Delaware population map.png|thumb|right|Delaware population density map]]\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 59096\n|1800= 64273\n|1810= 72674\n|1820= 72749\n|1830= 76748\n|1840= 78085\n|1850= 91532\n|1860= 112216\n|1870= 125015\n|1880= 146608\n|1890= 168493\n|1900= 184735\n|1910= 202322\n|1920= 223003\n|1930= 238380\n|1940= 266505\n|1950= 318085\n|1960= 446292\n|1970= 548104\n|1980= 594338\n|1990= 666168\n|2000= 783600\n|2010= 897934\n|estimate= 973764\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data|year=2010|publisher=Census|accessdate=August 17, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref><br />2019 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/DE,US/PST045219|title=QuickFacts Delaware; UNITED STATES|format=|website=2019 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 14, 2020|accessdate=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209044515/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/DE,US/PST045219|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Delaware was 973,764 on July 1, 2019, a 8.44% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=\"PopEstUS\"/>\n\n===Ancestry===\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Delaware had a population of 897,934.

U.S.&nbsp;40 is a primary east\u2013west route, connecting Maryland with New Jersey. DE&nbsp;404 is another primary east\u2013west highway connecting the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge]] in Maryland with the Delaware beaches.

Coverage of the system is broad within northern New Castle County with close association to major highways in Kent and Sussex counties. The system includes bus, subsidized passenger rail operated by Philadelphia transit agency SEPTA, and subsidized taxi and [[paratransit]] modes. The paratransit system, consisting of a statewide door-to-door bus service for the elderly and disabled, has been described by a Delaware state report as \"the most generous paratransit system in the United States\".<ref name=montgomery2012nj/> {{As of|2012}}, fees for the paratransit service have not changed since 1988.<ref name=montgomery2012nj/>\n\n===Air===\n{{see also|Aviation in Delaware}}\n\n{{As of|2016}}, there is no scheduled air service from any Delaware airport, as has been the case in various years since 1991.

Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]] (SBY), as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Atlantic City International Airport]] (ACY), [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR), and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.\n\nOther general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Delaware Coastal Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].\n\n[[Dover Air Force Base]], one of the largest in the country, is home to the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]]. In addition to its other responsibilities in the [[Air Mobility Command]], it serves as the entry point and [[mortuary]] for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.\n\n==Law and government==\nDelaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Delaware Constitution of 1897 as amended|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=August 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908150654/http://www.delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|archive-date=September 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Legislative branch===\n[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meets in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]\n\nThe [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.\n\nDelaware's U.S. Senators are [[Tom Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[Lisa Blunt Rochester]] (Democrat).\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:\n* The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.\n* The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.\n* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.\n\nMinor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.\n\nSignificantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"divcorpabout\">{{cite web|url= http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title= About Agency|accessdate= July 23, 2008 |publisher =Delaware Division of Corporations|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDelaware was the last U.S. state to use [[judicial corporal punishment]], in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pleck|first=Elizabeth Hefkin|title=Domestic tyranny: the making of American social policy against family|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2004|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|isbn=978-0-252-07175-1|access-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231231119/https://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|archive-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}\n\nThe executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]].

This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states\u2014such as court and law enforcement\u2014have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |title=The Hundreds of Delaware |website=Department of State: Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |publisher=Delaware State Archives |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061234/http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Politics of Delaware}}\n[[File:DNC Biden (28276763694).jpg|thumb|upright|Delaware Senator [[Chris Coons]] with Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in 2016]]\n\nThe Democratic Party holds a [[pluralism (political theory)|plurality]] of registrations in Delaware. Until the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Al Gore]] by 20-percentage points. In 2004, [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight-percentage points. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware by 25-percentage points. Obama's [[running mate]] was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973. Obama carried Delaware by 19-percentage points in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Hillary Clinton]] by 11-percentage points.\n\nDelaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.\n\nThe Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, [[State Auditor]] and [[State Treasurer]].\n\n===Freedom of information===\n{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}\n\nEach of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foiadvocates.com/records.html|title=State Public Record Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=FOIAdvocates|access-date=}}</ref> In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Rep. | first2 = Sen. | last2 = Peterson | first3 = Sen. | last3 = Katz | date = January 6, 2011 | publication-date = April 15, 2011 | contribution = An Act to Amend Title 29 of the Delaware Code Relating to the Freedom of Information Act | accessdate = April 22, 2011 | contribution-url = http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | edition = online | title = Delaware Code | volume = 78 | at = 10 | id = House Bill # 5 | url = http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+5/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002095945/http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | archive-date = October 2, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nTax is collected by the [[Delaware Division of Revenue]].<ref>https://revenue.delaware.gov/</ref>\n\nDelaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.\n\nDelaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.\n\n[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state.

Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.\n\nUnlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions.

The [[Delaware Indians]], a name used by [[Europeans]] for [[Lenape]] people indigenous to the Delaware Valley, also derive their name from the same source.\n\nThe surname ''de La Warr'' comes from [[Sussex]] and is of [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] origin.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ware DeGidio |first=Wanda |year=2011 |title=Ware Family History: Descendants from Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Kings and Queens, and Presidents of the United States |editor-first=Wanda |editor-last=Ware DeGidio |location= |edition=|volume= |page=10 |ref= |isbn=978-1-4010-9930-5 }}</ref> It came probably from a Norman [[lieu-dit]] ''La Guerre''.

The all-time record low of {{convert|\u221217|F|C}} was also recorded at Millsboro, on January 17, 1893. The [[hardiness zone]]s are 7a and 7b.\n\n===Environment===\nThe transitional climate of Delaware supports a wide variety of vegetation.

They had a settled hunting and agricultural society, and they rapidly became middlemen in an increasingly frantic fur trade with their ancient enemy, the Minqua or [[Susquehannock]]. With the loss of their lands on the Delaware River and the destruction of the Minqua by the [[Iroquois]] of the Five Nations in the 1670s, the remnants of the Lenape who wished to remain identified as such left the region and moved over the [[Alleghany Mountains]] by the mid-18th century. Generally, those who did not relocate out of the state of Delaware were baptized, became Christian and were grouped together with other persons of color in official records and in the minds of their non-Native American neighbors.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Colonial Delaware===\n{{Main|New Netherland|New Sweden|Delaware Colony}}\n[[File:NouvSuede.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|New Sweden\u2014encounter between Swedish colonists and the natives of Delaware]]\n\nThe [[Dutch people|Dutch]] were the first Europeans to settle in present-day Delaware in the middle region by establishing a trading post at [[Zwaanendael, Delaware|Zwaanendael]], near the site of [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]] in 1631. Within a year all the settlers were killed in a dispute with [[Native Americans in the United States|area Native American tribes]]. In 1638 [[New Sweden]], a [[Swedish people|Swedish]] trading post and colony, was established at [[Fort Christina]] (now in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]]) by [[Peter Minuit]] at the head of a group of Swedes, [[Finnish people|Finns]] and Dutch. The colony of New Sweden lasted 17 years. In 1651 the Dutch, reinvigorated by the leadership of [[Peter Stuyvesant]], established a fort at present-day [[New Castle, Delaware|New Castle]], and in 1655 they conquered the New Sweden colony, annexing it into the Dutch [[New Netherland]].<ref name=hod>{{cite book|title=History of Delaware|first =John A |last = Munroe|edition = 5th, illustrated|publisher= University of Delaware Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-87413-947-1|page=45|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vs7NcOKnlNUC&lpg=PA45&dq=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q=%22Lower%20counties%22%20%22on%20the%20delaware%22 | chapter = 3.

Fighting off a prior claim by [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]], [[Province of Maryland|Proprietor of Maryland]], the Duke passed his somewhat dubious ownership on to [[William Penn]] in 1682. Penn strongly desired access to the sea for his [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania province]] and leased what then came to be known as the \"Lower Counties on the Delaware\"<ref name = hod /> from the Duke.\n\nPenn established representative government and briefly combined his two possessions under one General Assembly in 1682. However, by 1704 the Province of Pennsylvania had grown so large that their representatives wanted to make decisions without the assent of the Lower Counties, and the two groups of representatives began meeting on their own, one at [[Philadelphia]], and the other at New Castle. Penn and his heirs remained proprietors of both and always appointed the same person Governor for their Province of Pennsylvania and their territory of the Lower Counties. The fact that Delaware and Pennsylvania shared the same governor was not unique. From 1703 to 1738 New York and New Jersey shared a governor.<ref>{{Citation |last = Lurie |first = Mappen M |title = Encyclopedia of New Jersey |publisher = Rutgers University Press |year = 2004 |isbn = 978-0-8135-3325-4 |page = 327}}</ref> Massachusetts and New Hampshire also shared a governor for some time.<ref>{{Citation |last = Mayo |first = LS |title = John Wentworth, Governor of New Hampshire: 1767\u20131775 |publisher = Harvard University Press |year = 1921 |page = 5}}</ref>\n\nDependent in early years on indentured labor, Delaware imported more slaves as the number of English [[immigrants]] decreased with better economic conditions in England. The colony became a slave society and cultivated tobacco as a cash crop, although English immigrants continued to arrive.\n\n===American Revolution===\n{{Main|American Revolutionary War|Lee Resolution|United States Declaration of Independence|Philadelphia campaign|Articles of Confederation#Ratification|Treaty of Paris (1783)|Constitutional Convention (United States)|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}\n\nLike the other middle colonies, the Lower Counties on the Delaware initially showed little enthusiasm for a break with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. The citizenry had a good relationship with the Proprietary government, and generally were allowed more independence of action in their Colonial Assembly than in other colonies. Merchants at the port of Wilmington had trading ties with the British.\n\nSo it was that New Castle lawyer [[Thomas McKean]] denounced the [[Stamp Act]] in the strongest terms, and Kent County native [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] became the \"Penman of the Revolution\". Anticipating the Declaration of Independence, [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] leaders Thomas McKean and [[Caesar Rodney]] convinced the Colonial Assembly to declare itself separated from British and Pennsylvania rule on June 15, 1776. The person best representing Delaware's majority, [[George Read (signer)|George Read]], could not bring himself to vote for a Declaration of Independence. Only the dramatic overnight ride of Caesar Rodney gave the delegation the votes needed to cast Delaware's vote for independence.\n\nInitially led by [[John Haslet]], Delaware provided one of the premier regiments in the [[Continental Army]], known as the \"Delaware Blues\" and nicknamed the \"[[Blue Hen Chicken|Blue Hen's Chicks]]\". In August 1777 [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|General Sir William Howe]] led a British army through Delaware on his way to a victory at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] and capture of the city of Philadelphia. The only real engagement on Delaware soil was the [[Battle of Cooch's Bridge]], fought on September 3, 1777, at [[Cooch's Bridge]] in New Castle County, although there was a [[Clow Rebellion|minor Loyalist rebellion]] in 1778.\n\nFollowing the Battle of Brandywine, Wilmington was occupied by the British, and [[Governor of Delaware|State President]] [[John McKinly]] was taken prisoner. The British remained in control of the Delaware River for much of the rest of the war, disrupting commerce and providing encouragement to an active [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] portion of the population, particularly in Sussex County. Because the British promised slaves of rebels freedom for fighting with them, escaped slaves flocked north to join their lines.<ref>{{Citation | first = Simon | last = Schama | author-link = Simon Schama | title = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution | place = New York | publisher = Harper Collins | year = 2006| title-link = Rough Crossings: Britain, the Slaves, and the American Revolution }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the [[American Revolution]], statesmen from Delaware were among the leading proponents of a strong central United States with equal representation for each state.\n\n===Slavery and race===\nMany colonial settlers came to Delaware from Maryland and Virginia, where the population had been increasing rapidly. The economies of these colonies were chiefly based on labor-intensive tobacco and increasingly dependent on African [[slaves]] because of a decline in working class immigrants from England. Most of the English colonists had arrived as [[indentured servant]]s (contracted for a fixed period to pay for their passage), and in the early years the line between servant and slave was fluid.\n\nMost of the free African-American families in Delaware before the Revolution had migrated from Maryland to find more affordable land. They were descendants chiefly of relationships or marriages between white servant women and enslaved, servant or free African or African-American men.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | first = Paul | last = Heinegg | title = Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware | accessdate = February 15, 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100807191511/http://www.freeafricanamericans.com/ | archive-date = August 7, 2010 | url-status = live }}</ref> Under slavery law, children took the social status of their mothers, so children born to white women were free, regardless of their paternity, just as children born to enslaved women were born into slavery. As the flow of indentured laborers to the colony decreased with improving economic conditions in England, more slaves were imported for labor and the caste lines hardened.\n\nBy the end of the colonial period, the number of enslaved people in Delaware began to decline. Shifts in the agriculture economy from tobacco to mixed farming resulted in less need for slaves' labor. In addition local [[Methodist]]s and [[Quaker]]s encouraged slaveholders to free their slaves following the American Revolution, and many did so in a surge of individual manumissions for idealistic reasons. By 1810 three-quarters of all blacks in Delaware were free. When John Dickinson freed his slaves in 1777, he was Delaware's largest slave owner with 37 slaves. By 1860, the largest slaveholder owned 16 slaves.{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 78, 81\u201382}}\n\nAlthough attempts to abolish slavery failed by narrow margins in the legislature, in practical terms the state had mostly ended the practice. By the [[United States Census, 1860|1860 census]] on the verge of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], 91.7% of the black population were free;{{Sfn |Kolchin |1994 |pp = 81\u201382}} 1,798 were slaves, as compared to 19,829 \"free colored persons\".<ref>{{Citation |url = http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |title = Historical Census Browser |contribution = 1860 Federal Census |publisher = University of Virginia Library |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141011024040/http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu/php/start.php?year=V1860 |archivedate = October 11, 2014 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAn independent black denomination was chartered in 1813 by freed slave [[Peter Spencer (religious leader)|Peter Spencer]] as the \"[[Spencer Churches|Union Church of Africans]]\". This followed the 1793 establishment in Philadelphia of the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] by [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], which had ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church until 1816. Spencer built a church in Wilmington for the new denomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|first=Peter T.|last=Dalleo|title=The Growth of Delaware's Antebellum Free African Community|publisher=University of Delaware|date=June 27, 1997|access-date=June 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905050734/http://www.udel.edu/BlackHistory/antebellum.html|archive-date=September 5, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> This was renamed as the [[African Union First Colored Methodist Protestant Church and Connection]], more commonly known as the [[A.U.M.P.

While most Delaware citizens who fought in the war served in the regiments of the state, some served in companies on the Confederate side in [[Maryland Civil War Confederate units|Maryland]] and [[List of Virginia Civil War units|Virginia]] Regiments. Delaware is notable for being the only slave state from which no Confederate regiments or militia groups were assembled. Delaware essentially freed the few slaves who were still in bondage shortly after the Civil War, but rejected the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th]], [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th]], and [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|15th]] Amendments to the Constitution; the 13th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1865, the 14th Amendment was rejected on February 8, 1867, and the 15th Amendment was rejected on March 18, 1869. Delaware officially ratified the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments on February 12, 1901.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{see also|Largest municipalities in Delaware}}\n[[File:Delaware population map.png|thumb|right|Delaware population density map]]\n{{US Census population\n|1790= 59096\n|1800= 64273\n|1810= 72674\n|1820= 72749\n|1830= 76748\n|1840= 78085\n|1850= 91532\n|1860= 112216\n|1870= 125015\n|1880= 146608\n|1890= 168493\n|1900= 184735\n|1910= 202322\n|1920= 223003\n|1930= 238380\n|1940= 266505\n|1950= 318085\n|1960= 446292\n|1970= 548104\n|1980= 594338\n|1990= 666168\n|2000= 783600\n|2010= 897934\n|estimate= 973764\n|estyear= 2019\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=Source: 1910\u20132010<ref>{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|title=Resident Population Data|year=2010|publisher=Census|accessdate=August 17, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019160532/http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/apportionment-pop-text.php|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}</ref><br />2019 estimate<ref name=\"PopEstUS\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/DE,US/PST045219|title=QuickFacts Delaware; UNITED STATES|format=|website=2019 Population Estimates|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]], Population Division|date=February 14, 2020|accessdate=February 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209044515/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/DE,US/PST045219|archive-date=February 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\nThe [[United States Census Bureau]] estimates that the population of Delaware was 973,764 on July 1, 2019, a 8.44% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]].<ref name=\"PopEstUS\"/>\n\n===Ancestry===\nAccording to the 2010 United States Census, Delaware had a population of 897,934.

Therefore, Delaware [[commercial airline]] passengers most frequently use [[Philadelphia International Airport]] (PHL), [[Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport]] (BWI) and [[Washington Dulles International Airport]] (IAD) for domestic and international transit. Residents of Sussex County will also use [[Wicomico Regional Airport]] (SBY), as it is located less than {{convert|10|mi|km}} from the Delaware border. [[Atlantic City International Airport]] (ACY), [[Newark Liberty International Airport]] (EWR), and [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (DCA) are also within a {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}} radius of New Castle County.\n\nOther general aviation airports in Delaware include [[Summit Airport (Delaware)|Summit Airport]] near [[Middletown, Delaware|Middletown]], [[Delaware Airpark]] near [[Cheswold, Delaware|Cheswold]], and [[Delaware Coastal Airport]] near [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].\n\n[[Dover Air Force Base]], one of the largest in the country, is home to the [[436th Airlift Wing]] and the [[512th Airlift Wing]]. In addition to its other responsibilities in the [[Air Mobility Command]], it serves as the entry point and [[mortuary]] for U.S. military personnel (and some civilians) who die overseas.\n\n==Law and government==\nDelaware's fourth and current constitution, adopted in 1897, provides for executive, judicial and legislative branches.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Delaware Constitution of 1897 as amended|url=http://delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|website=State of Delaware|accessdate=August 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908150654/http://www.delcode.delaware.gov/constitution/|archive-date=September 8, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Legislative branch===\n[[File:Delaware State Capitol.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Delaware General Assembly]] meets in the [[Delaware State Capitol|Legislative Hall]] in [[Dover, Delaware|Dover]].]]\n\nThe [[Delaware General Assembly]] consists of a [[Delaware House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with 41 members and a [[Delaware Senate|Senate]] with 21 members. It sits in Dover, the state capital. Representatives are elected to two-year terms, while senators are elected to four-year terms. The Senate confirms judicial and other nominees appointed by the governor.\n\nDelaware's U.S. Senators are [[Tom Carper]] (Democrat) and [[Chris Coons]] (Democrat). Delaware's single U.S. Representative is [[Lisa Blunt Rochester]] (Democrat).\n\n===Judicial branch===\nThe Delaware Constitution establishes a number of courts:\n* The [[Delaware Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court.\n* The [[Delaware Superior Court]] is the state's trial court of general jurisdiction.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Chancery]] deals primarily in corporate disputes.\n* The Family Court handles domestic and custody matters.\n* The [[Delaware Court of Common Pleas]] has jurisdiction over a limited class of civil and criminal matters.\n\nMinor non-constitutional courts include the [[Justice of the Peace]] Courts and Aldermen's Courts.\n\nSignificantly, Delaware has one of the few remaining Courts of [[Court of equity|Chancery]] in the nation, which has jurisdiction over [[Equity (law)|equity]] cases, the vast majority of which are corporate disputes, many relating to [[mergers and acquisitions]]. The [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]] and the Delaware Supreme Court have developed a worldwide reputation for rendering concise opinions concerning [[corporate law]] which generally (but not always) grant broad discretion to corporate boards of directors and officers. In addition, the [[Delaware General Corporation Law]], which forms the basis of the Courts' opinions, is widely regarded as giving great flexibility to corporations to manage their affairs. For these reasons, Delaware is considered to have the most business-friendly legal system in the United States; therefore a great number of companies are [[incorporated in Delaware]], including 60% of the companies listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"divcorpabout\">{{cite web|url= http://www.corp.delaware.gov/aboutagency.shtml |title= About Agency|accessdate= July 23, 2008 |publisher =Delaware Division of Corporations|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070228002805/http://www.state.de.us/corp/aboutagency.shtml |archivedate=February 28, 2007}}</ref>\n\nDelaware was the last U.S. state to use [[judicial corporal punishment]], in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pleck|first=Elizabeth Hefkin|title=Domestic tyranny: the making of American social policy against family|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2004|page=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|isbn=978-0-252-07175-1|access-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231231119/https://books.google.com/books?id=zN2A2shTz6YC&pg=PA120|archive-date=December 31, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Executive branch===\n{{See also|List of Governors of Delaware}}\n\nThe executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Delaware]].

This is the fewest among all states. Each county elects its own legislative body (known in New Castle and Sussex counties as '''County Council''', and in Kent County as '''Levy Court'''), which deal primarily in zoning and development issues. Most functions which are handled on a county-by-county basis in other states\u2014such as court and law enforcement\u2014have been centralized in Delaware, leading to a significant concentration of power in the Delaware state government. The counties were historically divided into [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundreds]], which were used as tax reporting and voting districts until the 1960s, but now serve no administrative role, their only current official legal use being in real estate title descriptions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |title=The Hundreds of Delaware |website=Department of State: Division of Historical and Cultural Affairs |publisher=Delaware State Archives |accessdate=September 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617061234/http://history.delaware.gov/museums/vc/vc_hundreds.shtml |archivedate=June 17, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Politics===\n{{Main|Politics of Delaware}}\n[[File:DNC Biden (28276763694).jpg|thumb|upright|Delaware Senator [[Chris Coons]] with Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in 2016]]\n\nThe Democratic Party holds a [[pluralism (political theory)|plurality]] of registrations in Delaware. Until the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]], the state tended to be a Presidential [[bellwether]], sending its three [[electoral votes]] to the winning candidate since 1952. This trend ended in 2000 when Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Al Gore]] by 20-percentage points. In 2004, [[John Kerry]] won Delaware by eight-percentage points. In 2008, Democrat [[Barack Obama]] defeated Republican [[John McCain]] in Delaware by 25-percentage points. Obama's [[running mate]] was [[Joe Biden]], who had represented Delaware in the [[United States Senate]] since 1973. Obama carried Delaware by 19-percentage points in 2012. In 2016, Delaware's electoral votes went to [[Hillary Clinton]] by 11-percentage points.\n\nDelaware's swing to the Democrats is in part due to a strong Democratic trend in New Castle County, home to 55 percent of Delaware's population (the two smaller counties have only 359,000 people between them to New Castle's 535,000). New Castle has not voted Republican in a presidential election since 1988. In 1992, 2000, 2004, and 2016, the Republican presidential candidate carried both Kent and Sussex but lost by double digits each time in New Castle, which was a large enough margin to swing the state to the Democrats. New Castle also elects a substantial majority of the legislature; 27 of the 41 state house districts and 14 of the 21 state senate districts are based in New Castle.\n\nThe Democrats have held the governorship since 1993, having won the last seven gubernatorial elections in a row. Democrats presently hold all the nine statewide elected offices, while the Republicans last won two statewide offices in 2014, [[State Auditor]] and [[State Treasurer]].\n\n===Freedom of information===\n{{see also|Freedom of information in the United States#State legislation}}\n\nEach of the 50 states of the United States has passed some form of freedom of information legislation, which provides a mechanism for the general public to request information of the government.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foiadvocates.com/records.html|title=State Public Record Laws|last=|first=|date=|website=FOIAdvocates|access-date=}}</ref> In 2011 Delaware passed legislation placing a 15 business day time limit on addressing freedom-of-information requests, to either produce information or an explanation of why such information would take longer than this time to produce.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Bennett | first1 = Rep. | first2 = Sen. | last2 = Peterson | first3 = Sen. | last3 = Katz | date = January 6, 2011 | publication-date = April 15, 2011 | contribution = An Act to Amend Title 29 of the Delaware Code Relating to the Freedom of Information Act | accessdate = April 22, 2011 | contribution-url = http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | edition = online | title = Delaware Code | volume = 78 | at = 10 | id = House Bill # 5 | url = http://legis.delaware.gov/LIS/lis146.nsf/vwLegislation/HB+5/ | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111002095945/http://legis.delaware.gov/lis/lis146.nsf/vwlegislation/HB+5 | archive-date = October 2, 2011 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\n===Taxation===\nTax is collected by the [[Delaware Division of Revenue]].<ref>https://revenue.delaware.gov/</ref>\n\nDelaware has six different [[income tax]] brackets, ranging from 2.2% to 5.95%. The state does not assess [[sales tax]] on consumers. The state does, however, impose a tax on the gross receipts of most businesses. Business and occupational license tax rates range from 0.096% to 1.92%, depending on the category of business activity.\n\nDelaware does not assess a state-level tax on real or personal property. Real estate is subject to county [[property tax]]es, school district property taxes, vocational school district taxes, and, if located within an incorporated area, municipal property taxes.\n\n[[Gambling in the United States#Authorized types|Gambling]] provides significant revenue to the state.

Significantly, ''Belton'' was the only case in which the state court found for the plaintiffs, thereby ruling that segregation is unconstitutional.\n\nUnlike many states, Delaware's educational system is centralized in a state Superintendent of Education, with local school boards retaining control over taxation and some curriculum decisions.
