Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

Davis was the fifth and longest-serving president of [[West Virginia State University|West Virginia State College]] in [[Institute, West Virginia]], from 1919 to 1953. Born in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend high school at Atlanta Baptist College (later known as [[Morehouse College]]). He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse, and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in 1911. At Morehouse, Davis formed associations with [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], [[Samuel Archer]], [[Benjamin Griffith Brawley]], [[Booker T. Washington]], and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. He completed [[Graduate school|graduate studies]] in chemistry and physics at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1911 to 1913, and served on the faculty of Morehouse as the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and as a professor in chemistry and physics. While in Atlanta, Davis helped to found one of the city's first chapters of the [[NAACP|National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).\n\nDavis served as the executive secretary of the [[Twelfth Street YMCA Building|Twelfth Street YMCA]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1917 to 1919, when he was elected as the president of West Virginia Collegiate Institute. Under Davis' leadership, West Virginia Collegiate Institute (later renamed West Virginia State College) became one of the leading [[historically black colleges and universities]] and [[Land-grant university|land-grant universities]] in the United States, in both academics and athletics. Through Davis' efforts, West Virginia Collegiate Institute became the first African American college to be [[Educational accreditation|accredited]] by the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] (NCA) in 1927. Under Davis' leadership, the college became home to the West Virginia Schools for the Colored Deaf and Blind and to West Virginia's [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service|Extension Service]] for African Americans. Davis also secured a [[Civilian Pilot Training Program]] (CPTP) and [[Army Specialized Training Program]] (ASTP) unit for the college during [[World War II]]. Through his efforts and educational statesmanship, Davis laid the groundwork for West Virginia State's transition into an integrated institution, and white students began enrolling in large numbers toward the end of his presidency.\n\nDavis was appointed by U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] as a charter member to the first [[National Science Board]] for the [[National Science Foundation]], on which he served from 1950 to 1956. In addition, President Truman appointed Davis as the director of the [[Point Four Program|Technical Cooperation Administration]] program in [[Liberia]] from 1952 to 1954. Davis helped to establish the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (NAACP LDF), and he served as special director of the NAACP LDF Teacher Information and Security Program from 1955 to 1972. In this role, Davis administered the NAACP LDF's scholarship programs for African American undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. In his later life, Davis was appointed to the U.S. National Commission for the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) and served as a member of the [[Bergen Community College|Bergen County College]] board of trustees. Davis continued to work as an active consultant for the NAACP LDF and serve as the head of its Herbert Lehmann Fund until his death in 1980. Davis was a recipient of 14 [[honorary degrees]] throughout his lifetime, and he was awarded [[Haiti]]'s [[National Order of Honour and Merit]] (1948) and Liberia's [[Order of the Star of Africa]] (1955) for his service to those countries.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nJohn Warren Davis was born on 11 February 1888 in [[Milledgeville, Georgia]].<ref name=\"WVAH 1\">{{cite web |url= http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |title= John Warren Davis  |author= West Virginia Archives and History |year= 2019 |publisher= West Virginia Department of Arts, Culture and History |access-date= 29 February 2020 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200229171815/http://www.wvculture.org/history/archives/blacks/jwdavis.html |archive-date= 29 February 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"The Record 1\">{{cite newspaper | last = Anderson | first = Gene | title = Dr. John Warren Davis, adviser to five presidents | newspaper = [[The Record (North Jersey)|The Record]] | location = [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] | date = 13 July 1980 | page = 22 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | accessdate = 2 March 2020 | via = [[Newspapers.com]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200302233738/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/46009114/dr-john-warren-davis-adviser-to-five/ | archive-date = 2 March 2020}}</ref> He was the son of Robert Marion Davis, a merchant, and his wife, Katie Mann Davis.<ref name=\"WVAH 1\"/><ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\">{{Harvnb|Moorland\u2013Spingarn Research Center Staff|2015|p=4.}}</ref> Davis' mother, Katie Mann Davis, was the biracial daughter of a white pastor.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=123.}}</ref> Davis was raised at his maternal grandfather's home from the age of five, after his parents relocated to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] with their other children.<ref name=\"Bardolph 123\"/>\n\nDavis attended elementary school in Milledgeville; however, since there were no public high schools for [[African Americans]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], Davis relocated to [[Atlanta]] in 1903 to attend [[Morehouse College|Atlanta Baptist College]] (later known as Morehouse College).<ref name=\"MSRC 2015 4\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\">{{Harvnb|Garibaldi|1984|p=x.}}</ref> He worked his way through high school and college at Morehouse,<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/> and gained the attention of the college's first African American president, [[John Hope (educator)|John Hope]], while polishing the floor of the president's house.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\">{{Harvnb|Bardolph|1959|p=130.}}</ref> Hope, known as \"the maker of college presidents,\" elevated Davis to a position in the college's business office.<ref name=\"Bardolph 130\"/> Davis completed the school's academic course in 1907<ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 99\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=99.}}</ref> and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (with honors) in 1911.<ref name=\"The Record 1\"/><ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Morehouse College 1921 89\">{{Harvnb|Morehouse College|1921|p=89.}}</ref>\n\nWhile attending Morehouse, Davis was a roommate of [[Mordecai Wyatt Johnson]], who later served as president of [[Howard University]], and remained a longstanding friend of Davis.<ref name=\"Garibaldi x\"/><ref name=\"Gloster 1981 78\">{{Harvnb|Gloster|1981|p=78.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson both played for Morehouse's [[American football|football team]], on which Davis was a [[defensive end]].<ref name=\"Wesley 1981 76\">{{Harvnb|Wesley|1981|p=76.}}</ref> Davis and Johnson befriended [[Charles H.

He has contributed to many areas of physics, including that of [[Brownian motion]], and in the establishment of the statistical basis of [[thermodynamics]], and non-Euclidean geometrical theories of relativity. He was the scientific coordinator of the \"European Thermodynamics Network\" in the European Commission Program of Human Capital and Mobility. He was also a proponent for the establishment of, and scientific director of, a National (Italian) Centre for Thermodynamics, and has acted as scientific consultant to companies such as the [[Eni|ENI]] Group, where he helped to found TEMA, a consulting firm for SNAM Progetti, [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] (Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and the Environment), and the [[Solar Energy Research Institute]] in [[Golden, Colorado]]. He has had over 130 scientific papers published in international journals, some critical of the new fashions and modes in theoretical physics.\n\nProfessor Lavenda currently lives in [[Trevignano Romano]] near Rome, is married with two adult children and two grandchildren, for whom his textbook \"A New Perspective on Thermodynamics\" is dedicated.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nBernard H. Lavenda was born in New York City. After completing secondary school in [[North Adams, Massachusetts]], he attended [[Clark University]] where he graduated ''cum laude'' in 1966 with a B.Sc in chemistry. Having passed the entrance examination for the doctoral program at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], he began experimental work on enzymes under the direction of [[Ephraim Katzir]], who was later to become the President of Israel. Realizing that he was not made out for experimental work, he came under the influence of Ephraim's brother, Aaron, after reading his book ''Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics in Biophysics'', coauthored with Peter Curran.\n\nAfter the Six Days War, [[Aaron Katchalsky]] helped him secure a studentship for a doctoral degree in [[Ilya Prigogine]]'s group in Brussels.\n\n===Doctoral thesis===\nHis doctoral thesis, \"Kinetic analysis and thermodynamic interpretation of nonequilibrium unstable transitions in open systems\", showed that when homogeneous nonlinear chemical reactions far from equilibrium on the thermodynamic branch, which is an extension of the law of mass action at equilibrium, become unstable they make transitions to kinetic branches with lower entropy production than the thermodynamic branch.\n \nThis result was initially contested by Prigogine who reasoned from hydrodynamic instabilities, like the Rayleigh-Benard instability, which show a larger entropy production beyond the critical point in order to maintain spatial structures.  Prigogine later considered these spatial structures to be produced by unstable chemically diffusing systems, based on [[Alan Turing]]'s morphological models, calling them 'dissipative structures' and for which Turing received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1977.\n\nPrigogine later acknowledged that such transitions to lower states of entropy reduction were possible since no  spatial structural changes were involved, and later incorporated Lavenda's work into a chapter  of his new book Thermodynamic Theory of Structure, Stability, and Fluctuations, co-authored with [[Paul Glansdorff]]. \nAfter receiving his doctorate from the Universite Libre de Bruxelles, with la plus grande distinction, he returned to Israel in 1970 to work as a post-doctoral student in the Physical Chemistry Department of the Hebrew University.\nDuring that period he published a short note in the Italian physics journal, Lettere Al Nuovo Cimento [3 (1972) 385-390] criticizing the Glansdorff-Prigogine universal criteria of evolution which attributes an inequality to a potential which is a function only of intensive   variables, the forces. He pointed out that no such thermodynamic potential could exist for it would be devoid of all information regarding how large the system is,  or how many particles it contains.  The inequality would be a criterion of stability, but, on account of the assumption of local (stable) equilibrium of the components that the system is broken up into, the sum of stable components can hardly become unstable. The note would probably have gone unnoticed were it not for Peter Landsberg's citation of  it in his ''Nature'' review of the Glansdorff-Prigogine book  [P. T. Landsberg, \"The fourth law of thermodynamics\"<ref>''Nature'' 238 (1972) 229-231 http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v238/n5361/abs/238229a0.html</ref>], where he predicted \"the occasional lack of lucidity in the book which may give rise to some discussion within the next few years\".\n\n=== Career ===\n\n====Consultancies====\nAfter the murder of [[Aharon Katzir]] in [[Lod Airport massacre]] in May 1972, Lavenda accepted a position of consultant at [[Nuovo Pignone]] in Florence Italy together with a teaching position at the University of Pisa.\nThrough  the vice President of Nuovo Pignone,  he came into contact with Vicenzo Gervasio who was later to become President of ENI Data, and the idea crystallized of setting up a company dedicated to the analysis and dynamic modeling of fouling processes in refineries and reactors. He established relations between ENI and Northwest Research, Boeing, and SERI (Solar Energy Research Institute). \nHe helped form a new company within the ENI group, TEMA, which was supported by SNAM Progetti. While retaining an unpaid lectureship in Thermodynamics at the University of Naples, Lavenda published his critical appraisal of the then current theories of irreversible thermodynamics, Thermodynamics of Irreversible Processes, in 1978. It was originally published by the Macmillan Press and later became a Dover Classic of Science and Mathematics.\n\n==== Camerino years ====\n\nIn 1980 he won a chair in Physical Chemistry. Transferring to Camerino, he was to spend more than three decades there.  \nHis first book during this period, \"Nonequilibrium Statistical Thermodynamics\", published by Wiley in 1985, developed the nonlinear generalization of the Onsager-Machlup formulation of nonequilibrium fluctuations which was restricted to linear (Gaussian) processes.  \nJust as equilibrium is characterized by the state of maximum entropy, corresponding to maximum probability,  nonequilibrium states are characterized by the principle of least dissipation of energy, corresponding to the maximum probability of a transition between nonequilibrium states that are not well-separated in time. \nThis principle can be generalized to non-Gaussian fluctuations in the limit of small thermal noise and constitutes a kinetic analog to Boltzmann's principle.\n\nDuring a sabbatical year in 1986 in Porto Alegre, Lavenda had ample time to browse through the well-furnished library at the Universidade Federale di Rio Grande del Sud. \nHe was impressed by the parallelism between statistical inference and statistical thermodynamics: two distinct and separate branches that are essentially working on the same problems but with no apparent connection. \nHis work, summarized in Statistical Physics: A Probabilistic Approach, published by Wiley-Interscience in 1991, completes Boltzmann's principle, which expresses the entropy as the logarithm of a combinatorial factor, by showing that the entropy is the potential that determines Gauss\u2019 law of error for which the average value is the most probable value.\nJust as there are frequency and degree- of-belief ([[Bayes' theorem]]) interpretations of statistical inference, the same should apply to statistical thermodynamics.  The frequency interpretation applies to extensive variables, like energy and volume which can be sampled, while the degree-of-belief  interpretations applies to the intensive variables, like temperature and pressure, for which sampling has no meaning.  The connection between the two branches translates the Cramer-Rao inequality into thermodynamic uncertainty relations, analogous to quantum mechanical uncertainty relations, where the more knowledge we have about a thermodynamic variable the less we know about its conjugate. \nSince the lack of a probability distribution means the absence of its statistics, the possibility of an intermediate statistics, or what is referred to as parastatistics, between [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics]] and [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics]] is nonexistent.\n\nStatistical thermodynamics is usually concerned with most probable behavior which becomes almost certainty if large enough samples are taken. \nBut sometimes surprises are in store where extreme behavior becomes the prevalent one.\nTurning his attention to such rare events Lavenda published Thermodynamics of Extremes in 1995, whose real interest lies in the formulation of a thermodynamics of earthquakes that was subsequently published in Annali di Geofisica (Extreme value statistics and thermodynamics of earthquakes: \"Large earthquakes\";<ref>Annali di geofisica 43 (2000) 469-484 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277</ref> \"aftershock sequences\"<ref>Annali di geofisica43 (2000) 967-982 http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/1277</ref>), and which is gaining increasing attention.\nBy properly defining entropy and energy, a temperature can be associated to an aftershock sequence giving it an additional means of characterization. \nA new magnitude-frequency relation is predicted which applies to clustered after-shocks in contrast to the [Gutenberg-Richter law] which treats them as independent and identically distributed random events.\n\n====Attempts at forming a centre for thermodynamics====\nIn the nineties, Lavenda saw thermodynamics as a cultural heritage that could have a place in Italian society, and would be pertinent to both industrial research and to the preservation of its artistic patrimony. \nHe was a proponent for the establishment of a National Centre of Thermodynamics for which financial funding was unavailable.  Capturing the interest of the ENEA, or the Italian agency for alternative energy resources, he applied for funding in the European Commission of Human Capital and Mobility Programme. \nHis project, \"Thermodynamics of Complex Systems\", came in sixth place in Chemistry section with maximum funding in 1992.\nThis led to the formation of a European Thermodynamics Network consisting of 16 partners in the EU and Switzerland.\nIt was later extended to the Eastern European Countries in the European Commission PECO Programme.

Retrieved February 29, 2016</ref>\n\nIts [[ecclesiastical province]] includes four suffragan bishoprics: \n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bilbao|Bilbao]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Osma\u2013Soria|Osma\u2013Soria]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palencia|Palencia]]\n* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Vitoria|Vitoria]]\n\n== Extent and flock == \nThe archdiocese comprises since the [[Concordat of 1851]] almost the entire [[Burgos province]]. \nIts area is approximately {{convert|8694|sqmi|km2}}, with a population in the early 20th century of 340,000, divided into 1220 [[parish]]es which form forty-seven [[vicariate]]s. By 2006, the number of parishes had declined to 1001.\n\nIn 2006, the Archdiocese of Burgos had 339,360 Catholics.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dburg.html#info According to Catholic-Hierarchy]</ref>  This meant that 94% of the population was Catholic in the area. However, since the Catholic Church records people who have been baptized as members, and only with the rare occurrence of excommunication are people normally removed from the records, this figure probably includes many people who not only do not attend Catholic services but may have actually been baptized in and currently attending [[Protestant]], [[Latter-day Saint]] or [[Muslim]] services.\n\nThe diocese had 589 Catholics per priest, which although it was higher than the 439 Catholics per priest that there had been in 1978 it was much lower than the 655 Catholics per priest in the Diocese back in 1950.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe northern and eastern portion of the diocese is mountainous, thickly wooded, and traversed by rivers, among which is the [[Ebro]], which rises in the mountains and serves as the eastern boundary for [[Miranda de Ebro]]. The [[Arlanza river|Arlanza]] which crosses the diocese from east to west flows by [[Salas de los Infantes]], near the famous monastery of [[Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], and through the center of the well-known town of [[Lerma, Burgos|Lerma]].\n\nThe mountainous region is unproductive of cereals, but fruits grow in abundance, and fine pasture-lands sustain great herds of cows and sheep, which furnish excellent meat and milk. Delicate cheeses which take their name from the city and are famous throughout Spain, are made in this section. Minerals are abundant, especially sulphate of soda, common salt, iron, and hard coal. The southern part of the diocese, especially the valley and plains, is fertile and produces abundantly vegetables, cereals, and quite a quantity of wind. The climate, cold but healthy, is damp towards the north. Although this section has few industries, the transportation of its fruit and minerals is greatly facilitated by the numerous highways and by the railroad between [[Madrid]] and [[France]] which crosses the eastern side of the diocese from south to north. There are also some secondary railway lines for the operation of the mines.\n\n== History ==\nBurgos has been since 800 AD an [[episcopal see]] of [[Spain]], into which in the 1087 the territory of the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese]] of [[Valpuesta]] (a [[suffragan]] of the [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] Metropolitan of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona|Tarragona]]; later the [[titular see]] of [[Valliposita]]) was merged.\n \nIn 1574 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] raised it to [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] rank, at the request of King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n=== Councils in Burgos ===\nSome important councils have been held in Burgos. A national council took place there in 1078, although opinions differ as to date (the \"Bolet\u00edn de la Academia de la Historia de Madrid\", 1906, XLIX, 337, says 1080). This was presided over by the [[papal delegate]], Cardinal Roberto, and attended by King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]]. It was convoked for the purpose of introducing into Spain the [[Roman Rite]] form of [[Mass (liturgy)|liturgy]] with the [[Roman Breviary]] and [[Sacramentary]], in place of the [[Mozarabic Rite]] then in use (which now survives only in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|Toledo]]).\n\nAnother national council, presided over by [[Boso Breakspeare|Cardinal Boso]] (d. 1181), also papal delegate, settled questions of discipline and established diocesan rights and limits. The proceedings of this council remained unpublished until quite recently, when they were made known in the Bolet\u00edn already mentioned (XLVIII) 395).\n\nIn 1898, a provincial council was called by Archbishop (not Cardinal) [[Gregorio Aguirre|Don Gregorio Aguirre]], in which the obligations of the clergy and the faithful were most minutely set forth.\n\n== (Archi)Episcopal incumbents ==\n\n=== Bishops of Burgos (1075\u20131574)===\n# 1075\u20131082 : Sime\u00f3n<!--en IBERCRONOX--> (or Sim\u00f3n<!--en la Breve historia de la di\u00f3cesis-->)\n# 1082\u20131096 : G\u00f3mez\n# 1097\u20131114 : Garc\u00eda Azn\u00e1rez\n# 1114\u20131118 : Pascual\n# 1119\u20131146 : Ramiro (intruso)\n# 1147\u20131156 : V\u00edctor\n# 1156\u20131181 : Pedro P\u00e9rez\n# 1181\u20131200 : [[Marino Mat\u00e9]]\n# 1200\u20131205 : Mateo I\n# 1206\u20131211 : [[Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez de Contreras]]<ref name=GarciaContre>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcntrr.html \"Bishop Garc\u00eda de Contreras\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

Two local saints were the martyrs [[Centola and Helen|Centola and (H)Elen(s)]].\n\n[[Saint I\u00f1igo]] (Enecus or Ignatius), abbot of [[O\u00f1a]], while not born in Burgos, labored there for many years; also [[Dominic of Silos|Saint Domingo de Silos]], abbot and reformer of the famous [[monastery of Silos]], and [[John of Sahag\u00fan|Saint John of Sahag\u00fan]], a native of that town in the [[Province of Le\u00f3n]].\n\nAmong its saints may also be mentioned the martyrs of [[Carde\u00f1a]], religious of the convent of the same name, who in the tenth century were executed by the Arab soldiers of the [[Emir of C\u00f3rdoba]] in one of their numerous invasions of Castile; and [[St. Casilda]], daughter of a [[Moorish]] king of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], converted near Burgos whither she had gone with her father's consent to drink the water of some medicinal springs. She built a [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] and died a saintly death.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of Burgos]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Wikisource1913CatholicEnc|Burgos}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Roman Catholic dioceses in Spain}}\n{{coord missing|Spain}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burgos, Archdiocese}}\n[[Category:Roman Catholic dioceses in Spain]]\n[[Category:Dioceses established in the 10th century]]\n[[Category:Archbishops of Burgos| ]]\n[[Category:Bishops of Burgos| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox diocese\n| jurisdiction      = Archdiocese \n| name              = Burgos\n| latin             = Archidioecesis Burgensis\n| local             = Archidi\u00f3cesis de Burgos\n| image             = Burgos Cathedral 2005-05-30.jpg\n| image_size        = 230px\n| image_alt         = \n| caption           = [[Burgos Cathedral]]\n<!---- Locations ---->\n| country           = {{flag|Spain}}\n| territory         = \n| province          = Burgos\n| metropolitan      = \n| archdeaconries    = \n| deaneries         = \n| subdivisions      = \n| coordinates       = <!-- Use {{coord}} -->\n<!---- Statistics ---->\n| area_km2          = 13,849 \n| area_sqmi         = <!-- Area in square miles, automatically converted -->\n| area_footnotes    = \n| population        = 375,563\n| population_as_of  = 2012\n| catholics         = 339,185\n| catholics_percent = 90.3\n| parishes          = 1003\n| churches          = <!-- Number of churches in the diocese -->\n| congregations     = <!-- Number of congregations in the diocese -->\n| schools           = <!-- Number of church supported schools in the diocese -->\n| members           = <!-- Number of members in the diocese -->\n<!---- Information ---->\n| denomination      = [[Roman Catholic]]\n| sui_iuris_church  = [[Latin Church]] \n| rite              = [[Roman Rite]] \n| established       = 1075 <small>(As Diocese of Burgos)</small><br>22 October 1574 <small>(As Archdiocese of Burgos)</small>\n| cathedral         = [[Burgos Cathedral|Cathedral of St Mary in Burgos]] \n| cocathedral       = \n| patron            = <!-- Patron saint(s) of the diocese (or archdiocese) -->\n| patron_title      = <!-- Use to override the default label \"Patron saint\" -->\n| priests           = <!-- Number of priests in the diocese -->\n<!---- Current leadership ---->\n| pope              = {{Incumbent pope}} <!-- DO NOT CHANGE.

By 2006, the number of parishes had declined to 1001.\n\nIn 2006, the Archdiocese of Burgos had 339,360 Catholics.<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dburg.html#info According to Catholic-Hierarchy]</ref>  This meant that 94% of the population was Catholic in the area. However, since the Catholic Church records people who have been baptized as members, and only with the rare occurrence of excommunication are people normally removed from the records, this figure probably includes many people who not only do not attend Catholic services but may have actually been baptized in and currently attending [[Protestant]], [[Latter-day Saint]] or [[Muslim]] services.\n\nThe diocese had 589 Catholics per priest, which although it was higher than the 439 Catholics per priest that there had been in 1978 it was much lower than the 655 Catholics per priest in the Diocese back in 1950.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe northern and eastern portion of the diocese is mountainous, thickly wooded, and traversed by rivers, among which is the [[Ebro]], which rises in the mountains and serves as the eastern boundary for [[Miranda de Ebro]]. The [[Arlanza river|Arlanza]] which crosses the diocese from east to west flows by [[Salas de los Infantes]], near the famous monastery of [[Silos Abbey|Santo Domingo de Silos]], and through the center of the well-known town of [[Lerma, Burgos|Lerma]].\n\nThe mountainous region is unproductive of cereals, but fruits grow in abundance, and fine pasture-lands sustain great herds of cows and sheep, which furnish excellent meat and milk. Delicate cheeses which take their name from the city and are famous throughout Spain, are made in this section. Minerals are abundant, especially sulphate of soda, common salt, iron, and hard coal. The southern part of the diocese, especially the valley and plains, is fertile and produces abundantly vegetables, cereals, and quite a quantity of wind. The climate, cold but healthy, is damp towards the north. Although this section has few industries, the transportation of its fruit and minerals is greatly facilitated by the numerous highways and by the railroad between [[Madrid]] and [[France]] which crosses the eastern side of the diocese from south to north. There are also some secondary railway lines for the operation of the mines.\n\n== History ==\nBurgos has been since 800 AD an [[episcopal see]] of [[Spain]], into which in the 1087 the territory of the suppressed [[Roman Catholic Diocese]] of [[Valpuesta]] (a [[suffragan]] of the [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] Metropolitan of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tarragona|Tarragona]]; later the [[titular see]] of [[Valliposita]]) was merged.\n \nIn 1574 [[Pope Gregory XIII]] raised it to [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] rank, at the request of King [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\n=== Councils in Burgos ===\nSome important councils have been held in Burgos. A national council took place there in 1078, although opinions differ as to date (the \"Bolet\u00edn de la Academia de la Historia de Madrid\", 1906, XLIX, 337, says 1080). This was presided over by the [[papal delegate]], Cardinal Roberto, and attended by King [[Alfonso VI of Castile]]. It was convoked for the purpose of introducing into Spain the [[Roman Rite]] form of [[Mass (liturgy)|liturgy]] with the [[Roman Breviary]] and [[Sacramentary]], in place of the [[Mozarabic Rite]] then in use (which now survives only in [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|Toledo]]).\n\nAnother national council, presided over by [[Boso Breakspeare|Cardinal Boso]] (d. 1181), also papal delegate, settled questions of discipline and established diocesan rights and limits. The proceedings of this council remained unpublished until quite recently, when they were made known in the Bolet\u00edn already mentioned (XLVIII) 395).\n\nIn 1898, a provincial council was called by Archbishop (not Cardinal) [[Gregorio Aguirre|Don Gregorio Aguirre]], in which the obligations of the clergy and the faithful were most minutely set forth.\n\n== (Archi)Episcopal incumbents ==\n\n=== Bishops of Burgos (1075\u20131574)===\n# 1075\u20131082 : Sime\u00f3n<!--en IBERCRONOX--> (or Sim\u00f3n<!--en la Breve historia de la di\u00f3cesis-->)\n# 1082\u20131096 : G\u00f3mez\n# 1097\u20131114 : Garc\u00eda Azn\u00e1rez\n# 1114\u20131118 : Pascual\n# 1119\u20131146 : Ramiro (intruso)\n# 1147\u20131156 : V\u00edctor\n# 1156\u20131181 : Pedro P\u00e9rez\n# 1181\u20131200 : [[Marino Mat\u00e9]]\n# 1200\u20131205 : Mateo I\n# 1206\u20131211 : [[Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez de Contreras]]<ref name=GarciaContre>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/bishop/bcntrr.html \"Bishop Garc\u00eda de Contreras\"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''.

There are 54 [[List of ethnic groups in Vietnam|ethnic groups in Vietnam]], each with its own language, lifestyle, and cultural heritage. The majority of Vietnamese are '''Kinh people''' ({{lang|vi|ng\u01b0\u1eddi Kinh}}) who are an [[East Asian]] [[ethnic group]] native to present-day northern [[Vietnam]] and southern [[China]]. They speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic language]]. They formed 85% of the population of Vietnam in the 2019 census, and are officially known as '''Kinh''' to distinguish them from minority ethnic groups within the country. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people is ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t|L\u1ea1c]]'' or ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]].\n \nAlthough Vietnam is geographically and linguistically considered Southeast Asian, the Vietnamese belong in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] due to the historical [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. They are culturally very similar to neighboring southern Han Chinese subgroups and other ethnic minorities from South China. The word ''Vi\u1ec7t'' derives from ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]'' ('Baiyue' in Chinese) and ''Nam'' means \"south\". \"Baiyue\" was a name used by the [[Han Chinese]] in ancient times to describe various southern non-Chinese peoples. Together, Vietnam means \"to the south of the Viet\", as Vietnam is located south of the ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]''.\n\nThe Viet are one of the 4 main groups of Vietic speakers in Vietnam, the others being the [[Muong people|Muong]], [[Th\u1ed5 people|Th\u1ed5]] and [[Ch\u1ee9t people|Ch\u1ee9t]].\n\n==Origins==\nWritten history first refers to the ancient Vietnamese people simply as the L\u1ea1c or [[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]], and the country of [[Vietnam]] as [[V\u0103n Lang]]. Archaeological evidence has been found of the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] (also known as Lac Society), a culture that existed during the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe Vietnamese or Kinh people are an Austroasiatic people who lived originally in the area of current northern Vietnam and southeastern China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/991634/filename/Ferlus2009_Dongsonian_JSEALS.pdf|title=HAL-SHS - Sciences de l'Homme et de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 - Accueil|website=hal.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> From there, several Austroasiatic tribes migrated to other parts of Vietnam, as well as the rest of Southeast Asia and parts of today's Indonesia and eastern India.

They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the [[H\u00f9ng king]].\n\n===First Vietnamese===\nHistorians believe that the earliest Vietnamese people gradually moved from the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago through the Malay Peninsula and Thailand until they settled on the edges of the Red River in the Tonkin Delta.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Archaeologists follow a path of stone tools from the Late [[Pleistocene]] across Java, Malaysia, Thailand and north to Myanmar. These stone tools are thought to be the first human tools used in Southeast Asia. Archaeologists believe that at this time the Himalayas, a chain of mountains in northern Myanmar and China, created an icy barrier which isolated the people of Southeast Asia. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (25,000-18,000 BCE), ocean levels dropped significantly. This resulted in the exposure of the shallow areas surrounding the coasts and islands of Southeast Asia - today known as the [[Sunda Shelf]].\n\nIt is generally thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the exposed Sunda Shelf looked like a giant salt plain, and that perhaps people ventured out across this area to settle on other coasts or islands. Later, when the glaciers melted, the Sunda Shelf again disappeared under water. Because it is a relatively shallow body of water, it has always provided a safe area for traders and travelers in small boats to pass safely without the threat of high or choppy seas. In this way, the geography of the area has had a lot to do with the way in which cultures developed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} As the map indicates, outside the Sunda Shelf are deep ocean basins which were not often crossed until heavier and wider Chinese vessels (massive vessels from the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), which dwarfed later European man-of-war sailing ships) could traverse these deep and sometimes dangerous seas.\n\nAs the glaciers melted and the seas near these coasts rose, traders and other travelers who wanted to migrate to other areas, or perhaps to proselytize religion, used boats as transport. For the next 4,000 years, until 8000 BCE, people also moved across the mainland of Southeast Asia towards the Tonkin Delta, some stopping and settling along the way. Eventually, the descendants of these migratory peoples entered the Neolithic Age (from around 8000-800 BCE), when humans started to use simple stone tools.  Remains of these people and the [[Hoabinhian]] culture have been found in the H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Caves along the Red River and in the Tonkin Delta. In the [[Neolithic#Middle Neolithic|Middle Neolithic]] Period (2500\u20132000 BCE), more people appeared in the area of present-day Vietnam and settled at another location called [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]], in a central area of the Tonkin Delta. These people were probably somewhat taller and lighter-skinned than the Hoabinhian [[negrito]]s; they excelled in the art of [[basket weaving]] as well as in the manufacturing and use of polished double-edged stone tools.\n\n===Earlier Vietnamese groups===\n[[File:World 500 BCE showing Van Lang.png|right|thumb|Map of [[V\u0103n Lang]], 500&nbsp;BC]]\nSometime after the advent of the societies found at H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh and B\u1eafc S\u01a1n, another group of people developed a culture in what is modern [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]], where an aspect of their religion was manifested in large mounds of mollusk shells which had been collected from the [[Red River Delta]]. Bodies had been buried under these piles of shells in a seated position with bent knees - in the same position as many buried bodies found throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. This signifies to archaeologists that these early people had an advanced society based on fishing and that their religion was oriented toward the sea. At a location further south of the [[Tonkin]] Delta, in the central region of Vietnam's coast, remains of another culture have been found at Sa Hu\u1ef3nh. The [[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture]] existed from about 4000 to 1000 BCE. Tools, ornamental beads, and funerary jars have also been found at these archaeological sites. These jars were usually located at the water's edge and probably signified a dead person's journey out to sea.\n\nThroughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be considered the period in which organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the [[Annamite Range]] to the eastern coast of [[Northern Vietnam]]. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into knee-deep ponds in which the rice was grown.\n\n===Cultural and historical influences===\n\n====North====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}} \nBefore the Chinese actually annexed Vietnam, groups from present-day southern China began to move into the Tonkin Delta<!--What is the Tonkin Delta?--> in order to start new lives after being forced to leave their homelands. Thus, around the 3rd century BC, changes in China began to heavily influence the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] which was thriving in Vietnam. One important series of changes occurred along the Yangtze River in southern China. According to historians, in 333 BC, three cultures, the [[Shu (state)|Shu]], the Ch'u, and the [[Yue (state)|Yueh]] began to fight among themselves, causing the Yueh to move south in small scattered kingdoms. At the same time, the central power of northern China, the Ch'in Dynasty, began to split so that a large number of princes and members of the aristocracy also moved south to start their own small kingdoms. [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] \u8d8a gave the name \"[[Viet]]\".\n[[File:Town Dress of Women from Tonkin, Woman from Tonkin, Cult Objects, Riflemen from Tonkin.JPG|thumb|People of [[Tonkin]], 1861-1880]]\nThe people of the Red River civilizations, also known as Lac society, began to feel the effects of these newcomers who gradually moved into their homelands. Many historians believe that it was not difficult for the Yueh to be incorporated into Lac society. However, the Au Lac lords began to fight with the Ch'in princes. While they were involved in this fighting, another group from the northwest, the Thuc (who had once been the Shu of the Yangtze River) took advantage of weakness in the area and asserted their authority. The legendary [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]], the remains of which can still be seen today. [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s arrival explains the origins of the legendary [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] kingdom which is usually associated with the height of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture. [[Vietnamese language]] may be representative of these influences.\n\n====South====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\nVietnam today is characterized by two major river deltas, the [[Red River Delta]] in the north and the [[Mekong Delta]] in the south. In prehistoric times, before the ethnic Vietnamese moved southward, another [[Indianized kingdom]] formed along the coasts north of the Mekong Delta. It was composed of Malayo-Polynesian people and was highly influenced by Indian and Indonesian traders and religious people. This area developed into the kingdom of [[Champa]] which was similar to other Hindu-Buddhist civilizations which were being formed in Indonesia, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]].\n[[File:Nam Tien.PNG|180px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the ''Nam ti\u1ebfn, 1069\u20131757'')]]\n\n[[Champa]] did not become an established kingdom until 192 AD after which time it became quite advanced with walled cities, books and archives, palaces, and monuments, many of which were built by slaves. [[Cham people|Residents of Champa]] were able to grow two crops of rice per year with a sophisticated system of irrigation which was overseen by a water chief, someone selected to monitor the irrigation ditches and canals. While some cities in Champa remained centers of religion and trade, this kingdom was mostly made up of small territories in river valleys and on coastal plains, each with a local ruler who was seen by his subjects as a representative of the gods. The height of Cham civilization occurred during the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, much trading occurred between the Chams and the highlanders who needed salt as well as with coastal villages in Vietnam and with China. Important trade items included elephant and rhinoceros tusks, cardamom, bee wax, aromatic woods and [[betel nut]]. However, when times were not going well in the small coastal city-states, the people turned to looting and pirating in other coastal towns of Champa and Vietnam. After centuries of these pirate raids, the Vietnamese began to fight back and eventually conquered Champa, but not before many aspects of Cham society were incorporated into the societies of Vietnam Cham society is organized in a cluster of City-States, not very different from ancient Greece, in contrast of centralized Vietnamese society influenced by China in the north.\n\n===Prehistoric mythology===\nThe movement and changing cultures of early Vietnam are explained through myths which give historians insight into what might have happened in the Dong Son era. The most well-known origin myth says the first Vietnamese people originated from the marriage of a dragon father and a fairy mother who had 100 sons. Because the dragon was a water creature and the fairy was a land creature, they decided they could no longer stay together. The fairy mother took 50 sons to the highlands, and the dragon father took 50 sons to the coast. One of the sons who went with the dragon father became the founder of the Hung Dynasty which is thought to have existed from as early as 2769 BC until 100 AD. The 50 sons who went to the coast are considered to be the people of the Lac Kingdom. According to historians and archaeologists, the Lac people were coastal people who had developed a sophisticated wet rice agricultural society from as early as 1500 BC. The Hungs, as depicted in the mythology, were [[mountain people]] who are believed to have had a reciprocal agreement with the Lac Kingdom so that the Hungs protected the Lacs from aggressive mountain groups in return for rice and other crops grown on the coastal plains of the Red River. These mythological stories, which in many cases can be matched with archaeological remains, tell of the joining of fire and water, or the earth people and the water people. The joining of these two elements has both historical and religious meaning.<ref>[[Paul Mus]], \"Vi\u00eat Nam.

Later this symbol was changed to the dragon following Chinese mythology. These origin myths were not written down by the Vietnamese people until about the 13th century AD, long after the Vietnamese had been colonized by the Chinese.<ref>Thanh H. Vuong, \"Th\u00e9orie des contextes et relations internationales: d\u00e9part de la premi\u00e8re Guerre d'Indochine\", dans \u00c9tudes Internationales, Vol. XVII, No. 3, pp, 571-597, septembre 1986</ref> \n[[File:Hanoi conducteur de pp.jpg|thumb|Rickshaw in [[Hanoi]] in the 19th century]]\nOrigin myths also show how the early Vietnamese people saw themselves in terms of their environment. Since water and sun were the most important elements of nature, they were incorporated into their mythology in a way which gave the people and the elements a common origin. Much of early Vietnamese religion involved nature and human relationships with their surroundings. The early Vietnamese people compared the soil, the water, and the sun to God in [[animism]]. In these elements there was energy which benefited the people and the greater power to help or to destroy. At times this power was compared to that of a child who may cause great destruction without even realizing it. In the earliest times people believed in ghosts and spirits which were thought to dwell in every tree, stone, mountain, cloud, stream, and animal. Rocks and mountains were thought to be able to multiply. These spirits were said to be the wandering souls of the dead, the ancestors of the people who had settled nearby. This type of religion is known as an ancestor cult. Because the ancestor spirits were the medium between living people and the greater forces of nature, they had to be honored in rituals and sacrifices in order to maintain harmony between the elements, the spirits, the ancestors, and the people. Later, as the Vietnamese people were converted to [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and then [[Confucianism]] by the Chinese, most villagers maintained these original beliefs\u2014especially those involving [[ancestor cult]] and incorporated them into the new religions. This is an example of \"creative borrowing\" by a people while their own culture remains a strong underlying force.<ref>Thanh H.

In 208 BC, [[Zhao Tuo]], a former [[Qin dynasty]] general from China, allied with the leaders of the Yue in the area of modern-day [[Guangdong]] and declared himself king of the [[Nanyue]] \"Southern Yue\". He defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and combined \u00c2u L\u1ea1c with his territories in southern China.\n\n==Diaspora==\n{{Main|Overseas Vietnamese}}\n[[File:San Jose Tet parade, 2009.jpg|thumb|Vietnamese [[T\u1ebft|New Year]] parade, San Jose, California]]\nOriginally from northern Vietnam and southern China, the Vietnamese have conquered much of the land belonging to the former [[Champa]] Kingdom and [[Khmer Empire]] over the centuries. They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a significant portion of the population of [[Cambodia]].\n\nBeginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes. Descendants of Vietnamese migrants in China form the [[Gin people|Gin]] ethnic group in the country and primarily reside in and around [[Guangxi Province]].

There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France.

They speak [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the most widely spoken [[Austroasiatic language]]. They formed 85% of the population of Vietnam in the 2019 census, and are officially known as '''Kinh''' to distinguish them from minority ethnic groups within the country. The earliest recorded name for the ancient Vietnamese people is ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t|L\u1ea1c]]'' or ''[[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]].\n \nAlthough Vietnam is geographically and linguistically considered Southeast Asian, the Vietnamese belong in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] due to the historical [[Chinese domination of Vietnam]]. They are culturally very similar to neighboring southern Han Chinese subgroups and other ethnic minorities from South China. The word ''Vi\u1ec7t'' derives from ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]'' ('Baiyue' in Chinese) and ''Nam'' means \"south\". \"Baiyue\" was a name used by the [[Han Chinese]] in ancient times to describe various southern non-Chinese peoples. Together, Vietnam means \"to the south of the Viet\", as Vietnam is located south of the ''[[Baiyue|B\u00e1ch Vi\u1ec7t]]''.\n\n==Origins==\nWritten history first refers to the ancient Vietnamese people simply as the L\u1ea1c or [[L\u1ea1c Vi\u1ec7t]], and the country of [[Vietnam]] as [[V\u0103n Lang]]. Archaeological evidence has been found of the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] (also known as Lac Society), a culture that existed during the [[Bronze Age]].\n\nThe Vietnamese or Kinh people are an Austroasiatic people who lived originally in the area of current northern Vietnam and southeastern China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/991634/filename/Ferlus2009_Dongsonian_JSEALS.pdf|title=HAL-SHS - Sciences de l'Homme et de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 - Accueil|website=hal.archives-ouvertes.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref> From there, several Austroasiatic tribes migrated to other parts of Vietnam, as well as the rest of Southeast Asia and parts of today's Indonesia and eastern India.

They married and had one hundred eggs, from which hatched one hundred children. Their eldest son ruled as the [[H\u00f9ng king]].\n\n===First Vietnamese===\nHistorians believe that the earliest Vietnamese people gradually moved from the [[Indonesia]]n archipelago through the Malay Peninsula and Thailand until they settled on the edges of the Red River in the Tonkin Delta.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Archaeologists follow a path of stone tools from the Late [[Pleistocene]] across Java, Malaysia, Thailand and north to Myanmar. These stone tools are thought to be the first human tools used in Southeast Asia. Archaeologists believe that at this time the Himalayas, a chain of mountains in northern Myanmar and China, created an icy barrier which isolated the people of Southeast Asia. During the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (25,000-18,000 BCE), ocean levels dropped significantly. This resulted in the exposure of the shallow areas surrounding the coasts and islands of Southeast Asia - today known as the [[Sunda Shelf]].\n\nIt is generally thought{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} that the exposed Sunda Shelf looked like a giant salt plain, and that perhaps people ventured out across this area to settle on other coasts or islands. Later, when the glaciers melted, the Sunda Shelf again disappeared under water. Because it is a relatively shallow body of water, it has always provided a safe area for traders and travelers in small boats to pass safely without the threat of high or choppy seas. In this way, the geography of the area has had a lot to do with the way in which cultures developed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} As the map indicates, outside the Sunda Shelf are deep ocean basins which were not often crossed until heavier and wider Chinese vessels (massive vessels from the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279), which dwarfed later European man-of-war sailing ships) could traverse these deep and sometimes dangerous seas.\n\nAs the glaciers melted and the seas near these coasts rose, traders and other travelers who wanted to migrate to other areas, or perhaps to proselytize religion, used boats as transport. For the next 4,000 years, until 8000 BCE, people also moved across the mainland of Southeast Asia towards the Tonkin Delta, some stopping and settling along the way. Eventually, the descendants of these migratory peoples entered the Neolithic Age (from around 8000-800 BCE), when humans started to use simple stone tools.  Remains of these people and the [[Hoabinhian]] culture have been found in the H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh Caves along the Red River and in the Tonkin Delta. In the [[Neolithic#Middle Neolithic|Middle Neolithic]] Period (2500\u20132000 BCE), more people appeared in the area of present-day Vietnam and settled at another location called [[B\u1eafc S\u01a1n District|B\u1eafc S\u01a1n]], in a central area of the Tonkin Delta. These people were probably somewhat taller and lighter-skinned than the Hoabinhian [[negrito]]s; they excelled in the art of [[basket weaving]] as well as in the manufacturing and use of polished double-edged stone tools.\n\n===Earlier Vietnamese groups===\n[[File:World 500 BCE showing Van Lang.png|right|thumb|Map of [[V\u0103n Lang]], 500&nbsp;BC]]\nSometime after the advent of the societies found at H\u00f2a B\u00ecnh and B\u1eafc S\u01a1n, another group of people developed a culture in what is modern [[Ngh\u1ec7 An Province]], where an aspect of their religion was manifested in large mounds of mollusk shells which had been collected from the [[Red River Delta]]. Bodies had been buried under these piles of shells in a seated position with bent knees - in the same position as many buried bodies found throughout Indonesia and the Philippines. This signifies to archaeologists that these early people had an advanced society based on fishing and that their religion was oriented toward the sea. At a location further south of the [[Tonkin]] Delta, in the central region of Vietnam's coast, remains of another culture have been found at Sa Hu\u1ef3nh. The [[Sa Hu\u1ef3nh culture]] existed from about 4000 to 1000 BCE. Tools, ornamental beads, and funerary jars have also been found at these archaeological sites. These jars were usually located at the water's edge and probably signified a dead person's journey out to sea.\n\nThroughout Southeast Asia, the Neolithic Period can be considered the period in which organized societies developed. During this period the Vietnamese people spread across a large area from the foothills of the [[Annamite Range]] to the eastern coast of [[Northern Vietnam]]. It is thought that they lived in small communities with groups of extended families living in a simple communal way. The growing of rice, their staple food, had developed into two distinct methods, shifting cultivation, done on a dry field, usually in upland areas, and wet rice cultivation, which involved the construction of dikes around rivers that collected water into knee-deep ponds in which the rice was grown.\n\n===Cultural and historical influences===\n\n====North====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}} \nBefore the Chinese actually annexed Vietnam, groups from present-day southern China began to move into the Tonkin Delta<!--What is the Tonkin Delta?--> in order to start new lives after being forced to leave their homelands. Thus, around the 3rd century BC, changes in China began to heavily influence the [[\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture]] which was thriving in Vietnam. One important series of changes occurred along the Yangtze River in southern China. According to historians, in 333 BC, three cultures, the [[Shu (state)|Shu]], the Ch'u, and the [[Yue (state)|Yueh]] began to fight among themselves, causing the Yueh to move south in small scattered kingdoms. At the same time, the central power of northern China, the Ch'in Dynasty, began to split so that a large number of princes and members of the aristocracy also moved south to start their own small kingdoms. [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] \u8d8a gave the name \"[[Viet]]\".\n[[File:Town Dress of Women from Tonkin, Woman from Tonkin, Cult Objects, Riflemen from Tonkin.JPG|thumb|People of [[Tonkin]], 1861-1880]]\nThe people of the Red River civilizations, also known as Lac society, began to feel the effects of these newcomers who gradually moved into their homelands. Many historians believe that it was not difficult for the Yueh to be incorporated into Lac society. However, the Au Lac lords began to fight with the Ch'in princes. While they were involved in this fighting, another group from the northwest, the Thuc (who had once been the Shu of the Yangtze River) took advantage of weakness in the area and asserted their authority. The legendary [[C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel]], the remains of which can still be seen today. [[An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng]]'s arrival explains the origins of the legendary [[\u00c2u L\u1ea1c]] kingdom which is usually associated with the height of \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture. [[Vietnamese language]] may be representative of these influences.\n\n====South====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}\nVietnam today is characterized by two major river deltas, the [[Red River Delta]] in the north and the [[Mekong Delta]] in the south. In prehistoric times, before the ethnic Vietnamese moved southward, another [[Indianized kingdom]] formed along the coasts north of the Mekong Delta. It was composed of Malayo-Polynesian people and was highly influenced by Indian and Indonesian traders and religious people. This area developed into the kingdom of [[Champa]] which was similar to other Hindu-Buddhist civilizations which were being formed in Indonesia, [[Burma]], [[Thailand]], and [[Cambodia]].\n[[File:Nam Tien.PNG|180px|right|thumb|Map of Vietnam showing the conquest of the south (the ''Nam ti\u1ebfn, 1069\u20131757'')]]\n\n[[Champa]] did not become an established kingdom until 192 AD after which time it became quite advanced with walled cities, books and archives, palaces, and monuments, many of which were built by slaves. [[Cham people|Residents of Champa]] were able to grow two crops of rice per year with a sophisticated system of irrigation which was overseen by a water chief, someone selected to monitor the irrigation ditches and canals. While some cities in Champa remained centers of religion and trade, this kingdom was mostly made up of small territories in river valleys and on coastal plains, each with a local ruler who was seen by his subjects as a representative of the gods. The height of Cham civilization occurred during the 6th to 8th centuries. At this time, much trading occurred between the Chams and the highlanders who needed salt as well as with coastal villages in Vietnam and with China. Important trade items included elephant and rhinoceros tusks, cardamom, bee wax, aromatic woods and [[betel nut]]. However, when times were not going well in the small coastal city-states, the people turned to looting and pirating in other coastal towns of Champa and Vietnam. After centuries of these pirate raids, the Vietnamese began to fight back and eventually conquered Champa, but not before many aspects of Cham society were incorporated into the societies of Vietnam Cham society is organized in a cluster of City-States, not very different from ancient Greece, in contrast of centralized Vietnamese society influenced by China in the north.\n\n===Prehistoric mythology===\nThe movement and changing cultures of early Vietnam are explained through myths which give historians insight into what might have happened in the Dong Son era. The most well-known origin myth says the first Vietnamese people originated from the marriage of a dragon father and a fairy mother who had 100 sons. Because the dragon was a water creature and the fairy was a land creature, they decided they could no longer stay together. The fairy mother took 50 sons to the highlands, and the dragon father took 50 sons to the coast. One of the sons who went with the dragon father became the founder of the Hung Dynasty which is thought to have existed from as early as 2769 BC until 100 AD. The 50 sons who went to the coast are considered to be the people of the Lac Kingdom. According to historians and archaeologists, the Lac people were coastal people who had developed a sophisticated wet rice agricultural society from as early as 1500 BC. The Hungs, as depicted in the mythology, were [[mountain people]] who are believed to have had a reciprocal agreement with the Lac Kingdom so that the Hungs protected the Lacs from aggressive mountain groups in return for rice and other crops grown on the coastal plains of the Red River. These mythological stories, which in many cases can be matched with archaeological remains, tell of the joining of fire and water, or the earth people and the water people. The joining of these two elements has both historical and religious meaning.<ref>[[Paul Mus]], \"Vi\u00eat Nam.

Later this symbol was changed to the dragon following Chinese mythology. These origin myths were not written down by the Vietnamese people until about the 13th century AD, long after the Vietnamese had been colonized by the Chinese.<ref>Thanh H. Vuong, \"Th\u00e9orie des contextes et relations internationales: d\u00e9part de la premi\u00e8re Guerre d'Indochine\", dans \u00c9tudes Internationales, Vol. XVII, No. 3, pp, 571-597, septembre 1986</ref> \n[[File:Hanoi conducteur de pp.jpg|thumb|Rickshaw in [[Hanoi]] in the 19th century]]\nOrigin myths also show how the early Vietnamese people saw themselves in terms of their environment. Since water and sun were the most important elements of nature, they were incorporated into their mythology in a way which gave the people and the elements a common origin. Much of early Vietnamese religion involved nature and human relationships with their surroundings. The early Vietnamese people compared the soil, the water, and the sun to God in [[animism]]. In these elements there was energy which benefited the people and the greater power to help or to destroy. At times this power was compared to that of a child who may cause great destruction without even realizing it. In the earliest times people believed in ghosts and spirits which were thought to dwell in every tree, stone, mountain, cloud, stream, and animal. Rocks and mountains were thought to be able to multiply. These spirits were said to be the wandering souls of the dead, the ancestors of the people who had settled nearby. This type of religion is known as an ancestor cult. Because the ancestor spirits were the medium between living people and the greater forces of nature, they had to be honored in rituals and sacrifices in order to maintain harmony between the elements, the spirits, the ancestors, and the people. Later, as the Vietnamese people were converted to [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], and then [[Confucianism]] by the Chinese, most villagers maintained these original beliefs\u2014especially those involving [[ancestor cult]] and incorporated them into the new religions. This is an example of \"creative borrowing\" by a people while their own culture remains a strong underlying force.<ref>Thanh H.

In 208 BC, [[Zhao Tuo]], a former [[Qin dynasty]] general from China, allied with the leaders of the Yue in the area of modern-day [[Guangdong]] and declared himself king of the [[Nanyue]] \"Southern Yue\". He defeated An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng and combined \u00c2u L\u1ea1c with his territories in southern China.\n\n==Diaspora==\n{{Main|Overseas Vietnamese}}\n[[File:San Jose Tet parade, 2009.jpg|thumb|Vietnamese [[T\u1ebft|New Year]] parade, San Jose, California]]\nOriginally from northern Vietnam and southern China, the Vietnamese have conquered much of the land belonging to the former [[Champa]] Kingdom and [[Khmer Empire]] over the centuries. They are the dominant ethnic group in most provinces of Vietnam, and constitute a significant portion of the population of [[Cambodia]].\n\nBeginning around the sixteenth century, groups of Vietnamese migrated to Cambodia and China for commerce and political purposes. Descendants of Vietnamese migrants in China form the [[Gin people|Gin]] ethnic group in the country and primarily reside in and around [[Guangxi Province]].

There was also a significant representation of Vietnamese students in France during this period, primarily consisting of members of the elite class. A large number of Vietnamese also migrated to France as workers, especially during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], when France recruited soldiers and locals of its colonies to help with war efforts in Metropolitan France. The wave of migrants to France during World War I formed the first major presence of Vietnamese people in France and the Western world.<ref name=diaspora>[http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas La Diaspora Vietnamienne en France un cas particulier] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000103/http://eglasie.mepasie.org/divers-horizons/1995-10-16-la-diaspora-vietnamienne-en-france-un-cas |date=2013-12-03 }} (in French)</ref>\n\nWhen Vietnam gained its independence from France in 1954, a number of Vietnamese loyal to the colonial government also migrated to France.
