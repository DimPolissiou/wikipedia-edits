At that time Gale was running venues at The John Barleycorn Hotel in Collingwood, The Tiger Lounge (Royal Oak in Richmond) and The Prospect Hill Hotel in Kew.{{cn|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe first bands to play the venue were The Adventure and Big Music Works on Friday 28 February 1983 with [[Big Pig]] following on the Saturday night. At first live music was played only on Friday and Saturday nights. During the period that Wayne Gale was the owner, the cream of Australia's music industry played there and at one point he achieved 15 full houses in 16 days. This was an outstanding achievement considering the strength and fierce competition in the Melbourne music industry at the time. Bands such as [[Diesel_(musician)#Band:_Johnny_Diesel_&_the_Injectors_(1986\u20131991)|Johnny Diesel & The Injectors]], [[Spy_vs_Spy_(Australian_band)|Spy vs Spy]] and [[Baby Animals]] all used the venue to build their profile in Melbourne.

With a number of renovations and improvements to the building over the years, the venue boasts its iconic band room, front bar and impressive rooftop equipped with multiple bars, function spaces and modern kitchen.\n\nThe Corner has also played host to a number of significant moments in music history. The White Stripes created the iconic riff to ''Seven Nation Army'' during their soundcheck in 2003. In 2006 U2 filmed a video for their single ''Window in the Skies'' in the band room and rooftop garden of the hotel. Crowded House chose the venue for their final Melbourne show in 1996, though they later reformed. The Living End used footage from their 1997 Corner show for the film clip to ''Second Solution''.\n\nThe venue was one of the first in 2005 to make all shows smoke-free and has also been a leader in safer spaces <ref>Anderson, Stephanie (20 March 2018). \"Victorian live music venues stamping out sexual assault, harassment\" on abc.net.au, https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-20/victorian-live-music-venues-sexual-assault-harassment/9567326</ref> and environmental initiatives.\n\nThe Corner Hotel launched the Corner Award in 2016, an annual award celebrating local artists creating unique music.

Members of this genus have showy [[flower]]s and long cylindrical [[leaf|leaves]]. They are [[epiphytic]], occasionally [[lithophytic]] or terrestrial, that grow pending and are cespitously, or reptant and ascending, which exist is three isolated areas of [[South America]], in [[Ecuador]], [[Amazon Forest]] and [[Serra do Mar]] and [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] mountains, in [[Brazil]], both in shady and sunny places.\n\nThe genus ''Scuticaria'' has been traditionally placed close to ''[[Maxillaria]]'' but recent research shows they are more closely related to the genus ''[[Bifrenaria]]''. Despite their interesting appearance, they are hardly seen in nature and, because their culture is complicated, they are not common in private collections and orchid shows either.

Their stem is formed by an ordinarily short [[rhizome]], slightly elongated in some species; and by cylindrical almost inconspicuous [[pseudobulb]]s of the same diameter or slightly thicker than the unique leaf born on their apexes, because they generally are covered by small dried scaling steaths. The leaves may be erect or pending up to one meter long. The [[inflorescences]] grow from the said steaths and almost always bear just one [[flower]], exceptionally two in one species, and always is much longer than the pseudobulbs, bearing showy yellow, orange, purple or greenish flowers, with [[petal]]s and [[sepal]]s plain, stained or striped, usually by light brown but also by diverse combinations and shades of the other mentioned colors. Ordinarily the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]] presents contrasting colors, frequently with white areas.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/>\n\nThe flowers are large, wide open, and last during about two weeks.<ref name=\"Freitas\"/> They have sepals of similar sizes and form an almost invisible chin with the [[column (botany)|column]] foot. The petals may be similar to the sepals but smaller, or much smaller and with a much narrower base, occasionally showing different patterns or colors. The labellum articulates with the column, is trilobed, with comparatively small lateral lobes and larger terminal, which has variable shapes with diverse patterns and a callus under to column. The later is \u00e9 semi-cylindrical, slightly arching, erect and thick, without any kind of appendix, ending in an apical [[anther]] and elongated in a small foot at the base. The flowers bear to pairs of [[pollinia]] of different sizes. The [[caudicle]] is narrow and the [[retinacle]] is small. The fruits resemble the ones of ''Maxillaria''.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> There are no observation records of pollinators activities but ''Scuticaria'' are supposedly pollinated by [[Euglossini]] [[bee]]s.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Taxonomic notes==\n[[File:Scuticaria steelei (=Maxillaria steelii) - Curtis v. 64 (NS 11) (1837) pl. 3573.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria steelei]]''. Illustration of original description published by William Jackson Hooker in 1837.]]\n\nIn May 1837, the English Botanist [[William Jackson Hooker]] received a drawing and a dried sample of a plant, sent by an orchid grower from [[Liverpool]], together with a note explaining that the plant arrived from  [[Demerara]], in [[Guyana]], in July of the preceding year. Hooker described this species, classifying it under the genus ''[[Maxillaria]]'', calling it ''M. steelei'', in homage to its discoverer. In his description, Hooker affirms that the plant is highly interesting and an excellent addition to the known epiphytic species because it shows cylindrical leaves almost one meter long, different from anything ever found.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Hooker, William Jackson</span>: ''Scuticaria'' in ''' The Botanical magazine 64''': t. 3573. Ed. William Curtis, London, 1837. [http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753002721378 Published on Internet.]</ref> A few months later, [[John Lindley]] published again the species Hooker described, however, adding more information. Two years earlier, several plants had been sent from Demerara and Lindey reports that he had previously informally classified this species as ''Maxillaria flabellifera'' which, under this name, could be found in several orchid collection in [[England]]. Because he had not yet described this species, he accepts the priority of the name chosen by Hooker. Lindley adds, however, that he had some doubts about the classification, of a species so different from any other known so far, under the genus ''Maxillaria''.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lindley, John</span>: ''Scuticaria steelei'' in '''Edward's Botanical Register''' Vol.2, t.1986.

[http://www.botanicus.org/item/31753002748355 Published on Internet.]</ref>\n\nIn 1843, Lindley published a revision of a group of orchids classified as tribus Maxillaridae, then subordinated to Vandeae, a subfamily of Orchidaceae at the time. In this revision, he indicates that much work is needed till the limits between each genus within this tribus can be established and states his doubts regarding some of the new genera he was proposing, despite being very sure of other ones. Lindley suggested the division of Maxillaridae in twenty-five genera, being ''Scuticaria'' one of the genera he considered well established. When describing this new genus, Lindley based on morphologic characteristics of ''Maxillaria steelei'' Hook., selected as the [[Type species]] of ''Scuticaria'' with the name ''[[Scuticaria steelei]]''.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lindley, John</span>: ''Scuticaria'' in '''Edward's Botanical Register''' Vol. 29 (miscelanea), p. 14.

It is speculated that possibly because it was found in [[Brazil]] on the same area in the southeast where most of ''Bifrenaria'' were common, or because he believed that two species separated by so long distance belonged to the same genus. It was ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]''.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lindley, John</span>: ''Bifrenaria hadwenii'' in '''Paxton's Flower Garden'''.

[[Terete]] leaves are capable of much more water and nutrients and to face longer drought periods than species bearing thin leaves, on the other hand, almost all epiphytic species presenting the former type of leaves show more or less atrophied pseudobulbs since the leaves carry on its accumulating role. It is a supposition that ''Scuticaria'' species should have once inhabited much drier through their evolution. Because most of the species are found in shadier and more humid species now, this may one of the reasons why their culture uses to be complicated, possibly because the delicate balance they reached in nature is broken. For the same reason, it is supposed their frequency in nature is only occasional or rare.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Species==\n[[File:Scuticaria hadwenii 119.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'' is the most variable among ''Scuticaria'' species and widespread through a large area in Southeast of Brazil.]]\n\nBecause of its highly particular morphologic characteristics which allow immediate identification, its restricted species distribution, and its comparatively low variability, since the genus ''Scuticaria'' was established by Lindley, only ten species were formally described and there has never been much confusion concerning the distinguishing of any of the species. Out of these ten, nine are generally accepted, the tenth being normally accepted not as a species but as a variety.<ref name=\"Kew\"/> For identification purposes, the species can be split as follows:\n\nOnly two species present erect leaves and are the only ones frequently found as lithophytes, ''[[Scuticaria irwiniana]]'', easily known recognized because of its flowers without any stains on the internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white labellum, striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer [[rhizome]] than any other species.<ref name=\"SI\"/> ''[[Scuticaria strictifolia]]'' also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and slightly bent making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from ''S. hadwenii''.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later.<ref name=\"OB\"/>\n\n[[File:Scuticaria strictifolia 008.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria strictifolia]]'', which is very close to ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'' but has erect leaves; different colors and diverse callus structure on the labellum.]]\n\nAll species remaining are epiphytic with pendant habit. ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'', due to its several more or less isolated groups of populations along Serra do Mar, mostly on the west side of this chain of mountains, spreading throughout the interior highland in some states of Brazil, is the ''Scuticaria'' species that presents most variable colors.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> It can be separated from ''S. strictifolia'' because shows leaves always pending, flowers of more vivid colors and by the interior of the labellum, which ordinarily is more pubescent. There is a variety denominated ''dogsonii'', native from Guyana, which is more [[floriferous]].<ref name=\"Rchb\"/>\n\nThe two other species from Esp\u00edrito Santo State are highly different from each other. ''[[Scuticaria kautskyi]]'' usually has more or less uniform orange color on its sepals and petals, with their bases slightly lighter and dotted of greenish-yellow. Their labellum is white showing few colored drawings and narrow terminal lobe, slightly deflected.<ref name=\"SK\"/> The other species from this state, ''[[Scuticaria novaesii]]'' presents flowers with green-yellow segments, intensely spotted with dark brown and wide and flat labellum terminal lobe, with clearly marked by radial multicolored lines.<ref name=\"FB\"/>\n\n''[[Scuticaria itirapinensis]]'', the last species of Brazilian southeast, is the one that closely resembles Amazonian ''Scuticaria steelei'', although it can be easily separated because of its strong yellow flowers and much shorter leaves, besides slight differences on the proportions of floral structures.<ref name=\"SI\"/> A ''[[Scuticaria steelei]]'' presents entirely pale yellow flowers, completely covered by spaced small darker stains, However it is not even necessary to observe the flowers to identify it as their leaves are about one meter long, and there are references of plants measuring almost one and a half meter.<ref name=\"Freitas\"/>\n\nThe last two ''Scuticaria''are isolated in forests of Peru and Ecuador and are similar to each other. They are different from all other because of the proportions of floral segments. The labellum is much larger when compared to their sepals and petals than it is on other species. Moreover, their petals are striped of brown and much smaller than the sepals, showing a greater difference than it is found on the other species. From each other, they can be separated mostly by the shape of the labellum. ''[[Scuticaria salesiana]]'' presents more rounded intermediate lobe, and ''[[Scuticaria peruviana]]'' has it more rectangular, with the apex truncated, almost in a straight line.<ref name=\"Chris\"/>\n\nIn 2008, a new species of ''Scuticaria'', ''[[Scuticaria bahiensis|S. bahiensis]]'' has been described from Bahia state in Brazil but so far it remains mostly unknown.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">K.L.Davies & Stpiczynska.</span> (2008). ''Scuticaria bahiensis'' in Orchid Review 116: 344.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Scuticaria itirapinensis.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria itirapinensis]]'' This showy species has been found just a couple of times in nature and has not been found or seen anywhere during the last decades.]]\n\nIn his book ''Flora Brasilica'', the Brazilian Botanist Frederico Hoehne strongly recommended the culture of  ''Scuticaria'' species because of their beautiful flowers and interesting vegetation, however, soon later he admits that all species then cultivated by [[S\u00e3o Paulo Botanic Garden]] had died after two or three years. Indeed, he claims that to successfully grow them a special environment needs to be created.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> These plants are not easy to maintain under culture. Only recently, with the help of modern technology, timers and foggers that keep the humidity constant, the growers have been finally capable of keeping them out of their natural environment for several years.\n\nThere are four different sorts of culture according to the origin of each species. ''S. steelei'' and ''S. hadwenii'' var. ''dogsonii'' are the species that need higher temperature and humidity.  The two rupicolous species, ''S. irwiniana'' and ''S. strictifolia'' are the ones which need more light and constant ventilation besides drier culture conditions.<ref name=\"SI\"/> ''S. peruviana'' and ''S. salesiana'' take slightly cooler [[temperature]]s than the other species although still need humidity mostly during the early morning hours.<ref name=\"Chris\"/> The other species need less light than the mentioned ones. All species should be preferably mounted on plaques of vegetable fibers because of their pending habit, the rupicolous species may alternatively potted in well-drained pots. ''Scuticaria'' are delicate plants that like to remain untouched during several years because their roots easily resent on replants.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citizendium|title=Scuticaria}}\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons-inline|Scuticaria (Orchidaceae)|''Scuticaria''}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Scuticaria (Orchidaceae)|''Scuticaria''}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3308362}}\n\n[[Category:Scuticaria (plant)|*]]\n[[Category:Maxillarieae genera]]\n[[Category:Epiphytic orchids]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Scuticaria'' (plant)}}\n{{Taxobox\n| name = ''Scuticaria''\n| image = Scuticaria steelei - 2.jpg\n| image_caption = ''Scuticaria steelei''\n| regnum = [[Plantae]]\n| unranked_divisio = [[Angiosperms]]\n| unranked_classis = [[Monocots]]\n| ordo = [[Asparagales]]\n| familia = [[Orchidaceae]]\n| subfamilia = [[Epidendroideae]]\n| tribus = [[Maxillarieae]]\n| subtribus = [[Maxillariinae]]\n| genus = '''''Scuticaria'''''\n| genus_authority = [[Lindl.]]\n| type_species = ''Maxillaria steelei''\n| type_species_authority = [[Hook.]]\n| subdivision_ranks = Species\n| subdivision =\n* ''[[Scuticaria bahiensis]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria bueraremensis]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria guainiana]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria irwiniana]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria itirapinensis]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria kautskyi]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria novaesii]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria peruviana]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria salesiana]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria steelei]]''\n* ''[[Scuticaria strictifolia]]''\n| synonyms = none\n}}\n'''''Scuticaria''''' is a genus of [[orchid]]s comprising 9 species native to [[Belize]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[French Guiana]],  [[Guyana]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]] and [[Venezuela]]. Members of this genus have showy [[flower]]s and long cylindrical [[leaf|leaves]]. They are [[epiphytic]], occasionally [[lithophytic]] or terrestrial, that grow pending and are cespitously, or reptant and ascending, which exist is three isolated areas of [[South America]], in [[Ecuador]], [[Amazon Forest]] and [[Serra do Mar]] and [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] mountains, in [[Brazil]], both in shady and sunny places.\n\nThe genus ''Scuticaria'' has been traditionally placed close to ''[[Maxillaria]]'' but recent research shows they are more closely related to the genus ''[[Bifrenaria]]''. Despite their interesting appearance, they are hardly seen in nature and, because their culture is complicated, they are not common in private collections and orchid shows either. No other use for these species is reported besides ornamentation. Because it is a well established genus, formed by few species that are reasonably easy to separate, there were few publications about them during the last decades.\n\n== Distribution and habit ==\nDespite there are few species, ''Scuticaria'' inhabit varied climates, disperse in a very uneven way though all countries of South America northern to [[Bolivia]], this excluded, and also in areas of [[Mata Atl\u00e2ntica]] in Brazilian Southeast. No species is common in nature, being just occasionally or even rarely found.\n\nThe species with wider range is ''Scuticaria steelei'' which inhabits open clearings at higher elevations of central [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]], jungles known as ''matas de terra firme'', up to eight hundred meters of altitude.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Miranda, Francisco</span>: '''Orqu\u00eddeas da Amaz\u00f4nia Brasileira''', pp. 43.

Their stem is formed by an ordinarily short [[rhizome]], slightly elongated in some species; and by cylindrical almost inconspicuous [[pseudobulb]]s of the same diameter or slightly thicker than the unique leaf born on their apexes, because they generally are covered by small dried scaling steaths. The leaves may be erect or pending up to one meter long. The [[inflorescences]] grow from the said steaths and almost always bear just one [[flower]], exceptionally two in one species, and always is much longer than the pseudobulbs, bearing showy yellow, orange, purple or greenish flowers, with [[petal]]s and [[sepal]]s plain, stained or striped, usually by light brown but also by diverse combinations and shades of the other mentioned colors. Ordinarily the [[Labellum (botany)|labellum]] presents contrasting colors, frequently with white areas.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/>\n\nThe flowers are large, wide open, and last during about two weeks.<ref name=\"Freitas\"/> They have sepals of similar sizes and form an almost invisible chin with the [[column (botany)|column]] foot. The petals may be similar to the sepals but smaller, or much smaller and with a much narrower base, occasionally showing different patterns or colors. The labellum articulates with the column, is trilobed, with comparatively small lateral lobes and larger terminal, which has variable shapes with diverse patterns and a callus under to column. The later is \u00e9 semi-cylindrical, slightly arching, erect and thick, without any kind of appendix, ending in an apical [[anther]] and elongated in a small foot at the base. The flowers bear to pairs of [[pollinia]] of different sizes. The [[caudicle]] is narrow and the [[retinacle]] is small. The fruits resemble the ones of ''Maxillaria''.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> There are no observation records of pollinators activities but ''Scuticaria'' are supposedly pollinated by [[Euglossini]] [[bee]]s.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Taxonomic notes==\n[[File:Scuticaria steelei (=Maxillaria steelii) - Curtis v. 64 (NS 11) (1837) pl. 3573.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria steelei]]''.

Hooker described this species, classifying it under the genus ''[[Maxillaria]]'', calling it ''M. steelei'', in homage to its discover. In his description, Hooker affirms that the plant is highly interesting and an excellent addition to the known epiphytic species because it shows cylindrical leaves almost one meter long, different from anything ever found.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Hooker, William Jackson</span>: ''Scuticaria'' in ''' The Botanical magazine 64''': t. 3573.

Two years earlier, several plants had been sent from Demerara and Lindey reports that he had previously informally classified this species as ''Maxillaria flabellifera'' which, under this name, could be found in several orchid collection in [[England]]. Because he had not yet described this species, he accepts the priority of the name chosen by Hooker. Lindley adds, however, that he had some doubts about the classification, of a species so different from any other known so far, under the genus ''Maxillaria''.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lindley, John</span>: ''Scuticaria steelei'' in '''Edward's Botanical Register''' Vol.2, t.1986.

In this revision, he indicates that much work is needed till the limits between each genus within this tribus can be established and states his doubts regarding some of the new genera he was proposing, despite being very sure of other ones. Lindley suggested the division of Maxillaridae in twenty five genera, being ''Scuticaria'' one of the genera he considered well established. When describing this new genus, Lindley based on morphologic characteristics of ''Maxillaria steelei'' Hook., selected as the [[Type species]] of ''Scuticaria'' with the name ''[[Scuticaria steelei]]''.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Lindley, John</span>: ''Scuticaria'' in '''Edward's Botanical Register''' Vol.29 (miscelanea), pp.14.

It is speculated that possibly because it was found in [[Brazil]] on the same area in the southeast where most of ''Bifrenaria'' were common, or because he believed that two species separated by so long distance belonged to the same genus.

[[Terete]] leaves are capable of much more water and nutrients and to face longer drought periods than species bearing thin leaves, on the other hand, almost all epiphytic species presenting the former type of leaves show more or less atrophied pseudobulbs since the leaves carry on its accumulating role. It is a supposition that ''Scuticaria'' species should have once inhabited much drier through their evolution. Because most of the species are found in shadier and more humid species now, this may one of the reasons why their culture uses to be complicated, possibly because the delicate balance they reached in nature is broken. For the same reason it is supposed their frequency in nature is only occasion or rare.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n==Species==\n[[File:Scuticaria hadwenii 119.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'', the most variable among ''Scuticaria'' species and widespread through a large area in Southeast of Brazil.]]\n\nBecause of its highly particular morphologic characteristics which allow immediate identification, its restricted species distribution, and its comparatively low variability, since the genus ''Scuticaria'' was established by Lindley, only ten species were formally described and there has never been much confusion concerning the distinguishing of any of the species. Out of these ten, nine are generally accepted, the tenth being normally accepted not as a species but as a variety.<ref name=\"Kew\"/> For identification purposes, the species can be split as follows:\n\nOnly two species present erect leaves and are the only ones frequently found as lithophytes, ''[[Scuticaria irwiniana]]'', easily known recognized because of its flowers without any stains on the internally entirely purple and externally whitish sepals and petals, with white labellum, striped of purple. This species generally can be identified even without flowers because of its reptant, slightly ascendant growth, and longer [[rhizome]] than any other species.<ref name=\"SI\"/> ''[[Scuticaria strictifolia]]'' also has erect leaves but occasionally, when cultivated under insufficient light, their leaves can be narrower and slightly bent making the distracted observer find hard to differentiate it from ''S. hadwenii''.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> The Brazilian taxonomist Guido Pabst considered this species a variety of the later.<ref name=\"OB\"/>\n\n[[File:Scuticaria strictifolia 008.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria strictifolia]]'', which is very close to ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'' but has erect leaves; different colors and diverse callus structure on the labellum.]]\n\nAll species remaining are epiphytic with pendent habit. ''[[Scuticaria hadwenii]]'', due to its several more or less isolated groups of populations along Serra do Mar, mostly on the west side of this chain of mountains, spreading throughout the interior highland in some states of Brazil, is the ''Scuticaria'' species that presents most variable colors.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> It can be separated from ''S. strictifolia'' because shows leaves always pending, flowers of more vivid colors and by the interior of the labellum, which ordinarily is more pubescent. There is a variety denominated ''dogsonii'', native from Guyana, which is more [[floriferous]].<ref name=\"Rchb\"/>\n\nThe two other species from Esp\u00edrito Santo State are highly different from each other. ''[[Scuticaria kautskyi]]'' usually has more or less uniform orange color on its sepals and petals, with their bases slightly lighter and dotted of greenish yellow. Their labellum is white showing few colored drawings and narrow terminal lobe, slightly deflected.<ref name=\"SK\"/> The other species from this state, ''[[Scuticaria novaesii]]'' presents flowers with green-yellow segments, intensely spotted with dark brown and wide and flat labellum terminal lobe, with clearly marked by radial multicolored lines.<ref name=\"FB\"/>\n\n''[[Scuticaria itirapinensis]]'', the last species of Brazilian southeast, is the one that closely resembles Amazonian ''Scuticaria steelei'', although it can be easily separated because of its strong yellow flowers and much shorter leaves, besides slight differences on the proportions of floral structures.<ref name=\"SI\"/> A ''[[Scuticaria steelei]]'' presents entirely pale yellow flowers, completely covered by spaced small darker stains, However it is not even necessary to observe the flowers to identify it as their leaves are about one meter long, and there are references of plants measuring almost one and a half meter.<ref name=\"Freitas\"/>\n\nThe last two ''Scuticaria''are isolated in forests of Peru and Ecuador and are similar to each other. They are different from all other because of the proportions of floral segments. The labellum is much larger when compared to their sepals and petals than it is on other species. Moreover, their petals are striped of brown and much smaller than the sepals, showing a greater difference than it is found on the other species. From each other, they can be separated mostly by the shape of the labellum. ''[[Scuticaria salesiana]]'' presents more rounded intermediate lobe, and ''[[Scuticaria peruviana]]'' has it more rectangular, with the apex truncated, almost in a straight line.<ref name=\"Chris\"/>\n\nIn 2008, a new species of ''Scuticaria'', ''[[Scuticaria bahiensis|S. bahiensis]]'' has been described from Bahia state in Brazil but so far it remains mostly unknown.<ref><span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">K.L.Davies & Stpiczynska.</span> (2008). ''Scuticaria bahiensis'' in Orchid Review 116: 344.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Scuticaria itirapinensis.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Scuticaria itirapinensis]]'' This showy species has been found just a couple of times in nature and has not been found or seen anywhere during the last decades.]]\n\nIn his book ''Flora Brasilica'', the Brazilian Botanist Frederico Hoehne strongly recommended the culture of  ''Scuticaria'' species because of their beautiful flowers and interesting vegetation, however, soon later he admits that all species then cultivated by [[S\u00e3o Paulo Botanic Garden]] had died after two or three years. Indeed, he claims that to successfully grow them a special environment needs to be created.<ref name=\"Hoehne\"/> These plants are not easy to maintain under culture. Only recently, with the help of modern technology, timers and foggers that keep the humidity constant, the growers have been finally capable of keeping them out of their natural environment for several years.\n\nThere are four different sorts of culture according to the origin of each species. ''S. steelei'' and ''S. hadwenii'' var. ''dogsonii'' are the species that need higher temperature and humidity.  The two rupicolous species, ''S. irwiniana'' and ''S. strictifolia'' are the ones which need more light and constant ventilation besides drier culture conditions.<ref name=\"SI\"/> ''S. peruviana'' and ''S. salesiana'' take slightly cooler [[temperature]]s than the other species although still need humidity mostly during the early morning hours.<ref name=\"Chris\"/> The other species need less light than the mentioned ones. All species should be preferably mounted on plaques of vegetable fibers because of their pending habit, the rupicolous species may alternatively potted in well-drained pots. ''Scuticaria'' are delicate plants that like to remain untouched during several years because their roots easily resent on replants.<ref name=\"DM\"/>\n\n== References ==\n*{{Citizendium|title=Scuticaria}}\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Commons-inline|Scuticaria (Orchidaceae)|''Scuticaria''}}\n* {{Wikispecies-inline|Scuticaria (Orchidaceae)|''Scuticaria''}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3308362}}\n\n[[Category:Scuticaria (plant)|*]]\n[[Category:Maxillarieae genera]]\n[[Category:Epiphytic orchids]]\n", "name_user": "LilHelpa", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo: though\u2192through; copy edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuticaria_(plant)"}
