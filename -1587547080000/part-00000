Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s.

Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | website = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crop diversity ===\n\nOrganic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]].

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]] and [[earhworms]] allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. [[Horticulture|Horticultural]] farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often rely even more on external inputs.<ref name=SoilFertility/>\n\nBiological research into soil and soil organisms has proven beneficial to organic farming.

While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}\n\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.\n\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256\u2013258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}</ref> Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]] write that many agricultural applications of [[biotechnology]] are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2018 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Adamchak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=978-0199342082 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]).

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\n\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants.

These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.<ref name=\"E&S\">[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S. \"Organic Agriculture, Poverty Reduction, Climate Change, and the Millennium Development Goals\".

The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">World Bank. 2008.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

Organic farming methods are studied in the field of [[agroecology]]. While conventional agriculture uses synthetic pesticides and water-soluble synthetically purified fertilizers, organic farmers are restricted by regulations to using natural pesticides and fertilizers. An example of a natural pesticide is [[pyrethrin]], which is found naturally in the [[Chrysanthemum]] flower. The principal methods of organic farming include [[crop rotation]], [[green manure]]s and [[compost]], [[biological pest control]], and mechanical [[Tillage|cultivation]]. These measures use the natural environment to enhance agricultural productivity: [[legumes]] are planted to fix [[nitrogen]] into the soil, [[predation|natural insect predators]] are encouraged, crops are rotated to confuse pests and renew soil, and natural materials such as [[potassium bicarbonate]]<ref>FiBL (2006) [http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf Use of potassium bicarbonate as a fungicide in organic farming] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111033236/http://www.betriebsmittelliste.ch/fileadmin/documents/de/hifu/stellungnahmen/potassium_bicarbonate_organic.pdf |date=11 January 2014 }}</ref> and [[mulch]]es are used to control disease and [[weed]]s.

Many of the methods developed for organic agriculture have been borrowed by more conventional agriculture. For example, [[Integrated Pest Management]] is a multifaceted strategy that uses various organic methods of pest control whenever possible, but in conventional farming could include synthetic [[pesticides]] only as a last resort.<ref name=\"EPA\">{{cite web | title =Integrated Pest Management | website = | publisher =U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | url =http://www.epa.gov/oecaagct/tipm.html | doi = | accessdate =1 January 2013 }}</ref>\n\n=== Crop diversity ===\n\nOrganic farming encourages [[Crop diversity]].

This biological process, driven by [[microorganism]]s such as [[mycorrhiza]] and [[earhworms]] allows the natural production of nutrients in the soil throughout the growing season, and has been referred to as ''feeding the soil to feed the plant.'' Organic farming uses a variety of methods to improve soil fertility, including crop rotation, cover cropping, reduced tillage, and application of compost. By reducing tillage, soil is not inverted and exposed to air; less carbon is lost to the atmosphere resulting in more soil organic carbon{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. This has an added benefit of carbon sequestration, which can reduce green house gases and help reverse climate change .\n\n[[Plant nutrition|Plants need]] a large number of nutrients in various quantities to flourish. Supplying enough [[nitrogen]] and particularly synchronization so that plants get enough nitrogen at the when plants need it most, is a challenge for organic farmers.<ref name=SoilFertility>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Watson CA, Atkinson D, Gosling P, Jackson LR, Rayns FW | title = Managing soil fertility in organic farming systems | year = 2002 | journal = Soil Use and Management | pages = 239\u2013247| volume = 18 | doi = 10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00265.x | url = http://orgprints.org/8060/2/Watson_orgprints_8060.pdf }} [http://orgprints.org/8060/ Preprint with free full-text].</ref> [[Crop rotation]] and [[green manure]] (\"[[cover crop]]s\") help to provide nitrogen through [[legume]]s (more precisely, the family [[Fabaceae]]), which fix nitrogen from the atmosphere through symbiosis with [[rhizobia]]l [[bacteria]]. [[Intercropping]], which is sometimes used for insect and disease control, can also increase soil nutrients, but the competition between the legume and the crop can be problematic and wider spacing between crop rows is required. [[Crop residue]]s can be [[plough]]ed back into the soil, and different plants leave different amounts of nitrogen, potentially aiding synchronization.<ref name=SoilFertility/> Organic farmers also use animal [[manure]], certain processed fertilizers such as seed meal and various [[mineral]] powders such as [[rock phosphate]] and [[Greensand (geology)|green sand]], a naturally occurring form of [[potash]] that provides potassium. Together these methods help to control [[erosion]]. In some cases [[pH]] may need to be amended. Natural pH amendments include [[Agricultural lime|lime]] and [[sulfur]], but in the U.S. some compounds such as [[Iron(II) sulfate|iron sulfate]], [[aluminum sulfate]], [[magnesium sulfate]], and soluble [[boron]] products are allowed in organic farming.<ref name=Gillman2008/>{{Rp|43}}\n\nMixed farms with both [[livestock]] and [[Tillage|crops]] can operate as [[ley farming|ley farms]], whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing [[forage]] grasses such as [[white clover]] or [[alfalfa]] and grows [[cash crop]]s or [[cereal]]s when fertility is established. Farms without livestock (\"stockless\") may find it more difficult to maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported [[manure]] as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested.

While today, small growing operations often do not include livestock, domesticated animals are a desirable part of the organic farming equation, especially for true sustainability, the ability of a farm to function as a self-renewing unit.\n\n=== Genetic modification ===\n{{Main|Genetically modified crops|Genetically modified food|Genetically modified food controversies}}\n\nA key characteristic of organic farming is the rejection of genetically engineered plants and animals. On 19 October 1998, participants at IFOAM's 12th Scientific Conference issued the [[International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements#IFOAM and GMOs|Mar del Plata Declaration]], where more than 600 delegates from over 60 countries voted unanimously to exclude the use of genetically modified organisms in food production and agriculture.\n\nAlthough opposition to the use of any transgenic technologies in organic farming is strong, agricultural researchers Luis Herrera-Estrella and Ariel Alvarez-Morales continue to advocate integration of [[transgenic]] technologies into organic farming as the optimal means to sustainable agriculture, particularly in the developing world.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume=2 |date=April 2001 |author1=Luis Herrera-Estrella |author2=Ariel Alvarez-Morales |title=Genetically modified crops: hope for developing countries? |pages=256\u2013258| doi= 10.1093/embo-reports/kve075 |journal=EMBO Reports |pmid=11306538 |issue=4 |pmc=1083872}}</ref> Organic farmer Raoul Adamchak and geneticist [[Pamela Ronald]] write that many agricultural applications of [[biotechnology]] are consistent with organic principles and have significantly advanced sustainable agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book|publisher=Oxford University Press |date=April 2018 |author1=Pamela Ronald |author2=Raoul Adamchak |title=Tomorrow's Table: Organic Farming, Genetics and the Future of Food|isbn=978-0199342082 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough GMOs are excluded from organic farming, there is concern that the pollen from genetically modified crops is increasingly penetrating organic and [[Heirloom plant|heirloom seed stocks]], making it difficult, if not impossible, to keep these genomes from entering the organic food supply. Differing regulations among countries limits the availability of GMOs to certain countries, as described in the article on [[regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]].\n\n=== Tools ===\n\nOrganic farmers use a number of traditional [[farm tools]] to do farming. Due to the goals of [[sustainability]] in organic farming, organic farmers try to minimize their reliance on [[fossil fuels]]. In the developing world on small organic farms tools are normally constrained to hand tools and [[diesel fuel|diesel]] powered water pumps.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Organic certification}}\nStandards regulate production methods and in some cases final output for organic agriculture. Standards may be voluntary or legislated. As early as the 1970s private associations certified organic producers. In the 1980s, governments began to produce organic production guidelines. In the 1990s, a trend toward legislated standards began, most notably with the 1991 [[EU-Eco-regulation]] developed for [[European Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/other/l21118_en.htm|title=EUR-Lex - l21118 - EN - EUR-Lex|publisher=}}</ref> which set standards for 12 countries, and a 1993 UK program. The EU's program was followed by a Japanese program in 2001, and in 2002 the U.S. created the [[National Organic Program]] (NOP).<ref>USDA [http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop/NOP/standards.html NOP Program Standards]. Retrieved 2 April 2008.</ref> As of 2007 over 60 countries regulate organic farming ([[#refWorldStats2007|IFOAM 2007:11]]). In 2005 IFOAM created the [[Principles of Organic Agriculture]], an international guideline for certification criteria.<ref>IFOAM. (2005).

Although the scope of economics is broad, agricultural economics tends to focus on maximizing yields and efficiency at the farm level. Economics takes an [[anthropocentric]] approach to the value of the natural world: biodiversity, for example, is considered beneficial only to the extent that it is valued by people and increases profits. Some entities such as the [[European Union]] [[subsidy|subsidize]] organic farming, in large part because these countries want to account for the [[externalities]] of reduced water use, reduced water contamination, reduced [[soil erosion]], reduced carbon emissions, increased biodiversity, and assorted other benefits that result from organic farming.<ref name=Misconcept/>\n\nTraditional organic farming is labor and knowledge-intensive whereas conventional farming is capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.<ref name=Halberg>{{cite book|last=Halberg|first=Niels|title=Global development of organic agriculture: challenges and prospects|year=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=978-1-84593-078-3|page=297|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ij-6DO4kk8gC|page=298}}}}</ref>\n\nOrganic farmers in California have cited marketing as their greatest obstacle.<ref>Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.

First, organic farmers do not rely on synthetic fertilizer and pesticide inputs, which can be costly. In addition, organic foods currently enjoy a price premium over conventionally produced foods, meaning that organic farmers can often get more for their yield.\n\nThe price premium for organic food is an important factor in the economic viability of organic farming. In 2013 there was a 100% price premium on organic vegetables and a 57% price premium for organic fruits. These percentages are based on wholesale fruit and vegetable prices, available through the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/organic-prices.aspx|title=USDA Economic Research Service - Organic Prices|last=Greene|first=Catherine|website=www.ers.usda.gov|access-date=25 March 2016}}</ref> Price premiums exist not only for organic versus nonorganic crops, but may also vary depending on the venue where the product is sold: farmers' markets, grocery stores, or wholesale to restaurants.

These benefits are expected to continue in the post-MDG era. A series of case studies conducted in selected areas in Asian countries by the Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI) and published as a book compilation by ADB in Manila document these contributions to both income and non-income aspects of the MDGs. These include poverty alleviation by way of higher incomes, improved farmers' health owing to less chemical exposure, integration of sustainable principles into rural development policies, improvement of access to safe water and sanitation, and expansion of global partnership for development as small farmers are integrated in value chains.<ref name=\"E&S\">[http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/161042/organic-agriculture-and-post-2015-development-goals.]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Setboonsarng, S. \"Organic Agriculture, Poverty Reduction, Climate Change, and the Millennium Development Goals\".

The results show considerable variation across the case studies, suggesting that there is no clear structure to the costs of adopting OA. Costs depend on the efficiency of the OA adoption programs. The lowest cost programs were more than ten times less expensive than the highest cost ones. However, further analysis of the gains resulting from OA adoption reveals that the costs per person taken out of poverty was much lower than the estimates of the World Bank,<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">World Bank. 2008.

Three broad management practices (prohibition/reduced use of chemical pesticides and inorganic fertilizers; sympathetic management of non-cropped habitats; and preservation of mixed farming) that are largely intrinsic (but not exclusive) to organic farming are particularly beneficial for farmland wildlife.<ref name=\":1\" /> Using practices that attract or introduce beneficial insects, provide habitat for birds and mammals, and provide conditions that increase soil biotic diversity serve to supply vital ecological services to organic production systems. Advantages to certified organic operations that implement these types of production practices include: 1) decreased dependence on outside fertility inputs; 2) reduced pest management costs; 3) more reliable sources of clean water; and 4) better pollination.<ref name=\"Agricultural Marketing Service 2016\">\"USDSA Guidance Natural Resources and Biodiversity Conservation\"(PDF).

The USDA certification requirements outline growing practices and ecological standards but do nothing to codify labor practices.

However, throughout its existence, the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles, such as [[Polish Jews]].\n\nPoles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor, among them [[Copernicus]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Fryderyk Chopin]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. Notable Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 many of them forced from their homeland by historic vicissitudes \u2013 have included physicist [[Joseph Rotblat]], mathematician [[Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]], pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], actresses [[Helena Modjeska]] and [[Pola Negri]], military leaders [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] and [[Casimir Pulaski]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], politician [[Rosa Luxemburg]], painter [[Tamara de Lempicka]], filmmakers [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and the [[Warner Brothers]], cartoonist [[Max Fleischer]], and cosmeticians [[Helena Rubinstein]] and [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Gesta Hamburgensis trans oddara st polanos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Fragment of ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (1073) by [[Adam of Bremen]], containing the name \"[[Polans (western)|Polans]]\":  \"''trans [[Oder|Oddaram]] sunt Polanos''\"]]\n[[Slavs]] have been in the territory of modern Poland for over 1500 years. They organized into [[Tribe|tribal units]], of which the larger ones were later known as the [[Polish tribes]]; the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous [[Bavarian Geographer]] in the 9th century.<ref name=\"playground I xxvii\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005a|p=xxvii}}.</ref> In the 9th and 10th centuries the tribes gave rise to developed regions along the upper [[Vistula]] (the [[Vistulans]] within the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire sphere),<ref name=\"playground I xxvii\"/> the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and in [[Greater Poland]].

After 1945 the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing in Poland and a considerable degree of popular support. According to this view, the [[Lusatian Culture]] which archaeologists have identified between the [[Oder]] and the [[Vistula]] in the early [[Iron Age]], is said to be Slavonic; all non-Slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times are dismissed as \"migrants\" and \"visitors\". In contrast, the critics of this theory, such as [[Marija Gimbutas]], regard it as an unproved hypothesis and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the Slavs is largely uncharted; the Slavonic connections of the Lusatian Culture are entirely imaginary; and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the [[North European Plain|Middle European Plain]] is taken for granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052255/http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\nPolish people are the sixth largest national group in the [[European Union]].<ref>NationMaster.com 2003\u20132008.

France has a historic relationship with Poland and has a relatively large Polish-descendant population. Poles have lived in France since the 18th century.

Owing to this central location, the Poles came very early into contact with both civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 eastern and western, and as a result developed economically, culturally, and politically. A German general [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmut Carl von Moltke]], in his ''Poland. A historical sketch'' (1885), stated that \"Poland of the fifteenth century was one of the most civilised states of Europe.\"\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity, experiencing severe crises, especially during World War II and in the following years. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.<ref name=\"MFA\" />\n\nPoland was for centuries a refuge to many [[Jews]] from all over Europe; in the twentieth century, a large number emigrated to [[Israel]]. Several prominent Israeli statesmen were born in Poland, including Israel's founder [[David Ben-Gurion]], former [[President of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Ministers]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Menachem Begin]].\n\n=== Language ===\n[[File:Book of Henryk\u00f3w.PNG|thumb|''[[Book of Henryk\u00f3w]]''.  Highlighted in red is the earliest known sentence written in the [[Old Polish language]]]]\n[[File:Polish Language in Europe.svg|thumb|Knowledge of the Polish language within Europe]]\n{{main|Polish language}}\nThe [[Polish language]] ({{lang-pl|j\u0119zyk polski}}) is a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]] of the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] group and the official language of Poland. Its written form uses the [[Polish alphabet]], which is the [[Latin alphabet]] with the addition of a few [[diacritic marks]].\n\nPoland is the most linguistically homogeneous European country; nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare [[Polish language|Polish]] as their mother tongue. Ethnic Poles constitute large minorities in Germany, northern [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], northeast [[Lithuania]] and western [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania's [[Vilnius]] County (26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results) and is found elsewhere in northeastern and western Lithuania. In Ukraine it is most common in the western [[Lviv]] and Volyn oblast (provinces), while in western Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Grodno]] regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border.\n\nThe geographical distribution of the [[Polish language]] was greatly affected by the border changes and population transfers that followed [[World War II]]. Poles resettled in the \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" in the west and north. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the [[USSR]], resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking minorities in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]], although many Poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within Poland's new borders. Meanwhile, the flight and expulsion of Germans, as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and resettlement of Ukrainians within Poland, contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity.\n\nPolish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner throughout most of Poland, though numerous languages and dialects coexist alongside the standard Polish language. The most common dialects in Poland are [[Silesian language|Silesian]], spoken in Upper Silesia, and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], widely spoken in the north.\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nEducation has been of prime interest to Poland since the early 12th century. The catalog of the library of the Cathedral Chapter in [[Krak\u00f3w]] dating from 1110 shows that Polish scholars already then had access to literature from all over Europe. In 1364 King [[Casimir III the Great]] founded the [[Krak\u00f3w Academy]], which would become Jagiellonian University, one of the great universities of Europe. The Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://uatacz.up.krakow.pl/~wwwchemia/pliki/ISBN_978_83_7271_768_9_From_alchemy_to_the_present_day|title=From alchemy to the present day \u2013 the choice of biographies of Polish scientists|last=Nodzy\u0144ska|first=Ma\u0142gorzata|last2=Cie\u015bla|first2=Pawe\u0142|publisher=Pedagogical University of Krak\u00f3w|year=2012|isbn=978-83-7271-768-9|location=Cracow|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe list of early famous scientists in Poland begins with the 13th-century [[Vitello]] and includes the [[polymath]] and astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who formulated a [[Mathematical model|model]] of [[Celestial spheres#Renaissance|the universe]] that placed [[Heliocentrism|the Sun]] rather than the Earth at its center; the publication of Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) just before his death in 1543 is considered a major event in the history of science, triggering the [[Copernican Revolution]] and making an important contribution to the [[Scientific Revolution]]. In 1773 King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] established the [[Commission of National Education]], the world's first ministry of education.\n\nAfter the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]], no free Polish state existed. The 19th and 20th centuries saw many Polish scientists working abroad. The greatest was [[Maria Sk\u0142odowska Curie]] (1867\u20131934), a [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who conducted pioneering research on [[radioactivity]] and was the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first woman to win a Nobel Prize]], the first person and only woman to [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|win twice]], the only person to win twice in multiple sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of [[Nobel Prize#Family laureates|five Nobel Prizes]].  Another notable Polish expatriate scientist was [[Ignacy Domeyko]] (1802\u201389), a geologist and mineralogist who lived and worked in South America, in [[Chile]].\n\n[[Kazimierz Funk]] (1884\u20131967), whose name is commonly [[English language|anglicized]] as \"Casimir Funk\", was a Polish [[Biochemistry|biochemist]], generally credited with being among the first to formulate (in 1912) the concept of [[vitamin]]s, which he called \"vital amines\" or \"vitamines\".\n\nAccording to [[NASA]], Polish scientists were among the pioneers of [[rocket]]ry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/A_Pictorial_History_of_Rockets.html|title=A Pictorial History of Rockets|last=|first=|publisher=NASA|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a world center of mathematics.

[[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|title=The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas|work=semper.pl|page=244|accessdate=13 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7rxPZrB?url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n====17th\u201318th centuries====\n{{Listen|filename=Polonezz.ogg|title=''Po\u017cegnanie Ojczyzny'' (Farewell to Country)|plain=Polonaise by Ogi\u0144ski (1794)|description=Polonaise by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski|Ogi\u0144ski]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nIn the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and his son [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]. These included [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Giovanni Francesco Anerio]], and [[Marco Scacchi]]. Polish composers from this period focused on [[baroque]] religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and [[basso continuo]], a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The best-remembered composer of this period is [[Adam Jarz\u0119bski]], known for his instrumental works such as ''Chromatica'', ''Tamburetta'', ''Sentinella'', ''Bentrovata'', and ''Nova Casa''.  Other composers include [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]], [[Franciszek Lilius]], [[Bart\u0142omiej P\u0119kiel]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Sylwester Szarzy\u0144ski]] and [[Marcin Mielczewski]].\n\nIn addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of ''Galatea'' (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy.  Shortly after this performance, the court produced [[Francesca Caccini]]'s opera ''[[La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d\u2019Alcina]]'', which she had written for Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] three years earlier when he was in Italy.  Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When W\u0142adys\u0142aw became king (as W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known:  they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Marco_Scacchi|title=Marco Scacchi|website=Cpdl.org|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W\u0142adys\u0142aw.\n\nThe late 17th century and the 18th century saw Poland in sociopolitical decline, which hindered the development of music. Some composers (such as Jan Stefani and [[Maciej Kamie\u0144ski]]) attempted to create a Polish opera; others imitated foreign composers such as [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\nThe most important development in this time, however, was the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], perhaps the first distinctively Polish [[art music]]. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]], [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]], [[Juliusz Zar\u0119bski]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz]], [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]], and, most famously, [[Fryderyk Chopin]]. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including [[mazurka]]s, [[nocturne]]s, [[waltz]]es and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces.  The same period saw [[Stanislaw Moniuszko|Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]], the leading individual in the successful development of [[Polish opera]], still renowned for operas like ''[[Halka]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Manor]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Micha\u0142 Kleafas Aginski. \u041c\u0456\u0445\u0430\u043b \u041a\u043b\u0435\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0441 \u0410\u0433\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0456 (F.-X.

In 1475 Kasper Elyan of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w|Glogau (G\u0142og\u00f3w)]] set up a printing shop in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw)]], [[Silesia]]. Twenty years later, the first [[Cyrillic]] printing house was founded at Krak\u00f3w by [[Schweipolt Fiol]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include ''Saint Florian's Breviary,'' printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; ''Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia'' (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]]'s ''Chronicle'' from the 15th century and his ''Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium''.<ref name=\"Mi\u0142osz-1\" />\n\n==== Renaissance ====\n[[File:Jan Kochanowski.png|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[Jan Kochanowski]]]]\nWith the advent of the [[Renaissance]], the Polish language was finally accepted in Poland on an equal footing with [[Latin]]. Polish art and culture flourished under the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing new literary trends with them. These writers included [[Kallimach]] ([[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]) and [[Conrad Celtis]]. [[Miko\u0142aj Rej]] and [[Jan Kochanowski]] laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the [[Polish language]] appeared in this period:  a [[Breviary|prayer-book]] by [[Biernat of Lublin]] (ca. 1465 \u2013 after 1529), ''Raj duszny'' (''[[Hortulus Animae]]'', Eden of the Soul), printed in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by [[Florian Ungler]] (originally from [[Bavaria]]).\n\nMany Polish writers studied abroad and at the [[Krak\u00f3w Academy]] (now [[Jagiellonian University]]), which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents.  In this period (as she had had earlier, and would also have in the future), Poland had notable philosophers, including [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Sebastian Petrycy]], [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]], [[Wawrzyniec Grzyma\u0142a Go\u015blicki]], [[Jan Jonston]] (a Briton), [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (a Czech), and [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]] (a Polish king).\n\nAnother notable literary figure from this period is [[Piotr Skarga]] (1536\u20131612), a Polish [[Jesuit]], preacher, [[hagiography|hagiographer]], [[polemicist]], and leading figure of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. His greatest works include ''[[The Lives of the Saints]]'' (''\u017bywoty \u015bwi\u0119tych'', 1579), which was for several centuries one of the most popular books in the Polish language and the ''[[Sejm Sermons]]'' (''Kazania Sejmowe'', 1597), a political [[treatise]], which became popular in the second half of the 19th century, when Skarga was seen as the \"patriotic seer\" who predicted the [[partitions of Poland]].\n\nIn 1488 the world's first literary society, the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana]]'' (the Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Krak\u00f3w.

In the first Romantic sub-period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics:  their work featured [[emotion]]alism and imagination, [[folklore]], and country life, in addition to the aspiration for independence.

Writers such as [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] sought to educate the public about a constructive patriotism that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated ''social organism,'' regardless of external circumstances.<ref>[[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 284.</ref> Another influential Polish novelist active in that period was [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1905.

The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] opposition to the ideals of [[Positivism in Poland|its own predecessor]] (promoting ''organic work'' in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in [[Decadent movement|decadence]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of [[art for art's sake]]. Prominent authors who followed this trend included [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]].\n\n====Restored independence (1918\u201339)====\nLiterature in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918\u201339) spanned a brief but exceptionally fertile period. With the restoration of the country's independence at the end of [[World War I]], Poland developed sociopolitically and culturally.  New [[avant-garde]] currents emerged. The [[Interbellum]] of just twenty years between the [[World Wars]] fostered numerous notable writers, including [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Do\u0142\u0119ga-Mostowicz]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]], [[Maria D\u0105browska]], and [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska]], who saw themselves as exponents of an evolving and advancing [[Europe]]an civilization.\n\n==== After 1945 ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Lem.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]]]\nMuch of Polish literature written during the [[occupation of Poland]] appeared in print only after the end of World War II, including books by [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska|Na\u0142kowska]], [[Adolf Rudnicki|Rudnicki]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]] and others.<ref name=\"JB-WE\" /> The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]]. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], author of ''[[Ashes and Diamonds]]'', describing the political and moral dilemmas associated with the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944\u20131946)|anti-communist resistance in Poland]]. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by [[Andrzej Wajda|Wajda]]. The new emerging prose writers such as [[Stanis\u0142aw Dygat]] and [[Stefan Kisielewski]] approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective.

The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be [[Tadeusz \u0141omnicki]], who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing King Lear.\n\nDuring the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of consumer capitalism. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, [[Daniel Olbrychski]], [[Krystyna Janda]], Jerzy Radziwi\u0142owicz, and from films of [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]. Notable actors from [[Poland]] include [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Janusz Gajos]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] and [[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]].

Greater Poland is where [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages|the Polish statehood emerged during the 9th and 10th centuries]]. With places such as [[Gniezno]], [[Giecz]] and [[Ostr\u00f3w Lednicki]], it is the oldest province of Poland. [[Pozna\u0144]] is its main city. We can distinguish smaller ethnographic subdivisions among Greater Poles, for example the [[Pa\u0142uki|Pa\u0142uczanie]], Biskupianie (near [[Krobia]]), [[Bambrzy]] and Hanobrzy (descended from Polonized German settlers from the areas of [[Bamberg]] and [[Hanover]]), [[Kalisz]]acy, [[Wiele\u0144]] Mazurs, [[Szamotu\u0142y|Szamotulanie]], [[Gosty\u0144|Gostynianie]], and others. Due to past migrations and shifting borders of historical regions, also two Silesian ethnographic groups live in the territory of Wielkopolska \u2013 Hazacy, who inhabit the area of [[Rawicz]]; and Chwalimiacy, who live around [[Chwalim]], [[Nowe Kramsko]] and [[Stare Kramsko]].\n\n=== Kuyavians ===\n{{Main|Kujawy|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Goplans|Duchy of Inowroc\u0142aw}}Some linguists and ethnographers counted Cuiavians as a subdivision of Greater Poles, but most recognize their distinct culture and identity.

Another Medieval expansion of Mazurs, to the east, into former [[Yotvingians|Yotvingian]] (ethnically [[Baltic languages|West Baltic]]) territories, led to the emergence of [[Suwa\u0142ki Region|Sudovian Poles]] and of [[Podlachian language|Podlasie Mazurs]] (in the areas around [[W\u0119gr\u00f3w]], [[Siedlce]], [[Pu\u0142awy]], [[\u0141uk\u00f3w]], [[Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski]], [[W\u0142odawa]], as far as [[Biebrza]] River). Another group descended from a mix of Poles (mostly Mazurs) and West Balts are the [[Kurpie]], who live primarily in [[Puszcza Zielona]] and [[Puszcza Bia\u0142a]] (the Green Forest and the White Forest). Yet another subdivision of Mazurs, which developed a very rich folk culture thanks to having special privileges and prosperity, are \u0141owiczanie (around [[\u0141owicz]]). Another group are Poborzanie in the areas of [[M\u0142awa]] and [[Zawkrze]].\n\nThe capital of Poland, [[Warsaw]], is located in the land of Central Mazurs. However, as any large city it has always been a melting pot of people from all regions of Poland and foreigners from abroad. It is home to the largest [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] community in Poland, as well as the cultural centre of [[Polish Karaims]]. Citizens of Warsaw are called Varsovians.

Another intermediate group, but closer to Mazurs, are Catholic [[Warmiak]]s in the East Prussian region of [[Warmia]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences. From the mixture of Kashubians and Greater Poles, emerged an ethnographic group called Borowiacy Tucholscy, who live in the [[Tuchola Forest]] region, between [[Tuchola]], [[Koronowo]], [[\u015awiecie]] and [[Starogard Gda\u0144ski|Starogard]]. Borowiacy are intermediary, whereas another mixed group \u2013 Krajniacy \u2013 have a mostly Greater Polish character, with relatively minor Kashubian influences. They live in the region of [[Krajna]].

In the west, Pomeranians extended perhaps up to [[Usedom]]. In the east, they extended as far as the [[Vistula Lagoon]], and their eastern neighbours were [[Old Prussians|Baltic-speaking Prussians]]. [[Krynica Morska]] was the easternmost Slavic-speaking village on the Baltic coast, while the area of [[Truso]] (today [[Elbl\u0105g]]) to the south was ethnically Old Prussian. Most of Pomeranians became [[Germanisation|Germanized]] throughout history. Only Eastern Pomeranians preserved their Slavic ethnicity, and are commonly known as [[Kashubians]] today. Kashubians who were [[Royal Prussia|under Polish rule during the 16th\u201318th centuries]] remained [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], while those who lived in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in the 1700s, became [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] following the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].\n\nKashubians can be divided into many subdivisions, such as the [[Slovincian language|Slovincians]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences, which led to the emergence of several intermediary ethnographic groups. Descended mainly from Greater Polish and Cuiavian settlers who mixed with Kashubians, are Kociewiacy in the region of [[Kociewie]], located between [[Starogard Gda\u0144ski|Starogard Pomorski]], [[Tczew]], [[Gniew]], [[\u015awiecie]] and up to the outskirts of [[Gda\u0144sk]] in the north. The main city in Eastern Pomerania has always been [[History of Gda\u0144sk|Gda\u0144sk]], located on the border between three regions: Kashubia to the west, Kociewie to the south, [[East Prussia|Prussia]] to the east.\n\n=== Silesians ===\n[[File:Members of \"Grojcowianie\" folklore group in \u017bywiec Beskids clothing 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[G\u00f3ral]] women from the [[Beskidy]] Mountains\n ([[\u017bywiec Beskids|\u017bywiec]]) in [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]]]]\n{{Main|Silesians|History of Silesia|Silesia|Cieszyn Silesia}}In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Silesia was inhabited by several [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes, known from [[Primary source|written sources]] under their [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] names.

However, throughout its existence, the Polish state followed a tolerant policy towards minorities resulting in numerous ethnic and religious identities of the Poles, such as [[Polish Jews]].\n\nPoles have made important contributions to the world in every major field of human endeavor, among them [[Copernicus]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Fryderyk Chopin]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. Notable Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9s \u2013 many of them forced from their homeland by historic vicissitudes \u2013 have included physicist [[Joseph Rotblat]], mathematician [[Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]], pianist [[Arthur Rubinstein]], actresses [[Helena Modjeska]] and [[Pola Negri]], military leaders [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]] and [[Casimir Pulaski]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], politician [[Rosa Luxemburg]], painter [[Tamara de Lempicka]], filmmakers [[Samuel Goldwyn]] and the [[Warner Brothers]], cartoonist [[Max Fleischer]], and cosmeticians [[Helena Rubinstein]] and [[Max Factor Sr.|Max Factor]].\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Gesta Hamburgensis trans oddara st polanos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Fragment of ''[[Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum]]'' (1073) by [[Adam of Bremen]], containing the name \"[[Polans (western)|Polans]]\":  \"''trans [[Oder|Oddaram]] sunt Polanos''\"]]\n[[Slavs]] have been in the territory of modern Poland for over 1500 years. They organized into [[Tribe|tribal units]], of which the larger ones were later known as the [[Polish tribes]]; the names of many tribes are found on the list compiled by the anonymous [[Bavarian Geographer]] in the 9th century.<ref name=\"playground I xxvii\">{{Harvnb|Davies|2005a|p=xxvii}}.</ref> In the 9th and 10th centuries the tribes gave rise to developed regions along the upper [[Vistula]] (the [[Vistulans]] within the [[Great Moravia]]n Empire sphere),<ref name=\"playground I xxvii\"/> the [[Baltic Sea]] coast and in [[Greater Poland]].

After 1945 the so-called \"autochthonous\" or \"aboriginal\" school of Polish prehistory received official backing in Poland and a considerable degree of popular support. According to this view, the [[Lusatian Culture]] which archaeologists have identified between the [[Oder]] and the [[Vistula]] in the early [[Iron Age]], is said to be Slavonic; all non-Slavonic tribes and peoples recorded in the area at various points in ancient times are dismissed as \"migrants\" and \"visitors\". In contrast, the critics of this theory, such as [[Marija Gimbutas]], regard it as an unproved hypothesis and for them the date and origin of the westward migration of the Slavs is largely uncharted; the Slavonic connections of the Lusatian Culture are entirely imaginary; and the presence of an ethnically mixed and constantly changing collection of peoples on the [[North European Plain|Middle European Plain]] is taken for granted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052255/http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2115/7953/1/KJ00000034106.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\nPolish people are the sixth largest national group in the [[European Union]].<ref>NationMaster.com 2003\u20132008.

France has a historic relationship with Poland and has a relatively large Polish-descendant population. Poles have lived in France since the 18th century.

Owing to this central location, the Poles came very early into contact with both civilizations&nbsp;\u2013 eastern and western, and as a result developed economically, culturally, and politically. A German general [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder|Helmut Carl von Moltke]], in his ''Poland. A historical sketch'' (1885), stated that \"Poland of the fifteenth century was one of the most civilised states of Europe.\"\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity, experiencing severe crises, especially during World War II and in the following years. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.<ref name=\"MFA\" />\n\nPoland was for centuries a refuge to many [[Jews]] from all over Europe; in the twentieth century, a large number emigrated to [[Israel]]. Several prominent Israeli statesmen were born in Poland, including Israel's founder [[David Ben-Gurion]], former [[President of Israel]] [[Shimon Peres]], and [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Ministers]] [[Yitzhak Shamir]] and [[Menachem Begin]].\n\n=== Language ===\n[[File:Book of Henryk\u00f3w.PNG|thumb|''[[Book of Henryk\u00f3w]]''.  Highlighted in red is the earliest known sentence written in the [[Old Polish language]]]]\n[[File:J\u0119zyk polski w Europie.png|thumb|Knowledge of the Polish language within Europe]]\n{{main|Polish language}}\nThe [[Polish language]] ({{lang-pl|j\u0119zyk polski}}) is a [[West Slavic languages|West Slavic language]] of the [[Lechitic languages|Lechitic]] group and the official language of Poland. Its written form uses the [[Polish alphabet]], which is the [[Latin alphabet]] with the addition of a few [[diacritic marks]].\n\nPoland is the most linguistically homogeneous European country; nearly 97% of Poland's citizens declare [[Polish language|Polish]] as their mother tongue. Ethnic Poles constitute large minorities in Germany, northern [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], northeast [[Lithuania]] and western [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]]. Polish is the most widely used minority language in Lithuania's [[Vilnius]] County (26% of the population, according to the 2001 census results) and is found elsewhere in northeastern and western Lithuania. In Ukraine it is most common in the western [[Lviv]] and Volyn oblast (provinces), while in western Belarus it is used by the significant Polish minority, especially in the [[Brest, Belarus|Brest]] and [[Grodno]] regions and in areas along the Lithuanian border.\n\nThe geographical distribution of the [[Polish language]] was greatly affected by the border changes and population transfers that followed [[World War II]]. Poles resettled in the \"[[Recovered Territories]]\" in the west and north. Some Poles remained in the previously Polish-ruled territories in the east that were annexed by the [[USSR]], resulting in the present-day Polish-speaking minorities in [[Lithuania]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]], although many Poles were expelled or emigrated from those areas to areas within Poland's new borders. Meanwhile, the flight and expulsion of Germans, as well as the expulsion of Ukrainians and resettlement of Ukrainians within Poland, contributed to the country's linguistic homogeneity.\n\nPolish-speakers use the language in a uniform manner throughout most of Poland, though numerous languages and dialects coexist alongside the standard Polish language. The most common dialects in Poland are [[Silesian language|Silesian]], spoken in Upper Silesia, and [[Kashubian language|Kashubian]], widely spoken in the north.\n\n=== Science and technology ===\nEducation has been of prime interest to Poland since the early 12th century. The catalog of the library of the Cathedral Chapter in [[Krak\u00f3w]] dating from 1110 shows that Polish scholars already then had access to literature from all over Europe. In 1364 King [[Casimir III the Great]] founded the [[Krak\u00f3w Academy]], which would become Jagiellonian University, one of the great universities of Europe. The Polish people have made considerable contributions in the fields of science, technology and mathematics.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://uatacz.up.krakow.pl/~wwwchemia/pliki/ISBN_978_83_7271_768_9_From_alchemy_to_the_present_day|title=From alchemy to the present day \u2013 the choice of biographies of Polish scientists|last=Nodzy\u0144ska|first=Ma\u0142gorzata|last2=Cie\u015bla|first2=Pawe\u0142|publisher=Pedagogical University of Krak\u00f3w|year=2012|isbn=978-83-7271-768-9|location=Cracow|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe list of early famous scientists in Poland begins with the 13th-century [[Vitello]] and includes the [[polymath]] and astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], who formulated a [[Mathematical model|model]] of [[Celestial spheres#Renaissance|the universe]] that placed [[Heliocentrism|the Sun]] rather than the Earth at its center; the publication of Copernicus' book ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres) just before his death in 1543 is considered a major event in the history of science, triggering the [[Copernican Revolution]] and making an important contribution to the [[Scientific Revolution]]. In 1773 King [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski]] established the [[Commission of National Education]], the world's first ministry of education.\n\nAfter the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland|third partition of Poland]], no free Polish state existed. The 19th and 20th centuries saw many Polish scientists working abroad. The greatest was [[Maria Sk\u0142odowska Curie]] (1867\u20131934), a [[physicist]] and [[chemist]] who conducted pioneering research on [[radioactivity]] and was the [[List of female Nobel laureates|first woman to win a Nobel Prize]], the first person and only woman to [[Nobel Prize#Multiple laureates|win twice]], the only person to win twice in multiple sciences, and was part of the Curie family legacy of [[Nobel Prize#Family laureates|five Nobel Prizes]].  Another notable Polish expatriate scientist was [[Ignacy Domeyko]] (1802\u201389), a geologist and mineralogist who lived and worked in South America, in [[Chile]].\n\n[[Kazimierz Funk]] (1884\u20131967), whose name is commonly [[English language|anglicized]] as \"Casimir Funk\", was a Polish [[Biochemistry|biochemist]], generally credited with being among the first to formulate (in 1912) the concept of [[vitamin]]s, which he called \"vital amines\" or \"vitamines\".\n\nAccording to [[NASA]], Polish scientists were among the pioneers of [[rocket]]ry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/topnav/materials/listbytype/A_Pictorial_History_of_Rockets.html|title=A Pictorial History of Rockets|last=|first=|publisher=NASA|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a world center of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the [[Lw\u00f3w School of Mathematics]] (including [[Stefan Banach]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Ulam]]) and [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]] (including [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski]]).

[[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Krak\u00f3w from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|title=The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas|work=semper.pl|page=244|accessdate=13 May 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5h7rxPZrB?url=http://www.semper.pl/muzyczne_dwory_summary.pdf|archivedate=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n====17th\u201318th centuries====\n{{Listen|filename=Polonezz.ogg|title=''Po\u017cegnanie Ojczyzny'' (Farewell to Country)|plain=Polonaise by Ogi\u0144ski (1794)|description=Polonaise by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski|Ogi\u0144ski]]|format=[[Ogg]]}}\nIn the last years of the 16th century and the first part of the 17th century, a number of Italian musicians were guests at the royal courts of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] and his son [[Ladislaus IV of Poland|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]]. These included [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Giovanni Francesco Anerio]], and [[Marco Scacchi]]. Polish composers from this period focused on [[baroque]] religious music, concertos for voices, instruments, and [[basso continuo]], a tradition that continued into the 18th century. The best-remembered composer of this period is [[Adam Jarz\u0119bski]], known for his instrumental works such as ''Chromatica'', ''Tamburetta'', ''Sentinella'', ''Bentrovata'', and ''Nova Casa''.  Other composers include [[Grzegorz Gerwazy Gorczycki]], [[Franciszek Lilius]], [[Bart\u0142omiej P\u0119kiel]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Sylwester Szarzy\u0144ski]] and [[Marcin Mielczewski]].\n\nIn addition, a tradition of operatic production began in Warsaw in 1628, with a performance of ''Galatea'' (composer uncertain), the first Italian opera produced outside Italy.  Shortly after this performance, the court produced [[Francesca Caccini]]'s opera ''[[La liberazione di Ruggiero dall'isola d\u2019Alcina]]'', which she had written for Prince [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV|W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] three years earlier when he was in Italy.  Another first, this is the earliest surviving opera written by a woman. When W\u0142adys\u0142aw became king (as W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV) he oversaw the production of at least ten operas during the late 1630s and 1640s, making Warsaw a center of the art. The composers of these operas are not known:  they may have been Poles working under Marco Scacchi<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Marco_Scacchi|title=Marco Scacchi|website=Cpdl.org|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> in the royal chapel, or they may have been among the Italians imported by W\u0142adys\u0142aw.\n\nThe late 17th century and the 18th century saw Poland in sociopolitical decline, which hindered the development of music. Some composers (such as Jan Stefani and [[Maciej Kamie\u0144ski]]) attempted to create a Polish opera; others imitated foreign composers such as [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].\n\nThe most important development in this time, however, was the [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]], perhaps the first distinctively Polish [[art music]]. Polonaises for piano were and remain popular, such as those by [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]], [[Karol Kurpi\u0144ski]], [[Juliusz Zar\u0119bski]], [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[Mieczys\u0142aw Kar\u0142owicz]], [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]], and, most famously, [[Fryderyk Chopin]]. Chopin remains very well known, and is regarded for composing a wide variety of works, including [[mazurka]]s, [[nocturne]]s, [[waltz]]es and concertos, and using traditional Polish elements in his pieces.  The same period saw [[Stanislaw Moniuszko|Stanis\u0142aw Moniuszko]], the leading individual in the successful development of [[Polish opera]], still renowned for operas like ''[[Halka]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Manor]]''.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Micha\u0142 Kleafas Aginski. \u041c\u0456\u0445\u0430\u043b \u041a\u043b\u0435\u0430\u0444\u0430\u0441 \u0410\u0433\u0456\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0456 (F.-X.

In 1475 Kasper Elyan of [[G\u0142og\u00f3w|Glogau (G\u0142og\u00f3w)]] set up a printing shop in [[Wroc\u0142aw|Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw)]], [[Silesia]]. Twenty years later, the first [[Cyrillic]] printing house was founded at Krak\u00f3w by [[Schweipolt Fiol]] for [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] hierarchs. The most notable texts produced in that period include ''Saint Florian's Breviary,'' printed partially in Polish in the late 14th century; ''Statua synodalia Wratislaviensia'' (1475): a printed collection of Polish and Latin prayers; as well as [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]]'s ''Chronicle'' from the 15th century and his ''Catalogus archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium''.<ref name=\"Mi\u0142osz-1\" />\n\n==== Renaissance ====\n[[File:Jan Kochanowski.png|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[Jan Kochanowski]]]]\nWith the advent of the [[Renaissance]], the Polish language was finally accepted in Poland on an equal footing with [[Latin]]. Polish art and culture flourished under the [[Jagiellonian Dynasty]], and many foreign poets and writers settled in Poland, bringing new literary trends with them. These writers included [[Kallimach]] ([[Filippo Buonaccorsi]]) and [[Conrad Celtis]]. [[Miko\u0142aj Rej]] and [[Jan Kochanowski]] laid the foundations for the Polish literary language and modern Polish grammar. The first book written entirely in the [[Polish language]] appeared in this period:  a [[Breviary|prayer-book]] by [[Biernat of Lublin]] (ca. 1465 \u2013 after 1529), ''Raj duszny'' (''[[Hortulus Animae]]'', Eden of the Soul), printed in [[Krak\u00f3w]] in 1513 at one of Poland's first printing establishments, operated by [[Florian Ungler]] (originally from [[Bavaria]]).\n\nMany Polish writers studied abroad and at the [[Krak\u00f3w Academy]] (now [[Jagiellonian University]]), which became a melting pot for new ideas and currents.  In this period (as she had had earlier, and would also have in the future), Poland had notable philosophers, including [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], [[Sebastian Petrycy]], [[Andrzej Frycz Modrzewski]], [[Wawrzyniec Grzyma\u0142a Go\u015blicki]], [[Jan Jonston]] (a Briton), [[Jan Amos Komensky]] (a Czech), and [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]] (a Polish king).\n\nAnother notable literary figure from this period is [[Piotr Skarga]] (1536\u20131612), a Polish [[Jesuit]], preacher, [[hagiography|hagiographer]], [[polemicist]], and leading figure of the [[Counter-Reformation]] in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. His greatest works include ''[[The Lives of the Saints]]'' (''\u017bywoty \u015bwi\u0119tych'', 1579), which was for several centuries one of the most popular books in the Polish language and the ''[[Sejm Sermons]]'' (''Kazania Sejmowe'', 1597), a political [[treatise]], which became popular in the second half of the 19th century, when Skarga was seen as the \"patriotic seer\" who predicted the [[partitions of Poland]].\n\nIn 1488 the world's first literary society, the ''[[Sodalitas Litterarum Vistulana]]'' (the Vistula Literary Society) was founded in Krak\u00f3w.

In the first Romantic sub-period, Polish Romantics were heavily influenced by other European Romantics:  their work featured [[emotion]]alism and imagination, [[folklore]], and country life, in addition to the aspiration for independence.

Writers such as [[Boles\u0142aw Prus]] sought to educate the public about a constructive patriotism that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated ''social organism,'' regardless of external circumstances.<ref>[[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', p. 284.</ref> Another influential Polish novelist active in that period was [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]] who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1905.

The period was based on two concepts. Its early stage was characterized by a strong [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] opposition to the ideals of [[Positivism in Poland|its own predecessor]] (promoting ''organic work'' in the face of foreign occupation). Artists following this early philosophy of Young Poland believed in [[Decadent movement|decadence]], [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]], conflict between human values and civilization, and the existence of [[art for art's sake]]. Prominent authors who followed this trend included [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Przybyszewski]] and [[Jan Kasprowicz]].\n\n====Restored independence (1918\u201339)====\nLiterature in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918\u201339) spanned a brief but exceptionally fertile period. With the restoration of the country's independence at the end of [[World War I]], Poland developed sociopolitically and culturally.  New [[avant-garde]] currents emerged. The [[Interbellum]] of just twenty years between the [[World Wars]] fostered numerous notable writers, including [[Julian Tuwim]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz]], [[Tadeusz Do\u0142\u0119ga-Mostowicz]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz]], [[Maria D\u0105browska]], and [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska]], who saw themselves as exponents of an evolving and advancing [[Europe]]an civilization.\n\n==== After 1945 ====\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw Lem.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]]]\nMuch of Polish literature written during the [[occupation of Poland]] appeared in print only after the end of World War II, including books by [[Zofia Na\u0142kowska|Na\u0142kowska]], [[Adolf Rudnicki|Rudnicki]], [[Tadeusz Borowski|Borowski]] and others.<ref name=\"JB-WE\" /> The Soviet takeover of the country did not discourage [[\u00e9migr\u00e9]]s and exiles from returning, especially before the advent of [[Stalinism in Poland|Stalinism]]. Indeed, many writers attempted to recreate the Polish literary scene, often with a touch of nostalgia for the prewar reality, including [[Jerzy Andrzejewski]], author of ''[[Ashes and Diamonds]]'', describing the political and moral dilemmas associated with the [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944\u20131946)|anti-communist resistance in Poland]]. His novel was adapted into film a decade later by [[Andrzej Wajda|Wajda]]. The new emerging prose writers such as [[Stanis\u0142aw Dygat]] and [[Stefan Kisielewski]] approached the catastrophe of war from their own perspective.

The most revered actor of the second half of the twentieth century in Poland is generally considered to be [[Tadeusz \u0141omnicki]], who died in 1992 of a heart attack while rehearsing King Lear.\n\nDuring the second half of the nineties, there appeared in Polish dramatic theatre a new generation of young directors, who have attempted to create productions relevant to the experience and problems of a thirty-something generation brought up surrounded by mass culture, habituated to a fast-moving lifestyle, but at the same time ever more lost in the world of consumer capitalism. There is no strict division in Poland between theatre and film directors and actors, therefore many stage artists are known to theatre goers from films of [[Andrzej Wajda]], for example: Wojciech Pszoniak, [[Daniel Olbrychski]], [[Krystyna Janda]], Jerzy Radziwi\u0142owicz, and from films of [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]]. Notable actors from [[Poland]] include [[Jerzy Stuhr]], [[Janusz Gajos]], [[Jerzy Skolimowski]] and [[Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski]].

Greater Poland is where [[Poland in the Early Middle Ages|the Polish statehood emerged during the 9th and 10th centuries]]. With places such as [[Gniezno]], [[Giecz]] and [[Ostr\u00f3w Lednicki]], it is the oldest province of Poland. [[Pozna\u0144]] is its main city. We can distinguish smaller ethnographic subdivisions among Greater Poles, for example the [[Pa\u0142uki|Pa\u0142uczanie]], Biskupianie (near [[Krobia]]), [[Bambrzy]] and Hanobrzy (descended from Polonized German settlers from the areas of [[Bamberg]] and [[Hanover]]), [[Kalisz]]acy, [[Wiele\u0144]] Mazurs, [[Szamotu\u0142y|Szamotulanie]], [[Gosty\u0144|Gostynianie]], and others. Due to past migrations and shifting borders of historical regions, also two Silesian ethnographic groups live in the territory of Wielkopolska \u2013 Hazacy, who inhabit the area of [[Rawicz]]; and Chwalimiacy, who live around [[Chwalim]], [[Nowe Kramsko]] and [[Stare Kramsko]].\n\n=== Kuyavians ===\n{{Main|Kujawy|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Goplans|Duchy of Inowroc\u0142aw}}Some linguists and ethnographers counted Cuiavians as a subdivision of Greater Poles, but most recognize their distinct culture and identity.

Another Medieval expansion of Mazurs, to the east, into former [[Yotvingians|Yotvingian]] (ethnically [[Baltic languages|West Baltic]]) territories, led to the emergence of [[Suwa\u0142ki Region|Sudovian Poles]] and of [[Podlachian language|Podlasie Mazurs]] (in the areas around [[W\u0119gr\u00f3w]], [[Siedlce]], [[Pu\u0142awy]], [[\u0141uk\u00f3w]], [[Soko\u0142\u00f3w Podlaski]], [[W\u0142odawa]], as far as [[Biebrza]] River). Another group descended from a mix of Poles (mostly Mazurs) and West Balts are the [[Kurpie]], who live primarily in [[Puszcza Zielona]] and [[Puszcza Bia\u0142a]] (the Green Forest and the White Forest). Yet another subdivision of Mazurs, which developed a very rich folk culture thanks to having special privileges and prosperity, are \u0141owiczanie (around [[\u0141owicz]]). Another group are Poborzanie in the areas of [[M\u0142awa]] and [[Zawkrze]].\n\nThe capital of Poland, [[Warsaw]], is located in the land of Central Mazurs. However, as any large city it has always been a melting pot of people from all regions of Poland and foreigners from abroad. It is home to the largest [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] community in Poland, as well as the cultural centre of [[Polish Karaims]]. Citizens of Warsaw are called Varsovians.

Another intermediate group, but closer to Mazurs, are Catholic [[Warmiak]]s in the East Prussian region of [[Warmia]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences. From the mixture of Kashubians and Greater Poles, emerged an ethnographic group called Borowiacy Tucholscy, who live in the [[Tuchola Forest]] region, between [[Tuchola]], [[Koronowo]], [[\u015awiecie]] and [[Starogard Gda\u0144ski|Starogard]]. Borowiacy are intermediary, whereas another mixed group \u2013 Krajniacy \u2013 have a mostly Greater Polish character, with relatively minor Kashubian influences. They live in the region of [[Krajna]]. Two other ethnographic group in Northern Poland are Powi\u015blanie (whose homelands are the areas around [[Sztum]], [[Kwidzyn|Kwidzy\u0144]] and [[Malbork]]) and [[:File:Koschneiderei 1926.gif|Kosznajdrzy]].\n\n[[\u017bu\u0142awy Wi\u015blane]] in North Poland used to be the homeland of [[Vistula delta Mennonites|Mennonites]], who are considered to be either Dutch, German, or a group on their own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inne-jezyki.amu.edu.pl/Frontend/Language/Details/16|title=Poland's Linguistic Heritage.

In the west, Pomeranians extended perhaps up to [[Usedom]]. In the east, they extended as far as the [[Vistula Lagoon]], and their eastern neighbours were [[Old Prussians|Baltic-speaking Prussians]]. [[Krynica Morska]] was the easternmost Slavic-speaking village on the Baltic coast, while the area of [[Truso]] (today [[Elbl\u0105g]]) to the south was ethnically Old Prussian. Most of Pomeranians became [[Germanisation|Germanized]] throughout history. Only Eastern Pomeranians preserved their Slavic ethnicity, and are commonly known as [[Kashubians]] today. Kashubians who were [[Royal Prussia|under Polish rule during the 16th\u201318th centuries]] remained [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], while those who lived in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] in the 1700s, became [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] following the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]].\n\nKashubians can be divided into many subdivisions, such as the [[Slovincian language|Slovincians]]. From the Early Middle Ages onwards, Pomerania was under strong Polish (especially Greater Polish and Cuiavian) influences, which led to the emergence of several intermediary ethnographic groups. Descended mainly from Greater Polish and Cuiavian settlers who mixed with Kashubians, are Kociewiacy in the region of [[Kociewie]], located between [[Starogard Gda\u0144ski|Starogard Pomorski]], [[Tczew]], [[Gniew]], [[\u015awiecie]] and up to the outskirts of [[Gda\u0144sk]] in the north. The main city in Eastern Pomerania has always been [[History of Gda\u0144sk|Gda\u0144sk]], located on the border between three regions: Kashubia to the west, Kociewie to the south, [[East Prussia|Prussia]] to the east.\n\n=== Silesians ===\n[[File:Members of \"Grojcowianie\" folklore group in \u017bywiec Beskids clothing 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[G\u00f3ral]] women from the [[Beskidy]] Mountains\n ([[\u017bywiec Beskids|\u017bywiec]]) in [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]]]]\n{{Main|Silesians|History of Silesia|Silesia|Cieszyn Silesia}}In the [[Early Middle Ages]], Silesia was inhabited by several [[Lechites|Lechitic]] tribes, known from [[Primary source|written sources]] under their [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] names.

Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire.... The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods. That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel (although electrical power was not cut off, since the plant in Ashqelon, which supplies 65% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, provided an uninterrupted flow of power).'</ref> According to the Telegraph, writing as Cast Lead began, the 4 November operation \"sealed the fate of the ceasefire.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Israel attack on Gaza: Fragile peace shattered again|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/3981502/Israel-attack-on-Gaza-Fragile-peace-shattered-again.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 27, 2008 |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> The raid, according to [[Mark LeVine]] was unprovoked.<ref name=\"LeVine\" >[[Mark LeVine]], [http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/war_on_gaza/2009/01/2009110112723260741.html \"Who will save Israel from itself?\"], [[Al Jazeera]] 27 December 2009</ref> Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers.

In certain cases, he added, such choice of means would be less harmful for civilian population than other munitions, provided that the use of white phosphorus withstands the proportionality test. In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account \"the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time\". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area. He also said that in his view white phosphorus munition is neither chemical nor incendiary weapon and is not intended to cause damage. He said its use was not prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention.<ref name=\"Public hearings \u2013 Geneva, Afternoon Session of 7 July 2009\"/>\n\nAn article by Mark Cantora examining the legal implications of the use of white phosphorus munitions by the IDF, published in 2010 in the ''[[Gonzaga Journal of International Law]]'', argues that Israel's use of white phosphorus in Gaza was technically legal under existing international humanitarian laws and \"Therefore, it is imperative for the international community to convene a White Phosphorus Convention Conference in order to address these issues and fill this substantial gap in international humanitarian law.\"<ref>Mark Cantora, Israel and White Phosphorus During Operation Cast Lead: A Case Study in Adherence to Inadequate Humanitarian Laws, 13:1 ''Gonzaga Journal of International Law'' (2010), available at {{cite web |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329005840/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/194/26/ |archivedate=29 March 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Dense inert metal explosives (DIME)====\n[[Dense Inert Metal Explosive]] (DIME) is a type of bomb developed to minimize collateral damage.<ref name=Haaretz_new_weapon>Amira Hass, [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/norwegian-doctor-israel-used-new-type-of-weapon-in-gaza-1.268394 \"Norwegian doctor: Israel used new type of weapon in Gaza\"].

He is of the view that some weapons systems used in the conflict had some sort of DIME component to reduce the effect on the ground. Colonel Lane explained that the idea behind a Focused Lethality Munition (FLM), which is an example of a DIME munition, is that the fragments produced stay within a safety radius of about 6 meters, so anybody outside that radius is safe, while those within the area of dispersal will be affected severely. He commented on the documentations where medics described unusual amputations saying that he was no medical expert, but the use of a metal like tungsten and cobalt at short distances would likely have that effect.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219084642/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/specialsession/9/docs/2009.07.07PM_Session.doc|url-status=dead|title=OHCHR.org|archivedate=19 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Goldstone Report]] wrote that the Mission found that the allegations that DIME weapons were used Israeli armed forces required further clarification and they were unable to ascertain their usage, though it received reports from Palestinian and foreign doctors who had operated in Gaza during the military operations of a high percentage of patients with injuries compatible with their impact.

Israel increased the severity of its blockade of Gaza during the ceasefire, drastically restricting the entry of supplies necessary for daily living and preventing exports from leaving the Strip.

The lull was sporadically violated by rocket and mortar shell fire, carried out by rogue terrorist organizations, in some instances in defiance of Hamas (especially by Fatah and Al-Qaeda supporters). Hamas was careful to maintain the ceasefire.... The escalation and erosion of the lull arrangement, 4 November to the time of this writing, December 172: On 4 November the IDF carried out a military action close to the border security fence on the Gazan side to prevent an abduction planned by Hamas, which had dug a tunnel under the fence to that purpose. Seven Hamas terrorist operatives were killed during the action. In retaliation, Hamas and the other terrorist organizations attacked Israel with a massive barrage of rockets.... During the second period a new dynamic was created which replaced the former relative calm: Hamas and the other terrorist organizations extended their attacks (rocket and mortar shell fire, IEDs and light-arms fire), the IDF operated to prevent attacks within the Gaza Strip (Israeli Air Force attacks, firing at terrorist squads within the Gaza Strip near the border), the terrorist organizations responded with barrages of rocket and mortar shell fire to retaliate for their losses and continued daily sporadic fire, in response to which Israel closed the border crossings, exerting pressure on Hamas and the Gaza Strip residents.... With the escalation in rocket and mortar shell attacks which began on 4 November, Israel began closing the crossings for longer periods. That led to shortages of basic goods in the Gaza Strip and to disruptions in the supply of various types of fuel (although electrical power was not cut off, since the plant in Ashqelon, which supplies 65% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, provided an uninterrupted flow of power).'</ref> According to the Telegraph, writing as Cast Lead began, the 4 November operation \"sealed the fate of the ceasefire.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Israel attack on Gaza: Fragile peace shattered again|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/palestinianauthority/3981502/Israel-attack-on-Gaza-Fragile-peace-shattered-again.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=December 27, 2008 |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> The raid, according to [[Mark LeVine]] was unprovoked.<ref name=\"LeVine\" >[[Mark LeVine]], [http://www.aljazeera.com/focus/war_on_gaza/2009/01/2009110112723260741.html \"Who will save Israel from itself?\"], [[Al Jazeera]] 27 December 2009</ref> Israel stated its aim was to destroy what it said was a tunnel on the Gaza-Israel border dug by militants to infiltrate into Israel and abduct soldiers.

In discussing the principle of proportionality he said that the legality of using white phosphorus in an urban setting could only be decided on a case-by-case basis taking into account \"the precise circumstances of its use, not in general, generically, but based on that target, at that time\". He stressed that the humanitarian implications were vital in this assessment giving the example that using white phosphorus on a school yard would have different implications to its use on another area.

{"title_page": "Ether", "text_new": "{{short description|Class of organic compounds}}\n{{about||the substance whose common name is ether|Diethyl ether|other uses of ether or aether|Aether (disambiguation){{!}}Aether}}\n{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}\n[[File:Ether-(general).png|thumb|150px|The general structure of an ether.  R and R' represent any [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] [[substituent]].]]\n\n'''Ethers''' are a class of [[organic compound]]s that contain an ether [[functional group|group]]\u2014an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] connected to two [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] groups.  They have the general formula R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 represent the alkyl or aryl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the [[oxygen]] atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=ethers|file=E02221}}</ref> A typical example of the first group is the [[solvent]] and [[anesthetic]] [[diethyl ether]], commonly referred to simply as \"ether\" ({{nobr|CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>}}). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lignin]].\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nEthers feature C\u2013O\u2013C linkage defined by a [[Molecular geometry#Bonding|bond angle]] of about 110\u00b0 and C\u2013O distances of about 140&nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]]. The barrier to rotation about the C\u2013O bonds is low.  The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the hybridization at oxygen is sp<sup>3</sup>.\n\nOxygen is more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in [[ketones]] or [[aldehydes]]), however.\n\n:Depending on the groups at R and R\u2032, ethers are classified into two types:\n\n# Simple ethers or symmetrical ethers; e.g., [[diethyl ether]], [[dimethyl ether]], [[dipropyl ether]] etc.\n# Mixed ethers or asymmetrical ethers; e.g., [[methoxyethane|ethyl methyl ether]], [[Methoxybenzene|methyl phenyl ether]], etc.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn the [[IUPAC nomenclature]] system, ethers are named using the general formula ''\"alkoxyalkane\"'', for example CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>3</sub> is [[methoxyethane]]. If the ether is part of a more-complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so \u2013OCH<sub>3</sub> would be considered a ''\"[[methoxy]]-\"'' group. The simpler [[alkyl]] radical is written in front, so CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> would be given as ''methoxy''(CH<sub>3</sub>O)''ethane''(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).\n\n===Trivial name===\nIUPAC rules are often not followed for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by \"ether\".  For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH<sub>3</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), diphenylether (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called \"ether\", but was once called ''sweet oil of vitriol''. Methyl phenyl ether is [[anisole]], because it was originally found in [[aniseed]]. The [[aromatic]] ethers include [[furan]]s. [[Acetal]]s (\u03b1-alkoxy ethers R\u2013CH(\u2013OR)\u2013O\u2013R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.\n\n===Polyethers===\nPolyethers are compounds with more than one ether group. These have been used as impression materials in dentistry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dental Materials- : Properties and Manipulation|last=Powers, John M.|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323291507|oclc=912232266}}</ref>\n\nThe [[crown ether]]s are examples of small polyethers.

The reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either OH can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:\n: R\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>(OH) \u2192 R\u2013CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. Several milder methods exist to produce ethers.\n\n===Williamson ether synthesis===\n[[Nucleophilic displacement]] of [[alkyl halide]]s by [[alkoxide]]s\n: R\u2013ONa + R\u2032\u2013X   \u2192   R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032 + Na[[Halide|X]]\nThis reaction is called the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]. It involves treatment of a parent [[alcohol]] with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable [[leaving group]] (R\u2013X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include [[iodide]], [[bromide]], or [[sulfonate]]s. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. [[bromobenzene]], see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.\n\nIn a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by [[phenoxide]]s. The R\u2013X cannot be used to react with the alcohol. However [[phenols]] can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] like [[sodium hydroxide]] to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the \u2013X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an [[SN2|S<sub>N</sub>2]] mechanism.\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup> + R\u2013X   \u2192   C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OR\n\n===Ullmann condensation===\nThe [[Ullmann condensation]] is similar to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide.  Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.\n\n===Electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes===\nAlcohols add to electrophilically activated [[alkene]]s.\n: [[alkene|R<sub>2</sub>C=CR<sub>2</sub>]] + R\u2013OH \u2192 R<sub>2</sub>CH\u2013C(\u2013O\u2013R)\u2013R<sub>2</sub>\n[[Acid]] [[catalysis]] is required for this reaction. Often, mercury trifluoroacetate (Hg(OCOCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is used as a catalyst for the reaction generating an ether with [[Markovnikov]] regiochemistry.  Using similar reactions, [[tetrahydropyranyl ether]]s are used as [[protective group]]s for alcohols.\n\n===Preparation of epoxides===\n{{main|epoxide}}\n[[Epoxide]]s are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes.  The most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen.  Other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:\n* By the oxidation of alkenes with a [[peroxyacid]] such as [[Meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|''m''-CPBA]].\n* By the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.\n\n==Important ethers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Ethylene oxide chemical structure.png|50px|Chemical structure of ethylene oxide]]\n| [[Ethylene oxide]]\n| A cyclic ether.

R and R' represent any [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] [[substituent]].]]\n\n'''Ethers''' are a class of [[organic compound]]s that contain an ether [[functional group|group]]\u2014an [[oxygen]] [[atom]] connected to two [[alkyl]] or [[aryl]] groups.  They have the general formula R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 represent the alkyl or aryl groups. Ethers can again be classified into two varieties: if the alkyl groups are the same on both sides of the [[oxygen]] atom, then it is a simple or symmetrical ether, whereas if they are different, the ethers are called mixed or unsymmetrical ethers.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=ethers|file=E02221}}</ref> A typical example of the first group is the [[solvent]] and [[anesthetic]] [[diethyl ether]], commonly referred to simply as \"ether\" ({{nobr|CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>3</sub>}}). Ethers are common in organic chemistry and even more prevalent in biochemistry, as they are common linkages in [[carbohydrate]]s and [[lignin]].\n\n==Structure and bonding==\nEthers feature C\u2013O\u2013C linkage defined by a [[Molecular geometry#Bonding|bond angle]] of about 110\u00b0 and C\u2013O distances of about 140&nbsp;[[Picometre|pm]]. The barrier to rotation about the C\u2013O bonds is low.  The bonding of oxygen in ethers, alcohols, and water is similar. In the language of [[valence bond theory]], the hybridization at oxygen is sp<sup>3</sup>.\n\nOxygen is more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon, thus the hydrogens alpha to ethers are more acidic than in simple hydrocarbons. They are far less acidic than hydrogens alpha to carbonyl groups (such as in [[ketones]] or [[aldehydes]]), however.\n\n:Depending on the groups at R and R\u2032, ethers are classified into two types:\n\n# Simple ethers or symmetrical ethers; e.g., [[diethyl ether]], [[dimethyl ether]], [[dipropyl ether]] etc.\n# Mixed ethers or asymmetrical ethers; e.g., [[methoxyethane|ethyl methyl ether]], [[Methoxybenzene|methyl phenyl ether]], etc.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn the [[IUPAC nomenclature]] system, ethers are named using the general formula ''\"alkoxyalkane\"'', for example CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>3</sub> is [[methoxyethane]]. If the ether is part of a more-complex molecule, it is described as an alkoxy substituent, so \u2013OCH<sub>3</sub> would be considered a ''\"[[methoxy]]-\"'' group. The simpler [[alkyl]] radical is written in front, so CH<sub>3</sub>\u2013O\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> would be given as ''methoxy''(CH<sub>3</sub>O)''ethane''(CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>).\n\n===Trivial name===\nIUPAC rules are often not followed for simple ethers. The trivial names for simple ethers (i.e., those with none or few other functional groups) are a composite of the two substituents followed by \"ether\".  For example, ethyl methyl ether (CH<sub>3</sub>OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), diphenylether (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OC<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>). As for other organic compounds, very common ethers acquired names before rules for nomenclature were formalized. Diethyl ether is simply called \"ether\", but was once called ''sweet oil of vitriol''. Methyl phenyl ether is [[anisole]], because it was originally found in [[aniseed]]. The [[aromatic]] ethers include [[furan]]s. [[Acetal]]s (\u03b1-alkoxy ethers R\u2013CH(\u2013OR)\u2013O\u2013R) are another class of ethers with characteristic properties.\n\n===Polyethers===\nPolyethers are compounds with more than one ether group. These have been used as impression materials in dentistry.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dental Materials- : Properties and Manipulation|last=Powers, John M.|date=2014|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323291507|oclc=912232266}}</ref>\n\nThe [[crown ether]]s are examples of small polyethers. Some toxins produced by [[dinoflagellate]]s such as [[brevetoxin]] and [[ciguatoxin]] are extremely large and are known as ''cyclic'' or ''ladder'' polyethers.\n\nPolyether generally refers to [[polymer]]s which contain the ether functional group in their main chain. The term [[polyol|glycol]] is reserved for low to medium range [[molar mass]] polymer when the nature of the [[end-group]], which is usually a [[hydroxyl]] group, still matters.

In general alkyl ethers form more readily than aryl ethers, with the later species often requiring metal catalysts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Frlan |first1=Rok |last2=Kikelj |first2=Danijel |title=Recent Progress in Diaryl Ether Synthesis |journal=Synthesis |date=29 June 2006 |volume=2006 |issue=14 |pages=2271\u20132285 |doi=10.1055/s-2006-942440}}</ref>\n\nThe synthesis of diethyl ether by a reaction between [[ethanol]] and [[sulfuric acid]] has been known since the 13th century.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Ether|volume=9|page=806}}</ref>\n\n===Dehydration of alcohols===\nThe [[dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[alcohol]]s affords ethers:<ref>{{cite book |title=Organic chemistry |last1=Clayden |last2=Greeves |last3=Warren |year=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-850346-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/129 129] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/organicchemistry00clay_0/page/129 }}</ref>\n: 2 R\u2013OH \u2192 R\u2013O\u2013R + [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] at high temperature\n\n[[Image:Symm2.svg|507px|center]]\n\nThis direct nucleophilic substitution reaction requires elevated temperatures (about 125&nbsp;\u00b0C). The reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually sulfuric acid. The method is effective for generating symmetrical ethers, but not unsymmetrical ethers, since either OH can be protonated, which would give a mixture of products. Diethyl ether is produced from ethanol by this method. Cyclic ethers are readily generated by this approach. Elimination reactions compete with dehydration of the alcohol:\n: R\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013CH<sub>2</sub>(OH) \u2192 R\u2013CH=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nThe dehydration route often requires conditions incompatible with delicate molecules. Several milder methods exist to produce ethers.\n\n===Williamson ether synthesis===\n[[Nucleophilic displacement]] of [[alkyl halide]]s by [[alkoxide]]s\n: R\u2013ONa + R\u2032\u2013X   \u2192   R\u2013O\u2013R\u2032 + Na[[Halide|X]]\nThis reaction is called the [[Williamson ether synthesis]]. It involves treatment of a parent [[alcohol]] with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] to form the alkoxide, followed by addition of an appropriate aliphatic compound bearing a suitable [[leaving group]] (R\u2013X). Suitable leaving groups (X) include [[iodide]], [[bromide]], or [[sulfonate]]s. This method usually does not work well for aryl halides (e.g. [[bromobenzene]], see Ullmann condensation below). Likewise, this method only gives the best yields for primary halides. Secondary and tertiary halides are prone to undergo E2 elimination on exposure to the basic alkoxide anion used in the reaction due to steric hindrance from the large alkyl groups.\n\nIn a related reaction, alkyl halides undergo nucleophilic displacement by [[phenoxide]]s. The R\u2013X cannot be used to react with the alcohol. However [[phenols]] can be used to replace the alcohol while maintaining the alkyl halide. Since phenols are acidic, they readily react with a strong [[Base (chemistry)|base]] like [[sodium hydroxide]] to form phenoxide ions. The phenoxide ion will then substitute the \u2013X group in the alkyl halide, forming an ether with an aryl group attached to it in a reaction with an [[SN2|S<sub>N</sub>2]] mechanism.\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH + OH<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\u2013O<sup>\u2212</sup> + R\u2013X   \u2192   C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OR\n\n===Ullmann condensation===\nThe [[Ullmann condensation]] is similar to the Williamson method except that the substrate is an aryl halide.  Such reactions generally require a catalyst, such as copper.\n\n===Electrophilic addition of alcohols to alkenes===\nAlcohols add to electrophilically activated [[alkene]]s.\n: [[alkene|R<sub>2</sub>C=CR<sub>2</sub>]] + R\u2013OH \u2192 R<sub>2</sub>CH\u2013C(\u2013O\u2013R)\u2013R<sub>2</sub>\n[[Acid]] [[catalysis]] is required for this reaction. Often, mercury trifluoroacetate (Hg(OCOCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>) is used as a catalyst for the reaction generating an ether with [[Markovnikov]] regiochemistry.  Using similar reactions, [[tetrahydropyranyl ether]]s are used as [[protective group]]s for alcohols.\n\n===Preparation of epoxides===\n{{main|epoxide}}\n[[Epoxide]]s are typically prepared by oxidation of alkenes.  The most important epoxide in terms of industrial scale is ethylene oxide, which is produced by oxidation of ethylene with oxygen.  Other epoxides are produced by one of two routes:\n* By the oxidation of alkenes with a [[peroxyacid]] such as [[Meta-Chloroperoxybenzoic acid|''m''-CPBA]].\n* By the base intramolecular nucleophilic substitution of a halohydrin.\n\n==Important ethers==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| [[File:Ethylene oxide chemical structure.png|50px|Chemical structure of ethylene oxide]]\n| [[Ethylene oxide]]\n| A cyclic ether.
