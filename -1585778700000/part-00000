The land had likely been observed by Bean while on a [[longhunter|long hunting]] excursion with [[Daniel Boone]] several years earlier. The outpost was situated at the intersection of the Old Wilderness Road, a north\u2013south path that roughly followed what is now [[U.S. Route 25E]], and the Old Stage Road, an east\u2013west path that roughly followed modern [[U.S. Route 11W]]. This crossroads location made Bean Station an important stopover for early travelers, and at least three taverns and inns were operating at the station by the early 1800s.<ref name=coffey>Ken Coffey, \"[http://www.beanstationtn.com/index.php/history-home/our-history History of Bean Station],\" Town of Bean Station official website.

Bean Station was held by a contingent of [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers under the command of General [[James M. Shackelford]]. After two days of fighting, Union forces were forced to retreat.<ref name=coffey />\n\nFollowing the war, a businessman named Samuel Tate constructed a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] hotel just west of Bean Station that became the focus of a resort known as Tate Springs. In the late 1870s, the hotel was purchased by Captain Thomas Tomlinson, who would transform the property into a vast resort that advertised the healing powers of its [[mineral spring]]s. At its height, the resort included over three dozen buildings, a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} park, and an 18-hole golf course, and attracted some of the wealthiest people in America. The resort declined during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and the hotel and most of its outbuildings have since been demolished. The [[Tate Springs Springhouse]] and its elaborate Victorian [[gazebo]] still stand just off Highway 11W, however.<ref name=coffey />\n\nThe construction of [[Cherokee Dam]] by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] several miles downstream along the [[Holston River]] in the early 1940s had drastically altered the city's layout. Many citizens were relocated and many houses and other structures were demolished. A large portion of the community was flooded, and at least one historical structure had to be relocated.<ref name=coffey />\n\nOn May 13, 1972, 14 people were killed in a head-on collision between a [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus and a tractor-trailer on U.S. Route 11W in Bean Station, which gave the U.S. Route 11W the nickname, \u201cBloody Highway 11W.\u201d<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://archive.knoxnews.com/news/local/blood-on-the-asphalt-11w-wreck-left-14-people-dead-ep-360225916-356724551.html/|title=Blood on the asphalt: 11W wreck left 14 people dead|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en}}</ref>\n\nBean Station was incorporated in November 1996.\n\nOn April 5, 2018, Southeastern Provisions, a cattle slaughterhouse near Bean Station<ref name=\"knoxnewsiceraidsgraingercountrymeatpackingplant\">{{cite news|last1=Dorman|first1=Travis|last2=Satterfield|first2=Jamie|title=ICE raids Grainger County meatpacking plant amid charges owners avoided $2.5M in payroll taxes|url=https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/crime/2018/04/05/ice-raids-meatpacking-plant-grainger-county/490673002/|accessdate=April 7, 2018|work=Knox News|date=April 5, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"abcnewsimmigrationraid\">{{cite news|last1=Burke|first1=Sheila|title=Immigration raid takes 97 into custody at Tennessee plant|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/immigration-raid-takes-97-custody-tennessee-plant-54296421|accessdate=April 7, 2018|work=ABC News|date=April 6, 2018}}</ref> was raided by [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE); 11 workers were arrested and 86 more were detained, all of whom were suspected of  [[Illegal immigration to the United States|residing in the United States unlawfully]].<ref name=\"knoxnewsiceraidsgraingercountrymeatpackingplant\"/> At the time, the raid was reportedly the largest workplace raid in US history.<ref name=\"abcnewsimmigrationraid\"/> In September 2018, the owner of the meatpacking facility was found guilty of multiple state and federal crimes, including [[tax evasion]], [[wire fraud]], employing immigrants not authorized to work in the US, and many other workplace violations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lakin|first=Matt|date=September 12, 2018|title=Bean Station ICE raid: Slaughterhouse owner pleads guilty to hiring undocumented workers\n|url=https://amp.knoxnews.com/amp/12600450020th |work=Knoxville News-Sentinel|location=Knoxville, Tennessee|access-date=2019-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wate.com/news/local-news/2018-grainger-county-ice-raid-subject-of-netflix-documentary/|title=2018 Grainger County ICE raid subject of Netflix documentary|date=2019-12-19|website=WATE 6 On Your Side|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-22}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBean Station is located in easternmost Grainger County, where it borders the unincorporated community of [[Mooresburg, Tennessee|Mooresburg]] at the county line between Grainger and [[Hawkins County, Tennessee|Hawkins]] counties.

The land had likely been observed by Bean while on a [[longhunter|long hunting]] excursion with [[Daniel Boone]] several years earlier. The outpost was situated at the intersection of the Old Wilderness Road, a north\u2013south path that roughly followed what is now [[U.S. Route 25E]], and the Old Stage Road, an east\u2013west path that roughly followed modern [[U.S. Route 11W]]. This crossroads location made Bean Station an important stopover for early travelers, and at least three taverns and inns were operating at the station by the early 1800s.<ref name=coffey>Ken Coffey, \"[http://www.beanstationtn.com/index.php/history-home/our-history History of Bean Station],\" Town of Bean Station official website.

Bean Station was held by a contingent of [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers under the command of General [[James M. Shackelford]]. After two days of fighting, Union forces were forced to retreat.<ref name=coffey />\n\nFollowing the war, a businessman named Samuel Tate constructed a large [[Victorian architecture|Victorian-style]] hotel just west of Bean Station that became the focus of a resort known as Tate Springs. In the late 1870s, the hotel was purchased by Captain Thomas Tomlinson, who would transform the property into a vast resort that advertised the healing powers of its [[mineral spring]]s. At its height, the resort included over three dozen buildings, a {{convert|100|acre|ha|adj=on}} park, and an 18-hole golf course, and attracted some of the wealthiest people in America. The resort declined during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], and the hotel and most of its outbuildings have since been demolished. The [[Tate Springs Springhouse]] and its elaborate Victorian [[gazebo]] still stand just off Highway 11W, however.<ref name=coffey />\n\nThe construction of [[Cherokee Dam]] by the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] several miles downstream along the [[Holston River]] in the early 1940s had drastically altered the city\u2019s layout.

The mayor of Beach is Henry Gerving.\n\n==History==\nBeach was first settled around 1900. It was named for Captain [[Warren C. Beach]] of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[11th Infantry]]. Beach had led an expedition of railroad surveyors through the area in 1880. The post office was established in 1902, and the town was incorporated first as a village in 1908 and as a city in 1909. It was named the [[county seat]] of [[Golden Valley County, North Dakota|Golden Valley County]] in 1912.<ref name=wick/>\n\nIn April 1911, the then ex-president and long term fixture of the Badlands region, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], made his last trip to the area, stopping in Beach and nearby [[Medora, North Dakota|Medora]]. His visit to Medora passed without incident, but the visit to Beach was marred by a strongly negative reception to Roosevelt's speech. He first expressed surprise that the town of Beach even existed, based upon such marginal land. This was undoubtedly due to the lack of flora and fauna, the wear and strain he endured in the 10 years he ranched in the area, and Rocky Mountain and Great Plains blizzard of 1886\u20137.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/grko/winter.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414231035/http://www.nps.gov/archive/grko/winter.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}</ref><ref>http://www.charlierussell.org/lastofthe5000.htm</ref><ref>http://www.charlierussell.org/big_dieup.htm</ref> Roosevelt's speech had a strong conservationist element, suggesting to local ranchers there should only be one cow for every {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land, which led to local disenchantment with the president.\n\nThe incident is likely to have critically influenced his commentary and estrangement with the region, culminating in October 1918. While giving a morale speech regarding [[World War I]] in then strongly anti-war North Dakota, a side trip to the Badlands was suggested. Roosevelt demurred, stating \"[i]t is a mistake for one to hit the back trail after many years have passed.  One finds things have changed, the old picture destroyed, the romance gone . . . It's best that it should be so, but I don't want to see the place again. I'd rather try and remember it as it was.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.com/Book_TR_Guide_Essays.asp#10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121052626/http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.com/Book_TR_Guide_Essays.asp |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nBeach is located in western North Dakota along the border with [[Montana]].

The mayor of Beach is Henry Gerving.\n\n==History==\nBeach was first settled around 1900. It was named for Captain [[Warren C. Beach]] of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[11th Infantry]]. Beach had led an expedition of railroad surveyors through the area in 1880. The post office was established in 1902, and the town was incorporated first as a village in 1908 and as a city in 1909. It was named the [[county seat]] of [[Golden Valley County, North Dakota|Golden Valley County]] in 1912.<ref name=wick/>\n\nIn April 1911, the then ex-president and long term fixture of the Badlands region, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], made his last trip to the area, stopping in Beach and nearby [[Medora, North Dakota|Medora]]. His visit to Medora passed without incident, but the visit to Beach was marred by a strongly negative reception to Roosevelt's speech. He first expressed surprise that the town of Beach even existed, based upon such marginal land. This was undoubtedly due to the lack of flora and fauna, the wear and strain he endured in the 10 years he ranched in the area, and Rocky Mountain and Great Plains blizzard of 1886-7.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/grko/winter.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=September 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414231035/http://www.nps.gov/archive/grko/winter.htm |archivedate=April 14, 2009 }}</ref><ref>http://www.charlierussell.org/lastofthe5000.htm</ref><ref>http://www.charlierussell.org/big_dieup.htm</ref> Roosevelt's speech had a strong conservationist element, suggesting to local ranchers there should only be one cow for every {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land, which led to local disenchantment with the president.\n\nThe incident is likely to have critically influenced his commentary and estrangement with the region, culminating in October 1918. While giving a morale speech regarding [[World War I]] in then strongly anti-war North Dakota, a side trip to the Badlands was suggested. Roosevelt demurred, stating \"[i]t is a mistake for one to hit the back trail after many years have passed.  One finds things have changed, the old picture destroyed, the romance gone . . . It's best that it should be so, but I don't want to see the place again.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\".

Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be allowed to get tested, and prioritized loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Paula |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{cite news |last1=Obermeier |first1=Ludwig |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe more a pandemic has spread, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests because the healthcare system becomes overburdened.<ref name=\"Focus2403\"/>\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of up to five and ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\"/>\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.

Personal quarantine is overseen by the local health agencies. By doing so, authorities are trying to keep infection chains short, leading to curtailed clusters. In the ''protection stage'' the strategy will change to using direct measures to protect vulnerable persons from becoming infected. The ''mitigation stage'' will eventually try to avoid spikes of intensive treatment in order to maintain medical services.\n\n===Criticism===\nAs early as January 2013, the German [[Bundestag]] was fully informed about the dangers of the global spread of a Corona virus pandemic. A risk analysis predicted how dangerous a global coronavirus outbreak could be. It was described as: \"Children [\u2026] have [\u2026] minor disease progressions\", \"the risk of death of \"over-65-year-olds [is] at 50%\". A \"vaccine\" is \"unavailable\" - all the more important is the \"use of protective equipment such as protective masks, goggles and gloves\".

Germans without any or unspecific symptoms could not be tested until late March. On 25 March 2020, the Robert Koch Institute announced that people no longer needed to come from risk areas to be allowed to get tested, and prioritized loosened restrictions to test health care workers.<ref name=\"Focus2503\">{{cite news |last1=Schneider |first1=Paula |title=Statistikerin fordert Tests, die endlich das wahre Corona-Ausma\u00df in Deutschland zeigen |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/es-grassiert-ungewissheit-repraesentative-tests-sollen-wahres-ausmass-in-deutschland-zeigen_id_11813688.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> RKI criticised that too many people without symptoms were tested.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI kassiert Kriterium f\u00fcr Corona-Tests |url=https://www.n-tv.de/panorama/RKI-kassiert-Kriterium-fuer-Corona-Tests-article21667740.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=ntv |date=25 March 2020}}</ref> On 26 March, virologist Streeck said that testing labs were at the limit of their capacity.<ref name=\"Focus2703\">{{cite news |last1=Obermeier |first1=Ludwig |title=Zahlen-Chaos: Bonner Virologe zeigt mit 3 Beispielen, warum wir im Corona-Dilemma stecken |url=https://www.focus.de/gesundheit/news/covid-19-pandemie-top-virologe-wir-stecken-in-einem-dilemma-weil-uns-entscheidende-daten-fehlen_id_11811994.html |accessdate=27 March 2020 |publisher=Focus |date=26 March 2020}}</ref>\nThe more a pandemic has spread, the harder it becomes to increase the number of tests because the healthcare system becomes overburdened.<ref name=\"Focus2403\"/>\n\n====Reporting lag====\nIncubation period, and turn around time of the only diagnostic test (PCR) can lead to a reporting lag of up to five and ten days.<ref name=\"Focus2503\"/>\n\nBecause of the federal health care system in Germany, states vary in data collection, aggregation and time of release to the public. Regional health departments initially reported data to the state health department which transferred data to the federal health department, many but not all on the day of receiving them. Reporting switched from manual to electronic. The Robert Koch Institute releases official numbers with an additional delay of several days. Cases reported by federal health departments are added earlier to a project by [[Funke Mediengruppe]], to which [[Berliner Morgenpost]] belongs. [[Johns Hopkins University]] seems to use the numbers of the Funke project for Germany indirectly while the Funke project uses numbers of Johns Hopkins University for other countries.<ref>{{cite news |title=RKI rechtfertigt sich \u2013 und h\u00e4lt sich bei einer Frage konsequent zur\u00fcck |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article206783949/Coronavirus-RKI-rechtfertigt-sich-und-haelt-sich-dann-konsequent-zurueck.html |accessdate=25 March 2020 |publisher=Welt |date=25 March 2020 |ref=WELT2503}}</ref>\n\nThe number of unknown cases could be tenfold according to some virologists.
