Chase''' (1843\u20131914) was a [[Union Army]] soldier in the [[American Civil War]] and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration, the [[Medal of Honor]]. An artilleryman, Chase earned the medal by continuing to work his cannon despite intense [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] fire at the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]]. He later participated in the Battle of Gettysburg and was severely wounded, losing his right arm, by a Confederate artillery shell. After the war, Chase worked as an inventor before moving to the [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], area. In Florida, he was involved in various business pursuits, including an attempt to form a retirement community for former soldiers in Veteran City, today known as [[Gulfport, Florida|Gulfport]].\n\n==Battle of Chancellorsville==\nChase joined the Army from [[Augusta, Maine]], and by May 3, 1863, was serving as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the [[5th Maine Battery|5th Battery, Maine Light Artillery]].<ref name=\"citation\">{{cite web |title=Civil War Medal of Honor recipients (A\u2013L) |work=Medal of Honor citations |publisher= [[United States Army Center of Military History]] |date=January 27, 2009 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwaral.html |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}</ref> On that day, during the Battle of Chancellorsville, his unit was ordered to move forward through heavy fire, set up their six cannons, and commence firing on the Confederate forces. Confederate artillery had been established on a ridge {{convert|600|ft|m}} away, and the guns poured heavy fire onto the 5th Maine's designated position. Within thirty minutes of setting up their own cannons, half of the men in Chase's battery were dead. Soon, all of the battery's officers had been killed or wounded and Chase's cannon was one of only two that were still operational. Lieutenant [[Edmund Kirby (army officer)|Edmund Kirby]] from the 1st U.S. Battery arrived to take command of the 5th Maine. Immediately after reaching Chase's gun, a Confederate shell exploded nearby and struck Kirby in the hip, leaving him incapacitated. As he lay beside the cannon, Chase asked if he wanted to be taken from the field, and Kirby replied, \"No, not as long as a gun can be fired.\"<ref name=\"DoV157\">Beyer, 157\u2013158</ref>\n\nEventually, Chase and another man, Corporal James Lebroke, were the only members of the battery still standing. Together, they continued to fire their cannon, with Chase sponging and ramming the [[Muzzle (firearm)|muzzle]], despite sustained fire from the Confederate artillery and approaching infantry. The gun was finally disabled when it was hit directly in the muzzle by a Confederate shell; the damage prevented Chase and Lebroke from reloading the weapon. Chase again asked Lieutenant Kirby if he wanted to be carried from the field, and Kirby replied, \"No, not until the guns are taken off.\"<ref name=\"DoV157\"/>\n\nStationed next to the 5th Maine Battery during the battle was the [[116th Pennsylvania Infantry]] of the [[Irish Brigade (U.S.)|Irish Brigade]]. Seeing that their position was about to be overrun, Second Lieutenant [[Louis J. Sacriste]], in command of the 116th Pennsylvania's Company D, led his men through the smoke and enemy fire to reach the 5th Maine.<ref name=\"DoV155\">Beyer, 155\u2013156</ref> While Chase and Lebroke lifted the rear of their cannon, Sacriste and his company attached ropes to the front and pulled the gun from the field.<ref name=\"DoV157\"/> The rest of the 116th Pennsylvania and then the whole Irish Brigade joined in, pulling all of the cannons and [[Caisson (military)|caissons]] to safety.<ref name=\"DoV155\"/>\n\nSatisfied that the cannons were out of the Confederates' reach, Chase returned to the field, picked up Lieutenant Kirby, and carried him to the rear. Before Chase left, Kirby took down his and Lebroke's names and stated \"If ever two men have earned a Medal of Honor, you have, and you shall have it.\"<ref name=\"DoV157\"/> Kirby died of his wounds three weeks later.<ref>{{cite book |last=Warner |first=Ezra J. |title=Generals in Blue: Lives of the Union Commanders |publisher=LSU Press |year=1964 |page=271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2PSgcaLic-AC |isbn=978-0-8071-0822-2 }}</ref>\n\nFor these actions, Chase was awarded the Medal of Honor several decades later, on February 7, 1888.<ref name=\"citation\"/> Louis Sacriste was also awarded the medal, in part for his actions in saving the 5th Maine Battery's cannons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil War Medal of Honor recipients (M\u2013Z) |work=Medal of Honor citations |publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]] |date=January 27, 2009 |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwarmz.html |accessdate=2009-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223063700/http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/civwarmz.html |archivedate=February 23, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nChase's official Medal of Honor citation reads:\n<blockquote>Nearly all the officers and men of the battery having been killed or wounded, this soldier with a comrade continued to fire his gun after the guns had ceased.

The 5th Maine Battery was a part of General [[John F. Reynolds]]' [[I Corps (Union Army)|I Corps]] and fought at Seminary Hill on the first day of the battle, July 1, 1863. As the Confederates advanced, the corps fell back past the town of Gettysburg, with Chase's battery taking up a position on a knoll between [[Culp's Hill]] and [[Cemetery Hill]]. On the battle's third day, July 3, the Confederates launched an assault on Cemetery Hill. Chase's battery fired with devastating effect on the attacking infantry, and in response, three or four Confederate batteries began targeting the 5th Maine's position.<ref name=\"DoV159\">Beyer, 159</ref>\n\nA Confederate shell exploded near where Chase was standing. The blast took off his right arm, destroyed his left eye, and sent forty-eight pieces of shrapnel into his body. He was carried, unconscious, to the rear and left for dead. Two days later, his body was loaded onto a wagon along with many others to be buried. The wagon driver heard him moan, pulled him out from among the dead bodies, and gave him a drink of water. The first words Chase said were \"Did we win the battle?\".<ref name=\"DoV159\"/>\n\nChase was taken to an Army hospital set up on a farm outside of Gettysburg and lain down beside a barn. The doctors there ignored him, thinking that he would die any minute, while they tended to other patients. After three days of lying on the ground, his wounds were bandaged and he was eventually moved into the farmhouse, where he stayed for a week. Sent to Seminary Hospital, his condition was still grim and about three weeks after arriving, he was again set outside to die. Despite the doctor's predictions, Chase survived his wounds. Following three months at Seminary Hospital, he was taken to West [[Philadelphia]] Hospital, where he stayed until he was well enough to return home to Augusta.<ref name=\"DoV159\"/>\n\n==Post-war life==\nAfter the war, he returned to Maine and worked as an inventor, receiving dozens of [[patent]]s for his work.

Her book ''Washington Rollercoaster'' recounted the Gotliebs' years as glamorous hosts in Washington during the [[Reagan Era]], when she wrote a much-read column for the ''[[Washington Post]]''. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine called her a \"sparkling hostess\", and in Washington she quickly became known for her irreverent attitude and sharp tongue. She often attracted attention with remarks considered out-of-character for diplomatic wives. Referring to Canada's image in America as a dull northern neighbour, she remarked: \"Maybe we should invade South Dakota\".\n\nIn 1986, she attracted a blaze of international publicity when reporter [[Juliet O'Neill]] caught her slapping her social secretary Connie Gibson Connors at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and U.S. Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The incident, while criticized, made her one of the most talked-about women in Washington, and invitations to the Gotliebs' parties became highly coveted.\n\nAfter she and her husband returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to [[Toronto]]'s exclusive [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] neighbourhood and became the centre of establishment society in that city. Allan joined numerous corporate boards, including [[Conrad Black]]'s [[Hollinger Inc.]], while Sondra began writing columns for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and later the ''[[National Post]]'', which was owned by Conrad Black.\n\nShe won the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour|Stephen Leacock Prize]] for her 1978 novel, ''True Confections'', which was subtitled, ''Or How My Family Arranged My Marriage''.\n\nIn 2001, she alluded to the infamous \"Slap Flap\" incident in a series of articles about her recent facelift, published in the ''National Post''. Gotlieb recounted how the idea for cosmetic surgery first came to her after a visit with friends in Washington D.C. \"One of them said to me, 'It must be nice living in Toronto. You can slop around without having to bother too much about your appearance. Canadians have such old-fashioned values.' For the second time in my life I felt like slapping someone's face.\"\n\nHer regular column in the ''[[National Post]]'' continued until 2015. \n\nShe resides in the Toronto neighbourhood of [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]].\n\n==Family==\n\nGotlieb (n\u00e9e Kaufman) and husband Allan were married in 1955. They had three children: Rebecca (born in 1958), Marc (born in 1959), and Rachel (born in 1962).\n\nRebecca, a lawyer, was married to Keith Ham, also a lawyer, but they separated and divorced a few years after the adoption of son David in 1992. She subsequently married journalist [[Matthew Fraser (journalist)|Matthew Fraser]], former Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[National Post]]'' and television host.

Her book ''Washington Rollercoaster'' recounted the Gotliebs' years as glamorous hosts in Washington during the [[Reagan Era]], when she wrote a much-read column for the ''[[Washington Post]]''. ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine called her a \"sparkling hostess\", and in Washington she quickly became known for her irreverent attitude and sharp tongue. She often attracted attention with remarks considered out-of-character for diplomatic wives. Referring to Canada's image in America as a dull northern neighbour, she remarked: \"Maybe we should invade South Dakota\".\n\nIn 1986, she attracted a blaze of international publicity when reporter [[Juliet O'Neill]] caught her slapping her social secretary Connie Gibson Connors at an official dinner she and her husband were hosting in honour of the Canadian prime minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and U.S. Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]]. The incident, while criticized, made her one of the most talked-about women in Washington, and invitations to the Gotliebs' parties became highly coveted.\n\nAfter she and her husband returned to Canada in the early 1990s, they moved to [[Toronto]]'s exclusive [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] neighbourhood and became the centre of establishment society in that city. Allan joined numerous corporate boards, including [[Conrad Black]]'s [[Hollinger Inc.]], while Sondra began writing columns for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' and later the ''[[National Post]]'', which was owned by Conrad Black.\n\nShe won the [[Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour|Stephen Leacock Prize]] for her 1978 novel, ''True Confections'', which was subtitled, ''Or How My Family Arranged My Marriage''.\n\nIn 2001, she alluded to the infamous \"Slap Flap\" incident in a series of articles about her recent facelift, published in the ''National Post''. Gotlieb recounted how the idea for cosmetic surgery first came to her after a visit with friends in Washington D.C. \"One of them said to me, 'It must be nice living in Toronto. You can slop around without having to bother too much about your appearance. Canadians have such old-fashioned values.' For the second time in my life I felt like slapping someone's face.\"\n\nHer regular column in the ''[[National Post]]'' continued until 2015. \n\nShe resides in the Toronto neighbourhood of [[Rosedale, Toronto|Rosedale]] with her husband, [[Allan Gotlieb]].\n\n==Family==\n\nGotlieb (n\u00e9e Kaufman) and husband Allan were married in 1955. They had three children: Rebecca (born in 1958), Marc (born in 1959), and Rachel (born in 1962).\n\nRebecca, a lawyer, was married to Keith Ham, also a lawyer, but they separated and divorced a few years after the adoption of son David in 1992. She subsequently married journalist [[Matthew Fraser (journalist)|Matthew Fraser]], former Editor-in-Chief of the ''[[National Post]]'' and television host. In early 2003, she died suddenly after a recurrence of liver cancer.\n\nMarc, an art historian and former [[University of Toronto]] professor, is married to Lauren Freeman. They have three children.\n\nRachel is married to lawyer Rob Dickson and they have two children.

Each use their own powers to help protect the citizens of their land, clean the planet, and make the world a better place.\n\nEach episode begins with a problem with nature seen on Earth. A rainbow is sent to Kaleidoscopia and Kalia calls all seven rangers and Floof to her. After they are shown the nature problem, Kalia chooses the three ideal rangers for the mission, Floof always joins the three on their scooters. When the mission is completed, the three rangers return to Kaleidoscopia on their scooters.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Main Characters ===\n* Rosie Redd (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the leader. She represents the color Red, and possesses Strength Power. \n* Mandarin \"Mandy\" Orange (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the cheerleader of the group. She represents the color Orange, and possesses Music Power. \n* Anna Banana (voiced by Juliette Crosbie) is naive and sweet who can talk to animals. She represents the color Yellow, and possesses Animal Power. She carries a yellow stuffed rabbit, Mr. Stuffie Wuffie, which is used for comforting animals.\n* Pepper Mintz (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is a shy, introverted bookworm who loves to read. She represents the color Green, and possesses Inviso Power. \n* Bonnie \"B.B.\" Blueberry (voiced by [[Zehra Naqvi|Zehra Jane Naqvi]]) is analytical and smart. She always says that things are logical or illogical. She represents the color Blue, and possesses Vision Power.\n* Indigo \"Indy\" Allfruit (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) has super speed, and is a prankster. She represents the color Indigo, and possesses Speed Power.\n* Lavender LaViolette (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) is a fashionista. She represents the color Violet, and possesses Micro Power.\n* Floof (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the Rangers' pet Prismacorn (according to B.B.). He accompanies them on their mission and helps out by using his magical horn. There is a running gag where Floof comes out of his door in a surprising or funny way.\n* Kalia (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the leader of Kaleidoscopia and when she sees trouble in the world she calls the rangers to the rescue.\n\n=== Villains ===\n* Preston Praxton (voiced by Dan Russell) is the Rangers' main antagonist. A greedy entrepreneur, he schemes with no regard for any environmental impact, causing the Rangers to try and stop him. He has a seemingly endless supply of booby traps to keep the Rangers from interfering with his business.\n* Patty Praxton (voiced by Zehra Jane Naqvi) is Preston's daughter, and while she does take after her money-loving father, she often serves as his voice of reason, and is on friendlier terms with the Rangers.\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2016, Genius Brands announced that they were partnering with ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Flypaper (2011 film)|Flypaper]]'' director [[Rob Minkoff]] and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' writer Shane Morris on their new ''Rainbow Rangers'' series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Terry|first1=Joshua|title=TV News Roundup: Leah Remini Developing Scientology Series;

Each use their own powers to help protect the citizens of their land, clean the planet, and make the world a better place.\n\nEach episode begins with a problem with nature seen on Earth. A rainbow is sent to Kaleidoscopia and Kalia calls all seven rangers and Floof to her. After they are shown the nature problem, Kalia chooses the three ideal rangers for the mission, Floof always joins the three on their scooters. When the mission is completed, the three rangers return to Kaleidoscopia on their scooters.\n\n==Characters==\n=== Main Characters ===\n* Rosie Redd (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the leader. She represents the color Red, and possesses Strength Power. \n* Mandarin \"Mandy\" Orange (voiced by Aileen Mythen) is the cheerleader of the group. She represents the color Orange, and possesses Music Power. \n* Anna Banana (voiced by Juliette Crosbie) is naive and sweet who can talk to animals. She represents the color Yellow, and possesses Animal Power. She carries a yellow stuffed rabbit, Mr. Stuffie Wuffie, which is used for comforting animals.\n* Pepper Mintz (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is a shy, introverted bookworm who loves to read. She represents the color Green, and possesses Inviso Power. \n* Bonnie \"B.B.\" Blueberry (voiced by [[Zehra Naqvi|Zehra Jane Naqvi]]) is analytical and smart. She always says that things are logical or illogical. She represents the color Blue, and possesses Vision Power.\n* Indigo \"Indy\" Allfruit (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) has super speed, and is a prankster. She represents the color Indigo, and possesses Speed Power.\n* Lavender LaViolette (voiced by Penelope Rawlins) is a fashionista. She represents the color Violet, and possesses Micro Power.\n* Floof (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the Rangers' pet Prismacorn (according to B.B.). He accompanies them on their mission and helps out by using his magical horn. There is a running gag where Floof comes out of his door in a surprising or funny way.\n* Kalia (voiced by Phillipa Alexander) is the leader of Kaleidoscopia and when she sees trouble in the world she calls the rangers to the rescue.\n\n=== Villains ===\n* Preston Praxton (voiced by Dan Russell) is the Rangers' main antagonist. A greedy entrepreneur, he schemes with no regard for any environmental impact, causing the Rangers to try and stop him. He has a seemingly endless supply of booby traps to keep the Rangers from interfering with his business.\n* Patty Praxton (voiced by Zehra Jane Naqvi) is Preston's daughter, and while she does take after her money-loving father, she often serves as his voice of reason, and is on friendlier terms with the Rangers.\n\n==Production==\nIn September 2016, Genius Brands announced that they were partnering with ''[[The Lion King]]'' and ''[[Flypaper (2011 film)|Flypaper]]'' director [[Rob Minkoff]] and ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' writer Shane Morris on their new ''Rainbow Rangers'' series.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Terry|first1=Joshua|title=TV News Roundup: Leah Remini Developing Scientology Series;

His literary output was prolific. He wrote twenty-four novels, ten collections of short stories, three plays, two biographies, two volumes of critical essays, and five books on the languages of the ''Kandha'', ''Gadaba'' and ''Saora'' tribes of Odisha. He translated Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (''Yuddh O Shanti''), in three volumes, 1985\u201386), and Rabindranath Tagore's ''Jogajog'', (1965), into Odia.\n\n'' Paraja '' (1945) is a story based on the life of a tribal community.

The trend which Fakir Mohan Senapati had started developed after the 1950s. Gopinath Mohanty, [[Surendra Mohanty]] and [[Manoj Das]] are considered the three literary jewels of this period. They were pioneers of a new trend, namely, that of developing or projecting the \"individual as protagonist\" in Odia fiction. Another of Gopinath's stories, 'Pimpudi' has had great influence.

The first three have been translated by Bikram K. Das, the fourth by [[Bidhu Bhusan Das]], [[Prabhat Nalini Das]] and [[Oopali Operajita]]; and the last, by Arun Kumar Mohanty. The English version of ''Paraja'' was published by Faber and Faber (UK) and Oxford University Press (India) in 1987. ''The Survivor'', the English translation of ''Danapani'', was published by Macmillan India Limited in 1995. ''\"Amrutara Santana'' - The Dynasty of The Immortals,\" has been published by the Central [[Sahitya Akademi]] in 2016. The translation of ''Laya Bilaya'' which bears the title,'' High Tide, Ebb Tide'', has been published by ''Lark Books''.  ''The Ancestor'', the translation of Gopinath\u2019s ''Dadi Budha'', has been brought out by the ''Sahitya Akademi''. Besides, a number of short stories of Gopinath have also been translated. It is extremely difficult to render in English the nuances of Gopinath Mohanty\u2019s language. However, translators have attempted to convey the richness and complexity of the original texts to readers unfamiliar with Odia.\n\n==Awards==\nMohanty received the Visuva Milan citation in 1950.

The trend which Fakir Mohan Senapati had started developed after the 1950s. Gopinath Mohanty, [[Surendra Mohanty]] and [[Manoj Das]] are considered the three literary jewels of this period. They were pioneers of a new trend, namely, that of developing or projecting the \"individual as protagonist\" in Odia fiction. Another of Gopinath's stories, 'Pimpudi' has had great influence. It is the story of a forest officer checking rice smuggling to Madras.<ref>Istahar-92, (26th Volume, 2nd Issue)</ref><ref name=\"Mohanty 1989 p.8 \">{{cite book | last=Mohanty | first=J.M. | title=Into Another Intensity: Essays on Oriya Literature | publisher=Post-Graduate Department of English, Utkal University | year=1989 | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=NgswAAAAMAAJ | access-date=2020-04-21 | page=8|quote=The story Pimpudi for example , where a young officer goes to the mountainous southern border of Orissa to check rice - smuggling in a tribal market , explores the depth of individual consciousness in a vision of vast expanse.}}</ref>\n\n==Translations==\nFive of Gopinath's novels, ''Paraja'', ''Danapani'', ''Laya Bilaya'', ''Amrutara Santana'', and ''Dadi Budha'', have been translated into English. The first three have been translated by Bikram K. Das, the fourth by [[Bidhu Bhusan Das]], [[Prabhat Nalini Das]] and [[Oopali Operajita]]; and the last, by Arun Kumar Mohanty. The English version of ''Paraja'' was published by Faber and Faber (UK) and Oxford University Press (India) in 1987. ''The Survivor'', the English translation of ''Danapani'', was published by Macmillan India Limited in 1995. ''\"Amrutara Santana'' - The Dynasty of The Immortals,\" has been published by the Central [[Sahitya Akademi]] in 2016. The translation of ''Laya Bilaya'' which bears the title,'' High Tide, Ebb Tide'', has been published by ''Lark Books''.  ''The Ancestor'', the translation of Gopinath\u2019s ''Dadi Budha'', has been brought out by the ''Sahitya Akademi''. Besides, a number of short stories of Gopinath have also been translated. It is extremely difficult to render in English the nuances of Gopinath Mohanty\u2019s language. However, translators have attempted to convey the richness and complexity of the original texts to readers unfamiliar with Odia.\n\n==Awards==\nMohanty received the Visuva Milan citation in 1950. He won the first central [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] in 1955 for his novel, ''Amrutara Santana''.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}.
