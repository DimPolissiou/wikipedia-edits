His [[ballad]]s were very popular in Germany. His most noted ballad, ''[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]'', found an audience beyond readers of the [[German language]] in an [[English language|English]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] adaptation and a [[French language|French]] translation.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Molmerswende]] (now a part of [[Mansfeld]]), [[Principality of Halberstadt]], where his father was the [[Lutheran]] pastor.\nHe showed an early predilection for solitary and gloomy places and the making of verses, for which he had no other model than hymnals. At the age of twelve, B\u00fcrger was practically adopted by his maternal grandfather, Bauer, at [[Aschersleben]], who sent him to the P\u00e4dagogium at [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]]. He learned Latin with difficulty. In 1764 he passed to the [[University of Halle]], as a student of [[theology]], which, however, he soon abandoned for the study of [[jurisprudence]]. There he fell under the influence of [[Christian Adolph Klotz]] (1738\u20131771), who directed B\u00fcrger's attention to literature and encouraged his natural disposition to a wild and unregulated life. In consequence of his dissipated habits, he was in 1767 recalled by his grandfather, but on promising to reform was in 1768 allowed to enter the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]] as a [[law]] student.\n\nAs he continued his wild career, however, his grandfather withdrew his support and he was left to his own devices. Meanwhile, he had made fair progress with his legal studies, and had the good fortune to form a close friendship with a number of young men of literary tastes. He studied the ancient [[classics]] and the best works in French, Italian, Spanish and English, particularly [[Shakespeare]], and the old English and Scottish ballads. [[Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]]'s ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' was his constant companion. In the [[G\u00f6ttinger Musenalmanach|G\u00f6ttingen ''Musenalmanach'']], edited by [[Heinrich Christian Boie]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gotter]], B\u00fcrger's first poems were published, and by 1771 he had already become widely known as a poet. In 1772, through Boie's influence, B\u00fcrger obtained the post of ''[[Amtmann]]'' or district magistrate at [[Altengleichen]] near G\u00f6ttingen. His grandfather was now reconciled to him, paid his debts and established him in his new sphere of activity.\n\n[[Image:Die Gartenlaube 1874 Auguste Leonhart.jpg|thumb|right|Auguste Leonhart, sister of B\u00fcrger's wife, and the \u201cMolly\u201d of his poetry.]]\n[[Image:Die Gartenlaube 1874 Dorette B\u00fcrger.jpg|thumb|Dorette B\u00fcrger, after a pastel drawing by her sister Auguste in 1781.]]\nMeanwhile, he kept in touch with his G\u00f6ttingen friends, and when the ''G\u00f6ttinger Bund'' or \"Hain\" (\"[[G\u00f6ttinger Hainbund]]\") was formed, B\u00fcrger, though not himself a member, kept in close touch with it.

He appeared to lose at once all courage and all bodily and mental vigour. He still continued to teach in G\u00f6ttingen; at the jubilee of the foundation of the university in 1787 he was made an honorary doctor of philosophy, and in 1789 was appointed [[extraordinary professor]] in that faculty, though without a stipend.

Among his purely lyrical poems, but few have earned a lasting reputation; but mention may be made of ''Das Bl\u00fcmchen Wunderhold'', ''Lied an den lieben Mond'', and a few love songs. His [[sonnet]]s, particularly the elegies, are of great beauty.

Henceforth each of these schools was to be managed by a [[board of governors]]. The following year, the headmaster of [[Uppingham School]] invited sixty to seventy of his fellow headmasters to form what became the Headmasters' Conference \u2013 later the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]. Separate [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory (or \"prep\") schools]] developed from the 1830s, which \"prepared\" younger boys for entry to the senior schools; as a result the latter began limiting entry to boys who had reached 12 or 13 years of age.\n\n[[File:Eton College by Loggan 1690 - R - slpl ste02048 merge.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A bird's eye view of [[Eton College]] by [[David Loggan]], published in his ''Cantabrigia Illustrata'' of 1690]]\n\nUntil the [[late medieval period]] most schools were controlled by the church and had specific entrance criteria; others were restricted to the sons of members of guilds, trades or [[livery companies]]. From the 16th century onward, boys' boarding schools were founded or endowed for public use.<ref name=\"Oxford English Dictionary 2010\">Oxford English Dictionary, June 2010.</ref> Traditionally, most of these public schools were all-boys and full [[boarding school|boarding]]. Some independent schools are particularly old, such as [[The King's School, Canterbury]] (founded 597), [[The King's School, Rochester]] (founded 604), [[St Peter's School, York]] (founded c. 627), [[Sherborne School]] (founded c. 710, refounded 1550 by [[Edward VI]]), [[Warwick School]] (c. 914), [[The King's School, Ely]] (c. 970) and [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]] (948).\n\nSeparate [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory schools]] (or \"prep schools\") for younger boys developed from the 1830s, with entry to the senior schools becoming limited to boys of at least 12 or 13 years old.

Protests in the local newspaper forced governors of the Perse School to keep it open, and a court case in 1837 required reform of the abuse of the school's [[charitable trust|trust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perse.co.uk/about-us/history/|title=History \u2013 Almost 400 years old|publisher=The Perse School}}</ref>\n\n==Victorian period==\nA [[Royal Commission]], the [[Clarendon Commission]] (1861\u20131864), investigated nine of the more established schools, including seven boarding schools ([[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], [[Westminster school|Westminster]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]]) and two day schools ([[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]] and the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors']]).{{sfnp|Shrosbree|1988|p=12}}\n\nThe [[Public Schools Act 1868]] regulated and reformed these \"public schools\", for which it provided the first legal definition: schools which were open to the paying public from anywhere in the country, as opposed to, for example, a local school only open to local residents, or a religious school open only to members of a certain church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter01.html|title=Education in England: a brief history |work=Education in England}}</ref> St Paul's School and the Merchant Taylors' School claimed successfully that their constitutions made them \"private\" schools, and were excluded from the requirements of this legislation.{{sfnp|Shrosbree|1988|p=118}} In 1887 the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal determined that the [[City of London School]] was a public school.<ref>''Blake v The Mayor and Citizens of the City of London'' [1887] L.R. 19 Q.B.D. 79.</ref>\n\nThe [[Taunton Commission]] was then appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed [[grammar school]]s, and produced recommendations to restructure their endowments; these recommendations were included, in modified form, in the [[Endowed Schools Act 1869]]. [[ Edward Thring]] wrote to 37 headmasters of what he considered leading boys' schools not covered by the Public Schools Act, inviting them to meet annually to address the threat posed by the Endowed Schools Act. In the first year 12 headmasters attended,  in the following year 34 attended, including headteachers from the Clarendon schools. The [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|Headmasters' Conference]] (HMC, now the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) has grown steadily to include over 200 schools.{{sfnp|Walford|1986|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe ''Public Schools Yearbook'' was published for the first time in 1889, listing 30 schools, mostly boarding schools. The day school exceptions were St Paul's School and Merchant Taylors' School. Some academically successful grammar schools have been added in later editions.

The [[direct grant grammar school]] would receive partial state funding in return for taking between 25 and 50 percent of its pupils from state primary schools.{{sfnp|Donnison|1970|p=49}} \n\nThe Fleming Committee recommended that one-quarter of the places at public schools should be assigned to a national bursary scheme for children who would benefit from boarding. The key advocate was [[Ellen Wilkinson]], but it got off to a slow start in an age of severe budget constraints. The Conservative Government elected in 1951 did not expand the programme. It failed because it was not a high priority for either party, money was tight, there was wavering support from independent boarding schools and local education authorities, and no consensus was reached on how to select the pupils to participate.<ref>[[Nick Hillman|Nicholas Hillman]], \"Public schools and the Fleming report of 1944: shunting the first-class carriage on to an immense siding?.\" ''History of Education'' 41#2 (2012): 235\u2013255.</ref>\n\nThe Labour government in 1965 made major changes to the organisation of maintained schools, directing local authorities to phase out [[Circular 10/65|selection at eleven]].

This was often for long uninterrupted periods of a year or more. The 19th-century public school ethos promoted ideas of service to Crown and Empire, familiar sentiments such as \"it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game\" and \"the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\". The latter sometimes but probably wrongly attributed to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]. Many ex-pupils, like those from other schools, had, and still have, a nostalgic affection for their old schools ([[George Orwell]] remembered being \"interested and happy\" at Eton,<ref>Buddicom, Jacintha. ''Eric and Us''. Finlay Publisher. 2006: p. 58</ref>) and a [[School tie|public school tie]] and \"[[old boy network]]\" of former pupils were useful in advancing a career.

Henceforth each of these schools was to be managed by a [[board of governors]]. The following year, the headmaster of [[Uppingham School]] invited sixty to seventy of his fellow headmasters to form what became the Headmasters' Conference \u2013 later the [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference]]. Separate [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|preparatory (or \"prep\") schools]] developed from the 1830s, which \"prepared\" younger boys for entry to the senior schools; as a result the latter began limiting entry to boys who had reached 12 or 13 years of age.\n\n[[File:Eton College by Loggan 1690 - R - slpl ste02048 merge.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|A bird's eye view of [[Eton College]] by [[David Loggan]], published in his ''Cantabrigia Illustrata'' of 1690]]\n\nUntil the [[late medieval period]] most schools were controlled by the church and had specific entrance criteria; others were restricted to the sons of members of guilds, trades or [[livery companies]].

Protests in the local newspaper forced governors of the Perse School to keep it open, and a court case in 1837 required reform of the abuse of the school's [[charitable trust|trust]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perse.co.uk/about-us/history/|title=History \u2013 Almost 400 years old|publisher=The Perse School}}</ref>\n\n==Victorian period==\nA [[Royal Commission]], the [[Clarendon Commission]] (1861\u20131864), investigated nine of the more established schools, including seven boarding schools ([[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]], [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]], [[Westminster school|Westminster]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]]) and two day schools ([[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]] and the [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors']]).{{sfnp|Shrosbree|1988|p=12}}\n\nThe [[Public Schools Act 1868]] regulated and reformed these \"public schools\", for which it provided the first legal definition: schools which were open to the paying public from anywhere in the country, as opposed to, for example, a local school only open to local residents, or a religious school open only to members of a certain church.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationengland.org.uk/history/chapter01.html|title=Education in England: a brief history |work=Education in England}}</ref> St Paul's School and the Merchant Taylors' School claimed successfully that their constitutions made them \"private\" schools, and were excluded from the requirements of this legislation.{{sfnp|Shrosbree|1988|p=118}} In 1887 the Divisional Court and the Court of Appeal determined that the [[City of London School]] was a public school.<ref>''Blake v The Mayor and Citizens of the City of London'' [1887] L.R. 19 Q.B.D. 79.</ref>\n\nThe [[Taunton Commission]] was then appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed [[grammar school]]s, and produced recommendations to restructure their endowments; these recommendations were included, in modified form, in the [[Endowed Schools Act 1869]]. [[ Edward Thring]] wrote to 37 headmasters of what he considered leading boys' schools not covered by the Public Schools Act, inviting them to meet annually to address the threat posed by the Endowed Schools Act. In the first year 12 headmasters attended,  in the following year 34 attended, including headteachers from the Clarendon schools. The [[Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference|Headmasters' Conference]] (HMC, now the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference) has grown steadily to include over 200 schools.{{sfnp|Walford|1986|pp=7\u20138}}\n\nThe ''Public Schools Yearbook'' was published for the first time in 1889, listing 30 schools, mostly boarding schools. The day school exceptions were St Paul's School and Merchant Taylors' School. Some academically successful grammar schools have been added in later editions.

The [[direct grant grammar school]] would receive partial state funding in return for taking between 25 and 50 percent of its pupils from state primary schools.{{sfnp|Donnison|1970|p=49}} \n\nThe Fleming Committee recommended that one-quarter of the places at public schools should be assigned to a national bursary scheme for children who would benefit from boarding. The key advocate was [[Ellen Wilkinson]], but it got off to a slow start in an age of severe budget constraints. The Conservative Government elected in 1951 did not expand the programme. It failed because it was not a high priority for either party, money was tight, there was wavering support from independent boarding schools and local education authorities, and no consensus was reached on how to select the pupils to participate.<ref>[[Nick Hillman|Nicholas Hillman]], \"Public schools and the Fleming report of 1944: shunting the first-class carriage on to an immense siding?.\" ''History of Education'' 41#2 (2012): 235\u2013255.</ref>\n\nThe Labour government in 1965 made major changes to the organisation of maintained schools, directing local authorities to phase out [[Circular 10/65|selection at eleven]].

This was often for long uninterrupted periods of a year or more. The 19th-century public school ethos promoted ideas of service to Crown and Empire, familiar sentiments such as \"it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game\" and \"the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton\". The latter sometimes but probably wrongly attributed to [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]. Many ex-pupils, like those from other schools, had, and still have, a nostalgic affection for their old schools ([[George Orwell]] remembered being \"interested and happy\" at Eton,<ref>Buddicom, Jacintha. ''Eric and Us''. Finlay Publisher. 2006: p. 58</ref>) and a [[School tie|public school tie]] and \"[[old boy network]]\" of former pupils were useful in advancing a career.

The studio hoped the film would fit in with its already-set Marvel slate, including ''Venom'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBy the end of September, Sony was intending for production on the film to take place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]\u2014where ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''Venom'' were previously produced\u2014but had still not set a release date for the film.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> [[Screen Rant]]'s Cooper Hood opined that Sony was likely waiting to see the response to ''Venom'' in early October, with Arad confirming at that time that there was excitement at Sony to produce ''Morbius'', especially due to the story of a \"healer that becomes a killer, and how do you deal with [that?]\"<ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> Tolmach said the project was \"very far along\" at that stage and they were now planning to begin filming in early 2019,<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /><ref name=\"AradTolmachOct2018\" /> with the intention that ''Morbius'' would be the second film released as part of Sony's shared universe after ''Venom''.<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /> He added that Leto was bringing the same \"intensity\" to the film that he had playing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"LetoIntensitySep2018\" /> By November, box office analysts believed that ''Venom'' had been successful enough for Sony to move ahead with other films like ''Morbius'',<ref name=\"VenomBOSuccess\" /> and at the end of that month the studio dated an untitled Marvel film that was believed to be ''Morbius'' for a July 10, 2020, release.<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /> [[Adria Arjona]] entered negotiations to portray the film's female lead, Martine Bancroft, in December;<ref name=\"Arjona\" /> her involvement was confirmed a month later when Sony pushed the release date to July 31,<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> and [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] also joined the cast.<ref name=\"Smith\" /><ref name=\"Smith2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began during the last week of February 2019 in [[London]],<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"LetoLondon\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Plasma''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> With the start of filming, [[Jared Harris]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]] joined the cast as Morbius's mentor and an FBI agent hunting Morbius, respectively.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith was revealed to be portraying the villainous Loxias Crown.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> In March, filming took place in [[Manchester]]'s [[Northern Quarter (Manchester)|Northern Quarter]], portraying [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ManNQ\" /> A month later, Gibson revealed that he was portraying Simon Stroud, and that [[Al Madrigal]] had been cast as his partner, Alberto Rodriguez.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> At the end of the month, [[Justin Haythe]] was believed to have contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"Haythe\" /> Filming was scheduled to take 12 weeks,<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" /> and ''Venom'' producer [[Amy Pascal]] said in June that production had \"just wrapped\" on the project.<ref name=\"PascalWrapped\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2019, Sony announced a new agreement with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] that extended a previous deal to have [[Marvel Studios]] and its president [[Kevin Feige]] produce a sequel to ''Far From Home'', keeping Spider-Man in Marvel's shared universe, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). As part of the new agreement, Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \"cross cinematic universes\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> The film's first trailer, released in January 2020, included an image of Spider-Man that commentators equated to the [[Sam Raimi]]-directed ''[[Spider-Man in film#Raimi films|Spider-Man]]'' films though it appeared to be used as a reference to the ending of ''Far From Home''.<ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /> The trailer also included a brief appearance by [[Michael Keaton]], who previously portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] from the co-produced Marvel Studios Spider-Man film, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.<ref name=\"Keaton\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> At that time, Sony also revealed that [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] had contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"MarcumHolloway\" />\n\nReshoots for the film had begun in [[Los Angeles]] by early February 2020.<ref name=\"LAReshoots\" /> A month later, as film productions around the United States were halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Sony was said to no longer be in production on the film.<ref name=\"DisneyHaltsCoronavirus\" /> At the end of the month, the film's release date was pushed back to March 19, 2021, due to the pandemic closing theaters around the world.<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== Music==\nBy October 2019, [[Jon Ekstrand]] was set to compose the score for ''Morbius'' after doing the same for Espinosa's previous films.<ref name=\"Ekstrand\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first trailer for the film was released on January 13, 2020.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> Julia Alexander at [[The Verge]] described the premise of the film as presented by the trailer as \"ridiculous\",<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> while Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt it looked \"silly\" and also noted that the film looked very similar to ''Venom'', which he acknowledged was commercially successful.<ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" /> Scott Mendelson, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', agreed with the comparison to ''Venom'' which he felt was a good move by Sony due to the success of their last few ''Spider-Man'' films, but cautioned that Leto may not have the same box office draw for general audiences that [[Tom Hardy]] gave to ''Venom''.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> Much of the discussion surrounding the trailer centered on the revelation of Keaton's role and the visual reference to Spider-Man, which led to questions about the film's relationship with the ''Spider-Man'' films and the wider Marvel Cinematic Universe.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /><ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /><ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /><ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''Morbius'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021.<ref name=\"2021Date\" /> It had previously been set by Sony for release on July 10, 2020,<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /><ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> before moving to July 31, 2020.<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> The film was then delayed to the March 2021 date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref

same name]], produced by [[Columbia Pictures]] in association with [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] and distributed by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]]. It is intended to be the third film in [[Sony's Marvel Universe]].<!-- Do NOT change to \"Sony's Universe of Marvel Characters\", as this is not supported by the sourcing. Thank you. --> The film is directed by [[Daniel Espinosa]] from a script by [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless|Matt Sazama & Burk Sharpless]] and [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway|Art Marcum & Matt Holloway]], and stars [[Jared Leto]] as Michael Morbius alongside [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]], [[Adria Arjona]], [[Jared Harris]], [[Al Madrigal]], and [[Tyrese Gibson]]. In the film, Morbius turns into a type of vampire after attempting to cure himself of a rare blood disease.\n\nAfter announcing plans for a new shared universe of films inspired by [[Spider-Man]] characters beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018), Sony was revealed to be developing one based on Morbius. Sazama and Sharpless had written a script by November 2017, with Marcum and Holloway joining later. Leto and Espinosa officially joined in June 2018. Work began in earnest at the end of the year with further casting, ahead of a production start in February 2019 in [[London]]. Filming was confirmed to have been completed by June 2019.<!-- The film is the first of Sony's Marvel Universe to include references to [[Spider-Man in film#Licensing agreement with Marvel Studios|the ''Spider-Man'' films]] set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].-->\n\n''Morbius'' is scheduled to be released in the United States on March 19, 2021, delayed from an initial July 2020 release date due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n== Premise ==\nSuffering from a rare blood disease, [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] tries a dangerous cure that afflicts him with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]].<ref name=\"Synopsis\" /><ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" />\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Jared Leto]] as [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]]:<br />A scientist suffering from a rare blood disease who attempts to cure himself and instead becomes afflicted with a form of [[Vampire|vampirism]],<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> which gives him superhuman abilities but none of the superstitious weaknesses usually associated with vampires. Leto was drawn to the character's struggle with his disease, and to the moral implications of a person who wants to be a hero but also has a thirst for blood.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" />\n* [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] as [[Hunger (Marvel Comics)|Loxias Crown]]:<br />Morbius' friend who suffers from the same rare blood disease.<ref name=\"Smith2\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith joined the film, after previously turning down other superhero film roles, due to director [[Daniel Espinosa]]'s involvement and encouragement from [[Karen Gillan]], who portrays [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and previously worked with Smith on ''[[Doctor Who]]''.<ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" />\n* [[Adria Arjona]] as Martine Bancroft: Morbius' fianc\u00e9e.<ref name=\"Arjona\" /><ref name=\"SolidDate\" />\n* [[Jared Harris]] as Morbius' mentor.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" />\n* [[Al Madrigal]] as Alberto Rodriguez: An FBI agent hunting Morbius.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" />\n* [[Tyrese Gibson]] as Simon Stroud: An FBI agent hunting Morbius.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /><ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> Gibson signed a three-picture deal when he joined the film.<ref name=\"Gibson3\" />\n\nAdditionally, [[Michael Keaton]] will appear in the film. He previously portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), but has not been confirmed to be reprising that role.<ref name=\"Keaton\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" />\n\n== Production ==\n=== Development ===\n[[Artisan Entertainment]] announced a deal with [[Marvel Entertainment]] in May 2000 to co-produce, finance, and distribute several films based on [[Marvel Comics]] characters, including [[Morbius, the Living Vampire]].<ref name=\"ArtisanDeal\" /> In May 2017, Sony officially announced plans for a new [[shared universe]] named \"[[Sony's Marvel Universe]]\", to feature [[Spider-Man]]-related properties beginning with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' in October 2018.<ref name=\"SonyMU\" /> That November, [[Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless]] submitted a script to Sony for a potential ''Morbius'' film, after a \"secret development process\" at the studio for the character.<ref name=\"WritersNov2017\" /> [[Jared Leto]] became \"loosely attached\" to the project to potentially star in the title role, but would not fully commit to the film until he was happy with the direction it was going; Leto asked to personally meet with several of the directors that Sony was looking at for the film.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\nBy the end of April 2018, Sony had approached [[Antoine Fuqua]] about potentially directing the film. He expressed interest in taking on the project, and said that if he was to make a film in the superhero genre he would want to make it \"something that's closer to what I get excited about.\"<ref name=\"FuquaApr2018\" /> He ultimately chose not to take on the project.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> Other directors that Sony approached about the film included [[F. Gary Gray]], who considered directing the film but ultimately turned down the role,<ref name=\"GrayTHS\" /> and [[Daniel Espinosa]], who previously directed the film ''[[Life (2017 film)|Life]]'' (2017) for the studio.<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> In May, while [[Monolith Tour|on tour in Germany]] with his band [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]], Leto met with Espinosa to talk about the film,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" /> and the pair were both confirmed for the project at the end of June. [[Avi Arad]], [[Matt Tolmach]], and [[Lucas Foster]] were set to produce,<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa2\" /> and Sony was expected to give the film a release date shortly after with filming set to begin by the end of 2018. The studio hoped the film would fit in with its already-set Marvel slate, including ''Venom'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019).<ref name=\"LetoEspinosa\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nBy the end of September, Sony was intending for production on the film to take place in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]\u2014where ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017) and ''Venom'' were previously produced\u2014but had still not set a release date for the film.<ref name=\"AtlantaFilming\" /><ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> [[Screen Rant]]'s Cooper Hood opined that Sony was likely waiting to see the response to ''Venom'' in early October, with Arad confirming at that time that there was excitement at Sony to produce ''Morbius'', especially due to the story of a \"healer that becomes a killer, and how do you deal with [that?]\"<ref name=\"AradSep2018\" /> Tolmach said the project was \"very far along\" at that stage and they were now planning to begin filming in early 2019,<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /><ref name=\"AradTolmachOct2018\" /> with the intention that ''Morbius'' would be the second film released as part of Sony's shared universe after ''Venom''.<ref name=\"TolmachSep2018\" /> He added that Leto was bringing the same \"intensity\" to the film that he had playing the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' (2016).<ref name=\"LetoIntensitySep2018\" /> By November, box office analysts believed that ''Venom'' had been successful enough for Sony to move ahead with other films like ''Morbius'',<ref name=\"VenomBOSuccess\" /> and at the end of that month the studio dated an untitled Marvel film that was believed to be ''Morbius'' for a July 10, 2020, release.<ref name=\"2020Dates\" /> [[Adria Arjona]] entered negotiations to portray the film's female lead, Martine Bancroft, in December;<ref name=\"Arjona\" /> her involvement was confirmed a month later when Sony pushed the release date to July 31,<ref name=\"SolidDate\" /> and [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] also joined the cast.<ref name=\"Smith\" /><ref name=\"Smith2\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began during the last week of February 2019 in [[London]],<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"LetoLondon\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Plasma''.<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> [[Oliver Wood (cinematographer)|Oliver Wood]] served as cinematographer for the film.<ref name=\"Wood\" /> With the start of filming, [[Jared Harris]] and [[Tyrese Gibson]] joined the cast as Morbius's mentor and an FBI agent hunting Morbius, respectively.<ref name=\"Harris\" /><ref name=\"Gibson\" /><ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> Smith was revealed to be portraying the villainous Loxias Crown.<ref name=\"Gibson2\" /> In March, filming took place in [[Manchester]]'s [[Northern Quarter (Manchester)|Northern Quarter]], portraying [[New York City]].<ref name=\"ManNQ\" /> A month later, Gibson revealed that he was portraying Simon Stroud, and that [[Al Madrigal]] had been cast as his partner, Alberto Rodriguez.<ref name=\"GibsonAgents\" /> At the end of the month, [[Justin Haythe]] was believed to have contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"Haythe\" /> Filming was scheduled to take 12 weeks,<ref name=\"LetoFilmingBegin\" /><ref name=\"SmithLAMar2019\" /> and ''Venom'' producer [[Amy Pascal]] said in June that production had \"just wrapped\" on the project.<ref name=\"PascalWrapped\" />\n\n=== Post-production ===\nIn September 2019, Sony announced a new agreement with [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Disney]] that extended a previous deal to have [[Marvel Studios]] and its president [[Kevin Feige]] produce a sequel to ''Far From Home'', keeping Spider-Man in Marvel's shared universe, the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU). As part of the new agreement, Feige stated that moving forward the MCU's Spider-Man would be able to \"cross cinematic universes\" and appear in Sony's own shared universe as well.<ref name=\"SonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> This interaction was said to be \"a 'call and answer' between the two franchises as they acknowledge details between the two in what would loosely be described as a shared detailed universe\".<ref name=\"DeadlineSonyMarvelDealSM3\" /> The film's first trailer, released in January 2020, included an image of Spider-Man that commentators equated to the [[Sam Raimi]]-directed ''[[Spider-Man in film#Raimi films|Spider-Man]]'' films though it appeared to be used as a reference to the ending of ''Far From Home''.<ref name=\"SpiderManRef\" /> The trailer also included a brief appearance by [[Michael Keaton]], who previously portrayed [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Adrian Toomes / Vulture]] from the co-produced Marvel Studios Spider-Man film, ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.<ref name=\"Keaton\" /><ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> At that time, Sony also revealed that [[Art Marcum and Matt Holloway]] had contributed to the film's script.<ref name=\"MarcumHolloway\" />\n\nReshoots for the film had begun in [[Los Angeles]] by early February 2020.<ref name=\"LAReshoots\" /> A month later, as film productions around the United States were halted due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], Sony was said to no longer be in production on the film.<ref name=\"DisneyHaltsCoronavirus\" /> At the end of the month, the film's release date was pushed back to March 19, 2021, due to the pandemic closing theaters around the world.<ref name=\"2021Date\" />\n\n== Music==\nBy October 2019, [[Jon Ekstrand]] was set to compose the score for ''Morbius'' after doing the same for Espinosa's previous films.<ref name=\"Ekstrand\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nThe first trailer for the film was released on January 13, 2020.<ref name=\"LetoTrailer\" /> Julia Alexander at [[The Verge]] described the premise of the film as presented by the trailer as \"ridiculous\",<ref name=\"VergeTrailer\" /> while Matt Goldberg of [[Collider (website)|Collider]] felt it looked \"silly\" and also noted that the film looked very similar to ''Venom'', which he acknowledged was commercially successful.<ref name=\"ColliderTrailer\" /> Scott Mendelson, writing for ''[[Forbes]]'', agreed with the comparison to ''Venom'' which he felt was a good move by Sony due to the success of their last few ''Spider-Man'' films, but cautioned that Leto

During the same year, von Br\u00fccke was supervisor to first-year medical student [[Sigmund Freud]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Freud later adopted this new construct of \u201cdynamic\u201d physiology to aid in his own conceptualization of the human psyche.

Depending upon severity of the underlying pathology, longer-term psychotherapy is required.

Studies have also demonstrated that those who received psychodynamic psychotherapy continued to grow post-therapy whereas those who received cognitive Behavior therapy did not.\n\n==Client-therapist relationship==\nBecause of the subjectivity of each client's potential psychological ailments, there is rarely a clear-cut treatment approach. Most often, therapists vary general approaches in order to best fit a client's specific needs. If a therapist does not understand the psychological ailments of their client extremely well, then it is unlikely that they are able to decide upon a treatment structure that will help the client. Therefore, the client-therapist relationship must be extremely strong. Therapists like their clients to be as open and honest as possible with them. Clients must trust their therapist if this is to happen. Because the effectiveness of treatment relies so heavily on the client giving information to their therapist, the client-therapist relationship is more vital to psychodynamic therapy than almost every other type of medical practice.<ref name=\"relationship\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223|pmid=12832233|title=The Effectiveness of Psychodynamic Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy in the Treatment of Personality Disorders: A Meta-Analysis|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=7|pages=1223\u20131232|year=2003|last1=Leichsenring|first1=Falk|last2=Leibing|first2=Eric}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anna Freud]]\n* [[Malan triangles]]\n* [[Models of abnormality]]\n* [[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n{{Psychology}}\n{{Psychotherapy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psychodynamic Psychotherapy}}\n[[Category:Psychodynamics]]\n[[Category:Psychotherapy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Psychology sidebar}}\n{{Infobox interventions | MeshYear = 2014 | ICD10 = | ICD9 = | MeshID = D064889 | OPS301 = | OtherCodes = | = }}\n'''Psychodynamic psychotherapy''' or '''psychoanalytic psychotherapy'''<ref>British Psychoanalytic Council.

Von Br\u00fccke, taking a cue from [[thermodynamics]], suggested all living organisms are energy systems, governed by the principle of [[Conservation of energy|energy conservation]]. During the same year, von Br\u00fccke was supervisor to first-year medical student [[Sigmund Freud]] at the [[University of Vienna]]. Freud later adopted this new construct of \u201cdynamic\u201d physiology to aid in his own conceptualization of the human psyche. Later, both the concept and application of psychodynamics were further developed by the likes of [[Carl Jung]], [[Alfred Adler]], [[Otto Rank]], and [[Melanie Klein]].<ref>[[Horacio Etchegoyen]]: ''The Fundamentals of Psychoanalytic Technique'', Karnac Books ed., New Ed, 2005, {{ISBN|1-85575-455-X}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nMost psychodynamic approaches are centered on the concept that some maladaptive functioning is in play, and that this maladaption is, at least in part, [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Horowitz|first=Mardi J.|title=Introduction to psychodynamics: A new synthesis|publisher=Basic Books|year=1988}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-4679(200006)56:6<723::aid-jclp3>3.0.co;2-3|title=Attributional style and defense mechanisms: A synthesis of cognitive and psychodynamic factors in depression|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychology|volume=56|issue=6|pages=723\u2013735|year=2000|last1=Kwon|first1=Paul|last2=Lemon|first2=Katherine E.}}</ref> The presumed maladaption develops early in life<ref>Lerner, H. \"Psychodynamic perspectives.\" The Handbook of Clinical Psychology 1 (2008): 127-160.</ref> and eventually causes difficulties in day-to-day life.

Studies have also demonstrated that those who received psychodynamic psychotherapy continued to grow post-therapy whereas those who received cognitive Behavior therapy did not.\n\n==Client-therapist relationship==\nBecause of the subjectivity of each client's potential psychological ailments, there is rarely a clear-cut treatment approach. Most often, therapists vary general approaches in order to best fit a client's specific needs. If a therapist does not understand the psychological ailments of their client extremely well, then it is unlikely that they are able to decide upon a treatment structure that will help the client. Therefore, the client-therapist relationship must be extremely strong. Therapists like their clients to be as open and honest as possible with them. Clients must trust their therapist if this is to happen. Because the effectiveness of treatment relies so heavily on the client giving information to their therapist, the client-therapist relationship is more vital to psychodynamic therapy than almost every other type of medical practice.<ref name=\"relationship\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223|pmid=12832233|title=The Effectiveness of Psychodynamic Therapy and Cognitive Behavior Therapy in the Treatment of Personality Disorders: A Meta-Analysis|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=7|pages=1223\u20131232|year=2003|last1=Leichsenring|first1=Falk|last2=Leibing|first2=Eric}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anna Freud]]\n* [[Malan triangles]]\n* [[Models of abnormality]]\n* [[Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|28em}}\n\n{{Psychology}}\n{{Psychotherapy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Psychodynamic Psychotherapy}}\n[[Category:Psychodynamics]]\n[[Category:Psychotherapy]]\n", "name_user": "Mentropane", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEfficacy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychodynamic_psychotherapy"}

Although an inconsistent and dissolute malcontent, he nevertheless showed considerable ability as a military leader and administrator.\n\n==Life==\nAbatai was born in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan, the imperial clan of the [[Qing dynasty]], as part of the [[Plain Blue Banner]]. He was the seventh son of [[Nurhaci]], the [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the Later Jin dynasty, the precursor of the Qing dynasty. His mother, who was from the Irgen Gioro (\u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85) clan, was a concubine of Nurhaci.\n\nAbatai led Later Jin forces to attack the tribes of Weji in 1611 and those of [[Jarut]] in 1623. He was disciplined for abandoning his colleagues during a raid on territories of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] in 1629. He was also held responsible for the loss of Yongping and other conquered Ming cities in 1629 and 1630.\n\nIn 1631, Abatai was appointed to the Manchu Board of Works. He was reprimanded for incompetence at the siege of [[Dalian]] in 1633 but reformed his conduct, and with his younger half-brother [[Ajige]], he reputedly fought and won 56 engagements. He was handsomely rewarded in 1636 for his achievements in battle.\n\nIn 1641, Abatai was stripped of his ranks for withdrawing without permission during the siege of [[Jinzhou]] in 1641. He then led a raiding force into northern China, advancing into [[Zhili]], [[Shandong]] and [[Jiangsu]] from 1642 to 1643.\n\nIn 1644, Abatai was granted the title \"[[Prince An|Prince Raoyu of the Second Rank]]\" (\u9952\u9918\u90e1\u738b), and in the following year he was placed in command of the military in Shandong.

Although an inconsistent and dissolute malcontent, he nevertheless showed considerable ability as a military leader and administrator.\n\n==Life==\nAbatai was born in the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] [[Aisin Gioro]] clan, the imperial clan of the [[Qing dynasty]], as part of the [[Plain Blue Banner]]. He was the seventh son of [[Nurhaci]], the [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the Later Jin dynasty, the precursor of the Qing dynasty. His mother, who was from the Irgen Gioro (\u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85) clan, was a concubine of Nurhaci.\n\nAbatai led Later Jin forces to attack the tribes of Weji in 1611 and those of [[Jarut]] in 1623. He was disciplined for abandoning his colleagues during a raid on territories of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Empire]] in 1629. He was also held responsible for the loss of Yongping and other conquered Ming cities in 1629 and 1630.\n\nIn 1631, Abatai was appointed to the Manchu Board of Works. He was reprimanded for incompetence at the siege of [[Dalian]] in 1633 but reformed his conduct, and with his younger half-brother [[Ajige]], he reputedly fought and won 56 engagements. He was handsomely rewarded in 1636 for his achievements in battle.\n\nIn 1641, Abatai was stripped off his ranks for withdrawing without permission during the siege of [[Jinzhou]] in 1641. He then led a raiding force into northern China, advancing into [[Zhili]], [[Shandong]] and [[Jiangsu]] from 1642 to 1643.\n\nIn 1644, Abatai was granted the title \"[[Prince An|Prince Raoyu of the Second Rank]]\" (\u9952\u9918\u90e1\u738b), and in the following year he was placed in command of the military in Shandong. He died in 1646.\n\n==Family==\n* Father: [[Nurhaci]], Taizu ({{lang|zh|\u592a\u7956 \u52aa\u723e\u54c8\u8d64}}; 8 April 1559 \u2013 30 September 1626)\n** Grandfather: [[Taksi]], Xianzu ({{lang|zh|\u986f\u7956 \u5854\u514b\u4e16}}; 1543\u20131583)\n** Grandmother: Empress Xuan, of the [[Hitara]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5ba3\u7687\u540e \u559c\u5854\u81d8\u6c0f}}; d. 1569), personal name Emeci ({{lang|zh|\u984d\u7a46\u9f4a}})\n* Mother: Secondary consort, of the [[Irgen Gioro]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5074\u798f\u6649 \u4f0a\u723e\u6839\u89ba\u7f85\u6c0f}})\n----\n* Consorts and Issue:\n** Primary consort, of the [[Clan Nara#Notable figures of the Nara|Nara]] clan ({{lang|zh|\u5ae1\u798f\u6649 \u90a3\u62c9\u6c0f}})\n*** \u0160anggiyan, Prince Xianque of the Fourth Rank ({{lang|zh|\u8ce2\u6128\u8c9d\u5b50 \u5c1a\u5efa}}; 1606\u20131630), first son\n*** Bohoto, Prince Wenliang of the Fourth Rank ({{lang|zh|\u6eab\u826f\u8c9d\u5b50 \u535a\u548c\u8bac}}; 1610 \u2013 October/November 1648), second son\n*** [[Bolo, Prince Duanzhong|Bolo]], [[Prince Duanzhong|Prince Duanzhongding of the First Rank]] ({{lang|zh|\u7aef\u91cd\u5b9a\u89aa\u738b \u535a\u6d1b}}; 1613 \u2013 23 April 1652), third son\n*** Yolo, [[Prince An|Prince Anhe of the First Rank]] ({{lang|zh|\u5b89\u548c\u89aa\u738b \u5cb3\u6a02}}; 19 October 1625 \u2013 15 March 1689), fourth son\n*** Hedu ({{lang|zh|\u548c\u5ea6}}), fifth son\n*** First daughter\n**** Married [[Li Yongfang]] ({{lang|zh|\u674e\u6c38\u82b3}}; d. 1634) in 1618\n*** Second daughter\n**** Married Ingg\u016bldai ({{lang|zh|\u82f1\u4fc4\u723e\u5cb1}}; 1596\u20131648) of the Manchu [[Tatara (clan)|Tatara]] clan\n** Unknown\n*** A daughter who married Chuo'erji ({{lang|zh|\u7dbd\u723e\u6fdf}}; d. 1670) of the [[Borjigin#Khorchin Mongols|Khorchin Borjigit]] clan, and had issue ([[Empress Xiaohuizhang]])\n*** A daughter who married Bu'erhatu ({{lang|zh|\u5e03\u723e\u54c8\u5716}})\n\n==See also==\n* [[Royal and noble ranks of the Qing dynasty]]\n* [[Ranks of Imperial Consorts in China#Qing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* {{cite book|last=Du|first=Jiaji|title=Baqi Yu Qingchao Zhengzhi Lun Gao (Draft on the Eight Banners and Politics of the Qing Dynasty)|year=2008|publisher=People's Publishing House|ref=harv|isbn=9787010067537}}\n* {{cite book|last=Hummel|first=Arthur W.|authorlink=Arthur W.
