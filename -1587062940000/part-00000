The lineup has changed several times with Komarov as the only constant member. Komarov started out for the band as a drummer, but following a few failed attempts at recruiting a singer, he took on vocal duties in January 1995. The band's exact birthday is unknown, but between 1 September and 26 December 1991, they recorded their first demo of 4 instrumentals on a primitive tape recorder. Thus, [[Hot Zex]] briefly existed in the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the beginning, [[Hot Zex]] were strongly influenced by punk rockers like the [[Dead Kennedys]] and [[The Clash]], later drifting towards American alternative rock like [[Sonic Youth]] and the noise experiments of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. Throughout the years [[Hot Zex]] incorporated touches of [[post-punk]], [[dream pop]], [[Britpop]], [[synthpop]], [[krautrock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and even [[Dub music|dub]] with trademark [[shoegazing]] constant noise/guitar-synth wall of sound and [[noise pop]] tunes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"Sugarbabes\", the band's debut album, was recorded in January 1995, the line-up featuring Vladimir Komarov (vocals, guitar, drums, programming), Vladimir Shibanov (guitar, departed soon after the album), Alex Kelman (guitar), Anton Zenkov (bass). The album was recorded and mixed overnight on an 8-channel portastudio by [[:ru:\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0438\u043d|Pavel Peretolchin]]. This is the band's only record not produced by Komarov. The sound concept was maximum DIY. Musically, \"Sugarbabes\" is a snapshot of the band trying to shape their style in long-winded and complex noise improvisations \u2014 definitely a huge [[Sonic Youth]] influence there. One track is worthy of mention \u2013 the early version of a [[Hot Zex]] classic, \"Waiting\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSummer 1997 saw the release of \"Velvety/Dual\" comprising two EPs: \"Velvety\" (recorded and mixed in January 1996) and \"Dual\" (recorded and mixed in January 1997). None of the EPs had been released. The album was a total departure from live drums; it ventured into [[Madchester]] and [[shoegazing]] territory and was better recorded. Unlike its predecessor, all of the \"Velvety/Dual\" material was written by Komarov, who had become the main songwriting force of [[Hot Zex]]. Despite continuing loyalty to noise, the song \"Planets\" was deemed radio-friendly and contributed to the band's popularity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe late-1990s internet boom gave [[Hot Zex]], a band from distant Siberia, access to a wider Russian and international audience. In October 2000, \"She Could Make Things Perfect\" was named Song of the Month on the German Bouncing Corporation label website. In May 2001, an international [[shoegazing]] compilation release \"Seven Winters\" features [[Hot Zex]] track \"Skylab Sounds\". The song went to #9 in the annual chart of U.S. Voyage Beyond Radio \u2014 The 10 Best Indie Music From The Michael Antony Show 2002. In the same year, [[:ru:MTV \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f|MTV Russia]] aired \"Feel the Light\" video.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe third [[Hot Zex]] album titled \"7 Lovesongs and a Track about Daily Routine of an Airport\" was released by Tokyo label Chelsea Girl Records in June 2003. By that time, the line-up had changed dramatically: Konstantin Nikonov became full-time drummer and Kelman was replaced by Mikhail Grinin.

The entire material had been written by Komarov shortly before the recording session and tried out during the Baltic States tour. The new live sound of the band had become more electronic and sample dominated, therefore all the 2002-2004 demos were ditched with the exception of electronic/acoustic ballad \"Falling\", recorded by Komarov in December 2004 in [[Novosibirsk]]. Otherwise, the album showcased rock'n'roll drive plus lo-fi Boss DR-202 Dr. Groove sounds and vintage analogue synths recorded in an 'upscale' studio.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe mixing stage of the album was completed in early 2007. However, differences with the record company delayed the release until it finally happened in 2009, when the moment was lost. Zenkov made his exit from the group in Summer 2007. By that time, Komarov's side-project [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] had already gained momentum, and [[Hot Zex]] was viewed as a less exciting [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] side-project by the public and the press. Despite this, many critics and fans rate \"Standby\" as the best album by [[Hot Zex]].\nThe band continued to play rare gigs in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg (with Alexander Bogdan on bass), the most recent of which dates back to 2010. [[Hot Zex]] never broke up officially. Komarov and Nikonov are rumored to have put the project on hiatus, with a collection of rare and unissued recordings in the pipeline.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==== Hot Zex Discography ====\n\n===== Albums =====\n* 1995 \u2014 Sugarbabies (CC, own release, Russia)\n* 1997 \u2014 Velvety/Dual (CC, Hit Service, Russia)\n* 2003 \u2014 7 lovesongs and a track about daily routine of an airport (CD, Chelsea Girl Records, Japan)\n* 2009 \u2014 Standby (Digital, Northern Star Records, Great Britain & AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n\n===== 7\" =====\n* 2006 \u2014 Hot Zex \u00abCold Sunday Rain\u00bb / Dayplanener \u00abSunshine\u00bb (Split single, MPLS LTD, USA)\n* 2009 \u2014 MPLS LTD V/A (East Side track 2: Hot Zex \u00abMade of Dirt\u00bb)\n\n===== Compilations =====\n* 2001 \u2014 Seven Winters (CD, G.A.C., Japan)\n* 2004 \u2014 Pop Renaissance (CD, Excellent Records, Japan)\n* 2007 \u2014 Avant 2007 (CD, Avant Recordings, Russia)\n* 2007 \u2014 Alley PM V2.0 (CD, Alley P.M., Russia)\n* 2008 \u2014 Future Sound of Russia (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2009 \u2014 Future Sound of Russia 2 (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n\n=== Punk TV ===\n'''Punk TV''' is a Russian electro-rock band, formed in [[Novosibirsk]] in 2004. The actual forming of the band could be traced back to December 2003, when Komarov heard the home demo of \"Snowboy\" instrumental by Alex Kelman (ex-[[Hot Zex]]) and offered to complete the song in a studio. He added vocals, guitar, bass and mixed the track almost overnight. A few months later, \"Snowboy\" was released on \"Alley P.M. Vol 01\" CD compilation and became a sudden hit. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] received numerous invitations to festivals; the band was joined by Hot Zex drummer Konstantin Nikonov and played a successful debut in July 2004 at Sunvibes international fest.\nBy 2005, Komarov had produced another three [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] tracks and forwarded them to Hermeet Chadha, assistant to [[John Peel]] and [[Steve Lamacq]]. Soon afterwards, [[BBC Radio 1]] played \"Snowboy\" and \"Zoomer Goodnight\". Several Russian labels offered Punk TV a debut album deal. The band chose Alley P.M., a small but friendly label that guaranteed [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] complete artistic freedom, and in June 2005 the eponymous debut was finished. A year later the record was re-released in the U.S. by AeroCCCP.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Punk TV's 90% instrumental debut, a blend of [[Lo-fi]], [[krautrock]] and [[breakbeat]], half of it recorded at home, got wonderful press on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Punk TV's debut album is an exciting trip down the stream of crafty and clever indie-rock that starts in the quiet haven of the Britpop \"Day By Day\", storms through a dozen weird guitar/sampler adventures, climaxing in the electronic \"Night By Night\". The album is largely vocal-free, and the centerpiece is titled \"While Mickey Mouse Sleeps\". The watchwords for Punk TV are \"drive\", \"cool\" and \"fresh\"\" \u2014 Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, December 2005.<ref>[http://www.inter-view.org/man/1149.htm], Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, December 2005.</ref>\n\nExcellent album from a trio of Siberians who mix driving, droning guitars with thick buzzing electronics. It has a touch of New Order and Ratatat to it, a bit of breakbeat and a dark Flaming Lips-like beauty that seems to be found only in places not on the musical map. Cool. \u2014 Tim Mohr, Playboy Magazine US, Dec 2006.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Punk-TV/dp/B000K4XA62], Tim Mohr, Playboy Magazine US, Dec 2006.</ref>\n\nAlex Kelman, Volodya Komarov and Kostya Nikonov are the Siberian trio behind Punk TV, carving out a niche for themselves with a set that is sure to extend their appeal well beyond native Russia. Opening with the atmospheric, propulsive \u00abDay by Day\u00bb, this disc would be perfect accompaniment for a spy movie, with its trick-start beginnings (\u00abAmsterdam\u00bb), tick tock rhythms coupled with floaty drones (\u00abZoomer Goodnight\u00bb) and plenty of disco guitars for those spies' nights off. They'll probably even get the girl at the end. Romantic avant-garde indie new-wave poptronica? Yes, please. \u2014 Kristi Kates, Remix Magazine, Feb 2007.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Punk-TV/dp/B000K4XA62], Kristi Kates, Remix Magazine, Feb 2007.</ref>\n\nAn electronics whiz, a bassist, and a drummer, all from Siberia, open up their debut album with a cute, curvy indie-pop tune about being on tour \u2014 but quickly they unveil a surprising array of dance beats, expert pacing, killer sonic kicks, and rich atmospherics. Invoking vintage European film soundtracks, American rock classics, and 90s U.K. pop, the album is exhilaratingly integrated, avoiding the usual gauche misalliances of rock, disco, and techno. \u2014 James Hunter, Spin Magazine, April 2007.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AuTSBJnG06YC&pg=PA94&dq=punk+tv+intitle:spin&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=XPyyUNvnF6jZ0QHmlYHIBw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=punk%20tv%20intitle%3Aspin&f=false], James Hunter, Spin Magazine, April 2007.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the summer of 2005, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] played Russia's major festivals: Nokia Lab in Moscow (sharing the bill with [[Howie B]]) and Stereoleto in Saint-Petersburg (with [[Gus Gus]] and 2020 Soundsystem). \"Snowboy\" became the anthem of Russia's #1 electronic fest KaZantip Republic. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] was named \"debut of the year\" by the press in 2005.\n\nIn summer 2006, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] signed with Moscow production company Soundhunters, moved to the capital and started recording the follow-up. The record was recorded in Autumn 2006 in Riga's Sound Division Studio and mixed at Gigant Record in Moscow. At the end of the year, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] received the Golden Gargoyle national prize for \"Best Russian Electronic Act 2006\". The second album, \"Music for the Broken Keys\", was released in March 2007.\n\nWhile Punk TV's debut saw Komarov immersed in guitar work and the search for the band's unique sound, with a brief nod to singing, \"Music for the Broken Keys\" boosted his songwriting talent. 5 tracks out of 9 featured lyrics, with each song an instant [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] classic. Komarov's songs broke with the old stereotypes and propelled [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] to new heights, out of reach for the Russian indie scene.\n\n<blockquote>\nPunk TV bang out \u00abVala Svala\u00bb and some might say that it's a bit controversial what has been said about this band but it is positive so tough. These guys are like the Pet Shop Boys but with balls. They have made an electro track that sounds amazing and the vocals are just mesmerizing, they have gone for quality rather than what will sell 200k Singles. This is a proper kick ass tune. \u2014 Mark Moore, Contactmusic.com<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/northern-star-records-revolution-in-soundx16x09x09], Mark Moore, Contactmusic.com</ref>\n\nThis is like Depeche Mode on acid with all its psychedelic sounds, soft Pet Shop Boys like vocals and lush keyboards. \u2014 Dj Astro, Unimeri.com<ref>[http://www.unimeri.com/PsychotropicZone/reviews.en.php?subaction=showfull&id=1247474109&archive=1262346811&start_from=&ucat=3&], Dj Astro, Unimeri.com</ref>\n\n\"Two years ago, Punk TV debut arrived as a bolt out of the blue in the backwater of our music landscape. The album boasted a whole range of flavor-of-the-season new-rave tricks: Manchester guitars and synth psychodelia. On \"Music For The Broken Keys\" the Novisibirsk guys venture farther than on their debut, leaving 'difficult second albums' to one-hit losers. Clubby clouds of Punk TV sound remain the same, but with a hint of difference. More tracks with vocal (three), guitars against a backdrop of puffy lacy electronica. Juggling hollow clich\u00e9s is pointless when talking about this record \u2014the music of Punk TV is exempt from European press classification. The album sounds fresh and fun, sometimes slightly ahead of the latest trends \u2014 and you know this special feeling when you get it\" \u2014 Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, June 2007.<ref>[http://www.inter-view.org/man/1149.htm], Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, June 2007.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe closing track \"Good Morning 1985\" was a last-minute addition. The original version was recorded by Komarov as a birthday present for [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] drummer Nikonov, a big fan of 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]]. Komarov resisted the idea of re-recording \"Good Morning 1985\" to the last, calling it \"a throwaway joke\".\n\nIn 2007, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] played 56 gigs in Russia, England, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. The band played Moscow's largest B1 club, opening for [[The Rapture (band)|The Rupture]] and [[Happy Mondays]]. In spring 2008, the band released \"Sunderground\" EP, a teaser for the third full-length [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] album \"Loverdrive\".\n\nDespite a successful career in Moscow, the band and their production company Soundhunters decided to part ways. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] continued their heavy touring schedule, while recording and mixing their new album at Gigant Records. The LP was released by Fusion/Gala on 18 March 2009. Unlike its predecessors, \"Loverdrive\" was more guitar-heavy and relatively short \u2014 clocking in at less than 38 minutes. Three tracks had already been available on \"Sunderground\" EP, with slightly altered mixes for the album. This is largely due to the band bankrolling the album after their split with the production company, however, the quality of the record did not suffer. Tight finances did not affect the material, in fact, two new songs by Komarov \u2013 \"Every Minute is OK\" and \"Voices\" are probably among Punk TV's finest. The record was lauded by critics and cemented the band's #1 national indie rockers status.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"After the band's second \"Music for the Broken Keys\" album (2007), Chemical Brothers references can only be found in lazy write-ups by those who fail to see beyond the press release. The actual similarities are few: simply great electro rock, where guitars and synthesizers coexist happily instead of drowning each other out. Up next: leaving Novosibirsk for Moscow, a tour of Russia, major festivals, MTV and Radio Maximum air a song they co-wrote with Bi-2. Now a new album \u2014 and it's on to the next level. \"Loverdrive\" is the same old Guitars vs. Synths friendly, the same rubber ball samples and laid-back guitar romantics. At the same time, Punk TV appear to have broken free and laid the heavy burden down. Where tracks used to crawl, heavy with samples and overdriven guitars, they now burst in all directions: synths gone up-register and into space, meaty back-to-gravity bass, distant weightless guitars. At times these elements mix so well that pleasure becomes almost physical. \"Loverdrive\" packs a surefire radio-friendly single \"Comet\" with vocals by Bi-2 and a near-perfect hit \"Voices\" that brings to mind the better days of Primal Scream \u2014 it would be a crime for radio programmers to ignore these songs. Besides, Punk TV deserve to lead the entire New Russian music corps. After all, it was vocalist Volodya Komarov who produced the new hipster darlings Manicure. The release and the future of \"Loverdrive\" becomes a moment of truth for the entire movement: it will either flourish or get a rude kick aside to small-time Moscow dives. Even so, Punk TV's crowning achievement is an accomplished fact: they are no longer the \"Russian Chemical Brothers\", they are quite simply Punk TV \u2014 and that is good enough\" \u2014 Georgy Birger, Time Out Moscow.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130417202729/http://www.timeout.ru/music/event/2759/], Georgy Birger, Time Out Moscow.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing a 30-gig Loverdrive Tour that spanned Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, Komarov went back into the studio to almost single-handedly record a new [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] single \"Solar\". The record was released by Fusion on 14 April 2010 in two formats and under different titles: 7\" vinyl \"S.S.\" (b-side \"Suburban Sounds\") and CD EP \"Solar\" (featuring remixes for \"Solar\" and b-side \"Discounted Toy\"). The entire material had been written by Komarov as early as Summer/Autumn 2009. The singer of legendary Irish [[post-punk]] band [[Power of Dreams]], Craig Walker, co-wrote and sang lead on \"Suburban Sounds\".\n\nIn February 2010, Punk TV opened for [[Ian Brown]] at Moscow's B1, and in April, the band embarked on Solar Tour through Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Kazakhstan. The tour wrapped up in end-September and the musicians decided to start a new album, tentatively slotted for release in March 2011. Unlike two previous LPs, when [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] went in with a ready, rehearsed and live-tested album, the new record, \"Space Shadows\", was a studio affair built from scratch. Komarov almost went back to the production method of the first eponymous [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] album, despite all recording and mixing taking place at Gigant Records. The result was a jigsaw sound puzzle of styles and moods. The album featured [[EMF (band)|EMF singer]] James Atkin on \"Breathing Out\" and the [[Lali Puna]] sound architect Christian Hei\u00df, who remixed \"SID\" into a new track, \"Seeds\". Drums on \"Phantom\", \"Parker's Beat\" and \"SID\" were played by Komarov, since the band drummer was not always available for recording sessions.\n<blockquote>\n\"Vladimir Komarov comments on the new release: \"We started the new album with no clear concept \u2014 just putting some tracks together to form an album like a bunch of favorite holiday snapshots. It was really just like that: the demo of \"Phantom\" was recorded in Mexico, the sequence of \"Breathing Out\" fell into place on long treks down crazy Vietnam roads, and \"Kopenhagen\", I think, kind of speaks for itself. When we stepped into this room at Christian Heiss' Munich studio (Lali Puna, Notwist, Portmanteau) and saw all these magic hand-made boxes that did not just make sounds but actually sang, we immediately thought \u2014 it would be perfect if he could produce \"SID\". Christian said yes, that's how a new track \"Seeds\" came about. James (Aitken, of EMF) agreed to sign on our record straight away, which put us in a stupid position \u2014 we have the cult singer and no song for him to sing. We trawled our archives, fished out a fragment of a studio jam and sent it to him. I was just amazed by the way his vocal fit in. The rest was simple tweaking \u2014 and \"Breathing Out\" turned out to be one the album's highlights\" \u2014 Lookatme.ru<ref>[http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/music/music-records/119421-punk-tv], Lookatme.ru</ref>\n\n\"\"Venom\" is another single off the fourth album of the band from Novosibirsk. Unlike \"Phantom\" and \"Take Control\", both great for a heroic Hollywood drama soundtrack, \"Venom\" is quality electro-rock, an approximation of MGMT, but sans irony (which could be a good thing)\" \u2014 Boris Dahl, Rolling Stone Russia, April 2011<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150580349240436&id=121400360435], Boris Dahl, Rolling Stone Russia, April 2011.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, interest continues to grow in the Western press, due in part to the fact that Punk TV's trademark Mancunian style is often expressed in instrumental forms. A guest appearance by Atkin on the new album also helps to overcome the language barrier. The general air of celebration is palpable: tambourines are shaken and smiles will widen. British and American webzines have thus far received the band with enthusiasm: \u00abThis is the perfect accompaniment for a spy movie, with trick-start beginnings, tick-tock rhythms, and floaty drones\u2026 plus plenty of disco guitars for those spies' nights off.\u00bb Or, elsewhere: \u00abCute, curvy indie-pop\u2026 with a surprising array of dance beats, expert pacing, killer sonic kicks, and rich atmospherics. \u2014 David MacFadyen, Farfrommoscow.com<ref>[http://www.farfrommoscow.com/articles/punk-tv-the-patience-and-scarlet-pills.html], David MacFadyen, Farfrommoscow.com</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"Space Shadows\" was released 25 March 2011 by [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] and supported by a three-month Russian tour, after which the band took some time off. In Summer 2012, Komarov started work on a remixed version of \"Loverdrive\", acting as executive producer. \"Loverdub\" was released as a free Bandcamp download on 1 October 2012. Komarov was also one of the authors, re-recording \"Jetlag Sunday\" under the alias Millrock.\n\n==== Discography Punk TV ====\n\n===== Albums =====\n* 2005 \u2014 Punk TV (CD, Alley P.M., Russia)\n** 2006 \u2014 Punk TV (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2007 \u2014 Music for the Broken Keys (CD, Soundhanters LTD, Russia)\n** 2007 \u2014 Music for the Broken Keys Deluxe Edition (2CD, Souz, Russia)\n* 2009 \u2014 Loverdrive (CD, Fusion/Gala Records, Russia)\n* 2011 \u2014 Space Shadows (CD, IceCream Disco, Russia)\n* 2012 \u2014 Loverdub \u2014 ''\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0430 Loverdrive'' (Digital, Punk TV)\n\n===== Singles & EP =====\n* 2006 \u2014 Snowboy Remixes (Digital, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2008 \u2014 Sundeground EP (CD, Punk TV, Russia)\n* 2009 \u2014 Every Minute is OK (CD, Fusion, Russia)\n* 2010 \u2014 Solar EP (CD, Fusion, Russia)\n* 2010 \u2014 S.S.

The song was included on Lost Weekend's \"Lights and Fears\" album released by Fusion/Gala in 2010.\n\nIn April 2012, the cinema release of Yusup Bakshiev's \"Rendezvous\", with most of the original soundtrack written by Vladimir. He also made a small on-screen appearance as the soundman for a school girl-group The Poisoned Peaches.\n\nVladimir took part in the recording of Novosibirsk band FPRF's album, due for release on Hopneck Sound.\n\nIn Spring 2012, Vladimir founded WOW!, an electro-garage duo with Dmitry Wild in New York. In September 2012 they released an online single \"Have Fun\" and continue work on their debut EP at [[Stratosphere Sound]], NY.\n\nIn July 2013, Vladimir and Moscow's Revoltmeter joined forces in a trans-Atlantic collaboration and released \"Death Electric\" EP. 4 tracks release was met with warm reviews on the both shores. aInfluential Interview Russia Magazine named title song as a \"track of the week\" <ref>[http://interviewrussia.ru/music/2170], Sergei Blohin, Interview, RUSSIA, August 2013</ref> while LA based website FFM used words \"A fresh breath of Manhattan air...\" <ref>[http://www.farfrommoscow.com/articles/monolizard-stephan-kubrak-uplotnenie-and-tony-soprano.html], David MacFadyen, FFM</ref> to describe the atmosphere of the song.\n\nVladimir frequently plays DJ sets. In 2007-2011 he was resident DJ at Moscow club Krizis Zhanra.\n\n== Sound production ==\nKomarov's debut as other artists' sound producer took place at Riga's Sound Division Studio in Autumn 2006 when he produced 4 songs by Moscow indie band Dairy High. \"Evil Lullaby\" was released in 2007 as a 7\" vinyl split single with \"Honeypod In My Head\" by New Zealand band [[Graeme Jefferies|The Cakekithchen]]. A year later, \"Evil Lullaby\" and the other three tracks from the same record session (\"The Crooked Mile (Without a Song)\", \"Flickering Light\", \"Most Expensive Crash\") were released on Dairy High's eponymous album. The remaining 6 album tracks were done by legendary Welsh producer Greg Haver. Apart from sound production, Komarov also played grand piano, melodica, provided backing vocals and arranged the acoustic ballad \"Running Aground\".\n\nIn late 2007, Komarov started the recording and mixing of the debut album by Moscow post-punk band [[:ru:Manicure|Manicure]]. The record, released in Spring 2009 by Fusion/Gala, was a major hit in Russia and was noted abroad.

The lineup has changed several times with Komarov as the only constant member.Komarov started out for the band as a drummer, but following a few failed attempts at recruiting a singer, he took on vocal duties in January 1995. The band's exact birthday is unknown, but between 1 September and 26 December 1991 they recorded their first demo of 4 instrumentals on a primitive tape recorder. Thus, [[Hot Zex]] briefly existed in the Soviet era.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the beginning, [[Hot Zex]] were strongly influenced by punk rockers like the [[Dead Kennedys]] and [[The Clash]], later drifting towards American alternative rock like [[Sonic Youth]] and the noise experiments of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. Throughout the years [[Hot Zex]] incorporated touches of [[post-punk]], [[dream pop]], [[Britpop]], [[synthpop]], [[krautrock]], [[ambient music|ambient]] and even [[Dub music|dub]] with trademark [[shoegazing]] constant noise/guitar-synth wall of sound and [[noise pop]] tunes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"Sugarbabes\", the band's debut album, was recorded in January 1995, the line-up featuring Vladimir Komarov (vocals, guitar, drums, programming), Vladimir Shibanov (guitar, departed soon after the album), Alex Kelman (guitar), Anton Zenkov (bass). The album was recorded and mixed overnight on an 8-channel portastudio by [[:ru:\u041f\u0430\u0432\u0435\u043b \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0447\u0438\u043d|Pavel Peretolchin]]. This is the band's only record not produced by Komarov. The sound concept was maximum DIY. Musically, \"Sugarbabes\" is a snapshot of the band trying to shape their style in long-winded and complex noise improvisations \u2014 definitely a huge [[Sonic Youth]] influence there. One track is worthy of mention \u2013 the early version of a [[Hot Zex]] classic, \"Waiting\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nSummer 1997 saw the release of \"Velvety/Dual\" comprising two EPs: \"Velvety\" (recorded and mixed in January 1996) and \"Dual\" (recorded and mixed in January 1997). None of the EPs had been released. The album was a total departure from live drums; it ventured into [[Madchester]] and [[shoegazing]] territory and was better recorded. Unlike its predecessor, all of the \"Velvety/Dual\" material was written by Komarov, who had become the main songwriting force of [[Hot Zex]]. Despite continuing loyalty to noise, the song \"Planets\" was deemed radio-friendly and contributed to the band's popularity.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe late-1990s internet boom gave [[Hot Zex]], a band from distant Siberia, access to a wider Russian and international audience. In October 2000, \"She Could Make Things Perfect\" was named Song of the Month on the German Bouncing Corporation label website. In May 2001, an international [[shoegazing]] compilation release \"Seven Winters\" features [[Hot Zex]] track \"Skylab Sounds\".

The entire material had been written by Komarov shortly before the recording session and tried out during the Baltic States tour. The new live sound of the band had become more electronic and sample dominated, therefore all the 2002-2004 demos were ditched with the exception of electronic/acoustic ballad \"Falling\", recorded by Komarov in December 2004 in [[Novosibirsk]]. Otherwise, the album showcased rock'n'roll drive plus lo-fi Boss DR-202 Dr. Groove sounds and vintage analogue synths recorded in an 'upscale' studio.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe mixing stage of the album was completed in early 2007. However, differences with the record company delayed the release until it finally happened in 2009, when the moment was lost. Zenkov made his exit from the group in Summer 2007. By that time, Komarov's side-project [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] had already gained momentum, and [[Hot Zex]] was viewed as a less exciting [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] side-project by the public and the press. Despite this, many critics and fans rate \"Standby\" as the best album by [[Hot Zex]].\nThe band continued to play rare gigs in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg (with Alexander Bogdan on bass), the most recent of which dates back to 2010. [[Hot Zex]] never broke up officially. Komarov and Nikonov are rumored to have put the project on hiatus, with a collection of rare and unissued recordings in the pipeline.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==== Hot Zex Discography ====\n\n===== Albums =====\n* 1995 \u2014 Sugarbabies (CC, own release, Russia)\n* 1997 \u2014 Velvety/Dual (CC, Hit Service, Russia)\n* 2003 \u2014 7 lovesongs and a track about daily routine of an airport (CD, Chelsea Girl Records, Japan)\n* 2009 \u2014 Standby (Digital, Northern Star Records, Great Britain & AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n\n===== 7\" =====\n* 2006 \u2014 Hot Zex \u00abCold Sunday Rain\u00bb / Dayplanener \u00abSunshine\u00bb (Split single, MPLS LTD, USA)\n* 2009 \u2014 MPLS LTD V/A (East Side track 2: Hot Zex \u00abMade of Dirt\u00bb)\n\n===== Compilations =====\n* 2001 \u2014 Seven Winters (CD, G.A.C., Japan)\n* 2004 \u2014 Pop Renaissance (CD, Excellent Records, Japan)\n* 2007 \u2014 Avant 2007 (CD, Avant Recordings, Russia)\n* 2007 \u2014 Alley PM V2.0 (CD, Alley P.M., Russia)\n* 2008 \u2014 Future Sound of Russia (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2009 \u2014 Future Sound of Russia 2 (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n\n=== Punk TV ===\n'''Punk TV''' is a Russian electro-rock band, formed in [[Novosibirsk]] in 2004. The actual forming of the band could be traced back to December 2003, when Komarov heard the home demo of \"Snowboy\" instrumental by Alex Kelman (ex-[[Hot Zex]]) and offered to complete the song in a studio. He added vocals, guitar, bass and mixed the track almost overnight. A few months later, \"Snowboy\" was released on \"Alley P.M. Vol 01\" CD compilation and became a sudden hit. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] received numerous invitations to festivals; the band was joined by Hot Zex drummer Konstantin Nikonov and played a successful debut in July 2004 at Sunvibes international fest.\nBy 2005, Komarov had produced another three [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] tracks and forwarded them to Hermeet Chadha, assistant to [[John Peel]] and [[Steve Lamacq]]. Soon afterwards, [[BBC Radio 1]] played \"Snowboy\" and \"Zoomer Goodnight\". Several Russian labels offered Punk TV a debut album deal. The band chose Alley P.M., a small but friendly label that guaranteed [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] complete artistic freedom, and in June 2005 the eponymous debut was finished. A year later the record was re-released in the U.S. by AeroCCCP.\n\nSurprisingly enough, Punk TV's 90% instrumental debut, a blend of [[Lo-fi]], [[krautrock]] and [[breakbeat]], half of it recorded at home, got wonderful press on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Punk TV's debut album is an exciting trip down the stream of crafty and clever indie-rock that starts in the quiet haven of the Britpop \"Day By Day\", storms through a dozen weird guitar/sampler adventures, climaxing in the electronic \"Night By Night\". The album is largely vocal-free, and the centerpiece is titled \"While Mickey Mouse Sleeps\". The watchwords for Punk TV are \"drive\", \"cool\" and \"fresh\"\" \u2014 Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, December 2005.<ref>[http://www.inter-view.org/man/1149.htm], Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, December 2005.</ref>\n\nExcellent album from a trio of Siberians who mix driving, droning guitars with thick buzzing electronics. It has a touch of New Order and Ratatat to it, a bit of breakbeat and a dark Flaming Lips-like beauty that seems to be found only in places not on the musical map. Cool. \u2014 Tim Mohr, Playboy Magazine US, Dec 2006.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Punk-TV/dp/B000K4XA62], Tim Mohr, Playboy Magazine US, Dec 2006.</ref>\n\nAlex Kelman, Volodya Komarov and Kostya Nikonov are the Siberian trio behind Punk TV, carving out a niche for themselves with a set that is sure to extend their appeal well beyond native Russia. Opening with the atmospheric, propulsive \u00abDay by Day\u00bb, this disc would be perfect accompaniment for a spy movie, with its trick-start beginnings (\u00abAmsterdam\u00bb), tick tock rhythms coupled with floaty drones (\u00abZoomer Goodnight\u00bb) and plenty of disco guitars for those spies' nights off. They'll probably even get the girl at the end. Romantic avant-garde indie new-wave poptronica? Yes, please. \u2014 Kristi Kates, Remix Magazine, Feb 2007.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Punk-TV/dp/B000K4XA62], Kristi Kates, Remix Magazine, Feb 2007.</ref>\n\nAn electronics whiz, a bassist, and a drummer, all from Siberia, open up their debut album with a cute, curvy indie-pop tune about being on tour \u2014 but quickly they unveil a surprising array of dance beats, expert pacing, killer sonic kicks, and rich atmospherics. Invoking vintage European film soundtracks, American rock classics, and 90s U.K. pop, the album is exhilaratingly integrated, avoiding the usual gauche misalliances of rock, disco, and techno. \u2014 James Hunter, Spin Magazine, April 2007.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AuTSBJnG06YC&pg=PA94&dq=punk+tv+intitle:spin&hl=ru&sa=X&ei=XPyyUNvnF6jZ0QHmlYHIBw&ved=0CDsQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&q=punk%20tv%20intitle%3Aspin&f=false], James Hunter, Spin Magazine, April 2007.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the summer of 2005, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] played Russia's major festivals: Nokia Lab in Moscow (sharing the bill with [[Howie B]]) and Stereoleto in Saint-Petersburg (with [[Gus Gus]] and 2020 Soundsystem). \"Snowboy\" became the anthem of Russia's #1 electronic fest KaZantip Republic. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] was named \"debut of the year\" by the press in 2005.\n\nIn summer 2006, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] signed with Moscow production company Soundhunters, moved to the capital and started recording the follow-up. The record was recorded in Autumn 2006 in Riga's Sound Division Studio and mixed at Gigant Record in Moscow. At the end of the year, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] received the Golden Gargoyle national prize for \"Best Russian Electronic Act 2006\". The second album, \"Music for the Broken Keys\", was released in March 2007.\n\nWhile Punk TV's debut saw Komarov immersed in guitar work and the search for the band's unique sound, with a brief nod to singing, \"Music for the Broken Keys\" boosted his songwriting talent. 5 tracks out of 9 featured lyrics, with each song an instant [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] classic. Komarov's songs broke with the old stereotypes and propelled [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] to new heights, out of reach for the Russian indie scene.\n\n<blockquote>\nPunk TV bang out \u00abVala Svala\u00bb and some might say that it's a bit controversial what has been said about this band but it is positive so tough. These guys are like the Pet Shop Boys but with balls. They have made an electro track that sounds amazing and the vocals are just mesmerizing, they have gone for quality rather than what will sell 200k Singles. This is a proper kick ass tune. \u2014 Mark Moore, Contactmusic.com<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/album-review/northern-star-records-revolution-in-soundx16x09x09], Mark Moore, Contactmusic.com</ref>\n\nThis is like Depeche Mode on acid with all its psychedelic sounds, soft Pet Shop Boys like vocals and lush keyboards. \u2014 Dj Astro, Unimeri.com<ref>[http://www.unimeri.com/PsychotropicZone/reviews.en.php?subaction=showfull&id=1247474109&archive=1262346811&start_from=&ucat=3&], Dj Astro, Unimeri.com</ref>\n\n\"Two years ago, Punk TV debut arrived as a bolt out of the blue in the backwater of our music landscape. The album boasted a whole range of flavor-of-the-season new-rave tricks: Manchester guitars and synth psychodelia. On \"Music For The Broken Keys\" the Novisibirsk guys venture farther than on their debut, leaving 'difficult second albums' to one-hit losers. Clubby clouds of Punk TV sound remain the same, but with a hint of difference. More tracks with vocal (three), guitars against a backdrop of puffy lacy electronica. Juggling hollow clich\u00e9s is pointless when talking about this record \u2014the music of Punk TV is exempt from European press classification. The album sounds fresh and fun, sometimes slightly ahead of the latest trends \u2014 and you know this special feeling when you get it\" \u2014 Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, June 2007.<ref>[http://www.inter-view.org/man/1149.htm], Dmitry Weber, Rolling Stone Russia, June 2007.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe closing track \"Good Morning 1985\" was a last-minute addition. The original version was recorded by Komarov as a birthday present for [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] drummer Nikonov, a big fan of 1980s [[New wave music|new wave]]. Komarov resisted the idea of re-recording \"Good Morning 1985\" to the last, calling it \"a throwaway joke\".\n\nIn 2007, [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] played 56 gigs in Russia, England, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Ukraine. The band played Moscow's largest B1 club, opening for [[The Rapture (band)|The Rupture]] and [[Happy Mondays]]. In spring 2008, the band released \"Sunderground\" EP, a teaser for the third full-length [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] album \"Loverdrive\".\n\nDespite a successful career in Moscow, the band and their production company Soundhunters decided to part ways. [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] continued their heavy touring schedule, while recording and mixing their new album at Gigant Records. The LP was released by Fusion/Gala on 18 March 2009. Unlike its predecessors, \"Loverdrive\" was more guitar-heavy and relatively short \u2014 clocking in at less than 38 minutes. Three tracks had already been available on \"Sunderground\" EP, with slightly altered mixes for the album. This is largely due to the band bankrolling the album after their split with the production company, however, the quality of the record did not suffer. Tight finances did not affect the material, in fact, two new songs by Komarov \u2013 \"Every Minute is OK\" and \"Voices\" are probably among Punk TV's finest. The record was lauded by critics and cemented the band's #1 national indie rockers status.\n\n<blockquote>\n\"After the band's second \"Music for the Broken Keys\" album (2007), Chemical Brothers references can only be found in lazy write-ups by those who fail to see beyond the press release. The actual similarities are few: simply great electro rock, where guitars and synthesizers coexist happily instead of drowning each other out. Up next: leaving Novosibirsk for Moscow, a tour of Russia, major festivals, MTV and Radio Maximum air a song they co-wrote with Bi-2. Now a new album \u2014 and it's on to the next level. \"Loverdrive\" is the same old Guitars vs. Synths friendly, the same rubber ball samples and laid-back guitar romantics. At the same time, Punk TV appear to have broken free and laid the heavy burden down. Where tracks used to crawl, heavy with samples and overdriven guitars, they now burst in all directions: synths gone up-register and into space, meaty back-to-gravity bass, distant weightless guitars. At times these elements mix so well that pleasure becomes almost physical. \"Loverdrive\" packs a surefire radio-friendly single \"Comet\" with vocals by Bi-2 and a near-perfect hit \"Voices\" that brings to mind the better days of Primal Scream \u2014 it would be a crime for radio programmers to ignore these songs. Besides, Punk TV deserve to lead the entire New Russian music corps. After all, it was vocalist Volodya Komarov who produced the new hipster darlings Manicure. The release and the future of \"Loverdrive\" becomes a moment of truth for the entire movement: it will either flourish or get a rude kick aside to small-time Moscow dives. Even so, Punk TV's crowning achievement is an accomplished fact: they are no longer the \"Russian Chemical Brothers\", they are quite simply Punk TV \u2014 and that is good enough\" \u2014 Georgy Birger, Time Out Moscow.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130417202729/http://www.timeout.ru/music/event/2759/], Georgy Birger, Time Out Moscow.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nFollowing a 30-gig Loverdrive Tour that spanned Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, Komarov went back into the studio to almost single-handedly record a new [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] single \"Solar\". The record was released by Fusion on 14 April 2010 in two formats and under different titles: 7\" vinyl \"S.S.\" (b-side \"Suburban Sounds\") and CD EP \"Solar\" (featuring remixes for \"Solar\" and b-side \"Discounted Toy\"). The entire material had been written by Komarov as early as Summer/Autumn 2009. The singer of legendary Irish [[post-punk]] band [[Power of Dreams]], Craig Walker, co-wrote and sang lead on \"Suburban Sounds\".\n\nIn February 2010, Punk TV opened for [[Ian Brown]] at Moscow's B1, and in April, the band embarked on Solar Tour through Russia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, Finland, Sweden and Kazakhstan. The tour wrapped up in end-September and the musicians decided to start a new album, tentatively slotted for release in March 2011. Unlike two previous LPs, when [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] went in with a ready, rehearsed and live-tested album, the new record, \"Space Shadows\", was a studio affair built from scratch. Komarov almost went back to the production method of the first eponymous [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] album, despite all recording and mixing taking place at Gigant Records. The result was a jigsaw sound puzzle of styles and moods. The album featured [[EMF (band)|EMF singer]] James Atkin on \"Breathing Out\" and the [[Lali Puna]] sound architect Christian Hei\u00df, who remixed \"SID\" into a new track, \"Seeds\". Drums on \"Phantom\", \"Parker's Beat\" and \"SID\" were played by Komarov, since the band drummer was not always available for recording sessions.\n<blockquote>\n\"Vladimir Komarov comments on the new release: \"We started the new album with no clear concept \u2014 just putting some tracks together to form an album like a bunch of favorite holiday snapshots. It was really just like that: the demo of \"Phantom\" was recorded in Mexico, the sequence of \"Breathing Out\" fell into place on long treks down crazy Vietnam roads, and \"Kopenhagen\", I think, kind of speaks for itself. When we stepped into this room at Christian Heiss' Munich studio (Lali Puna, Notwist, Portmanteau) and saw all these magic hand-made boxes that did not just make sounds but actually sang, we immediately thought \u2014 it would be perfect if he could produce \"SID\". Christian said yes, that's how a new track \"Seeds\" came about. James (Aitken, of EMF) agreed to sign on our record straight away, which put us in a stupid position \u2014 we have the cult singer and no song for him to sing. We trawled our archives, fished out a fragment of a studio jam and sent it to him. I was just amazed by the way his vocal fit in. The rest was simple tweaking \u2014 and \"Breathing Out\" turned out to be one the album's highlights\" \u2014 Lookatme.ru<ref>[http://www.lookatme.ru/mag/music/music-records/119421-punk-tv], Lookatme.ru</ref>\n\n\"\"Venom\" is another single off the fourth album of the band from Novosibirsk. Unlike \"Phantom\" and \"Take Control\", both great for a heroic Hollywood drama soundtrack, \"Venom\" is quality electro-rock, an approximation of MGMT, but sans irony (which could be a good thing)\" \u2014 Boris Dahl, Rolling Stone Russia, April 2011<ref>[http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10150580349240436&id=121400360435], Boris Dahl, Rolling Stone Russia, April 2011.</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, interest continues to grow in the Western press, due in part to the fact that Punk TV's trademark Mancunian style is often expressed in instrumental forms. A guest appearance by Atkin on the new album also helps to overcome the language barrier. The general air of celebration is palpable: tambourines are shaken and smiles will widen. British and American webzines have thus far received the band with enthusiasm: \u00abThis is the perfect accompaniment for a spy movie, with trick-start beginnings, tick-tock rhythms, and floaty drones\u2026 plus plenty of disco guitars for those spies' nights off.\u00bb Or, elsewhere: \u00abCute, curvy indie-pop\u2026 with a surprising array of dance beats, expert pacing, killer sonic kicks, and rich atmospherics. \u2014 David MacFadyen, Farfrommoscow.com<ref>[http://www.farfrommoscow.com/articles/punk-tv-the-patience-and-scarlet-pills.html], David MacFadyen, Farfrommoscow.com</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n\"Space Shadows\" was released 25 March 2011 by [[:ru:Punk TV|Punk TV]] and supported by a three-month Russian tour, after which the band took some time off. In Summer 2012, Komarov started work on a remixed version of \"Loverdrive\", acting as executive producer. \"Loverdub\" was released as a free Bandcamp download on 1 October 2012. Komarov was also one of the authors, re-recording \"Jetlag Sunday\" under the alias Millrock.\n\n==== Discography Punk TV ====\n\n===== Albums =====\n* 2005 \u2014 Punk TV (CD, Alley P.M., Russia)\n** 2006 \u2014 Punk TV (CD, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2007 \u2014 Music for the Broken Keys (CD, Soundhanters LTD, Russia)\n** 2007 \u2014 Music for the Broken Keys Deluxe Edition (2CD, Souz, Russia)\n* 2009 \u2014 Loverdrive (CD, Fusion/Gala Records, Russia)\n* 2011 \u2014 Space Shadows (CD, IceCream Disco, Russia)\n* 2012 \u2014 Loverdub \u2014 ''\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f \u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0438\u044f \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0430 Loverdrive'' (Digital, Punk TV)\n\n===== Singles & EP =====\n* 2006 \u2014 Snowboy Remixes (Digital, AeroCCCP Recordings, USA)\n* 2008 \u2014 Sundeground EP (CD, Punk TV, Russia)\n* 2009 \u2014 Every Minute is OK (CD, Fusion, Russia)\n* 2010 \u2014 Solar EP (CD, Fusion, Russia)\n* 2010 \u2014 S.S.

In 2007-2011 he was resident DJ at Moscow club Krizis Zhanra.\n\n== Sound production ==\nKomarov's debut as other artists' sound producer took place at Riga's Sound Division Studio in Autumn 2006 when he produced 4 songs by Moscow indie band Dairy High. \"Evil Lullaby\" was released in 2007 as a 7\" vinyl split single with \"Honeypod In My Head\" by New Zealand band [[Graeme Jefferies|The Cakekithchen]]. A year later, \"Evil Lullaby\" and the other three tracks from the same record session (\"The Crooked Mile (Without a Song)\", \"Flickering Light\", \"Most Expensive Crash\") were released on Dairy High's eponymous album. The remaining 6 album tracks were done by legendary Welsh producer Greg Haver. Apart from sound production, Komarov also played grand piano, melodica, provided backing vocals and arranged the acoustic ballad \"Running Aground\".\n\nIn late 2007, Komarov started the recording and mixing of the debut album by Moscow post-punk band [[:ru:Manicure|Manicure]].

The white tips of the wings (primary [[feather]]s) seen in flight are another diagnostic characteristic. The beak is black and straight and presents a casque, more developed in males. Female southern ground hornbills are smaller and have violet-blue skin on their throats. Juveniles to six years old lack the prominent red pouch, but have a duller patch of grey in its place.\n\n==Habitat and diet==\n[[File:Bucorvus leadbeateri -Philadelphia Zoo -upper body-8a.jpg|left|thumb|Head of female at [[Philadelphia Zoo]]]]\nSouthern ground hornbills can be found from northern [[Namibia]] and [[Angola]] to northern [[South Africa]] and southern [[Zimbabwe]] to [[Burundi]] and [[Kenya]].
