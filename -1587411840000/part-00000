The chain started in 1972 in [[Dallas, Texas]], and at one point had spread throughout the southern and eastern parts of the [[United States]]. Each restaurant has a trolley car in the dining room and patrons are able to sit in the car. One of Spaghetti Warehouse's unique characteristics is that many of the older locations are in renovated, historic buildings.\n\nThe location in [[Columbus, Ohio]], which opened in 1978, is the largest both in seating capacity and in sales.

Opened in 1975, and built in 1902, it used to be a grocery warehouse, and during prohibition, was a brothel. Two chandeliers from New York City's Penn Station reside there as well as the original box office from Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California.  Like its Dallas counterpart, it is also home to an original East Dallas trolley car.  The Austin location closed April 23, 2011 due to physical building issues.\n\n=== Columbus, Ohio ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nThe Columbus location was the first Spaghetti Warehouse outside of Texas, and the fifth to open in the chain.  It opened in April 1978 in an old ice house built in the 1880s. It is the largest in the company and continually exceeds its counterparts in weekly sales. It is such a \"landmark\" in Columbus, that many diners there believe it to be the only location. It is home to two confessionals taken from churches in New England, as well as a 1920s German elevator in which patrons may sit for dinner. The original steam engine that kept the building cold when it was an ice house, is still located in its lobby. Another artifact there includes the head of a moose killed by former President Theodore Roosevelt along with its certificate of authenticity.\n\n=== Akron, Ohio ===\n\nThe [[Akron]] location opened in 1992 on the site of a former [[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich Corporation]] warehouse, adjacent to the former [[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich Corporation]] Headquarters until 1988 and the building was originally built in the 1870's as a warehouse of B.F. Goodrich tires. The Akron store features a 20-foot chandelier that once belonged to the  [[Dunes (hotel and casino)|Dunes]] Hotel & Casino in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]. This location features several signs of former rubber tires companies that once called Akron home, as well as old arcade games and antiques. Diners can sit in an old hotel elevator, and a former Akron street trolley car. Although not one of the original, warehouse type stores from the 1970's and 1980's, it is in a historical building in a historical area, on the old [[Goodrich Corporation|B. F. Goodrich Corporation]] property.\n\n=== Memphis, Tennessee (closed) ===\nThe Memphis location was inside a typical warehouse of the late 19th to early 20th century. It was decorated with an original trolley used for transportation in downtown Memphis, and with doors and light fixtures from [[Memphis Union Station]] which had been abandoned and razed in 1968 to make way for a new post office. When [[Elvis Presley]] returned from the Army on 7 March 1960, he was greeted in Memphis Union Station by a crowd of several hundred fans. The station was located about {{convert|0.6|mi|m|abbr=on}} southeast of the restaurant's current site.

It opened in 1973 in Downtown Houston. Like the Dallas location, it had two floors of dining. During lunch, guests were seated in a trolley structure for their meal.  The [[Houston]] location is said{{By whom|date=December 2015}} to be haunted. Many employees refuse to speak on the matter, but there have been a few, who are willing to share. Many signs of haunting include floating wine glasses, strange flickers of light, mysterious sounds, and voices in the night. Some waiters report mysterious sightings, especially when working late at night. According to reports from a variety of sources, including the Houston Press, a managers willingly recounted the haunting tales. Long ago, the building that Spaghetti Warehouse currently occupies served as a pharmacy. One day, one of the pharmacists was tragically killed in by a freak accident in an elevator shaft. His wife, devastated by his death, died of a broken heart exactly one year later. Her spirit is said to haunt the second floor of the Spaghetti Warehouse. Visitors have taken pictures of mysterious figures, and creepy noises have been recorded. The creepy element of the restaurant attracts many thrill seekers, who seek to explore the spiritual world.\n\nIn late August 2017, [[Hurricane Harvey]] forced the restaurant to close as a result of water seeping through the top of the main floor, causing significant damage. It reopened in August 2019 as Warehouse 72/Butcher's Plates & Pizza, at the [[Marq*E Entertainment Center]].\n\n===Ybor City, Tampa, Florida (closed)===\nThe Tampa store was located in the former tobacco storage warehouse of the [[Ybor Factory Building]] in the historic neighborhood of [[Ybor City]]. The building was constructed in 1886 and was the largest cigar factory in the world at the time. The walls and floors of the restaurant consist mainly of original exposed brick, and a replica of an Ybor City [[Streetcar|street car]] is located inside the main dining room. On 4 March 2016, it was announced this location would be closing, however, 5 days later the parent brand, BLD Brands, stated the location will remain open for another full year while another location is scouted.

This historic building had opened in 1901 as the [[Choctaw Route]] station, but had been vacant since 1968, after being purchased by the preservation minded owners of the [[Arkansas Gazette]].  At the time this Spaghetti Warehouse location opened, it was reported to be the company's most expensive renovation to date, and part of the dining area also include a 1924 Pullman car, originally named Mt. Sheridan, which had been used by the [[Cotton Belt Railroad]].  Spaghetti Warehouse also acquired an antebellum home, the Alexander George house, which had served as a division headquarters for the railroad.  For four years, Spaghetti Warehouse worked with local preservationists in an effort to save this structure, which was finally razed in 1994. The slow pace of downtown Little Rock redevelopment doomed the restaurant, and this location was closed on February 4,1996.
