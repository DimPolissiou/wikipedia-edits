Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs.

Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia.

In contrast, modern dog breeds are particular breed standards, sharing a common set of heritable characteristics, determined by the kennel club that recognizes the breed. \n\nThe spread of modern dog breeds has been difficult to resolve because many are the products of the controlled breeding practices of the Victorian era (1830\u20131900).<ref name=\"Atlas of Dog Breeds of the World\"/><ref name=\"American Kennel Club 2006\"/> In 2010, a study looked at 48,000&nbsp;[[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 912&nbsp;dogs representing 85&nbsp;breeds.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\">{{cite journal |first=Bridgett |last=vonHoldt |date=2010-03-17 |title=Genome-wide SNP and haplotype analyses reveal a rich history underlying dog domestication |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature08837 |pmid=20237475 |volume=464 |issue=7290 |pages=898\u2013902 |bibcode=2010Natur.464..898V |pmc=3494089 |last2=Lohmueller |first2=Kirk E. |last3=Han |first3=Eunjung |last4=Parker |first4=Heidi G. |last5=Quignon |first5=Pascale |last6=Degenhardt |first6=Jeremiah D. |last7=Boyko |first7=Adam R. |last8=Earl |first8=Dent A. |last9=Auton |first9=Adam |last10=Reynolds |first10=Andy |last11=Bryc |first11=Kasia |last12=Brisbin |first12=Abra |last13=Knowles |first13=James C. |last14=Mosher |first14=Dana S. |last15=Spady |first15=Tyrone C. |last16=Elkahloun |first16=Abdel |last17=Geffen |first17=Eli |last18=Pilot |first18=Malgorzata |last19=Jedrzejewski |first19=Wlodzimierz |last20=Greco |first20=Claudia |last21=Randi |first21=Ettore |last22=Bannasch |first22=Danika |last23=Wilton |first23=Alan |last24=Shearman |first24=Jeremy |last25=Musiani |first25=Marco |last26=Cargill |first26=Michelle |last27=Jones |first27=Paul G. |last28=Qian |first28=Zuwei |last29=Huang |first29=Wei |display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nThe study found distinct genetic clusters within modern dogs that largely corresponded to [[phenotype]] or function. These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]]. The study referred to these 16 as [[Basal (phylogenetics)|Basal]] breeds, as opposed to ancient breeds, as they exhibited genetic divergence but not all of them were historically considered to be \"ancient breeds\".<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nThe 2012 study found that modern breeds only emerged in the 19th century and that claims of their antiquity are based on little or no historical or empirical evidence. The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

Kennel Clubs maintain [[breed standard]]s, record [[Pedigree (dog)|pedigree]]s in a [[breed registry]] (or studbook), and issue the rules for [[conformation dog show]]s and trials and accreditation of judges. They often serve as [[breed registry|registries]], which are lists of adult [[purebred]] dogs and lists of litters of puppies born to purebred parents.\n\nA dog breed is represented by a sufficient number of individuals to stably transfer its specific characteristics over generations.

Four varieties of the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog]] are recognised as four distinct breeds by the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/pdf/breed_groups/working_standard.pdf | title=Standards of the Breeds: Group 5 \u2013 Working | publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club}}</ref> Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the [[Feist (dog)|feist]] is a hunting dog raised in the [[Southern United States]] for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other [[dog type]]s and breeds. However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.\n\nA dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. Purebred dog breeders of today \"have inherited a breeding paradigm that is, at the very least, a bit anachronistic in light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a pretty blatant misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable.\"<ref name=\"Budiansky\">{{Cite book | last =Budiansky\" | first =Stephen | publication-date =2000 | title =The Truth About Dogs; an Inquiry into the Ancestry, Social Conventions, Mental Habits, and Moral Fiber of Canis familiaris | location =New York, U.S.A. | place = | publisher =Viking Penguin | page =[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 35] | isbn =978-0-670-89272-3 | year =2000 | url =https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 }}</ref> The American Kennel Club allows [[mixed-breed dog]]s to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL).<ref name=\"AKC-Mixed\">{{cite web | title=Get Started - Register Your Mixed Breed Dog With AKC Canine Partners | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-07-28 | url=https://www.akc.org/register/information/canine-partners/get-started/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> California Assembly Act AB 1634 was a bill introduced in 2007 that would require all non-working dogs of mixed breed over the age of 6 months to be neutered or spayed.<ref name=\"ab1634\">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165548/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> The bill was morally controversial, leading the American Kennel Club to fight the bill.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222300/http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian department of agriculture has strict standards for the documenting of what it calls \"evolving breeds\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-11.2/FullText.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726205721/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.2/FullText.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2012 |title=Animal Pedigree Act 1985 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |work=Department of Justice, Canada }}</ref>\n\n====Breed standards====\nThe [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/about/glossary.cfm American Kennel Club Glossary]</ref> Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called ''[[Fault (dog)|faults]]'').

Prior to the [[Victorian era]], there were different types of dogs that were defined by their function. Many different terms were used to describe dogs, such as breed, strain, type, kind, and variety. By the end of the Victorian era, society had changed and so did the role of dogs. Form was given a more prominent role than function.<ref name=\"Worboys 2019\">{{cite web | last=Worboys | first=Michael | title=The history of dog breeds | website=The Week | date=2019-04-13 | url=https://theweek.com/articles/832600/history-dog-breeds | access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref><ref name=\"KC-Standard\">{{cite web | title=About Breed Standards | website=Home | url=https://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/activities/dog-showing/breed-standards/about-breed-standards/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> Different types or breeds of dog were being developed by breeders who wanted to define specific characteristics and desirable features in their dogs.<ref name=\"KC-Standard\"/> Driven by dog shows and the groups that hosted them, the term dog breed took on an entirely new meaning.

Over the past 200 years, dogs have undergone rapid [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] change and were formed into today's modern breeds due to [[artificial selection]] imposed by humans. These breeds can vary in size and weight from a {{convert|0.46|kg|lb|abbr=on}} teacup [[poodle]] to a {{convert|90|kg|lb|abbr=on}} giant [[mastiff]]. The skull, body, and limb proportions vary significantly between breeds, with dogs displaying more phenotypic diversity than can be found within the entire order of carnivores. Some breeds demonstrate outstanding skills in herding, retrieving, scent detection, and guarding, which demonstrates the functional and behavioral diversity of dogs. The first dogs were certainly wolflike, but the phenotypic changes that coincided with the dog\u2013wolf [[genetic divergence]] are not known.<ref name=freedman2017/>\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 years ago the domestic dog was present at what is now [[Zhokhov Island]], arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is {{convert|20-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}} based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between {{convert|16-25|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 ago and in the modern [[Siberian Husky]] breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at {{convert|30|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar-bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.<ref name=pitulko2017/>\n\nBetween 3,000 and 4,000 years ago greyhound-type dogs were depicted on pottery and paintings in Egypt and Western Asia.

These included spitz-breeds, toy dogs, spaniels, Mastiff-like breeds, small terriers, retrievers, herding dogs, scent-hounds, and sight-hounds. There were 17&nbsp;breeds that conflicted with phenotype or function and these were thought to be the result of crossing some of the other phenotypes. As in a 2004 study that found 9&nbsp;\u2018ancient breeds\u2019 to be genetically divergent, the study found 13&nbsp;breeds that were genetically divergent from the modern breeds: the [[Basenji]], [[Saluki]], [[Afghan hound]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Canaan dog]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[dingo]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Chinese Shar Pei]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan malamute]], [[Siberian husky]] and [[American Eskimo dog]]. Results also indicated that the [[Basenji]] had recent admixture with Middle Eastern wolves.<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\nThe study found that there were three well-supported groups that were highly divergent and distinct from modern domestic dogs. \n*an ''Asian group'' ([[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[chow chow]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]] and [[Shar Pei]]) that showed past admixture with Chinese wolves,\n*a ''Middle Eastern'' group ([[Afghan hound]] and [[Saluki]])\n*a ''northern group'' ([[Alaskan Malamute]] and [[Siberian Husky]]).<ref name=\"vonHoldt_etal_2010\" />\n\n===Basal breeds===\nIn 2012, a study looked at 49,000 [[SNP genotyping|single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that gave a [[genome]]-wide coverage of 1,375 dogs representing 35 breeds, 19 wolves, and previous published genetic signatures of other breeds, giving a total of 121 breeds covered. The study found a deep genetic split between old-world and new-world wolves, and confirmed the genetic divergence of 13 breeds from a 2010 study ([[Afghan Hound]], [[Akita (dog)|Akita]], [[Alaskan Malamute]], [[American Eskimo]], [[Basenji]], [[Canaan dog]], [[Chow Chow]], [[Dingo]], [[New Guinea singing dog]], [[Saluki]], [[Samoyed (dog)|Samoyed]], [[Shar-Pei]], [[Siberian Husky]]), plus another three: the [[Eurasier]], [[Finnish Spitz]] and [[Shiba Inu]].

The study indicated that throughout history, global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\nOf the basal breeds, the [[American Eskimo Dog]] and [[Eurasier]] were the very recent product of cross-breeding other basal breeds. Most basal breeds have hybridized with other lineages in the past. If those other lineages were other basal breeds then a basal genetic signature remains. The combination of introgression and past population bottlenecks suggested that basal breeds have little or no genetic connections to their ancestral populations and that their genetic distinctiveness does not signify ancient heritage. They are distinctive from the modern breeds because the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and the basal breeds have mostly avoided admixture with them due to geographic or cultural barriers.<ref name=larson2012/>\n\n===Medical research===\nAs dogs are a subspecies but their breeds are distinct genetic units, and because only certain breeds share the same type of cancers as humans, the differences in the genes of different breeds may be useful in human medical research.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cadieu | first1 = Edouard | last2 = Ostrander | first2 = Elaine A. | year = 2007| title = Canine Genetics Offers New Mechanisms for the Study of Human Cancer | url = http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/16/11/2181 | journal = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention | volume = 16 | issue = 11| pages = 2181\u20132183 | doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-07-2667 | pmid = 17982116 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n===Breed temperament===\nIn 2014, a study indicated that some breed-temperaments, such as anxiety or fear, may be linked to gene mutations.

Four varieties of the [[Belgian Shepherd Dog]] are recognised as four distinct breeds by the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nzkc.org.nz/pdf/breed_groups/working_standard.pdf | title=Standards of the Breeds: Group 5 \u2013 Working | publisher=New Zealand Kennel Club}}</ref> Further, some groups of dogs which clearly share a persistent set of characteristics and documented descent from a known foundation stock may still not be recognized by some clubs as breeds. For instance, the [[Feist (dog)|feist]] is a hunting dog raised in the [[Southern United States]] for hunting small game. Feists have a consistent set of characteristics that reliably differentiate them from other [[dog type]]s and breeds. However, the [[United Kennel Club]] recognizes one breed of feist, the [[Treeing Feist]], while the [[American Kennel Club]] does not recognize any feist breed.\n\nA dog is said to be [[Purebred (dog)|purebred]] if their parents were purebred and if the dog meets the standards of the breed. Purebred dog breeders of today \"have inherited a breeding paradigm that is, at the very least, a bit anachronistic in light of modern genetic knowledge, and that first arose out of a pretty blatant misinterpretation of Darwin and an enthusiasm for social theories that have long been discredited as scientifically insupportable and morally questionable.\"<ref name=\"Budiansky\">{{Cite book | last =Budiansky\" | first =Stephen | publication-date =2000 | title =The Truth About Dogs; an Inquiry into the Ancestry, Social Conventions, Mental Habits, and Moral Fiber of Canis familiaris | location =New York, U.S.A. | place = | publisher =Viking Penguin | page =[https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 35] | isbn =978-0-670-89272-3 | year =2000 | url =https://archive.org/details/truthaboutdogsin00budi/page/35 }}</ref> The American Kennel Club allows [[mixed-breed dog]]s to be shown but under the condition the animals have been spayed or neutered, are not a wolf hybrid, and not eligible for the AKC Foundation Stock Service Program or an AKC Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL).<ref name=\"AKC-Mixed\">{{cite web | title=Get Started - Register Your Mixed Breed Dog With AKC Canine Partners | website=American Kennel Club | date=2019-07-28 | url=https://www.akc.org/register/information/canine-partners/get-started/ | access-date=2019-08-09}}</ref> California Assembly Act AB 1634 was a bill introduced in 2007 that would require all non-working dogs of mixed breed over the age of 6 months to be neutered or spayed.<ref name=\"ab1634\">{{cite web|url=http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091025165548/http://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/07-08/bill/asm/ab_1601-1650/ab_1634_bill_20070531_amended_asm_v94.html |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> The bill was morally controversial, leading the American Kennel Club to fight the bill.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605222300/http://www.akc.org/canine_legislation/CA_action_center.cfm |archive-date=5 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian department of agriculture has strict standards for the documenting of what it calls \"evolving breeds\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/a-11.2/FullText.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726205721/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/A-11.2/FullText.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 July 2012 |title=Animal Pedigree Act 1985 |accessdate=9 April 2008 |work=Department of Justice, Canada }}</ref>\n\n====Breed standards====\nThe [[Breed standard (dogs)|breed standard]] for each breed of dog is a detailed description of the appearance and behaviour of an idealized dog of that breed.<ref>[http://www.akc.org/about/glossary.cfm American Kennel Club Glossary]</ref> Included in the breed standard description are externally observable aspects of appearance and behaviour that are considered by the breed club to be the most important for the breed, and externally observable details of appearance or temperament that are considered by the breed club to be unacceptable (called ''[[Fault (dog)|faults]]'').

Some versions of ''Scooby-Doo'' feature variations on the show's supernatural theme and include characters such as Scooby's cousin [[Scooby-Dum]] and nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] in addition to some of the original characters.\n\n''Scooby-Doo'' was originally broadcast on [[CBS]] from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. ABC aired variations of the show until canceling it in 1985, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children called ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' from 1988 until 1991. Two ''Scooby-Doo'' reboots aired as part of [[Kids' WB]] on [[The WB]] and its successor [[The CW]] from 2002 until 2008. Further reboots were produced for [[Cartoon Network]] beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2018. Repeats of the various ''Scooby-Doo'' series are frequently broadcast on Cartoon Network's sister channel [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] in the United States as well as other countries. The newest series ''[[Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?]]'' premiered on June 27, 2019 on Boomerang.\n\nIn 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Scooby-Doo'' the fifth greatest TV cartoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|work=TV Guide|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nIn 1968, [[consumer organization|parent-run organizations]], particularly [[Action for Children's Television]] (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons.<ref>{{cite web| first= William |last= Richter |title= Action for Children's Television|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021016074041/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| archivedate= October 16, 2002| url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| website= museum.tv| publisher= Museum of Broadcast Communications| accessdate= June 9, 2006}}</ref>  Most of these shows were [[Hanna-Barbera]] action cartoons such as ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'', ''[[The Herculoids]]'', and ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=Tim|title=Hi there, boys and girls! : America's local children's TV shows|date=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=1-57806-396-5|page=20}}</ref> Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\n\n[[Fred Silverman]], executive for [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime programming]] at [[CBS]], was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was ''[[The Archie Show]]'', based on [[Bob Montana]]'s teenage humor comic book ''[[Archie (comic book)|Archie]]''. Also successful were the musical numbers [[The Archies]] performed during each program (one of which, \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\", was the most successful ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one hit]] of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' [[old-time radio|radio]] [[radio drama|serials]] of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.<ref>Laurence Marcus & Stephen R.

Their treatment, based in part on ''The Archie Show'', was titled ''Mysteries Five'' and featured five teenagers: Geoff, Mike, Kelly, Linda, and Linda's brother W.W., along with their [[bongo drum|bongo]]-playing dog, Too Much, who collectively formed the band Mysteries Five. When The Mysteries Five were not performing at gigs, they were out solving spooky mysteries involving ghosts, [[zombie]]s, and other supernatural creatures. Ruby and Spears were unable to decide whether Too Much would be a large cowardly dog or a small feisty one.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> When the former was chosen, Ruby and Spears wrote Too Much as a [[Great Dane]] but revised the dog character to a large [[Old English Sheepdog|sheepdog]] (similar to the Archies' sheepdog, [[Hot Dog (comics)|Hot Dog]]) just before their presentation to Silverman, as Ruby feared the character would be too similar to the comic strip character [[Marmaduke]].<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> Silverman rejected their initial pitch, and after consulting with Barbera on next steps, got Barbera's permission to go ahead with Too Much being a Great Dane instead of a sheepdog.<ref name=\"STUEP1\">Shostak, Stu (February 5, 2012). \"[http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php Interview with Joe Ruby and Ken Spears]\".

New York, Los Angeles, CA: Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.</ref>\n\nThe TV influences of ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' and ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis|Dobie Gillis]]'' were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the ''Scooby-Doo'' teens and the ''Dobie Gillis'' teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same [[beatnik]]-style [[goatee]], similar hairstyles, and demeanors.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> The core premise of ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' was also similar to [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]'' books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories often revolved around a mystery which invariably turned out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to [[disguise]] the villain's true intent.\n\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a [[Bob Hope]]-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery.<ref name=RubyAndSpears /> Later versions of the show made slight changes to the characters' established roles, such as showing the Daphne in 1990s and 2000s ''Scooby-Doo'' productions as knowing many forms of [[karate]] and having the ability to defend herself, and reducing her tendency towards being kidnapped.\n\n''Scooby-Doo'' itself influenced many other Saturday morning [[cartoon]]s of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its rivals produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' (1970\u201371), ''[[The Funky Phantom]]'' (1971\u201372), ''[[The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan]]'' (1972\u201373), ''[[Speed Buggy]]'' (1973\u201374), ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]'' (1973\u201374), ''[[Jabberjaw]]'' (1976\u201378), ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]'' (1977\u201380), among others.<ref name=\"Burke and Burke-p105-119\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/saturdaymorningf00burk/page/105 |title=Saturday Morning Fever |last=1964\u2013 |first=Burke, Timothy |date=1999 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-16996-5 |edition=1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/saturdaymorningf00burk/page/105 105\u2013119] |oclc=38832996 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==== ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' ====\nIn 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' and ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', the comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, ''[[Super Friends]]'', a year later), and celebrities such as [[Sandy Duncan]], [[The Addams Family]], [[Cass Elliot]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[The Three Stooges]]. Hanna-Barbera musical director [[Hoyt Curtin]] composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme remained in use for much of ''Scooby-Doo's'' original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the ''New Movies'' format from 1972 to 1973, CBS began airing reruns of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' series until its option on the series expired in 1976.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" />\n\n=== ABC years (1976\u201391) ===\n==== ''The Scooby-Doo Show'' and ''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics'' ====\nNow president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976\u201377 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'', to create ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour]]'' (the show became ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' when a bonus ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin [[Scooby-Dum]], voiced by [[Daws Butler]], as a recurring character.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> The voice cast was held over from ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. [[Pat Stevens]] took over her role as the voice of Velma.\n\nFor the 1977\u201378 season, ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' became the two-hour programming block ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' (1977\u201378) with the addition of ''[[Laff-a-Lympics]]'' and ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]''. In addition to eight new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the ''All-Star'' block's ''Laff-a-Lympics'' series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''-esque parodies of [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the ''Laff-a-Lympics'' \"Scooby Doobies\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\n\n''Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics'' was retitled ''Scooby's All Stars'' for the 1978\u201379 season, reduced to 90 minutes when ''Dynomutt'' was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. ''Scooby's All-Stars'' continued broadcasting reruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' aired during a separate half-hour under the ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' banner. After nine weeks, the separate ''Where are You!'' broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the ''Scooby's All-Stars'' block.<ref>Lenberg, Jeff (2006).

The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.\n\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost ''Scooby-Doo''{{'}}s slipping [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\" /> The 1979\u201380 episodes, aired under the new title ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. [[Lennie Weinrib]] voiced Scrappy in the 1979\u201380 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter.<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/|title=Scrappy Days: The Birth of Scrappy-Doo and What I Had to Do with It|first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\n\n==== ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts ====\nAs a result of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's'' success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (shorts)|new ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' format]] now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute ''Scooby and Scrappy'' cartoons, who in previous ''Scooby'' series had been revealed to be human criminals in [[costume]], were now real within the context of the series.\n\nThis version of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show]]'', an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'' cartoon, adapted from the [[Harvey Comics]] character. From 1982 to 1983, ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' were part of ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour]]'', a co-production with [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] which featured two ''Scooby and Scrappy'' shorts, a ''Scrappy and Yabba-Doo'' short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his [[Western (genre)|Western]] deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and ''[[The Puppy's New Adventures]]'', based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.\n\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of ''Scooby-Doo'' were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles ''Scooby-Doo Classics'', ''[[Scary Scooby Funnies]]'', ''The Best of Scooby-Doo'', and ''[[Scooby's Mystery Funhouse]]'', the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.<ref name=\"McNeil3\">McNeil, Alex (1996).

New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-024916-8}}</ref>\n\n==== ''The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show'' ====\n''Scooby-Doo'' was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'' in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\n\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title ''The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries''. The 1984\u201385 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\n\n==== ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' ====\n1985 saw the debut of ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by [[Susan Blu]])<ref name=\"TRueggerInterview\" /> and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by [[Vincent Price]]) traveling the globe to capture \"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\" The final first-run episode of ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new ''Scooby'' series aired on the network for the next two years.\n\n==== ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' ====\nHanna-Barbera reincarnated the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' cast as [[elementary school]] students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', which debuted on ABC in 1988. ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]], and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original ''Scooby'' series for a more ''[[Looney Tunes]]''-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later ''Scooby'' productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\n''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was developed and produced by [[Tom Ruegger]], who had been the head [[story editor]] on ''Scooby-Doo'' since 1983. Following the first season of ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to [[Warner Bros. Animation]] to develop ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' and later ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and ''[[Freakazoid!]]''.<ref name=\"TRueggerInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Tom Ruegger is back!|publisher=Platypuscomix.net|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Reruns and reboots (1987\u2013present) ==\n=== TV movies, reruns, and direct-to-video films ===\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'', a series of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Television film|TV movies]] featuring their most popular characters, including [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[The Flintstones]] and [[The Jetsons]]. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'' (1987), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'' (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', originally broadcast by [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] in 1994, [[Don Messick]]'s final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\n\nReruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' have been in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 1980, and have also been shown on [[cable television]] networks such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]] (until 1989) and [[USA Network]] (as part of the [[USA Cartoon Express]] from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With [[Turner Broadcasting]] purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]].<ref name=\"STUEP10\" /> [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] network [[TELETOON (Canada)|Teletoon]] began airing ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' in 1997, with the other ''Scooby'' series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, ''Scooby-Doo'' became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\nWith ''Scooby-Doo's'' restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network,<ref name=\"STUEP10\">Shostak, Stu (December 3, 2014). \"[http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php Interview with Jerry Beck]\".

The first four DTV entries were ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' (1998), ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'' (1999), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'' (2000), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 [[Burger King]] commercial.<ref name=\"KasemVegetarian\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1908941,00.html|work=Time|title=Radio Host Casey Kasem|first=Laura|last=Fitzpatrick|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> Therefore, [[Scott Innes]] took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy ([[Billy West]] voiced Shaggy in ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island''). [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] took over as Velma, and [[Mary Kay Bergman]] voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\n\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island'', featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-worshiping cat creatures in the [[Louisiana]] bayou. ''Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost'' featured an author (voice of [[Tim Curry]]) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. ''The Witch's Ghost'' introduced a [[goth rock]] band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise.\n\n''Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase'' was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company [[Warner Bros. Animation]] following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation continued production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new ''Scooby-Doo'' series for television.\n\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]'' (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'', using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature [[Matthew Lillard]] as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical ''Scooby-Doo'' films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named ''[[Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon]]''.\n\nIn addition, a live-action TV movie, ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'', was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut.<ref>Scooby-Doo: No Big Mystery, Third Live-Action Movie in the Works ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.

The show contains obvious influences of ''Scooby-Doo'', where \"The Scoobies\" use books to look up monsters. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], the actress who plays [[Buffy Summers]] on the series, later went on to appear as [[Daphne Blake]] in the live-action films ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]''.\n* Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang (based on their classic 1972 incarnation as opposed to their more recent incarnations) appear in the second part of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases\" in which they team up with Batman and Robin to rescue [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic|Weird Al]] who was kidnapped by [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] and [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]].\n* The song ''Scooby-Doo and the Snowmen Mystery'' was released in 1972 in the United Kingdom by the label [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]].\n* The film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' includes an alternate ending called the \"Scooby-Doo Ending\" in which a character in the film is revealed to have been wearing a mask.

Animation]] have produced numerous follow-up and spin-off animated series and several related works, including television specials and made-for-TV movies, a line of direct-to-video films, and two Warner Bros.\u2013produced theatrical feature films. Some versions of ''Scooby-Doo'' feature variations on the show's supernatural theme and include characters such as Scooby's cousin [[Scooby-Dum]] and nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] in addition to some of the original characters.\n\n''Scooby-Doo'' was originally broadcast on [[CBS]] from 1969 to 1976, when it moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. ABC aired variations of the show until canceling it in 1985, and presented a spin-off featuring the characters as children called ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'' from 1988 until 1991. Two ''Scooby-Doo'' reboots aired as part of [[Kids' WB]] on [[The WB]] and its successor [[The CW]] from 2002 until 2008. Further reboots were produced for [[Cartoon Network]] beginning in 2010 and continuing through 2018. Repeats of the various ''Scooby-Doo'' series are frequently broadcast on Cartoon Network's sister channel [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] in the United States as well as other countries. The newest series ''[[Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?]]'' premiered on June 27, 2019 on Boomerang.\n\nIn 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Scooby-Doo'' the fifth greatest TV cartoon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvguide.com/News/Greatest-Cartoons-TV-Guide-Magazine-1071203.aspx|title=TV Guide Magazine's 60 Greatest Cartoons of All Time|work=TV Guide|accessdate=October 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\nIn 1968, [[consumer organization|parent-run organizations]], particularly [[Action for Children's Television]] (ACT), began protesting what they perceived as excessive violence in Saturday-morning cartoons.<ref>{{cite web| first= William |last= Richter |title= Action for Children's Television|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20021016074041/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| archivedate= October 16, 2002| url= http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/actionforch/actionforch.htm| website= museum.tv| publisher= Museum of Broadcast Communications| accessdate= June 9, 2006}}</ref>  Most of these shows were [[Hanna-Barbera]] action cartoons such as ''[[Space Ghost (TV series)|Space Ghost]]'', ''[[The Herculoids]]'', and ''[[Birdman and the Galaxy Trio]]'', and virtually all of them were canceled by 1969 because of pressure from the parent groups.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hollis|first1=Tim|title=Hi there, boys and girls! : America's local children's TV shows|date=2001|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=1-57806-396-5|page=20}}</ref> Members of these watchgroups served as advisers to Hanna-Barbera and other animation studios to ensure that new programs would be safe for children.\n\n[[Fred Silverman]], executive for [[Daytime television in the United States|daytime programming]] at [[CBS]], was then looking for a show that would both revitalize his Saturday-morning line and please the watch groups. The result was ''[[The Archie Show]]'', based on [[Bob Montana]]'s teenage humor comic book ''[[Archie (comic book)|Archie]]''. Also successful were the musical numbers [[The Archies]] performed during each program (one of which, \"[[Sugar, Sugar]]\", was the most successful ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|number-one hit]] of 1969). Eager to build upon this success, Silverman contacted producers [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] about creating another show based on a teenage rock group, this time featuring teens who solved mysteries between gigs. Silverman envisioned the show as a cross between the popular ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' [[old-time radio|radio]] [[radio drama|serials]] of the 1940s and either the Archie characters or the popular early 1960s television series ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.<ref>Laurence Marcus & Stephen R.

New York, Los Angeles, CA: Warner Bros. Entertainment, Inc.</ref>\n\nThe TV influences of ''[[I Love a Mystery]]'' and ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis|Dobie Gillis]]'' were apparent in the first episodes. Of the similarities between the ''Scooby-Doo'' teens and the ''Dobie Gillis'' teens, the similarities between Shaggy and Maynard are the most noticeable; both characters share the same [[beatnik]]-style [[goatee]], similar hairstyles, and demeanors.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> The core premise of ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' was also similar to [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''[[The Famous Five (novel series)|Famous Five]]'' books. Both series featured four youths with a dog, and the Famous Five stories often revolved around a mystery which invariably turned out not to be supernaturally based, but simply a ruse to [[disguise]] the villain's true intent.\n\nThe role of each character was strongly defined in the series: Fred is the leader and the determined detective, Velma is the intelligent analyst, Daphne is danger-prone, Shaggy is a coward more motivated by hunger than any desire to solve mysteries, and Scooby is similar to Shaggy, save for a [[Bob Hope]]-inspired tendency towards temporary bravery.<ref name=RubyAndSpears /> Later versions of the show made slight changes to the characters' established roles, such as showing the Daphne in 1990s and 2000s ''Scooby-Doo'' productions as knowing many forms of [[karate]] and having the ability to defend herself, and reducing her tendency towards being kidnapped.\n\n''Scooby-Doo'' itself influenced many other Saturday morning [[cartoon]]s of the 1970s. During that decade, Hanna-Barbera and its rivals produced several animated programs also featuring teenage detectives solving mysteries with a pet or mascot of some sort, including ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' (1970\u201371), ''[[The Funky Phantom]]'' (1971\u201372), ''[[The Amazing Chan and the Chan Clan]]'' (1972\u201373), ''[[Speed Buggy]]'' (1973\u201374), ''[[Goober and the Ghost Chasers]]'' (1973\u201374), ''[[Jabberjaw]]'' (1976\u201378), ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]'' (1977\u201380), among others.<ref name=\"Burke and Burke-p105-119\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/saturdaymorningf00burk/page/105 |title=Saturday Morning Fever |last=1964\u2013 |first=Burke, Timothy |date=1999 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=0-312-16996-5 |edition=1st St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |pages=[https://archive.org/details/saturdaymorningf00burk/page/105 105\u2013119] |oclc=38832996 |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n==== ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' ====\nIn 1972, new one-hour episodes under the title ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' were created; each episode featuring a real or fictitious guest star helping the gang solve mysteries, including characters from other Hanna-Barbera series such as ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'' and ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', the comic book characters [[Batman]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (later adapted into their own Hanna-Barbera series, ''[[Super Friends]]'', a year later), and celebrities such as [[Sandy Duncan]], [[The Addams Family]], [[Cass Elliot]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Don Knotts]] and [[The Three Stooges]]. Hanna-Barbera musical director [[Hoyt Curtin]] composed a new theme song for this series, and Curtin's theme remained in use for much of ''Scooby-Doo's'' original broadcast run. After two seasons and 24 episodes of the ''New Movies'' format from 1972 to 1973, CBS began airing reruns of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' series until its option on the series expired in 1976.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" />\n\n=== ABC years (1976\u201391) ===\n==== ''The Scooby-Doo Show'' and ''Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics'' ====\nNow president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], Fred Silverman made a deal with Hanna-Barbera to bring new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' to the ABC Saturday morning lineup, where the show went through almost yearly lineup changes. For their 1976\u201377 season, 16 new episodes of Scooby-Doo were joined with a new Hanna-Barbera show, ''[[Dynomutt, Dog Wonder]]'', to create ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour]]'' (the show became ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' when a bonus ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' rerun was added to the package in November 1976). Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, now working for Silverman as supervisors of the ABC Saturday morning programs, returned the program to its original ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' format, with the addition of Scooby's dim-witted country cousin [[Scooby-Dum]], voiced by [[Daws Butler]], as a recurring character.<ref name=\"STUEP1\" /> The voice cast was held over from ''The New Scooby-Doo Movies'' save for Nicole Jaffe, who retired from acting in 1973. [[Pat Stevens]] took over her role as the voice of Velma.\n\nFor the 1977\u201378 season, ''The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Show'' became the two-hour programming block ''[[Scooby's All-Star Laff-A-Lympics]]'' (1977\u201378) with the addition of ''[[Laff-a-Lympics]]'' and ''[[Captain Caveman and the Teen Angels]]''. In addition to eight new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' and reruns of the 1969 show, Scooby-Doo also appeared during the ''All-Star'' block's ''Laff-a-Lympics'' series, which featured 45 Hanna-Barbera characters competing in ''[[Battle of the Network Stars]]''-esque parodies of [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic]] sporting events. Scooby was seen as the team captain of the ''Laff-a-Lympics'' \"Scooby Doobies\" team, which also featured Shaggy and Scooby-Dum among its members.\n\n''Scooby's All-Star Laff-a-Lympics'' was retitled ''Scooby's All Stars'' for the 1978\u201379 season, reduced to 90 minutes when ''Dynomutt'' was spun off into its own half-hour and the 1969 reruns were dropped. ''Scooby's All-Stars'' continued broadcasting reruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' from 1976 and 1977, while new episodes of ''Scooby-Doo'' aired during a separate half-hour under the ''Scooby-Doo, Where are You!'' banner. After nine weeks, the separate ''Where are You!'' broadcast was cancelled, and the remainder of the 16 new 1978 episodes debuted during the ''Scooby's All-Stars'' block.<ref>Lenberg, Jeff (2006).

The special revolved around Shaggy and Scooby attempting to convince the network to move Scooby out of Saturday morning and into a prime-time series, and featured spoofs of then-current television series and films such as ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]'', ''[[Laverne & Shirley]]'' and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.\n\nIn 1979, Scooby's tiny nephew [[Scrappy-Doo]] was added to both the series and the billing, in an attempt to boost ''Scooby-Doo''{{'}}s slipping [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\" /> The 1979\u201380 episodes, aired under the new title ''[[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (1979 TV series)|Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo]]'' as an independent half-hour show, succeeded in regenerating interest in the show. [[Lennie Weinrib]] voiced Scrappy in the 1979\u201380 episodes, with Don Messick assuming the role thereafter.<ref name=\"ScrappyDays\">{{cite web|url=http://www.newsfromme.com/writings/scrappy-days/|title=Scrappy Days: The Birth of Scrappy-Doo and What I Had to Do with It|first=Mark|last=Evanier|authorlink=Mark Evanier|publisher=Newsfromme.com|accessdate=September 2, 2013}}</ref> Marla Frumkin replaced Pat Stevens as the voice of Velma mid-season.\n\n==== ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' shorts ====\nAs a result of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo's'' success, the entire show was overhauled in 1980 to focus more upon Scrappy-Doo. At this time, Scooby-Doo started to walk and run anthropomorphically on two feet more often, rather than on four like a normal dog as he did previously. Fred, Daphne, and Velma were dropped from the series, and the [[Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo (shorts)|new ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' format]] now consisted of three seven-minute comedic adventures starring Scooby, Scrappy, and Shaggy instead of one half-hour mystery. Most of the supernatural villains in the seven-minute ''Scooby and Scrappy'' cartoons, who in previous ''Scooby'' series had been revealed to be human criminals in [[costume]], were now real within the context of the series.\n\nThis version of ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' first aired from 1980 to 1982 as part of ''[[The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show]]'', an hour-long program also featuring episodes of Hanna-Barbera's new ''[[Richie Rich (1980 TV series)|Richie Rich]]'' cartoon, adapted from the [[Harvey Comics]] character. From 1982 to 1983, ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' were part of ''[[The Scooby-Doo/Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour]]'', a co-production with [[Ruby-Spears Productions]] which featured two ''Scooby and Scrappy'' shorts, a ''Scrappy and Yabba-Doo'' short featuring Scrappy-Doo and his [[Western (genre)|Western]] deputy uncle Yabba-Doo, and ''[[The Puppy's New Adventures]]'', based on characters from a 1977 Ruby-Spears TV special.\n\nBeginning in 1980, a half-hour of reruns from previous incarnations of ''Scooby-Doo'' were broadcast on ABC Saturday mornings in addition to first-run episodes. Airing under the titles ''Scooby-Doo Classics'', ''[[Scary Scooby Funnies]]'', ''The Best of Scooby-Doo'', and ''[[Scooby's Mystery Funhouse]]'', the rerun package remained on the air until the end of the 1986 season.<ref name=\"McNeil3\">McNeil, Alex (1996). ''Total Television'' (4th ed.), pg. 732. New York: Penguin Books. {{ISBN|0-14-024916-8}}</ref>\n\n==== ''The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show'' ====\n''Scooby-Doo'' was restored to a standalone half-hour in 1983 with ''[[The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show]]'' in 1983, which comprised two 11-minute mysteries per episode in a format reminiscent of the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' mysteries. Heather North returned to the voice cast as Daphne, who in this incarnation solved mysteries with Shaggy, Scooby, and Scrappy while working undercover as a reporter for a teen magazine.\n\nThis version of the show lasted for two seasons, with the second season airing under the title ''The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries''. The 1984\u201385 season episodes featured semi-regular appearances from Fred and Velma, with Frank Welker and Marla Frumkin resuming their respective roles for these episodes.\n\n==== ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' ====\n1985 saw the debut of ''[[The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo]]'', which featured Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, Scrappy, and new characters Flim-Flam (voiced by [[Susan Blu]])<ref name=\"TRueggerInterview\" /> and Vincent Van Ghoul (based upon and voiced by [[Vincent Price]]) traveling the globe to capture \"thirteen of the most terrifying ghosts upon the face of the earth.\" The final first-run episode of ''The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo'' aired in December 1985, and after its reruns were removed from the ABC lineup the following March, no new ''Scooby'' series aired on the network for the next two years.\n\n==== ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' ====\nHanna-Barbera reincarnated the original ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' cast as [[elementary school]] students (a common trope in 1980s children's TV) for a new series titled ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', which debuted on ABC in 1988. ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was an irreverent re-imagining of the series, heavily inspired by the classic cartoons of [[Tex Avery]] and [[Bob Clampett]], and eschewed the realistic aesthetic of the original ''Scooby'' series for a more ''[[Looney Tunes]]''-like style, including an episode where Scooby-Doo's parents show up and reveal his real name to be \"Scoobert\". At the same time, the series returned to its original formula in that the group unmasked human villains in costume, as opposed to the supernatural monsters of the early to mid-1980s. The series also established \"Coolsville\" as the name of the gang's hometown; this setting was retained for several of the later ''Scooby'' productions. The retooled show was a success, remaining in production for four seasons and on ABC's lineup until 1991.\n\n''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'' was developed and produced by [[Tom Ruegger]], who had been the head [[story editor]] on ''Scooby-Doo'' since 1983. Following the first season of ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', Ruegger and much of his unit defected from Hanna-Barbera to [[Warner Bros. Animation]] to develop ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures|Steven Spielberg Presents Tiny Toon Adventures]]'' and later ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'', and ''[[Freakazoid!]]''.<ref name=\"TRueggerInterview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/people/ruegger2.html|title=Tom Ruegger is back!|publisher=Platypuscomix.net|accessdate=May 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Reruns and reboots (1987\u2013present) ==\n=== TV movies, reruns, and direct-to-video films ===\nFrom 1987 to 1988, Hanna-Barbera Productions produced ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'', a series of [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] [[Television film|TV movies]] featuring their most popular characters, including [[Yogi Bear]], [[Huckleberry Hound]], [[The Flintstones]] and [[The Jetsons]]. Scooby-Doo, Scrappy-Doo and Shaggy starred in three of these movies: ''[[Scooby-Doo Meets the Boo Brothers]]'' (1987), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Ghoul School]]'' (1988), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf]]'' (1988). These three films took their tone from the early-1980s ''Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo'' entries, and featured the characters encountering actual monsters and ghosts rather than masqueraded people. Scooby-Doo and Shaggy later appeared as the narrators of the made-for-TV movie ''[[Scooby-Doo in Arabian Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', originally broadcast by [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] in 1994, [[Don Messick]]'s final outing as the original voice of Scooby-Doo.\n\nReruns of ''Scooby-Doo'' have been in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] since 1980, and have also been shown on [[cable television]] networks such as [[TBS (TV network)|TBS Superstation]] (until 1989) and [[USA Network]] (as part of the [[USA Cartoon Express]] from 1990 to 1994). In 1993, ''A Pup Named Scooby-Doo'', having just recently ended its network run on ABC, began reruns on the Cartoon Network. With [[Turner Broadcasting]] purchasing Hanna-Barbera in 1991, in 1994 the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise became exclusive to the Turner networks: Cartoon Network, TBS Superstation, and [[Turner Network Television|TNT]].<ref name=\"STUEP10\" /> [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] network [[TELETOON (Canada)|Teletoon]] began airing ''Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!'' in 1997, with the other ''Scooby'' series soon following. When TBS and TNT ended their broadcasts of H-B cartoons in 1998, ''Scooby-Doo'' became the exclusive property of both Cartoon Network and sister station [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]].\n\nWith ''Scooby-Doo's'' restored popularity in reruns on Cartoon Network,<ref name=\"STUEP10\">Shostak, Stu (December 3, 2014). \"[http://www.stusshow.com/archives.php Interview with Jerry Beck]\".

The first four DTV entries were ''[[Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island]]'' (1998), ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost]]'' (1999), ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Alien Invaders]]'' (2000), and ''[[Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase]]'' (2001). Frank Welker was the only original voice cast member to return for these productions. Don Messick had died in 1997 and Casey Kasem, a strict vegetarian, relinquished the role of Shaggy after having to provide the voice for a 1995 [[Burger King]] commercial.<ref name=\"KasemVegetarian\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1908941,00.html|work=Time|title=Radio Host Casey Kasem|first=Laura|last=Fitzpatrick|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=October 30, 2017}}</ref> Therefore, [[Scott Innes]] took over as both Scooby-Doo and Shaggy ([[Billy West]] voiced Shaggy in ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island''). [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B.J. Ward]] took over as Velma, and [[Mary Kay Bergman]] voiced Daphne until her death in November 1999, and was replaced by [[Grey DeLisle]].\n\nThese first four direct-to-video films differed from the original series format by placing the characters in plots with a darker tone and pitting them against actual supernatural forces. ''Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island'', featured the original 1969 gang, reunited after years of being apart, fighting [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]]-worshiping cat creatures in the [[Louisiana]] bayou. ''Scooby-Doo! and the Witch's Ghost'' featured an author (voice of [[Tim Curry]]) returning to his hometown with the gang, to find out that an event is being haunted by the author's dead ancestor Sarah, who was an actual witch. ''The Witch's Ghost'' introduced a [[goth rock]] band known as The Hex Girls, who became recurring characters in the ''Scooby-Doo'' franchise.\n\n''Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase'' was the final production made by the Hanna-Barbera studio, which was absorbed into parent company [[Warner Bros. Animation]] following William Hanna's death in 2001. Warner Animation continued production of the direct-to-video series while also producing new ''Scooby-Doo'' series for television.\n\nThe direct-to-video productions continued to be produced concurrently with at least one entry per year. Two of these entries, ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Legend of the Vampire]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and the Monster of Mexico]]'' (both 2003) were produced in a retro-style reminiscent of the original series, and featured Heather North and Nicole Jaffe as the voices of Daphne and Velma, respectively. Later entries produced between 2004 and 2009 were done in the style of ''What's New, Scooby-Doo'', using that show's voice cast. Entries from 2010 on use the original 1969 designs and feature [[Matthew Lillard]] as the voice of Shaggy, the character Lillard portrayed in the live-action theatrical ''Scooby-Doo'' films. Two Scooby-Doo! movies were released in 2016, named ''[[Lego Scooby-Doo! Haunted Hollywood]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo! and WWE: Curse of the Speed Demon]]''.\n\nIn addition, a live-action TV movie, ''[[Scooby-Doo! The Mystery Begins]]'', was released on DVD and simultaneously aired on Cartoon Network on September 13, 2009, the 40th anniversary of the series' debut.<ref>Scooby-Doo: No Big Mystery, Third Live-Action Movie in the Works ''TVSeriesFinale.com''.

The villains, led by \"Dr. Phibes\" (based primarily upon [[Dr. Evil]] from the ''[[Austin Powers (film series)|Austin Powers]] ''series, and named after Vincent Price's character from ''[[The Abominable Dr. Phibes]]''), then use different schemes to try to get the invention from Shaggy and Scooby, who handle the plots alone.

The show contains obvious influences of ''Scooby-Doo'', where \"The Scoobies\" use books to look up monsters. [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], the actress who plays [[Buffy Summers]] on the series, later went on to appear as [[Daphne Blake]] in the live-action films ''[[Scooby-Doo (film)|Scooby-Doo]]'' and ''[[Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed]]''.\n* Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Inc. gang (based on their classic 1972 incarnation as opposed to their more recent incarnations) appear in the second part of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode \"Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases\" in which they team up with Batman and Robin to rescue [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic|Weird Al]] who was kidnapped by [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] and [[Penguin (character)|The Penguin]].\n* The song ''Scooby-Doo and the Snowmen Mystery'' was released in 1972 in the United Kingdom by the label [[Music for Pleasure (record label)|Music for Pleasure]].\n* The film ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' includes an alternate ending called the \"Scooby-Doo Ending\" in which a character in the film is revealed to have been wearing a mask. It also includes a reference to the iconic line \"Let's see who this really is\" before removing the mask.\n* ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' has a brief scene where the title characters hitch a ride in the Mystery Machine with Scooby and the gang.\n* The [[Filk music|filk]] band [[Ookla the Mok (band)|Ookla the Mok]] open their 2003 album ''Oh Okay LA'' with the song \"W.W.S.D.?\" (\"What Would Scooby Do?\"), which proposes a [[Deontological ethics|deontological]] system of [[Ethics|moral philosophy]] based on the actions of Scooby-Doo.\n* In October 1999, [[Cartoon Network]] made a Scooby-Doo spoof of ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' called ''The Scooby-Doo Project''.\n* A ''Scooby-Doo'' parody appeared in the ''[[Mad (TV series)|Mad]]'' episode \"Kitchen Nightmares Before Christmas / How I Met Your Mummy\".\n* ''Scooby-Doo'' was parodied on ''[[Futurama]]'' episode \"Saturday Morning Fun Pit\", where the characters from Planet Express take on the roles of the gang (Bender as Scooby, Hermes as Fred, Leela as Daphne, Amy as Velma and Fry as Shaggy).\n* The ''[[The Venture Bros.|Venture Bros.]]'' episode \"\u00a1Viva los Muertos!\" features a thinly parodied version of the gang as aging, gone-to-seed miscreants with the characters matched to corresponding serial killers and radical figures, e.g. Fred being mixed with [[Ted Bundy]] into the composite character \"Ted\".\n* The series is parodied in the animated music video for the song \"[[Ghost (Mystery Skulls song)|Ghost]]\" by [[Mystery Skulls]].\n* The [[animated series]] ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'' has a parody of Scooby-Doo called \"[[List of Arthur characters|Spooky-Poo]]\".\n* In the ''[[South Park]]'' episode \"[[Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery]]\", the nu metal band [[Korn]], parodying Scooby and the gang, tackle an invasion of mysterious \"Pirate Ghosts\". They enlist the help of [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick]], and after they solve the mystery they perform \"[[Falling Away from Me]]\" from their album ''[[Issues (Korn album)|Issues]]''.\n* ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' defends the gang against possession charges in the 2002 episode \"Shaggy Busted\".\n* In the ''[[Teen Titans Go!
