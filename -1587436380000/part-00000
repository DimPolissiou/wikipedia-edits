{"title_page": "Silent e", "text_new": "{{Short description|common occurrence of \"e\" as a silent letter in English, like in \"like\"}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Silent ''e''}}\n{{for|unpronounced {{angle bracket|e}} in French|e muet}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nIn [[English orthography]], many words feature a '''silent {{angle bracket|e}}''' (single, final, non-syllabic <e>), most commonly at the end of a [[word]] or [[morpheme]]. Typically it represents a vowel sound that was formerly pronounced, but became [[silent letter|silent]] in late [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]].\n\nIn a large class of words, as a consequence of a series of [[#History|historical sound changes]], including the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the presence of a suffix on the end of a word influenced the development of the preceding vowel, and in a smaller number of cases it affected the pronunciation of a preceding consonant. When the inflection disappeared in speech, but remained as a historical remnant in the spelling, this silent {{angle bracket|e}} was reinterpreted synchronically as a marker of the surviving sounds. \n\nThis can be seen in the vowels in word-pairs such as ''rid'' {{IPAc-en|r|\u026a|d}} and ''ride'' {{IPAc-en|r|a\u026a|d}}, in which the presence of the final, unpronounced {{angle bracket|e}} appears to alter the sound of the preceding {{angle bracket|i}}. An example with consonants is the word-pair ''loath'' (lo\u028a\u03b8) and ''loathe'' (lo\u028a\u00f0), where the {{angle bracket|e}} can be understood as a marker of a voiced {{angle bracket|th}}. \n\nAs a result of this reinterpretation, the {{angle bracket|e}} was added by analogy in [[Early Modern English]] to many words which had never had a pronounced {{angle bracket|e}}-inflection, and it is used in modern neologisms such as ''bike'', in which there is no historical reason for the presence of the {{angle bracket|e}} other than the need to mark the pronunciation of the preceding vowel.\n\nAlthough Modern English orthography is not entirely consistent here, the correlation is common enough to allow a [[rule-of-thumb]] to be used to explain the spelling, especially in early schooling, where a silent {{angle bracket|e}} which has this effect is sometimes called a '''magic {{angle bracket|e}}''' or '''bossy {{angle bracket|e}}'''. Structured Word Inquiry{{what?}} uses the term silent {{angle bracket|e}}.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramsden|first=Melvyn|date=2004|title=Suffix Checker|url=http://files.realspellers.org/PetesFolder/resources/Checker-standard.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  \n\n==Effect on vowels==\nDepending on [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]], English has anywhere from 13 to more than 20 distinct vowel [[phoneme]]s, both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s. A silent {{angle bracket|e}}, in association with the [[Latin alphabet]]'s five vowel characters, is one of the ways by which some of these vowel sounds are represented in [[English orthography]]. \n\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} in association with the other vowels may convert a [[short vowel]] sound to a long vowel equivalent, though that may not always be the case. The short vowels are {{IPAc-en|\u00e6|_|\u025b|_|\u026a|_|\u0252|_|\u028c}} while the equivalent long vowels are {{IPAc-en|e\u026a|_|i\u02d0|_|a\u026a|_|o\u028a|_|j|u\u02d0}}. However, because of the complications of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the long vowel is not always simply a lengthened version of the corresponding short one; and in most cases (for example with ''ride'') is in fact a diphthong ({{IPAc-en|r|a\u026a|d}}). \n\nTo create a long vowel, there is usually only one consonant between the silent {{angle bracket|e}} and the preceding vowel. In some cases two consonants may also have the same effect, as in ''table'', ''paste'' and ''bathe'', while in other cases no consonants are also found, as in ''tie'', ''toe'' and ''due''. The presence of a [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|double consonant]] may indicate that the {{angle bracket|e}} is not silent and does not affect the preceding vowel (as in ''[[Jesse]]'' and ''posse'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Short vowel<br>Without silent {{angle bracket|e}}\n!Long vowel<br>With silent {{angle bracket|e}}\n![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription\n|-\n|| ''sl\u0103t'' || ''sl\u0101t\u0247''|| {{IPA|/sl\u00e6t/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/sle\u026at/}}\n|-\n|| ''m\u0115t'' || ''m\u0113t\u0247'' || {{IPA|/m\u025bt/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/mi\u02d0t/}}\n|-\n|| ''gr\u012dp''|| ''gr\u012bp\u0247''|| {{IPA|/\u0261r\u026ap/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u0261ra\u026ap/}}\n|-\n|| ''c\u014fd'' || ''c\u014dd\u0247'' || {{IPA|/k\u0252d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/ko\u028ad/}}\n|-\n|| ''c\u016dt'' || ''c\u016bt\u0247'' || {{IPA|/k\u028ct/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/kju\u02d0t/}}\n|}\n\nIn English, the \"[[letter name]]\" of a vowel is its long vowel form (except in the case of {{angle bracket|y}}, which has the same pronunciation as {{angle bracket|i}} \u2013 compare ''byte/bite'').\n\nThis terminology reflects the historical pronunciation and development of those vowels, but as a phonetic description of their current values it may no longer be accurate. The English values of the letters {{angle bracket|a, e, i, o, u}} used to be similar to the values those letters had in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] or [[Italian language|Italian]], namely {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|e}}, {{IPAblink|i}}, {{IPAblink|o}}, {{IPAblink|u}}. The [[Great Vowel Shift]] leading to [[Early Modern English]] gave current English \"long vowels\" values that differ markedly from the \"short vowels\" that they relate to in writing.  Since English has a literary tradition that goes back into the Middle English period, written English continues to use Middle English writing conventions to mark distinctions that had been reordered by the [[chain shift]] of the long vowels. However, the pronunciation of {{angle bracket|u}} before silent {{angle bracket|e}}, found mainly in borrowings from French and Latin, is a consequence not of the Great Vowel Shift but of a [[Phonological history of English high back vowels#Development of the sequence /ju\u02d0/|different series of changes]].\n\nWhen final {{angle bracket|e}} is ''not'' silent, this may be indicated in various ways in English spelling.  When representing {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}, this is usually done via doubling (''employee'', with ''[[wikt:employe|employe]]'' as an obsolete spelling, ''refugee'').  Non-silent {{angle bracket|e}} can also be indicated by a [[diacritical mark]], such as a [[grave accent]] (''learn\u00e8d'') or a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''learn\u00ebd, Bront\u00eb'').  Other diacritical marks are preserved in [[loanword]]s (''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'', ''caf\u00e9'', ''blas\u00e9''), or [[hyperforeignism|introduced]] on this pattern (''[[Mate (beverage)|mat\u00e9]]''), though these diacritics are frequently omitted.  Other words have no indication that the {{angle bracket|e}} is not silent (''[[wikt:pace#Etymology_2|pace]]'', Latin loan meaning \"with due respect to\"). \n\n===The {{angle bracket|a}} group===\nThe sounds of the {{angle bracket|a}} group are some of the more dialectically-complex features of contemporary modern English; the [[phoneme]]s represented in modern \"short\" {{angle bracket|a}} include {{IPAc-en|\u00e6}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}}, and {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}.  See ''[[broad A]]'' and ''[[Phonological history of English low back vowels#Cot\u2013caught merger|cot\u2013caught merger]]'' for some of the cross-dialect complexities of the English {{angle bracket|a}} group.  A silent {{angle bracket|e}} typically moves {{angle bracket|a}} to {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|e}} group===\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}} typically moves {{angle bracket|e}} to {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}.  This change is generally consistent across nearly all English dialects today, though previously many dialects used {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} instead before migrating to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}.  Some parts of [[Mid-Ulster English]] still use {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|i}} group===\nFor the \"long vowel\" represented in written English by {{angle bracket|i}}, the effect of silent {{angle bracket|e}} is to turn it into a [[diphthong]] {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|o}} group===\nShort {{angle bracket|o}} often falls in with short {{angle bracket|a}} and shares some of the complexities of that group.  Variously, the written short {{angle bracket|o}} can represent {{IPAc-en|\u0252}}, {{IPAc-en|\u028c}}, and {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}.  The usual effect of silent {{angle bracket|e}} on written {{angle bracket|o}} is to fix it as a long {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}} sound.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|u}} group===\nShort {{angle bracket|u}} can variably represent either {{IPAc-en|\u028c}} or {{IPAc-en|\u028a}}, as a result of the [[Phonological_history_of_English_high_back_vowels#Foot.E2.80.93strut_split|''foot\u2013strut'' split]].  Silent {{angle bracket|e}} generally turns {{angle bracket|u}} to its corresponding long version {{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}}, which [[Phonological history of English high back vowels#Development of the sequence /ju\u02d0/|developed from Middle English {{IPA|/\u026au/}}]].  Variably by dialect and even word, the {{IPAc-en|j}} in this {{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}} may [[yod-dropping|drop]] (''rune'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|u\u02d0|n}}, ''lute'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|u\u02d0|t}}), causing a merger with {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}}; in other cases, the {{IPA|/j/}} [[yod-coalescence|coalesces]] with the preceding consonant (''issue'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|s|.|j|u\u02d0}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|u\u02d0}}), meaning that the silent {{angle bracket|e}} can affect the quality of a consonant much earlier in the word (''educate'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|d\u0292|u|k|e\u026a|t}}, ''nature'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|n|e\u026a|t\u0283|\u0259r}}).\n\n==Effect on consonants==\nIn addition to indicating that a preceding vowel is a long vowel, a silent {{angle bracket|e}} when it immediately follows a (c) or (g) also indicates that the (c) is a [[Hard and soft C|soft {{angle bracket|c}}]] and (g) is a [[Hard and soft G|soft {{angle bracket|g}}]]. For example:\n\n*''M\u0103c'' > ''m\u0101c\u0247'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u00e6|k}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|e\u026a|s}})\n*''st\u0103g'' > ''st\u0101g\u0247'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|\u00e6|\u0261}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|e\u026a|d\u0292}})\n\nwhere {{IPAc-en|s}} is the expected outcome of the {{angle bracket|ce}} [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]], and the {{angle bracket|g}} in ''huge'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|d\u0292}}. The same effect on (c) and (g), but not the preceding vowel, arises in words such as \u201cchance\u201d, \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cforge\u201d. To stop this softening effect, a silent (u) is added before (e), as in \u201cplague\u201d, \u201cfugue\u201d and \u201ccatalogue.\u201d{{NoteTag |The American spelling, \"catalog,\" has neither the {{Grapheme|u}} nor silent e.}}\n\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}} is used in some words with {{angle bracket|dg}} in which it does not lengthen a vowel: ''r\u012ddg\u0247'', ''sl\u0115dg\u0247'', ''h\u014fdg\u0247-p\u014fdg\u0247''.  Spelling such words with {{angle bracket|j}}, the other letter that indicates that sound, does not occur in native or nativized English words.\n\nThe same softening effect ({{Grapheme|c}} {{IPA|/k/ \u2192 /s/}} and {{angle bracket|g}} {{IPA|/g/ \u2192 /d\u0292/}}) also arises with a following (i) or (y).\n\nIn word final position, a similar softening effect can occur with the digraph [[Pronunciation of English \u27e8th\u27e9|{{angle bracket|th}}]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/ \u2192 /\u00f0/}}; often the form with the {{angle bracket|e}} is a verb related to the noun form without the e:\n* ''bath, bathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u00e6\u03b8/, /be\u026a\u00f0/}})\n* ''breath, breathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u0279\u025b\u03b8/, /b\u0279i\u00f0/}})\n* ''cloth, clothe'' ({{IPA|/kl\u0254\u03b8/, /klo\u028a\u00f0/}})\n\n==Truly silent {{angle bracket|e}}==\nIn some common words that historically had long vowels, silent {{angle bracket|e}} no longer has its usual lengthening effect. For example, the {{angle bracket|o}} in ''come'' (as compared to in ''cone'') and in ''done'' (as compared to in ''dome'').  This is especially common in some words that historically had {{angle bracket|f}} instead of {{angle bracket|v}}, such as ''give'' and ''love''; in [[Old English language|Old English]], {{IPAslink|f}} became {{IPAslink|v}} when it appeared between two vowels (OE ''giefan, lufu''), while a [[Gemination|geminated]] {{angle bracket|ff}} lost its doubling to yield {{IPAslink|f}} in that position.  This also applies to a large class of words with the adjective suffix ''[[wikt:-ive|-ive]]'', such as ''captive'' (where, again, the {{angle bracket|i}} is not lengthened, unlike in ''hive''), that originally had ''[[wikt:-if|-if]]'' in French.  \n\nSome loanwords from French (''promenade'') retained their French silent {{angle bracket|e}}, called [[French_phonology#Schwa|''e muet'' or ''e caduc'']], which has no effect on the preceding vowel. Also, the feminine forms of some words of French origin end in a silent {{angle bracket|e}}, for example ''fianc\u00e9e'' and ''n\u00e9e''.\n\nSome English words vary their accented syllable based on whether they are used as [[noun]]s or as [[adjective]]s.  In a few words such as ''minute'', this may affect the operation of silent {{angle bracket|e}}: as an adjective, ''min\u00fate'' ({{IPAc-en|m|a\u026a|\u02c8|nj|u\u02d0|t}}, \"small\") has the usual value of {{angle bracket|u}} followed by silent {{angle bracket|e}}, while as a noun ''m\u00ednute'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u026a|n|\u1d7b|t}}, the unit of time) silent {{angle bracket|e}} does not operate.  See [[initial-stress-derived noun]] for similar patterns that may give rise to exceptions.\n\nHistorically, following the French usage, it was the practice to add a silent {{angle bracket|e}} at the end of words for aesthetic purposes. For example, words ending in ''-le'' (as in ''subtle'' and ''table'') as well as following an (s) (such as ''house'' and ''tense'', etc) have a redundant silent {{angle bracket|e}}.\n\n==Dropping of silent {{angle bracket|e}}==\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} is usually dropped when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added to a word, for example: ''cope'' to ''coping'', ''trade'' to ''tradable'', ''tense'' to ''tension'', ''captive'' to ''captivate'', ''plague'' to ''plaguing'', ''secure'' to ''security'', ''create'' to ''creator'', etc. However, this is inconsistently applied, as in the case of ''liveable''. In the case of the \"-ment\" suffix, there is also a divergence of practice. In [[American English]], ''judge'' usually becomes ''judgment'', while in [[British English]] the e is usually retained, as in ''judgement''. Other words with an uncertain practice include ''movement'', ''incitement'', ''involvement'', besides others.\n\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} is not usually dropped in compound words, such as ''comeback''.\n\n==History==\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}}, like many conventions of [[literary language|written language]] that no longer reflect current pronunciations, was not always silent.  In [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Balade]]'', the first line does not scan properly unless what appears to current eyes to be a silent {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced:\n\n:''Hyd, Absolon, thy gilt'''\u00e8''' tresses cler'''\u00e8'''''\n\n''Gilte'' ends in the same sound as modern English ''Malta''. In [[Middle English]], this final [[schwa]] had some grammatical significance, although that was mostly lost by Chaucer's time.  It was [[elision|elided]] regularly when a word beginning with a vowel came next.  The consequences of silent {{angle bracket|e}} in contemporary spelling reflect the phonology of Middle English.  In Middle English, as a consequence of the [[lax vowel]] rule shared by most [[Germanic languages]], vowels were [[vowel length|long]] when they historically occurred in [[lexical stress|stressed]] open [[syllable]]s; they were short when they occurred in \"checked\" or closed syllables.  Thus ''bide'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bi\u02d0d\u0259/}} had a long vowel, while ''bid'' {{IPA|/bid/}} had a short one.\n\nThe historical sequence went something like this:\n* In [[Old English language|Old English]], a [[phonology|phonological distinction]] was made between [[vowel length|long and short vowels]].\n* In Middle English, vowel length was lost as a phonological feature, but was still phonetically present. A word like ''bide'', syllabified ''bi.de'' and phonetically {{IPA|[bi\u02d0d\u0259]}}, had one stressed, open, long syllable. On the other hand, the word ''bid'', although stressed, had a short vowel: {{IPA|[bid]}}.\n* At some point unknown, the phonetically long vowels began to [[diphthong]]ize. This was the start of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Possibly at the same time, the short vowels became lax. So as \"bide\" {{IPA|[bi\u02d0d\u0259]}} became {{IPA|[b\u0268id\u0259]}}, \"bid\" {{IPA|[bid]}} changed to {{IPA|[b\u026ad]}}.\n* At a later point, all word-final schwas were lost. The phonetic motivation for lengthening the vowel\u2014the open syllable\u2014was lost, but the process of diphthongization had already begun, and the vowels which had once been identical except for length were now phonetically dissimilar and phonologically distinct.\n\nThe writing convention of silent {{angle bracket|e}} indicates that different vowel qualities had become phonemic, and were preserved even when phonemic vowel length was lost.\n\nLong vowels could arise by other mechanisms. One of these is known as \"[[compensatory lengthening]]\"; this occurred when consonants formerly present were lost: ''maid'' is the modern descendant of Old English ''m\u00e6gde''. In this example, the ''g'' actually became a glide {{IPA|/j/}}, so in a sense, the length of the consonant stayed where it always had been, and there was no \"compensation.\" The silent {{angle bracket|e}} rule became available to represent long vowels in writing that arose from other sources; Old English ''br\u0177d'', representing *''bru\u0292d-i-'', became Modern English ''bride''. \n\nThe rules of current English spelling were first set forth by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in his 1582 publication ''Elementarie''.  Mulcaster called silent {{angle bracket|e}} \"qualifying {{angle bracket|e}}\", and wrote of it:\n<blockquote>It altereth the sound of all the vowells, euen quite thorough one or mo consonants as, m\u00e1de, st\u00e9me, \u00e9che, k\u00ednde, str\u00edpe, \u00f3re, c\u00fare, t\u00f3ste sound sharp with the qualifying E in their end: whereas, m\u00e0d, st\u00e8m, \u00e8ch, frind, strip, or, cut, tost, contract of tossed sound flat without the same E, And therefor the same loud and sharp sound in the word, calleth still for the qualifying e, in the end, as the flat and short nedeth it not. It qualifyeth no ending vowell, bycause it followeth none in the end, sauing i. as in daie, maie, saie, trewlie, safetie, where it maketh i, either not to be heard, or verie gentlie to be heard, which otherwise would sound loud and sharp, and must be expressed by y. as, deny, aby, ally. Which kinde of writing shalbe noted hereafter. It altereth also the force of, c, g, s, tho it sound not after them, as in hence, for that, which might sound henk, if anie word ended in c. in swinge differing from swing, in vse differing from vs.\n</blockquote>\nMulcaster also formulated the rule that a [[double letter]], when final, indicated a short vowel in English, while the absence of doubling and the presence of silent {{angle bracket|e}} made the vowel long.  In modern English, this rule is most prominent in its effects on the written \"a\" series:\n* ''gal, gall, gale'' ({{IPA|/\u0261\u00e6l, /\u0261\u0254\u02d0l/, /\u0261e\u026al/}}).\n\n[[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] are sometimes treated as single letters for purposes of this rule:\n* ''bath, bathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u00e6\u03b8/, /be\u026a\u00f0/}})\n* ''breath, breathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u0279\u025b\u03b8/, /b\u0279i\u00f0/}})\n* ''cloth, clothe'' ({{IPA|/kl\u0254\u03b8/, /klo\u028a\u00f0/}})\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n* [[Tom Lehrer]] wrote a song called \"Silent E\" for the [[children's television]] series ''[[The Electric Company]]'' in 1971.  In it, he asks the musical questions:\n*:''Who can turn a ''c\u0103n'' into a ''c\u0101n\u0247''?<br>Who can turn a ''p\u0103n'' into a ''p\u0101n\u0247''?<br>It's not too hard to see.<br>It's Silent \"E\"!''\n* A series of similar songs about \"Magic E\" was featured in the [[United Kingdom|British]] educational series ''[[Look and Read]]'' between 1974 and 1994, written by [[Roger Limb]] and [[Rosanna Hibbert]] and performed by [[Derek Griffiths]].\n* In ''[[Alphablocks]]'', Magic E is E's impish alter-ego, with a black ninja outfit and a [[top hat]]. He does not speak, but in the episode ''Magic'', he sings a song about himself while he causes mischief.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n===Notes===\n{{Notefoot}}\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[I before E except after C]]\n* [[Silent letter]]\n* {{section link|Albanian language|Sounds}}, the [[Gheg]] dialect of Albanian also uses \"silent e\" to mark long vowels earlier in the word\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.indiana.edu/~reading/phonics/u2/whistory.pdf ''Early Modern English''] ([[PDF]])\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050503170131/http://www.reading.org/Library/Retrieve.cfm?D=10.1598%2FRRQ.34.1.6&F=RRQ-34-1-Templeton.pdf ''Questions teachers ask about spelling''] by Shane Templeton and Darrell Morris (PDF)\n*[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/p/pd-modeng/pd-modeng-idx?type=header&byte=51422115 ''Elementarie'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Richard Mulcaster\n*[http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.misc.html#silente ''Silent E''], complete lyrics by Tom Lehrer\n*[http://www.lookandread.fsnet.co.uk/downloads/ ''Look and Read'' downloads], including a version of the ''Magic E'' song\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silent E}}\n[[Category:English spelling|E]]\n[[Category:Silent letters|E]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|common occurrence of \"e\" as a silent letter in English, like in \"like\"}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Silent ''e''}}\n{{for|unpronounced {{angle bracket|e}} in French|e muet}}\n{{IPA notice}}\nIn [[English orthography]], many words feature a '''silent {{angle bracket|e}}''' (single, final, non-syllabic <e>), most commonly at the end of a [[word]] or [[morpheme]]. Typically it represents a vowel sound that was formerly pronounced, but became [[silent letter|silent]] in late [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]].\n\nIn a large class of words, as a consequence of a series of [[#History|historical sound changes]], including the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the presence of a suffix on the end of a word influenced the development of the preceding vowel, and in a smaller number of cases it affected the pronunciation of a preceding consonant. When the inflection disappeared in speech, but remained as a historical remnant in the spelling, this silent {{angle bracket|e}} was reinterpreted synchronically as a marker of the surviving sounds. \n\nThis can be seen in the vowels in word-pairs such as ''rid'' {{IPAc-en|r|\u026a|d}} and ''ride'' {{IPAc-en|r|a\u026a|d}}, in which the presence of the final, unpronounced {{angle bracket|e}} appears to alter the sound of the preceding {{angle bracket|i}}. An example with consonants is the word-pair ''loath'' (lo\u028a\u03b8) and ''loathe'' (lo\u028a\u00f0), where the {{angle bracket|e}} can be understood as a marker of a voiced {{angle bracket|th}}. \n\nAs a result of this reinterpretation, the {{angle bracket|e}} was added by analogy in [[Early Modern English]] to many words which had never had a pronounced {{angle bracket|e}}-inflection, and it is used in modern neologisms such as ''bike'', in which there is no historical reason for the presence of the {{angle bracket|e}} other than the need to mark the pronunciation of the preceding vowel.\n\nAlthough Modern English orthography is not entirely consistent here, the correlation is common enough to allow a [[rule-of-thumb]] to be used to explain the spelling, especially in early schooling, where a silent {{angle bracket|e}} which has this effect is sometimes called a '''magic {{angle bracket|e}}''' or '''bossy {{angle bracket|e}}'''. Structured Word Inquiry uses the term '''silent {{angle bracket|e}}'''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ramsden|first=Melvyn|date=2004|title=Suffix Checker|url=http://files.realspellers.org/PetesFolder/resources/Checker-standard.pdf|format=PDF}}</ref>  \n\n==Effect on vowels==\nDepending on [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]], English has anywhere from 13 to more than 20 distinct vowel [[phoneme]]s, both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s. A silent {{angle bracket|e}}, in association with the [[Latin alphabet]]'s five vowel characters, is one of the ways by which some of these vowel sounds are represented in [[English orthography]]. \n\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} in association with the other vowels may convert a [[short vowel]] sound to a long vowel equivalent, though that may not always be the case. The short vowels are {{IPAc-en|\u00e6|_|\u025b|_|\u026a|_|\u0252|_|\u028c}} while the equivalent long vowels are {{IPAc-en|e\u026a|_|i\u02d0|_|a\u026a|_|o\u028a|_|j|u\u02d0}}. However, because of the complications of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], the long vowel is not always simply a lengthened version of the corresponding short one; and in most cases (for example with ''ride'') is in fact a diphthong ({{IPAc-en|r|a\u026a|d}}). \n\nTo create a long vowel, there is usually only one consonant between the silent {{angle bracket|e}} and the preceding vowel. In some cases two consonants may also have the same effect, as in ''table'', ''paste'' and ''bathe'', while in other cases no consonants are also found, as in ''tie'', ''toe'' and ''due''. The presence of a [[Digraph (orthography)#Double letters|double consonant]] may indicate that the {{angle bracket|e}} is not silent and does not affect the preceding vowel (as in ''[[Jesse]]'' and ''posse'').\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Short vowel<br>Without silent {{angle bracket|e}}\n!Long vowel<br>With silent {{angle bracket|e}}\n![[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] transcription\n|-\n|| ''sl\u0103t'' || ''sl\u0101t\u0247''|| {{IPA|/sl\u00e6t/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/sle\u026at/}}\n|-\n|| ''m\u0115t'' || ''m\u0113t\u0247'' || {{IPA|/m\u025bt/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/mi\u02d0t/}}\n|-\n|| ''gr\u012dp''|| ''gr\u012bp\u0247''|| {{IPA|/\u0261r\u026ap/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/\u0261ra\u026ap/}}\n|-\n|| ''c\u014fd'' || ''c\u014dd\u0247'' || {{IPA|/k\u0252d/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/ko\u028ad/}}\n|-\n|| ''c\u016dt'' || ''c\u016bt\u0247'' || {{IPA|/k\u028ct/}} \u2192 {{IPA|/kju\u02d0t/}}\n|}\n\nIn English, the \"[[letter name]]\" of a vowel is its long vowel form (except in the case of {{angle bracket|y}}, which has the same pronunciation as {{angle bracket|i}} \u2013 compare ''byte/bite'').\n\nThis terminology reflects the historical pronunciation and development of those vowels, but as a phonetic description of their current values it may no longer be accurate. The English values of the letters {{angle bracket|a, e, i, o, u}} used to be similar to the values those letters had in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[French language|French]] or [[Italian language|Italian]], namely {{IPAblink|a}}, {{IPAblink|e}}, {{IPAblink|i}}, {{IPAblink|o}}, {{IPAblink|u}}. The [[Great Vowel Shift]] leading to [[Early Modern English]] gave current English \"long vowels\" values that differ markedly from the \"short vowels\" that they relate to in writing.  Since English has a literary tradition that goes back into the Middle English period, written English continues to use Middle English writing conventions to mark distinctions that had been reordered by the [[chain shift]] of the long vowels. However, the pronunciation of {{angle bracket|u}} before silent {{angle bracket|e}}, found mainly in borrowings from French and Latin, is a consequence not of the Great Vowel Shift but of a [[Phonological history of English high back vowels#Development of the sequence /ju\u02d0/|different series of changes]].\n\nWhen final {{angle bracket|e}} is ''not'' silent, this may be indicated in various ways in English spelling.  When representing {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}, this is usually done via doubling (''employee'', with ''[[wikt:employe|employe]]'' as an obsolete spelling, ''refugee'').  Non-silent {{angle bracket|e}} can also be indicated by a [[diacritical mark]], such as a [[grave accent]] (''learn\u00e8d'') or a [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]] (''learn\u00ebd, Bront\u00eb'').  Other diacritical marks are preserved in [[loanword]]s (''r\u00e9sum\u00e9'', ''caf\u00e9'', ''blas\u00e9''), or [[hyperforeignism|introduced]] on this pattern (''[[Mate (beverage)|mat\u00e9]]''), though these diacritics are frequently omitted.  Other words have no indication that the {{angle bracket|e}} is not silent (''[[wikt:pace#Etymology_2|pace]]'', Latin loan meaning \"with due respect to\"). \n\n===The {{angle bracket|a}} group===\nThe sounds of the {{angle bracket|a}} group are some of the more dialectically-complex features of contemporary modern English; the [[phoneme]]s represented in modern \"short\" {{angle bracket|a}} include {{IPAc-en|\u00e6}}, {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0}}, and {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}.  See ''[[broad A]]'' and ''[[Phonological history of English low back vowels#Cot\u2013caught merger|cot\u2013caught merger]]'' for some of the cross-dialect complexities of the English {{angle bracket|a}} group.  A silent {{angle bracket|e}} typically moves {{angle bracket|a}} to {{IPAc-en|e\u026a}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|e}} group===\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}} typically moves {{angle bracket|e}} to {{IPAc-en|i\u02d0}}.  This change is generally consistent across nearly all English dialects today, though previously many dialects used {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}} instead before migrating to {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}.  Some parts of [[Mid-Ulster English]] still use {{IPA|/e\u02d0/}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|i}} group===\nFor the \"long vowel\" represented in written English by {{angle bracket|i}}, the effect of silent {{angle bracket|e}} is to turn it into a [[diphthong]] {{IPAc-en|a\u026a}}.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|o}} group===\nShort {{angle bracket|o}} often falls in with short {{angle bracket|a}} and shares some of the complexities of that group.  Variously, the written short {{angle bracket|o}} can represent {{IPAc-en|\u0252}}, {{IPAc-en|\u028c}}, and {{IPAc-en|\u0254\u02d0}}.  The usual effect of silent {{angle bracket|e}} on written {{angle bracket|o}} is to fix it as a long {{IPAc-en|o\u028a}} sound.\n\n===The {{angle bracket|u}} group===\nShort {{angle bracket|u}} can variably represent either {{IPAc-en|\u028c}} or {{IPAc-en|\u028a}}, as a result of the [[Phonological_history_of_English_high_back_vowels#Foot.E2.80.93strut_split|''foot\u2013strut'' split]].  Silent {{angle bracket|e}} generally turns {{angle bracket|u}} to its corresponding long version {{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}}, which [[Phonological history of English high back vowels#Development of the sequence /ju\u02d0/|developed from Middle English {{IPA|/\u026au/}}]].  Variably by dialect and even word, the {{IPAc-en|j}} in this {{IPAc-en|j|u\u02d0}} may [[yod-dropping|drop]] (''rune'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|r|u\u02d0|n}}, ''lute'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|l|u\u02d0|t}}), causing a merger with {{IPAc-en|u\u02d0}}; in other cases, the {{IPA|/j/}} [[yod-coalescence|coalesces]] with the preceding consonant (''issue'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|s|.|j|u\u02d0}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u026a|\u0283|u\u02d0}}), meaning that the silent {{angle bracket|e}} can affect the quality of a consonant much earlier in the word (''educate'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u025b|d\u0292|u|k|e\u026a|t}}, ''nature'' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|n|e\u026a|t\u0283|\u0259r}}).\n\n==Effect on consonants==\nIn addition to indicating that a preceding vowel is a long vowel, a silent {{angle bracket|e}} when it immediately follows a (c) or (g) also indicates that the (c) is a [[Hard and soft C|soft {{angle bracket|c}}]] and (g) is a [[Hard and soft G|soft {{angle bracket|g}}]]. For example:\n\n*''M\u0103c'' > ''m\u0101c\u0247'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u00e6|k}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|e\u026a|s}})\n*''st\u0103g'' > ''st\u0101g\u0247'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|\u00e6|\u0261}} \u2192 {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|t|e\u026a|d\u0292}})\n\nwhere {{IPAc-en|s}} is the expected outcome of the {{angle bracket|ce}} [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]], and the {{angle bracket|g}} in ''huge'' is pronounced {{IPAc-en|d\u0292}}. The same effect on (c) and (g), but not the preceding vowel, arises in words such as \u201cchance\u201d, \u201cchange\u201d and \u201cforge\u201d. To stop this softening effect, a silent (u) is added before (e), as in \u201cplague\u201d, \u201cfugue\u201d and \u201ccatalogue.\u201d{{NoteTag |The American spelling, \"catalog,\" has neither the {{Grapheme|u}} nor silent e.}}\n\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}} is used in some words with {{angle bracket|dg}} in which it does not lengthen a vowel: ''r\u012ddg\u0247'', ''sl\u0115dg\u0247'', ''h\u014fdg\u0247-p\u014fdg\u0247''.  Spelling such words with {{angle bracket|j}}, the other letter that indicates that sound, does not occur in native or nativized English words.\n\nThe same softening effect ({{Grapheme|c}} {{IPA|/k/ \u2192 /s/}} and {{angle bracket|g}} {{IPA|/g/ \u2192 /d\u0292/}}) also arises with a following (i) or (y).\n\nIn word final position, a similar softening effect can occur with the digraph [[Pronunciation of English \u27e8th\u27e9|{{angle bracket|th}}]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/ \u2192 /\u00f0/}}; often the form with the {{angle bracket|e}} is a verb related to the noun form without the e:\n* ''bath, bathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u00e6\u03b8/, /be\u026a\u00f0/}})\n* ''breath, breathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u0279\u025b\u03b8/, /b\u0279i\u00f0/}})\n* ''cloth, clothe'' ({{IPA|/kl\u0254\u03b8/, /klo\u028a\u00f0/}})\n\n==Truly silent {{angle bracket|e}}==\nIn some common words that historically had long vowels, silent {{angle bracket|e}} no longer has its usual lengthening effect. For example, the {{angle bracket|o}} in ''come'' (as compared to in ''cone'') and in ''done'' (as compared to in ''dome'').  This is especially common in some words that historically had {{angle bracket|f}} instead of {{angle bracket|v}}, such as ''give'' and ''love''; in [[Old English language|Old English]], {{IPAslink|f}} became {{IPAslink|v}} when it appeared between two vowels (OE ''giefan, lufu''), while a [[Gemination|geminated]] {{angle bracket|ff}} lost its doubling to yield {{IPAslink|f}} in that position.  This also applies to a large class of words with the adjective suffix ''[[wikt:-ive|-ive]]'', such as ''captive'' (where, again, the {{angle bracket|i}} is not lengthened, unlike in ''hive''), that originally had ''[[wikt:-if|-if]]'' in French.  \n\nSome loanwords from French (''promenade'') retained their French silent {{angle bracket|e}}, called [[French_phonology#Schwa|''e muet'' or ''e caduc'']], which has no effect on the preceding vowel. Also, the feminine forms of some words of French origin end in a silent {{angle bracket|e}}, for example ''fianc\u00e9e'' and ''n\u00e9e''.\n\nSome English words vary their accented syllable based on whether they are used as [[noun]]s or as [[adjective]]s.  In a few words such as ''minute'', this may affect the operation of silent {{angle bracket|e}}: as an adjective, ''min\u00fate'' ({{IPAc-en|m|a\u026a|\u02c8|nj|u\u02d0|t}}, \"small\") has the usual value of {{angle bracket|u}} followed by silent {{angle bracket|e}}, while as a noun ''m\u00ednute'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|m|\u026a|n|\u1d7b|t}}, the unit of time) silent {{angle bracket|e}} does not operate.  See [[initial-stress-derived noun]] for similar patterns that may give rise to exceptions.\n\nHistorically, following the French usage, it was the practice to add a silent {{angle bracket|e}} at the end of words for aesthetic purposes. For example, words ending in ''-le'' (as in ''subtle'' and ''table'') as well as following an (s) (such as ''house'' and ''tense'', etc) have a redundant silent {{angle bracket|e}}.\n\n==Dropping of silent {{angle bracket|e}}==\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} is usually dropped when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added to a word, for example: ''cope'' to ''coping'', ''trade'' to ''tradable'', ''tense'' to ''tension'', ''captive'' to ''captivate'', ''plague'' to ''plaguing'', ''secure'' to ''security'', ''create'' to ''creator'', etc. However, this is inconsistently applied, as in the case of ''liveable''. In the case of the \"-ment\" suffix, there is also a divergence of practice. In [[American English]], ''judge'' usually becomes ''judgment'', while in [[British English]] the e is usually retained, as in ''judgement''. Other words with an uncertain practice include ''movement'', ''incitement'', ''involvement'', besides others.\n\nA silent {{angle bracket|e}} is not usually dropped in compound words, such as ''comeback''.\n\n==History==\nSilent {{angle bracket|e}}, like many conventions of [[literary language|written language]] that no longer reflect current pronunciations, was not always silent.  In [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer's]] ''[[The Legend of Good Women|Balade]]'', the first line does not scan properly unless what appears to current eyes to be a silent {{angle bracket|e}} is pronounced:\n\n:''Hyd, Absolon, thy gilt'''\u00e8''' tresses cler'''\u00e8'''''\n\n''Gilte'' ends in the same sound as modern English ''Malta''. In [[Middle English]], this final [[schwa]] had some grammatical significance, although that was mostly lost by Chaucer's time.  It was [[elision|elided]] regularly when a word beginning with a vowel came next.  The consequences of silent {{angle bracket|e}} in contemporary spelling reflect the phonology of Middle English.  In Middle English, as a consequence of the [[lax vowel]] rule shared by most [[Germanic languages]], vowels were [[vowel length|long]] when they historically occurred in [[lexical stress|stressed]] open [[syllable]]s; they were short when they occurred in \"checked\" or closed syllables.  Thus ''bide'' {{IPA|/\u02c8bi\u02d0d\u0259/}} had a long vowel, while ''bid'' {{IPA|/bid/}} had a short one.\n\nThe historical sequence went something like this:\n* In [[Old English language|Old English]], a [[phonology|phonological distinction]] was made between [[vowel length|long and short vowels]].\n* In Middle English, vowel length was lost as a phonological feature, but was still phonetically present. A word like ''bide'', syllabified ''bi.de'' and phonetically {{IPA|[bi\u02d0d\u0259]}}, had one stressed, open, long syllable. On the other hand, the word ''bid'', although stressed, had a short vowel: {{IPA|[bid]}}.\n* At some point unknown, the phonetically long vowels began to [[diphthong]]ize. This was the start of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Possibly at the same time, the short vowels became lax. So as \"bide\" {{IPA|[bi\u02d0d\u0259]}} became {{IPA|[b\u0268id\u0259]}}, \"bid\" {{IPA|[bid]}} changed to {{IPA|[b\u026ad]}}.\n* At a later point, all word-final schwas were lost. The phonetic motivation for lengthening the vowel\u2014the open syllable\u2014was lost, but the process of diphthongization had already begun, and the vowels which had once been identical except for length were now phonetically dissimilar and phonologically distinct.\n\nThe writing convention of silent {{angle bracket|e}} indicates that different vowel qualities had become phonemic, and were preserved even when phonemic vowel length was lost.\n\nLong vowels could arise by other mechanisms. One of these is known as \"[[compensatory lengthening]]\"; this occurred when consonants formerly present were lost: ''maid'' is the modern descendant of Old English ''m\u00e6gde''. In this example, the ''g'' actually became a glide {{IPA|/j/}}, so in a sense, the length of the consonant stayed where it always had been, and there was no \"compensation.\" The silent {{angle bracket|e}} rule became available to represent long vowels in writing that arose from other sources; Old English ''br\u0177d'', representing *''bru\u0292d-i-'', became Modern English ''bride''. \n\nThe rules of current English spelling were first set forth by [[Richard Mulcaster]] in his 1582 publication ''Elementarie''.  Mulcaster called silent {{angle bracket|e}} \"qualifying {{angle bracket|e}}\", and wrote of it:\n<blockquote>It altereth the sound of all the vowells, euen quite thorough one or mo consonants as, m\u00e1de, st\u00e9me, \u00e9che, k\u00ednde, str\u00edpe, \u00f3re, c\u00fare, t\u00f3ste sound sharp with the qualifying E in their end: whereas, m\u00e0d, st\u00e8m, \u00e8ch, frind, strip, or, cut, tost, contract of tossed sound flat without the same E, And therefor the same loud and sharp sound in the word, calleth still for the qualifying e, in the end, as the flat and short nedeth it not. It qualifyeth no ending vowell, bycause it followeth none in the end, sauing i. as in daie, maie, saie, trewlie, safetie, where it maketh i, either not to be heard, or verie gentlie to be heard, which otherwise would sound loud and sharp, and must be expressed by y. as, deny, aby, ally. Which kinde of writing shalbe noted hereafter. It altereth also the force of, c, g, s, tho it sound not after them, as in hence, for that, which might sound henk, if anie word ended in c. in swinge differing from swing, in vse differing from vs.\n</blockquote>\nMulcaster also formulated the rule that a [[double letter]], when final, indicated a short vowel in English, while the absence of doubling and the presence of silent {{angle bracket|e}} made the vowel long.  In modern English, this rule is most prominent in its effects on the written \"a\" series:\n* ''gal, gall, gale'' ({{IPA|/\u0261\u00e6l, /\u0261\u0254\u02d0l/, /\u0261e\u026al/}}).\n\n[[Digraph (orthography)|Digraphs]] are sometimes treated as single letters for purposes of this rule:\n* ''bath, bathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u00e6\u03b8/, /be\u026a\u00f0/}})\n* ''breath, breathe'' ({{IPA|/b\u0279\u025b\u03b8/, /b\u0279i\u00f0/}})\n* ''cloth, clothe'' ({{IPA|/kl\u0254\u03b8/, /klo\u028a\u00f0/}})\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n* [[Tom Lehrer]] wrote a song called \"Silent E\" for the [[children's television]] series ''[[The Electric Company]]'' in 1971.  In it, he asks the musical questions:\n*:''Who can turn a ''c\u0103n'' into a ''c\u0101n\u0247''?<br>Who can turn a ''p\u0103n'' into a ''p\u0101n\u0247''?<br>It's not too hard to see.<br>It's Silent \"E\"!''\n* A series of similar songs about \"Magic E\" was featured in the [[United Kingdom|British]] educational series ''[[Look and Read]]'' between 1974 and 1994, written by [[Roger Limb]] and [[Rosanna Hibbert]] and performed by [[Derek Griffiths]].\n* In ''[[Alphablocks]]'', Magic E is E's impish alter-ego, with a black ninja outfit and a [[top hat]]. He does not speak, but in the episode ''Magic'', he sings a song about himself while he causes mischief.\n\n== Notes and references ==\n===Notes===\n{{Notefoot}}\n===References===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[I before E except after C]]\n* [[Silent letter]]\n* {{section link|Albanian language|Sounds}}, the [[Gheg]] dialect of Albanian also uses \"silent e\" to mark long vowels earlier in the word\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.indiana.edu/~reading/phonics/u2/whistory.pdf ''Early Modern English''] ([[PDF]])\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050503170131/http://www.reading.org/Library/Retrieve.cfm?D=10.1598%2FRRQ.34.1.6&F=RRQ-34-1-Templeton.pdf ''Questions teachers ask about spelling''] by Shane Templeton and Darrell Morris (PDF)\n*[http://www.hti.umich.edu/cgi/p/pd-modeng/pd-modeng-idx?type=header&byte=51422115 ''Elementarie'']{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Richard Mulcaster\n*[http://dmdb.org/lyrics/lehrer.misc.html#silente ''Silent E''], complete lyrics by Tom Lehrer\n*[http://www.lookandread.fsnet.co.uk/downloads/ ''Look and Read'' downloads], including a version of the ''Magic E'' song\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Silent E}}\n[[Category:English spelling|E]]\n[[Category:Silent letters|E]]\n", "name_user": "Nixinova", "label": "safe", "comment": "already introduced", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_e"}

Bennett and Boyd sought members \"not only for literary work, but also for social development\", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tessier, Denise, \"History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years\". 2000</ref> Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met around 1869 in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members when they first decided to form a new society.<ref>William Urban et al., ''Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century''. Monmouth College, 1979</ref> Soon after, they recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.[[File:Minnie Stewart House.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Minnie Stewart House]] in Monmouth, where the sorority was founded|alt=|left]]\n\nThe six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on the first chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma, later known as the Alpha chapter. They chose a golden key as their badge and ordered their badges from Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter was also drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted for October 13, 1870 to be recognized as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined.\n\nIn 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby St. Mary's Seminary. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at Indiana University. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years.\n\nIn 1882 Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly [[Magazine|journal]],''The Key''. Today, it is published triannually and printed through Watkins Printing Company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bairdsmanualame00bairgoog|quote=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities.|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|last1=Baird|first1=William Raimond|last2=Brown|first2=James Taylor|publisher=G.

This meeting resulted in the organization of the first interfraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|edition=Seventh|page=57|oclc=912380768|authorlink=G. William Domhoff|title-link=Who Rules America?}}</ref>\n\nOn January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved their headquarters from 530 East Town Street in Columbus, Ohio to their new location at 6640 Riverside Drive in Dublin, Ohio.\n\n==Symbols==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nKappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the [[owl]] as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the [[fleur-de-lis]], combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the iris is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue [[sapphire]]. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity [[Coat of Arms]] combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma used \"Tradition of Leadership\" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to \"Aspire to Be\".\n\nIn June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line \"Dream Boldly, Live Fully\".\n\n===Badges===\nThe badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with sapphires, pearls or diamonds. On the front of the key are the Greek letters \u039a\u039a\u0393 (on the stem) and \u0391\u03a9\u039f (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as opals. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership and only by initiated members. Members are encouraged to return their badges to fraternity headquarters upon their death.\n\nNew members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge: a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the chapter.\n\n== Programs ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Philanthropy===\nKappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as \"Philanthropy 1-2-3\".\n\n* The first branch of philanthropy supports the \"Kappa family\" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma  Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need.\n* The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions.\n* The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004.\n\nLocal KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually.\n\n===Leadership===\nCollegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers.\n\nThe national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nIn 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an [[outdoor education]] facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at [http://www.heartlandretreat.com Heartland Conference Retreat Center] in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters.\n\n===The Monmouth Duo===\nThe women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] was founded as I.C. Sorosis at [[Monmouth College]] in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called \"The Monmouth Duo\". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Hazing===\n{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}\nIn 1997 the television show ''20/20'' featured an expos\u00e9 on [[hazing]] in the sorority system<ref name=\"Haz2020\">{{cite web|date= May 3, 1999\n| url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/hazenews/haze15.htm\n| title=20/20 Transcript}}</ref> that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at [[DePauw University]] and a local sorority [[Lambda Delta Sigma (Concordia)|Lambda Delta Sigma]] at [[Concordia College (Minnesota)|Concordia College]].

They must also have a minimum [[Grading in education|grade point average]] to be considered eligible. Women must participate in sorority recruitment and if they are issued an invitation to join, they enter the New Member period, the first of three phases of membership. After six to eight weeks, New Members are initiated and enter the second phase of membership as active collegiate members. Upon graduation, members enter the third and final phase of membership and become alumnae. Alumnae have the opportunity to join local alumna associations and remain active participants in fraternity life by engaging in social and philanthropic events, volunteering as advisers to collegiate chapters, and serving as fraternity council officers.\n\n===Collegiate chapters===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters}}\n\n* Kappa Kappa Gamma has chartered a total of 161 chapters, 30 of which the fraternity has closed. Eight of the 30 closed chapters have been rechartered, and none of the rechartered chapters have been closed.\n* Active chapters exist in 41 of the 50 states and in the [[District of Columbia]] as well as in three of the 10 Canadian provinces.\n* The state with the largest number of active chapters is [[California]], with 17 active chapters and one inactive chapter. Kappa has had active chapters at all nine of the [[University of California]] undergraduate campuses.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary year was 1929, with six new chapters chartered.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary decades were the 1980s, in which 19 chapters were chartered, and the 1920s, in which 18 chapters where chartered and one chapter was rechartered.\n* The fraternity's least expansionary decades were the 1890s, in which five chapters were chartered and one chapter was rechartered, and the 1960s, in which six chapters were chartered.\n* The decade with the largest number of chapter closures was the 1880s, with six chapters closed.\n\n===Notable Alumnae===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma sisters}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.kappakappagamma.org/ Kappa Kappa Gamma Website]\n* [http://associations.kappakappagamma.org/ Association Websites of Kappa Kappa Gamma]\n\n{{National Panhellenic Conference}}\n{{Fraternities and Sororities |collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Kappa Kappa Gamma| ]]\n[[Category:1870 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Monmouth College]]\n[[Category:National Panhellenic Conference]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1870]]\n[[Category:Student societies in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox Fraternity\n|letters= \u039a\u039a\u0393\n|name= Kappa Kappa Gamma\n|crest= File:Kappa_Kappa_Gamma_crest.gif\n|founded= {{start date and years ago|1870|10|13}}\n|birthplace= [[Monmouth College]], ([[Monmouth, Illinois]])\n{{Coord|40|06|09.8|N|83|06|35.7|W|display=inline,title}}\n|type= Social\n|emphasis=\n|scope= International\n|mission=\n|vision=\n|motto=Dream Boldly.

Bennett and Boyd sought members \"not only for literary work, but also for social development\", beginning with their friend Mary Moore Stewart.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Tessier, Denise, \"History 2000: Kappa Kappa Gamma Throughout the Years\". 2000</ref> Stewart, Boyd, and Bennett met around 1869 in the Amateurs des Belles Lettres Hall, a literary society of which the women were active members when they first decided to form a new society.<ref>William Urban et al., ''Monmouth College, a history through its fifth quarter century''. Monmouth College, 1979</ref> Soon after, they recruited three additional women, Anna Elizabeth Willits, Martha Louisa Stevenson, and Susan Burley Walker, to join in founding the fraternity.[[File:Minnie Stewart House.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Minnie Stewart House]] in Monmouth, where the sorority was founded|alt=|left]]\n\nThe six founders met at Willit's home to begin work on the first chapter of Kappa Kappa Gamma, later known as the Alpha chapter. They chose a golden key as their badge and ordered their badges from Bennett's family jeweler for their official debut. A formal charter was also drawn up by Stewart's father, who was an attorney in the state of Illinois. On October 13, 1870, the founders publicized their intention to organize as a women's fraternity by entering the Monmouth chapel, a public campus venue, wearing their golden key badges in their hair. Although the groundwork of the organization began as early as 1869, the 1876 Convention voted for October 13, 1870 to be recognized as the official Founders Day as no earlier charter date could be determined.\n\nIn 1871, the fraternity chartered its Beta chapter at nearby St. Mary's Seminary. The next year, the fraternity opened its Gamma chapter at Smithson College and Delta chapter at Indiana University. Though the Beta and Gamma chapters failed to survive more than a few years, the Delta chapter became the fraternity's oldest continuously active chapter (Alpha was closed in 1874 but later re-established) and contributed a great deal to the organization of the fraternity in its early years.\n\nIn 1882 Kappa Kappa Gamma was the first women's fraternity to publish a quarterly [[Magazine|journal]],''The Key''. Today, it is published triannually and printed through Watkins Printing Company.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bairdsmanualame00bairgoog|quote=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities.|title=Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities|last1=Baird|first1=William Raimond|last2=Brown|first2=James Taylor|publisher=G.

This meeting resulted in the organization of the first interfraternity association and the first intergroup organization on college campuses.\n\nIn the 1960s, [[G. William Domhoff]], writing in ''[[Who Rules America?]]'', listed Kappa Kappa Gamma as one of \"the four or five sororities with nationwide prestige.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Who Rules America?|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|publisher=McGraw Hill College|year=2015|edition=Seventh|page=57|oclc=912380768|authorlink=G. William Domhoff|title-link=Who Rules America?}}</ref>\n\nOn January 2, 2018, Kappa Kappa Gamma moved their headquarters from 530 East Town Street in Columbus, Ohio to their new location at 6640 Riverside Drive in Dublin, Ohio.\n\n==Symbols==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\nKappa Kappa Gamma's official colors are light blue and dark blue, with the [[owl]] as its official mascot. The fraternity flower, the [[fleur-de-lis]], combines the fraternity's colors of dark blue and light blue. Since the fleur-de-lis is a mythical symbol, the iris is often substituted for practical purposes. The fraternity jewel is the blue [[sapphire]]. The sapphire is recognized as a symbol of truth, sincerity, and constancy. The fraternity [[Coat of Arms]] combines all of the fraternity's symbols: the key, the Greek letters, the new-member pin, the fleur-de-lis, the owl, and the head of Minerva.\n\nKappa Kappa Gamma used \"Tradition of Leadership\" as a tagline in many previous fraternity publications, but, as of June 2012, the new fraternity tagline was changed to \"Aspire to Be\".\n\nIn June 2018, an announcement was made that a new brand would be rolled out during the 2018-2019 academic year with the tag line \"Dream Boldly, Live Fully\".\n\n===Badges===\nThe badge of membership is the golden key. The standard badge is one inch in length and is sometimes jeweled with sapphires, pearls or diamonds. On the front of the key are the Greek letters \u039a\u039a\u0393 (on the stem) and \u0391\u03a9\u039f (on the ward). Often the initials and initiation date of the member to whom the badge belongs are inscribed on the back of the badge. The original keys were larger and were not standardized; many were specially made to the member's specifications, sometimes including stones such as opals. They were also worn on members' lapels, foreheads or hair, whereas today, badges are uniformly worn on the left side of the chest. The badge is worn strictly as an emblem of membership and only by initiated members. Members are encouraged to return their badges to fraternity headquarters upon their death.\n\nNew members of Kappa Kappa Gamma wear a different badge: a sigma within a delta enameled on silver in the two colors of the fraternity, dark blue and light blue. The new member pin is only worn during the new member period, after which it is returned to the chapter.\n\n== Programs ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}\n\n===Philanthropy===\nKappa Kappa Gamma supports a three-part Philanthropy program, often referred to as \"Philanthropy 1-2-3\".\n\n* The first branch of philanthropy supports the \"Kappa family\" through the Kappa Kappa Gamma  Foundation, which provides funding for Kappa museums, members-only scholarships, educational and leadership programming, and the Rose McGill fund, which provides emergency financial aid to sisters in need.\n* The second branch supports the local community by encouraging chapters and alumnae associations to volunteer and raise money for charities in their regions.\n* The third branch encompasses the entire fraternity through its national philanthropy, [[Reading is Fundamental]] (RIF). The fraternity officially adopted RIF, which works to promote literacy in children, as the national philanthropy in 2004.\n\nLocal KKG chapters may support other foundations or philanthropies individually.\n\n===Leadership===\nCollegiate chapters contain a governing body of members that include a President, Treasurer, Secretary and officers assigned to chapter functions such as membership, standards, events, and philanthropy. Often these officers supervise committees as well. The chapter officers are advised by and report to alumnae volunteers who serve as chapter advisors, traveling Leadership Consultants, and Fraternity Council officers.\n\nThe national Fraternity Council consists of six elected alumnae (the President, four Vice Presidents, and Treasurer) and two non-voting members (the National Panhellenic Conference Delegate, and the Fraternity Executive Director). Their work is supported by 11 Content Directors, 14 District Directors, dozens of Content Specialists, various committees, and Kappa Kappa Gamma Headquarters staff. As of January 2018, the Fraternity moved their headquarters from Columbus, Ohio to a new facility in Dublin, Ohio.\n\nIn 2004, Leadership Academy began offering undergraduate and alumna members intensive leadership development at an outdoor weekend retreat. Programming for the Leadership Academy has been developed in partnership with The Tompeters! Company and Bradford Woods, an [[outdoor education]] facility in Indiana. More recently, Leadership Academy has taken place at [http://www.heartlandretreat.com Heartland Conference Retreat Center] in Marengo, Ohio, near the Fraternity Headquarters.\n\n===The Monmouth Duo===\nThe women's fraternity [[Pi Beta Phi]] was founded as I.C. Sorosis at [[Monmouth College]] in 1867. Kappa Kappa Gamma was founded at the college in 1870, and in 1888 I.C. Sorosis adopted Greek letters and changed its name to Pi Beta Phi. Because both fraternities have their origins at the same college within three years of one another, they are often called \"The Monmouth Duo\". On campuses with Pi Beta Phi and Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters, the groups often hold joint social and philanthropic events.\n\n==Controversies==\n\n===Hazing===\n{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}\nIn 1997 the television show ''20/20'' featured an expos\u00e9 on [[hazing]] in the sorority system<ref name=\"Haz2020\">{{cite web|date= May 3, 1999\n| url=http://www.deltasigmatheta.com/hazenews/haze15.htm\n| title=20/20 Transcript}}</ref> that included a hazing by three members of Kappa Kappa Gamma at [[DePauw University]] and a local sorority [[Lambda Delta Sigma (Concordia)|Lambda Delta Sigma]] at [[Concordia College (Minnesota)|Concordia College]].

They must also have a minimum [[Grading in education|grade point average]] to be considered eligible. Women must participate in sorority recruitment and if they are issued an invitation to join, they enter the New Member period, the first of three phases of membership. After six to eight weeks, New Members are initiated and enter the second phase of membership as active collegiate members. Upon graduation, members enter the third and final phase of membership and become alumnae. Alumnae have the opportunity to join local alumna associations and remain active participants in fraternity life by engaging in social and philanthropic events, volunteering as advisers to collegiate chapters, and serving as fraternity council officers.\n\n===Collegiate chapters===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma chapters}}\n\n* Kappa Kappa Gamma has chartered a total of 161 chapters, 30 of which the fraternity has closed. Eight of the 30 closed chapters have been rechartered, and none of the rechartered chapters have been closed.\n* Active chapters exist in 41 of the 50 states and in the [[District of Columbia]] as well as in three of the 10 Canadian provinces.\n* The state with the largest number of active chapters is [[California]], with 17 active chapters and one inactive chapter. Kappa has had active chapters at all nine of the [[University of California]] undergraduate campuses.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary year was 1929, with six new chapters chartered.\n* The fraternity's most expansionary decades were the 1980s, in which 19 chapters were chartered, and the 1920s, in which 18 chapters where chartered and one chapter was rechartered.\n* The fraternity's least expansionary decades were the 1890s, in which five chapters were chartered and one chapter was rechartered, and the 1960s, in which six chapters were chartered.\n* The decade with the largest number of chapter closures was the 1880s, with six chapters closed.\n\n===Notable Alumnae===\n{{Main|List of Kappa Kappa Gamma sisters}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.kappakappagamma.org/ Kappa Kappa Gamma Website]\n* [http://associations.kappakappagamma.org/ Association Websites of Kappa Kappa Gamma]\n\n{{National Panhellenic Conference}}\n{{Fraternities and Sororities |collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Kappa Kappa Gamma| ]]\n[[Category:1870 establishments in Illinois]]\n[[Category:Companies based in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area]]\n[[Category:Monmouth College]]\n[[Category:National Panhellenic Conference]]\n[[Category:Student organizations established in 1870]]\n[[Category:Student societies in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "He10061556", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up grammar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa_Kappa_Gamma"}
