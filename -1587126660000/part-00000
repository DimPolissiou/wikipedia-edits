{"title_page": "Adaptive immune system", "text_new": "[[File:SEM Lymphocyte.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A [[scanning electron microscope]] image of a single human [[lymphocyte]]]]\nThe '''adaptive immune system''', also referred as the '''acquired immune system''', is a subsystem of the  [[immune system]] that is composed of specialized, systemic cells and processes that eliminates [[pathogens]] by preventing their growth. The acquired immune system is one of the two main [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] strategies found in [[vertebrate]]s (the other being the [[innate immune system]]). \n\nAcquired immunity creates [[immunological memory]] after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of [[vaccination]]. Like the innate system, the acquired system includes both [[humoral immunity]] components and [[cell-mediated immunity]] components.[[File:Ngram acquired immunity vs. adaptive immunity.png|thumb|Google Ngram  of \"acquired immunity \" vs. \"adaptive immunity\".  The peak  for \"adaptive\" in the 1960s reflects its introduction to immunology  by Robert A. Good and use by colleagues; the explosive increase in the 1990s was correlated with the use of the phrase \"innate immunity\".]]\n\nUnlike the innate immune system, the acquired immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Acquired immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, [[chickenpox]]. The acquired system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the acquired system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; the effects of this may be [[allergic rhinitis|hayfever]], [[asthma]] or any other [[allergy]]. [[Antigens]] are any substances that elicit the acquired immune response (whether adaptive or maladaptive to the organism). The cells that carry out the acquired immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes\u2014antibody responses and cell mediated immune response\u2014are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete [[antibodies]], which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.<ref name=Alberts/>\n\nIn acquired immunity, pathogen-specific [[Immune receptor|receptors]] are \"acquired\" during the lifetime of the organism (whereas in innate immunity pathogen-specific receptors are already encoded in the [[germline]]). The acquired response is called \"adaptive\" because it prepares the body's immune system for future challenges (though it can actually also be [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] when it results in [[autoimmunity]]).{{refn| In the technical sense, both the innate and acquired immune systems are \"adaptive\" in the physiological and evolutionary sense of allowing the organism to adapt to changing external circumstances (and both can be maladaptive if overactive, causing pathological inflammation or autoimmunity). Furthermore, the pathogen-receptors of innate and acquired immune mechanisms are both specific: The specificities of innate immunity have evolved over evolutionary time in response to highly conserved molecular features of the microbial world, whereas the specificities of acquired immunity mature in each organism. For this reason, in general the term \"acquired\" is preferred to \"adaptive\" or \"specific\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}|group=n}}\n\nThe system is highly [[adaptation|adaptable]] because of [[somatic hypermutation]] (a process of accelerated [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[mutation]]s), and [[V(D)J recombination]] (an irreversible [[genetic recombination]] of antigen receptor gene segments). This mechanism allows a small number of genes to generate a vast number of different antigen receptors, which are then uniquely expressed on each individual [[lymphocyte]]. Since the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the [[DNA]] of each cell, all [[offspring|progeny]] (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the [[memory B cell]]s and [[memory T cells]] that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity.\n\nA theoretical framework explaining the workings of the acquired immune system is provided by [[immune network theory]]. This theory, which builds on established concepts of [[clonal selection]], is being applied in the search for an [[HIV vaccine]].\n{{TOCleft}}{{Clr}}\n\n== Naming ==\nThe term \"adaptive\" was first used by Robert Good in reference to antibody responses in frogs as a synonym for \"acquired immune response\" in 1964. Good acknowledged  he used the terms as synonyms but explained only that he \"preferred\" to use the term \"adaptive\".  He might have been thinking of the then not implausible theory of antibody formation in which antibodies were plastic and could adapt themselves to the molecular shape of antigens, and/or to the concept of \"adaptive enzymes\" as described by Monod in bacteria, that is, enzymes whose expression could be induced by their substrates.  The phrase was used almost exclusively by Good and his students and a few other immunologists working with marginal organisms until the 1990s when it became widely used in tandem with the term \"innate immunity\" which became a popular subject after the discovery of the Toll receptor system in ''Drosophila'', a previously marginal organism for the study of immunology.  The term \"adaptive\" as used in immunology is problematic as acquired immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the physiological sense. Indeed, both acquired and innate immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the evolutionary sense.  Most textbooks today, following the early use by Janeway, use \"adaptive\" almost exclusively and noting in glossaries that the term is synonymous with \"acquired\".\n\nThe classic sense of \"acquired immunity\" came to mean, since Tonegawas's discovery, \"antigen-specific immunity mediated by somatic gene rearrangements that create clone-defining antigen receptors\". In the last decade, the term \"adaptive\" has been increasingly applied to another class of immune response not so-far associated with somatic gene rearrangements.  These include expansion of natural killer (NK) cells with so-far unexplained specificity for antigens, expansion of NK cells expressing germ-line encoded receptors, and activation of other innate immune cells to an activated state that confers a short-term \"immune memory\".   In this sense, \"adaptive immunity\" more closely resembles the concept of \"activated state\" or \"heterostasis\", thus returning in sense to the physiological sense of \"adaptation\" to environmental changes.  \n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Functions==\nAcquired immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and (1) generates a threshold level of antigen and (2) generates \"stranger\" or \"danger\" signals activating dendritic cells.<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | vauthors = Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik MJ | title =Immunobiology |edition=5th | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2001 | location = New York and London| pages =  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| doi =  | isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}</ref>\n\nThe major functions of the acquired immune system include: \n*Recognition of specific \"non-self\" antigens in the presence of \"self\", during the process of [[antigen presentation]].\n*Generation of responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.\n*Development of [[#Immunological memory|immunological memory]], in which pathogens are \"remembered\" through [[memory B cell]]s and [[memory T cell]]s.\n\nIn humans, it takes 4-7 days for the adaptive immune system to mount a significant response.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/#_i2255_theadaptiveimmunesys_</ref>\n\n==Lymphocytes ==\n{{main|Lymphocyte}}\nThe cells of the acquired immune system are T and B [[lymphocytes]]; lymphocytes are a subset of [[leukocyte]]. [[B cell]]s and [[T cell]]s are the major types of lymphocytes. The human body has about 2 trillion lymphocytes, constituting 20\u201340% of white blood cells (WBCs); their total mass is about the same as the [[brain]] or liver.

These antigens are different from those on the surface of bacteria or on the surface of virus-infected host cells (\"non-self\" or \"foreign\" antigens). The acquired immune response is triggered by recognizing foreign antigen in the cellular context of an activated dendritic cell.\n\nWith the exception of non-nucleated cells (including [[erythrocyte]]s), all cells are capable of presenting antigen through the function of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.<ref name=Janeway6/> Some cells are specially equipped to present antigen, and to prime naive T cells. [[Dendritic cells]], B-cells, and [[macrophages]] are equipped with special \"co-stimulatory\" ligands recognized by co-stimulatory receptors on T cells, and are termed professional [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs).\n\nSeveral T cells subgroups can be activated by professional APCs, and each type of T cell is specially equipped to deal with each unique toxin or microbial pathogen. The type of T cell activated, and the type of response generated, depends, in part, on the context in which the APC first encountered the antigen.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n===Exogenous antigens===\n[[Image:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|220px|right|Antigen presentation stimulates T cells to become either \"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells or \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\nDendritic cells engulf [[exogenous]] pathogens, such as bacteria, parasites or toxins in the tissues and then migrate, via [[chemotactic]] signals, to the T cell-enriched lymph nodes. During migration, dendritic cells undergo a process of maturation in which they lose most of their ability to engulf other pathogens, and develop an ability to communicate with T-cells.  The dendritic cell uses [[enzyme]]s to chop the pathogen into smaller pieces, called [[antigen]]s.  In the lymph node, the dendritic cell displays these non-self antigens on its surface by coupling them to a receptor called the [[major histocompatibility complex]], or MHC (also known in humans as [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA)). This MHC: antigen complex is recognized by T-cells passing through the lymph node. Exogenous antigens are usually displayed on [[MHC class II]] molecules, which activate [[CD4]]+[[T helper cell]]s.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n===Endogenous antigens===\n[[Endogenous]] antigens are produced by intracellular bacteria and viruses replicating within a host cell. The host cell uses enzymes to digest virally associated proteins, and displays these pieces on its surface to T-cells by coupling them to MHC. Endogenous antigens are typically displayed on [[MHC class I]] molecules, and activate [[CD8]]+ cytotoxic T-cells. With the exception of non-nucleated cells (including [[erythrocyte]]s), MHC class I is expressed by all host cells.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n==T lymphocytes==\n{{main|T cell}}\n\n===CD8+ T lymphocytes and cytotoxicity===\n{{main|Cytotoxic T cell}}\nCytotoxic T cells (also known as TC, killer T cell, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)) are a sub-group of T cells that induce the death of cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nNaive cytotoxic T cells are activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) strongly interacts with a peptide-bound MHC class I molecule. This affinity depends on the type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together.<ref name=Janeway/> Once activated, the CTL undergoes a process called [[clonal selection]], in which it gains functions and divides rapidly to produce an army of \u201carmed\u201d effector cells. Activated CTL then travels throughout the body searching for cells that bear that unique MHC Class I + peptide.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhen exposed to these infected or dysfunctional [[somatic cell]]s, effector CTL release [[perforin]] and [[granulysin]]: cytotoxins that form pores in the target cell's [[plasma membrane]], allowing [[ion]]s and water to flow into the infected cell, and causing it to burst or [[Lysis|lyse]]. CTL release [[granzyme]], a [[serine protease]] encapsulated in a granule that enters cells via pores to induce [[apoptosis]] (cell death). To limit extensive tissue damage during an infection, CTL activation is tightly controlled and in general requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T-cells (see below).<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nOn resolution of the infection, most effector cells die and [[phagocyte]]s clear them away\u2014but a few of these cells remain as memory cells.<ref name=Janeway6/> On a later encounter with the same antigen, these memory cells quickly differentiate into effector cells, dramatically shortening the time required to mount an effective response.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} {{clear}}\n\n===Helper T-cells===\n{{main|T helper cell}} [[Image:T cell activation.svg|thumb|280px|right|The T lymphocyte activation pathway.

The activation of a naive helper T-cell causes it to release cytokines, which influences the activity of many cell types, including the APC (Antigen-Presenting Cell) that activated it.  Helper T-cells require a much milder activation stimulus than cytotoxic T cells. Helper T cells can provide extra signals that \"help\" activate cytotoxic cells.<ref name=Janeway6/>\n\n====Th1 and Th2: helper T cell responses====\nClassically, two types of effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper cell responses can be induced by a professional APC, designated Th1 and Th2, each designed to eliminate different types of pathogens.

Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as [[CD1d receptor|CD1d]]-restricted [[natural killer T cell]]s, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells exhibit characteristics that place them at the border between innate and acquired immunity. On one hand, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange TCR genes via [[V(D)J recombination]], which also produces [[junctional diversity]], and develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, however, the various subsets may also be considered part of the innate immune system where a restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as a [[pattern recognition receptor]]. For example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells respond within hours to [[non-peptidic antigen|common molecules]] produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial V\u03b41 T cells respond to stressed epithelial cells.\n\n==B lymphocytes and antibody production==\n{{main|B cell|Humoral immunity}}\n[[File:B cell activation.svg|thumb|230px|right|The B lymphocyte activation pathway. B cells function to protect the host by producing antibodies that identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.<ref name=NIAID/>]] \nB Cells are the major cells involved in the creation of [[antibodies]] that circulate in [[blood plasma]] and lymph, known as [[humoral immunity]]. Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulin, Ig), are large Y-shaped proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects. In mammals, there are five types of antibody: [[IgA]], [[IgD]], [[IgE]], [[IgG]], and [[IgM]], differing in biological properties; each has evolved to handle different kinds of antigens. Upon activation, B cells produce antibodies, each of which recognize a unique antigen, and neutralizing specific pathogens.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nAntigen and antibody binding would cause five different protective mechanisms:\n*Agglutination: Reduces number of infectious units to be dealt with \n*Activation of complement: Cause inflammation and cell lysis\n*Opsonization: Coating antigen with antibody enhances phagocytosis\n*Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity: Antibodies attached to target cell cause destruction by macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells\n*Neutralization: Blocks adhesion of bacteria and viruses to mucosa\n\nLike the T cell, B cells express a unique B cell receptor (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. All the BCR of any one clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell \"sees\" an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form \u2013 as a peptide in the context of an MHC molecule,<ref name=Janeway/> whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form.<ref name=Janeway/> Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a [[helper T cell]] (predominately Th2 type)), it further [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]]s into an effector cell, known as a plasma cell.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n[[Plasma cells]] are short-lived cells (2\u20133 days) that secrete antibodies.

Throughout the lifetime of an animal these memory cells form a database of effective B and T lymphocytes. Upon interaction with a previously encountered antigen, the appropriate memory cells are selected and activated. In this manner, the second and subsequent exposures to an antigen produce a stronger and faster immune response. This is \"adaptive\" in the sense that the body's immune system prepares itself for future challenges, but is \"maladaptive\" of course if the receptors are autoimmune. Immunological memory can be in the form of either ''passive'' short-term memory or ''active'' long-term memory.\n\n===Passive memory===\nPassive memory is usually short-term, lasting between a few days and several months. Newborn [[infant]]s have had no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. ''[[Uterus|In utero]]'', [[maternal]] IgG is transported directly across the [[placenta]], so that, at birth, human babies have high levels of antibodies, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.<ref name=Janeway/> [[Breast milk]] contains antibodies (mainly IgA) that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nThis is [[passive immunization|passive immunity]] because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies: It only borrows them. Short-term passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich [[blood plasma|serum]].\n\n===Active memory===\nIn general, active immunity is long-term and can be acquired by infection followed by B cell and T cell activation, or artificially acquired by vaccines, in a process called immunization.\n\n====Immunization====\nHistorically, infectious disease has been the leading cause of death in the human population. Over the last century, two important factors have been developed to combat their spread: [[sanitation]] and [[immunization]].<ref name=Janeway6/> Immunization (commonly referred to as [[vaccination]]) is the deliberate induction of an immune response, and represents the single most effective manipulation of the immune system that scientists have developed.<ref name=Janeway6/> Immunizations are successful because they utilize the immune system's natural specificity as well as its inducibility.\n\nThe principle behind immunization is to introduce an antigen, derived from a disease-causing organism, that stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against that organism, but that does not '''itself''' cause the pathogenic effects of that organism. An [[antigen]] (short for ''anti''body ''gen''erator), is defined as any substance that binds to a specific antibody and elicits an [[adaptive immune response]].<ref name=Alberts/>\n\nMost viral [[vaccine]]s are based on live [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] viruses, whereas many bacterial vaccines are based on [[acellular]] components of microorganisms, including harmless [[toxin]] components.<ref name=Alberts/> Many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce an adaptive response, and most bacterial vaccines require the addition of ''[[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]]s'' that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the [[innate immune system]] to enhance [[immunogenicity]].<ref name=Janeway6/>\n\n==Immunological diversity==\n[[File:Antibody chains.svg|thumb|right|An antibody is made up of two heavy chains and two light chains. The unique variable region allows an antibody to recognize its matching antigen.<ref name=NIAID/>]]\nMost large molecules, including virtually all [[protein]]s and many [[polysaccharide]]s, can serve as antigens.<ref name=Janeway/> The parts of an antigen that interact with an antibody molecule or a lymphocyte receptor, are called [[epitope]]s, or antigenic determinants. Most antigens contain a variety of epitopes and can stimulate the production of antibodies, specific T cell responses, or both.<ref name=Janeway/>   A very small proportion (less than 0.01%) of the total lymphocytes are able to bind to a particular antigen, which suggests that only a few cells respond to each antigen.<ref name=Janeway6/>\n\nFor the acquired response to \"remember\" and eliminate a large number of pathogens the immune system must be able to distinguish between many different antigens,<ref name=Alberts/> and the receptors that recognize antigens must be produced in a huge variety of configurations, in essence one receptor (at least) for each different pathogen that might ever be encountered. Even in the absence of antigen stimulation, a human can produce more than 1 trillion different antibody molecules.<ref name=Janeway6/> Millions of genes would be required to store the genetic information that produces these receptors, but, the entire human genome contains fewer than 25,000 [[gene]]s.<ref name=\"IHSGC2004\">{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931\u201345 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 }}</ref>\n\nMyriad receptors are produced through a process known as [[clonal selection]].<ref name=Alberts/><ref name=Janeway/>  According to the clonal selection theory, at birth, an animal randomly generates a vast diversity of lymphocytes (each bearing a unique antigen receptor) from information encoded in a small family of genes. To generate each unique antigen receptor, these genes have undergone a process called [[V(D)J recombination]], or ''combinatorial diversification'', in which one gene segment recombines with other gene segments to form a single unique gene. This assembly process generates the enormous diversity of receptors and antibodies, before the body ever encounters antigens, and enables the immune system to respond to an almost unlimited diversity of antigens.<ref name=Janeway/> Throughout an animal's lifetime, lymphocytes that can react against the antigens an animal actually encounters are selected for action\u2014directed against anything that expresses that antigen.\n\nNote that the innate and acquired portions of the immune system work together, not in spite of each other. The acquired arm, B, and T cells couldn't function without the innate system' input. T cells are useless without antigen-presenting cells to activate them, and B cells are crippled without T cell help. On the other hand, the innate system would likely be overrun with pathogens without the specialized action of the adaptive immune response.\n\n==Acquired immunity during pregnancy==\nThe cornerstone of the immune system is the recognition of \"self\" versus \"non-self\". Therefore, the mechanisms that protect the human [[fetus]] (which is considered \"non-self\") from attack by the immune system, are particularly interesting. Although no comprehensive explanation has emerged to explain this mysterious, and often repeated, lack of rejection, two classical reasons may explain how the fetus is tolerated. The first is that the fetus occupies a portion of the body protected by a non-immunological barrier, the [[uterus]], which the immune system does not routinely patrol.<ref name=Janeway/> The second is that the fetus itself may promote local immunosuppression in the mother, perhaps by a process of active nutrient depletion.<ref name=Janeway/> A more modern explanation for this induction of tolerance is that specific glycoproteins expressed in the uterus during [[pregnancy]] suppress the uterine immune response (see [[eu-FEDS]]).\n\nDuring pregnancy in [[viviparity|viviparous]] mammals (all mammals except [[Monotreme]]s), [[endogenous retroviruses]] (ERVs) are activated and produced in high quantities during the implantation of the embryo. They are currently known to possess immunosuppressive properties, suggesting a role in protecting the embryo from its mother's immune system. Also, [[viral fusion proteins]] cause the formation of the placental [[syncytium]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mi S, Lee X, Li X, Veldman GM, Finnerty H, Racie L, LaVallie E, Tang XY, Edouard P, Howes S, Keith JC, McCoy JM | title = Syncytin is a captive retroviral envelope protein involved in human placental morphogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6771 | pages = 785\u201389 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10693809 | doi = 10.1038/35001608 }}\n</ref> to limit exchange of migratory cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother (something an [[epithelium]] can't do sufficiently, as certain blood cells specialize to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells). The immunodepressive action was the initial normal behavior of the virus, similar to HIV. The fusion proteins were a way to spread the infection to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one (HIV does this too). It is believed that the ancestors of modern viviparous mammals evolved after an infection by this virus, enabling the fetus to survive the immune system of the mother.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~faculty/villarreal/new1/erv-placental.html\n|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070715005236/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~faculty/villarreal/new1/erv-placental.html\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=2007-07-15\n|title=The Viruses That Make Us: A Role For Endogenous Retrovirus In The Evolution Of Placental Species\n| first = Luis P. | last = Villarreal | name-list-format = vanc \n|publisher=University of California, Irvine (lecture notes)\n|access-date=2008-02-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[human genome project]] found several thousand [[endogenous retrovirus|ERV]]s classified into 24 families.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp | title = Persisting Viruses Could Play Role in Driving Host Evolution | first = Luis P. | last = Villarreal | name-list-format = vanc | journal = ASM News | date = Oct 2001 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090508113235/http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp | archive-date = 2009-05-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Immune network theory==\n{{Main|Immune network theory}}\nA theoretical framework explaining the workings of the acquired immune system is provided by [[immune network theory]], based on interactions between [[idiotypes]] (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of [[antigenic determinants]] of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype as if it were a foreign antigen).

The acquired immune system is one of the two main [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] strategies found in [[vertebrate]]s (the other being the [[innate immune system]]). \n\nAcquired immunity creates [[immunological memory]] after an initial response to a specific pathogen, and leads to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that pathogen. This process of acquired immunity is the basis of [[vaccination]]. Like the innate system, the acquired system includes both [[humoral immunity]] components and [[cell-mediated immunity]] components.[[File:Ngram acquired immunity vs. adaptive immunity.png|thumb|Google Ngram  of \"acquired immunity \" vs. \"adaptive immunity\".  The peak  for \"adaptive\" in the 1960s reflects its introduction to immunology  by Robert A. Good and use by colleagues; the explosive increase in the 1990s was correlated with the use of the phrase \"innate immunity\".]]\n\nUnlike the innate immune system, the acquired immune system is highly specific to a particular pathogen. Acquired immunity can also provide long-lasting protection; for example, someone who recovers from measles is now protected against measles for their lifetime. In other cases it does not provide lifetime protection; for example, [[chickenpox]]. The acquired system response destroys invading pathogens and any toxic molecules they produce. Sometimes the acquired system is unable to distinguish harmful from harmless foreign molecules; the effects of this may be [[allergic rhinitis|hayfever]], [[asthma]] or any other [[allergy]]. [[Antigens]] are any substances that elicit the acquired immune response (whether adaptive or maladaptive to the organism). The cells that carry out the acquired immune response are white blood cells known as lymphocytes. Two main broad classes\u2014antibody responses and cell mediated immune response\u2014are also carried by two different lymphocytes (B cells and T cells). In antibody responses, B cells are activated to secrete [[antibodies]], which are proteins also known as immunoglobulins. Antibodies travel through the bloodstream and bind to the foreign antigen causing it to inactivate, which does not allow the antigen to bind to the host.<ref name=Alberts/>\n\nIn acquired immunity, pathogen-specific [[Immune receptor|receptors]] are \"acquired\" during the lifetime of the organism (whereas in innate immunity pathogen-specific receptors are already encoded in the [[germline]]). The acquired response is called \"adaptive\" because it prepares the body's immune system for future challenges (though it can actually also be [[Maladaptation|maladaptive]] when it results in [[autoimmunity]]).{{refn| In the technical sense, both the innate and acquired immune systems are \"adaptive\" in the physiological and evolutionary sense of allowing the organism to adapt to changing external circumstances (and both can be maladaptive if overactive, causing pathological inflammation or autoimmunity). Furthermore, the pathogen-receptors of innate and acquired immune mechanisms are both specific: The specificities of innate immunity have evolved over evolutionary time in response to highly conserved molecular features of the microbial world, whereas the specificities of acquired immunity mature in each organism. For this reason, in general the term \"acquired\" is preferred to \"adaptive\" or \"specific\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}|group=n}}\n\nThe system is highly [[adaptation|adaptable]] because of [[somatic hypermutation]] (a process of accelerated [[Somatic cell|somatic]] [[mutation]]s), and [[V(D)J recombination]] (an irreversible [[genetic recombination]] of antigen receptor gene segments).

Since the gene rearrangement leads to an irreversible change in the [[DNA]] of each cell, all [[offspring|progeny]] (offspring) of that cell inherit genes that encode the same receptor specificity, including the [[memory B cell]]s and [[memory T cells]] that are the keys to long-lived specific immunity.\n\nA theoretical framework explaining the workings of the acquired immune system is provided by [[immune network theory]]. This theory, which builds on established concepts of [[clonal selection]], is being applied in the search for an [[HIV vaccine]].\n{{TOCleft}}{{Clr}}\n\n== Naming ==\nThe term \"adaptive\" was first used by Robert Good in reference to antibody responses in frogs as a synonym for \"acquired immune response\" in 1964. Good acknowledged  he used the terms as synonyms but explained only that he \"preferred\" to use the term \"adaptive\".  He might have been thinking of the then not implausible theory of antibody formation in which antibodies were plastic and could adapt themselves to the molecular shape of antigens, and/or to the concept of \"adaptive enzymes\" as described by Monod in bacteria, that is, enzymes whose expression could be induced by their substrates.  The phrase was used almost exclusively by Good and his students and a few other immunologists working with marginal organisms until the 1990s when it became widely used in tandem with the term \"innate immunity\" which became a popular subject after the discovery of the Toll receptor system in ''Drosophila'', a previously marginal organism for the study of immunology.  The term \"adaptive\" as used in immunology is problematic as acquired immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the physiological sense. Indeed, both acquired and innate immune responses can be both adaptive and maladaptive in the evolutionary sense.  Most textbooks today, following the early use by Janeway, use \"adaptive\" almost exclusively and noting in glossaries that the term is synonymous with \"acquired\".\n\nThe classic sense of \"acquired immunity\" came to mean, since Tonegawas's discovery, \"antigen-specific immunity mediated by somatic gene rearrangements that create clone-defining antigen receptors\". In the last decade, the term \"adaptive\" has been increasingly applied to another class of immune response not so-far associated with somatic gene rearrangements.  These include expansion of natural killer (NK) cells with so-far unexplained specificity for antigens, expansion of NK cells expressing germ-line encoded receptors, and activation of other innate immune cells to an activated state that confers a short-term \"immune memory\".   In this sense, \"adaptive immunity\" more closely resembles the concept of \"activated state\" or \"heterostasis\", thus returning in sense to the physiological sense of \"adaptation\" to environmental changes.  \n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Functions==\nAcquired immunity is triggered in vertebrates when a pathogen evades the innate immune system and (1) generates a threshold level of antigen and (2) generates \"stranger\" or \"danger\" signals activating dendritic cells.<ref name=Janeway>{{cite book | vauthors = Janeway CA, Travers P, Walport M, Shlomchik MJ | title =Immunobiology |edition=5th | publisher = Garland Science | year = 2001 | location = New York and London| pages =  | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&rid=imm.TOC&depth=10| doi =  | isbn = 0-8153-4101-6}}</ref>\n\nThe major functions of the acquired immune system include: \n*Recognition of specific \"non-self\" antigens in the presence of \"self\", during the process of [[antigen presentation]].\n*Generation of responses that are tailored to maximally eliminate specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells.\n*Development of [[#Immunological memory|immunological memory]], in which pathogens are \"remembered\" through [[memory B cell]]s and [[memory T cell]]s.\n\nIn humans, it takes 4-7 days for the adaptive immune system to mount a significant response.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279396/#_i2255_theadaptiveimmunesys_</ref>\n\n==Lymphocytes ==\n{{main|Lymphocyte}}\nThe cells of the acquired immune system are T and B [[lymphocytes]]; lymphocytes are a subset of [[leukocyte]].

These antigens are different from those on the surface of bacteria or on the surface of virus-infected host cells (\"non-self\" or \"foreign\" antigens). The acquired immune response is triggered by recognizing foreign antigen in the cellular context of an activated dendritic cell.\n\nWith the exception of non-nucleated cells (including [[erythrocyte]]s), all cells are capable of presenting antigen through the function of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.<ref name=Janeway6/> Some cells are specially equipped to present antigen, and to prime naive T cells. [[Dendritic cells]], B-cells, and [[macrophages]] are equipped with special \"co-stimulatory\" ligands recognized by co-stimulatory receptors on T cells, and are termed professional [[antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs).\n\nSeveral T cells subgroups can be activated by professional APCs, and each type of T cell is specially equipped to deal with each unique toxin or microbial pathogen. The type of T cell activated, and the type of response generated, depends, in part, on the context in which the APC first encountered the antigen.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n===Exogenous antigens===\n[[Image:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|220px|right|Antigen presentation stimulates T cells to become either \"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells or \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\nDendritic cells engulf [[exogenous]] pathogens, such as bacteria, parasites or toxins in the tissues and then migrate, via [[chemotactic]] signals, to the T cell-enriched lymph nodes. During migration, dendritic cells undergo a process of maturation in which they lose most of their ability to engulf other pathogens, and develop an ability to communicate with T-cells.  The dendritic cell uses [[enzyme]]s to chop the pathogen into smaller pieces, called [[antigen]]s.  In the lymph node, the dendritic cell displays these non-self antigens on its surface by coupling them to a receptor called the [[major histocompatibility complex]], or MHC (also known in humans as [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA)). This MHC: antigen complex is recognized by T-cells passing through the lymph node. Exogenous antigens are usually displayed on [[MHC class II]] molecules, which activate [[CD4]]+[[T helper cell]]s.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n===Endogenous antigens===\n[[Endogenous]] antigens are produced by intracellular bacteria and viruses replicating within a host cell. The host cell uses enzymes to digest virally associated proteins, and displays these pieces on its surface to T-cells by coupling them to MHC. Endogenous antigens are typically displayed on [[MHC class I]] molecules, and activate [[CD8]]+ cytotoxic T-cells. With the exception of non-nucleated cells (including [[erythrocyte]]s), MHC class I is expressed by all host cells.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n==T lymphocytes==\n{{main|T cell}}\n\n===CD8+ T lymphocytes and cytotoxicity===\n{{main|Cytotoxic T cell}}\nCytotoxic T cells (also known as TC, killer T cell, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)) are a sub-group of T cells that induce the death of cells that are infected with viruses (and other pathogens), or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nNaive cytotoxic T cells are activated when their T-cell receptor (TCR) strongly interacts with a peptide-bound MHC class I molecule. This affinity depends on the type and orientation of the antigen/MHC complex, and is what keeps the CTL and infected cell bound together.<ref name=Janeway/> Once activated, the CTL undergoes a process called [[clonal selection]], in which it gains functions and divides rapidly to produce an army of \u201carmed\u201d effector cells. Activated CTL then travels throughout the body searching for cells that bear that unique MHC Class I + peptide.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nWhen exposed to these infected or dysfunctional [[somatic cell]]s, effector CTL release [[perforin]] and [[granulysin]]: cytotoxins that form pores in the target cell's [[plasma membrane]], allowing [[ion]]s and water to flow into the infected cell, and causing it to burst or [[Lysis|lyse]]. CTL release [[granzyme]], a [[serine protease]] encapsulated in a granule that enters cells via pores to induce [[apoptosis]] (cell death). To limit extensive tissue damage during an infection, CTL activation is tightly controlled and in general requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T-cells (see below).<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nOn resolution of the infection, most effector cells die and [[phagocyte]]s clear them away\u2014but a few of these cells remain as memory cells.<ref name=Janeway6/> On a later encounter with the same antigen, these memory cells quickly differentiate into effector cells, dramatically shortening the time required to mount an effective response.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} {{clear}}\n\n===Helper T-cells===\n{{main|T helper cell}} [[Image:T cell activation.svg|thumb|280px|right|The T lymphocyte activation pathway.

Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as [[CD1d receptor|CD1d]]-restricted [[natural killer T cell]]s, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells exhibit characteristics that place them at the border between innate and acquired immunity. On one hand, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells may be considered a component of adaptive immunity in that they rearrange TCR genes via [[V(D)J recombination]], which also produces [[junctional diversity]], and develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, however, the various subsets may also be considered part of the innate immune system where a restricted TCR or NK receptors may be used as a [[pattern recognition receptor]]. For example, according to this paradigm, large numbers of V\u03b39/V\u03b42 T cells respond within hours to [[non-peptidic antigen|common molecules]] produced by microbes, and highly restricted intraepithelial V\u03b41 T cells respond to stressed epithelial cells.\n\n==B lymphocytes and antibody production==\n{{main|B cell|Humoral immunity}}\n[[File:B cell activation.svg|thumb|230px|right|The B lymphocyte activation pathway. B cells function to protect the host by producing antibodies that identify and neutralize foreign objects like bacteria and viruses.<ref name=NIAID/>]] \nB Cells are the major cells involved in the creation of [[antibodies]] that circulate in [[blood plasma]] and lymph, known as [[humoral immunity]]. Antibodies (also known as immunoglobulin, Ig), are large Y-shaped proteins used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects. In mammals, there are five types of antibody: [[IgA]], [[IgD]], [[IgE]], [[IgG]], and [[IgM]], differing in biological properties; each has evolved to handle different kinds of antigens. Upon activation, B cells produce antibodies, each of which recognize a unique antigen, and neutralizing specific pathogens.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nAntigen and antibody binding would cause five different protective mechanisms:\n*Agglutination: Reduces number of infectious units to be dealt with \n*Activation of complement: Cause inflammation and cell lysis\n*Opsonization: Coating antigen with antibody enhances phagocytosis\n*Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity: Antibodies attached to target cell cause destruction by macrophages, eosinophils, and NK cells\n*Neutralization: Blocks adhesion of bacteria and viruses to mucosa\n\nLike the T cell, B cells express a unique B cell receptor (BCR), in this case, a membrane-bound antibody molecule. All the BCR of any one clone of B cells recognizes and binds to only one particular antigen. A critical difference between B cells and T cells is how each cell \"sees\" an antigen. T cells recognize their cognate antigen in a processed form \u2013 as a peptide in the context of an MHC molecule,<ref name=Janeway/> whereas B cells recognize antigens in their native form.<ref name=Janeway/> Once a B cell encounters its cognate (or specific) antigen (and receives additional signals from a [[helper T cell]] (predominately Th2 type)), it further [[cellular differentiation|differentiate]]s into an effector cell, known as a plasma cell.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\n[[Plasma cells]] are short-lived cells (2\u20133 days) that secrete antibodies.

Immunological memory can be in the form of either ''passive'' short-term memory or ''active'' long-term memory.\n\n===Passive memory===\nPassive memory is usually short-term, lasting between a few days and several months. Newborn [[infant]]s have had no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection. Several layers of passive protection are provided by the mother. ''[[Uterus|In utero]]'', [[maternal]] IgG is transported directly across the [[placenta]], so that, at birth, human babies have high levels of antibodies, with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother.<ref name=Janeway/> [[Breast milk]] contains antibodies (mainly IgA) that are transferred to the gut of the infant, protecting against bacterial infections, until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies.<ref name=Janeway/>\n\nThis is [[passive immunization|passive immunity]] because the fetus does not actually make any memory cells or antibodies: It only borrows them. Short-term passive immunity can also be transferred artificially from one individual to another via antibody-rich [[blood plasma|serum]].\n\n===Active memory===\nIn general, active immunity is long-term and can be acquired by infection followed by B cell and T cell activation, or artificially acquired by vaccines, in a process called immunization.\n\n====Immunization====\nHistorically, infectious disease has been the leading cause of death in the human population. Over the last century, two important factors have been developed to combat their spread: [[sanitation]] and [[immunization]].<ref name=Janeway6/> Immunization (commonly referred to as [[vaccination]]) is the deliberate induction of an immune response, and represents the single most effective manipulation of the immune system that scientists have developed.<ref name=Janeway6/> Immunizations are successful because they utilize the immune system's natural specificity as well as its inducibility.\n\nThe principle behind immunization is to introduce an antigen, derived from a disease-causing organism, that stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against that organism, but that does not '''itself''' cause the pathogenic effects of that organism. An [[antigen]] (short for ''anti''body ''gen''erator), is defined as any substance that binds to a specific antibody and elicits an [[adaptive immune response]].<ref name=Alberts/>\n\nMost viral [[vaccine]]s are based on live [[Attenuated vaccine|attenuated]] viruses, whereas many bacterial vaccines are based on [[acellular]] components of microorganisms, including harmless [[toxin]] components.<ref name=Alberts/> Many antigens derived from acellular vaccines do not strongly induce an adaptive response, and most bacterial vaccines require the addition of ''[[Immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]]s'' that activate the antigen-presenting cells of the [[innate immune system]] to enhance [[immunogenicity]].<ref name=Janeway6/>\n\n==Immunological diversity==\n[[File:Antibody chains.svg|thumb|right|An antibody is made up of two heavy chains and two light chains. The unique variable region allows an antibody to recognize its matching antigen.<ref name=NIAID/>]]\nMost large molecules, including virtually all [[protein]]s and many [[polysaccharide]]s, can serve as antigens.<ref name=Janeway/> The parts of an antigen that interact with an antibody molecule or a lymphocyte receptor, are called [[epitope]]s, or antigenic determinants. Most antigens contain a variety of epitopes and can stimulate the production of antibodies, specific T cell responses, or both.<ref name=Janeway/>   A very small proportion (less than 0.01%) of the total lymphocytes are able to bind to a particular antigen, which suggests that only a few cells respond to each antigen.<ref name=Janeway6/>\n\nFor the acquired response to \"remember\" and eliminate a large number of pathogens the immune system must be able to distinguish between many different antigens,<ref name=Alberts/> and the receptors that recognize antigens must be produced in a huge variety of configurations, in essence one receptor (at least) for each different pathogen that might ever be encountered. Even in the absence of antigen stimulation, a human can produce more than 1 trillion different antibody molecules.<ref name=Janeway6/> Millions of genes would be required to store the genetic information that produces these receptors, but, the entire human genome contains fewer than 25,000 [[gene]]s.<ref name=\"IHSGC2004\">{{cite journal | author = International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium | title = Finishing the euchromatic sequence of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 431 | issue = 7011 | pages = 931\u201345 | date = October 2004 | pmid = 15496913 | doi = 10.1038/nature03001 }}</ref>\n\nMyriad receptors are produced through a process known as [[clonal selection]].<ref name=Alberts/><ref name=Janeway/>  According to the clonal selection theory, at birth, an animal randomly generates a vast diversity of lymphocytes (each bearing a unique antigen receptor) from information encoded in a small family of genes. To generate each unique antigen receptor, these genes have undergone a process called [[V(D)J recombination]], or ''combinatorial diversification'', in which one gene segment recombines with other gene segments to form a single unique gene. This assembly process generates the enormous diversity of receptors and antibodies, before the body ever encounters antigens, and enables the immune system to respond to an almost unlimited diversity of antigens.<ref name=Janeway/> Throughout an animal's lifetime, lymphocytes that can react against the antigens an animal actually encounters are selected for action\u2014directed against anything that expresses that antigen.\n\nNote that the innate and acquired portions of the immune system work together, not in spite of each other. The acquired arm, B, and T cells couldn't function without the innate system' input. T cells are useless without antigen-presenting cells to activate them, and B cells are crippled without T cell help. On the other hand, the innate system would likely be overrun with pathogens without the specialized action of the adaptive immune response.\n\n==Acquired immunity during pregnancy==\nThe cornerstone of the immune system is the recognition of \"self\" versus \"non-self\". Therefore, the mechanisms that protect the human [[fetus]] (which is considered \"non-self\") from attack by the immune system, are particularly interesting. Although no comprehensive explanation has emerged to explain this mysterious, and often repeated, lack of rejection, two classical reasons may explain how the fetus is tolerated. The first is that the fetus occupies a portion of the body protected by a non-immunological barrier, the [[uterus]], which the immune system does not routinely patrol.<ref name=Janeway/> The second is that the fetus itself may promote local immunosuppression in the mother, perhaps by a process of active nutrient depletion.<ref name=Janeway/> A more modern explanation for this induction of tolerance is that specific glycoproteins expressed in the uterus during [[pregnancy]] suppress the uterine immune response (see [[eu-FEDS]]).\n\nDuring pregnancy in [[viviparity|viviparous]] mammals (all mammals except [[Monotreme]]s), [[endogenous retroviruses]] (ERVs) are activated and produced in high quantities during the implantation of the embryo. They are currently known to possess immunosuppressive properties, suggesting a role in protecting the embryo from its mother's immune system. Also, [[viral fusion proteins]] cause the formation of the placental [[syncytium]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mi S, Lee X, Li X, Veldman GM, Finnerty H, Racie L, LaVallie E, Tang XY, Edouard P, Howes S, Keith JC, McCoy JM | title = Syncytin is a captive retroviral envelope protein involved in human placental morphogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 403 | issue = 6771 | pages = 785\u201389 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10693809 | doi = 10.1038/35001608 }}\n</ref> to limit exchange of migratory cells between the developing embryo and the body of the mother (something an [[epithelium]] can't do sufficiently, as certain blood cells specialize to insert themselves between adjacent epithelial cells). The immunodepressive action was the initial normal behavior of the virus, similar to HIV. The fusion proteins were a way to spread the infection to other cells by simply merging them with the infected one (HIV does this too). It is believed that the ancestors of modern viviparous mammals evolved after an infection by this virus, enabling the fetus to survive the immune system of the mother.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~faculty/villarreal/new1/erv-placental.html\n|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070715005236/http://www.dbc.uci.edu/~faculty/villarreal/new1/erv-placental.html\n|url-status=dead\n|archive-date=2007-07-15\n|title=The Viruses That Make Us: A Role For Endogenous Retrovirus In The Evolution Of Placental Species\n| first = Luis P. | last = Villarreal | name-list-format = vanc \n|publisher=University of California, Irvine (lecture notes)\n|access-date=2008-02-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[human genome project]] found several thousand [[endogenous retrovirus|ERV]]s classified into 24 families.<ref>{{cite journal | url = http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp | title = Persisting Viruses Could Play Role in Driving Host Evolution | first = Luis P. | last = Villarreal | name-list-format = vanc | journal = ASM News | date = Oct 2001 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090508113235/http://newsarchive.asm.org/oct01/feature1.asp | archive-date = 2009-05-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Immune network theory==\n{{Main|Immune network theory}}\nA theoretical framework explaining the workings of the acquired immune system is provided by [[immune network theory]], based on interactions between [[idiotypes]] (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of [[antigenic determinants]] of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype as if it were a foreign antigen). This theory, which builds on the existing [[clonal selection]] hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by [[Niels Jerne]] and [[Geoffrey W. Hoffmann]], is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the [[Pathophysiology of HIV/AIDS|HIV pathogenesis]] and the search for an [[HIV vaccine]].\n\n=== Stimulation of adaptive immunity ===\nOne of the most interesting developments in biomedical science during the past few decades has been elucidation of mechanisms mediating innate immunity.  One set of innate immune mechanisms is humoral, such as [[complement system|complement activation]].  Another set comprises pattern recognition receptors such as [[toll-like receptor]]s, which induce the production of interferons and other cytokines increasing resistance of cells such as monocytes to infections.<ref name=Uematsu/> Cytokines produced during innate immune responses are among the activators of adaptive immune responses.<ref name=Uematsu/> Antibodies exert additive or synergistic effects with mechanisms of innate immunity.

The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

Unlike previous Qualifying rounds, this round only reveal the first and last placed singers and the middle placements for the other five were not shown until the next episode.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible\" width=\"80%\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n| colspan=\"9\" |<div style=\"font-size:10pt\">'''Singer 2020 Qualifier Round 5 April 3, 2020 Host: Eliza Liang'''</div>\n|- style=\"background:#f49c3b\n| style=\"width:7%\" |'''Order'''\n| style=\"width:8%\" |'''Singer'''\n| style=\"width:9%\" |'''Music Partner'''\n| style=\"width:18%\" |'''Song Title'''\n| style=\"width:12%\" |'''Original Singer'''\n| style=\"width:12% \" |'''Lyricist'''\n| style=\"width:12%\" |'''Composer'''\n| style=\"width:15%\" |'''Arranger'''\n| style=\"width:7%\" |'''Rank'''\n|-\n| 1 || [[Jam Hsiao]] || Eliza liang || \"\u62ab\u661f\u6234\u6708\u7684\u60f3\u4f60\" || Accusefive || Pan Yanshan || Pam Yunan ||  || 5\n|-\n| 2 || ''[[Super-Vocal]]'' || \u2014 || \"[[Radioactive (Imagine Dragons song)|Radioactive]]|| [[Imagine Dragons]] || colspan=2 | [[Alex da Kid|Alexander Grant]]<br />[[Ben McKee]]<br />Josh Mosser<br />[[Daniel Platzman]]<br />[[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]]<br />[[Wayne Sermon]] ||  || 7\n|-\n| 3 || ''Life Journey'' || Kuo Tao || \"\u6c38\u8fdc\u90fd\u4f1a\u5728\" || ''Life Journey'' || colspan=2 | Zijun Huang<br />Wei Wei ||  || Surprise Success 6\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 4 || rowspan=2 | [[Zhou Shen]] || rowspan=2 | Enti Jin || \"\u76f8\u601d\" || [[Mao Amin]] || Chou Xiaoyuan || Sanbao || rowspan=2 |  || rowspan=2 |  3\n|-\n| \"\u79e6\u6dee\u666f\"\uff08Wu\uff09 || Hsu Huifen<br />Wu Jianfang<br />Chang Jianfeng || colspan=2 | [[Qigang Chen]]\n|-\n| 5 || [[Misia]] || Hao Tan || \"[[Ai no Katachi|\u30a2\u30a4\u30ce\u30ab\u30bf\u30c1]] feat.HIDE(GReeeeN)\"<br>(Ai no Katachi) (Japanese) || Misia<br />[[GReeeeN|HIDE]] || colspan=2 | GReeeeN ||  || 4\n|-\n| 6 || [[Hua Chenyu]] || Li Weijia || \"\u597d\u60f3\u7231\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e16\u754c\u554a\" || Hua Chenyu || Pei Yu || Hua Chenyu || Zheng Nan] || 2\n|-\n| 7 || Jike Junyi || \u2014 || \"\u4e0d\u8981\u6015\"\uff08Yi\uff09 || \u74e6\u5176\u4f9d\u5408 || colspan=2 | Moxi Zishi ||  || 8\n|-\n| 8 || [[Lala Hsu]] || Leo Li || \"\u5927\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\" || [[Jolin Tsai]] || Yan Yunnong || Robin Jessen<br />Anne Judith Wik<br />Nermin Harambasic<br />Ronny Svendsen<br />Charite Viken Reinas<br />Eirik Johansen<br />Alexander Puntervold ||  || 1\n|}\n\n===== Surprise Challenge results =====\n{| width=\"70%\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background:#f49c3b\n! colspan=\"5\" | <div class=\"iamasinger-table-header\">Singer 2020 Qualifier Round 5 Surprise Challenge results</div>\n|- style=\"background:#f49c3b\n! style=\"width:20%\" | Order !! style=\"width:20%\" | Singer !! style=\"width:20%\" | Votes !! style=\"width:20%\" | Valid Votes !! style=\"width:20%\" | Results\n|-\n| rowspan=2 | 1 || ''Life Journey'' || 309 || rowspan=2 | 493 || rowspan=2 | Surprise Success/Advanced\n|-\n| ''[[Super-Vocal]]''|| 184\n|}\n\n==== Knockout ====\n*'''Recording Date''': March 31, 2020\n*'''Airing date''': April 10, 2020\n\nThe final Surprise Challenger introduced this season is Ai Re.

The season premiered on February 7, 2020 after facing two postponements, one from January 10 due to some episodes clashing with [[Chinese New Year]], and one on January 31 due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|ongoing Coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ent.sina.com.cn/tv/zy/2020-01-29/doc-iimxxste7519666.shtml|title=\u6e56\u5357\u536b\u89c6\u300a\u6b4c\u624b\u300b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u81f32\u67087\u65e5\u64ad\u51fa|website=Sina|date=2019-01-29|accessdate=2020-01-31}}</ref>.\n\nThis is the first season in the show's history not to feature Return performances, due to health and safety concerns over the coronavirus pandemic happening at the time of taping.\n\n==Competition rules==\nLike the previous seasons of ''I Am a Singer'' and ''Singer'', it features five rounds of two stages, Qualifier and Knockout, with seven singers performing for a 500-member audience each week. The [[electronic voting]], first appeared as a pre-voting twist in [[Singer 2018|season six]] and introduced permanently on [[Singer 2019|season seven]], where voting (up to three votes) was conducted throughout the performance and accounted for 50% of the final score. As such for past seasons, the scores from both weeks are combined to decide the eliminated singer who received the fewest votes. Unlike the last season, separate scores for paper and electronic votes are not revealed.\n\nThe competition revert to the pre-[[I Am a Singer (Chinese season 3)|season three]] format with Challenge rounds (a round which featured a new singer requiring to rank in the top four to avoid elimination) removed, but instead replaced with a variant round known as Surprise, which in-turn functions similarities to the Substituted singers as well. Three new singers were introduced at the start of the Qualifier round and along with the managers; while on backstage, the singers watched their performance while seated with a microphone stand lever. During the performance, a contestant may pull the lever to issue a challenge to the current contestant, but any current contestants are not aware from their existence until the performance ended. After the challenger performed, an electronic vote will immediately conduct with the results being revealed afterwards (previously after the episode prior to the first round). All three Surprise challenges do not need to be performed on a single episode, but challengers must challenge to a singer within the current elimination round. If at least one challenger succeed in the Surprise round, one contestant from the current lineup will be eliminated at the end of the current Knockout round; if multiple challengers succeed, a re-vote will conduct between the successful singers and the singer with a higher vote advance will replace the eliminated singer, but all successful singers, regardless if they lose the revote will be guaranteed a place in the Breakout round. If all three challengers were unsuccessful, all seven contestants are safe from elimination itself. The final round features a small change in which the Challengers were reduced to two, and no re-vote was conducted for multiple successful singers, meaning that the singers are immediately advanced to the competition and eliminations are conducted as usual.\n\nAs the season is subtitled ''Year of the Hits'', the contest is suggested for a pool of younger singing talents with an age range of 18 and 35. Contestants are no longer restricted to the songs selection, and may freely choose a song they composed on their own or on someone else. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://epaper.bbtnews.com.cn/site1/bjsb/html/2020-01/06/content_442354.htm|title=\u9996\u53d1\u9635\u5bb9\u5f15\u4e89\u8bae \u300a\u6b4c\u624b2020\u300b\u9760\u4ec0\u4e48\u201c\u5f53\u6253\u201d |publisher=\u5317\u4eac\u5546\u62a5|author1=\u5362\u626c|author2=\u4f0d\u78a7\u6021|date=2020-01-06|accessdate=2020-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Contestants==\nThe following ''Singer 2020'' contestants are listed in alphabetical order.

The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the \"Alice in Nightmareland\" version). After the contest, \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.\n\nLoic has sung at NJR park Uitmarkt Symphonica.

The song went to number one on both the Flanders and Wallonia Ultratop charts. Performing in the first semi final of the competition, Nottet was successful in progressing to the final, coming second in his semi final with 149 points. During the Jury Final (following Australia), he could be barely seen on stage due to heavy use of smoke machines and pyrotechnics from the Australian Act. His delegation was rumoured to have lodged a complaint about this, saying that it would affect part of their final score. While they requested to perform again, this was apparently denied, instead telling juries to disregard the smoke. In the Grand Final, the Belgian entry scored a total of 217 points leaving \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" in fourth position overall, giving Belgium its first top five placement since 2003. It received the maximum 12 points from three countries; Netherlands, France and Hungary. The song was certified Platinum for selling 30,000 copies in Belgium. Nottet has released three different music videos for Rhythm Inside (including one called the \"Alice in Nightmareland\" version). After the contest, \"[[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]]\" reached the top ten in the Austrian, Lithuanian and Russian Music Charts, achieving top 20 in Finland, Iceland and Sweden and also charting in Australia, UK, France, Switzerland and many more European countries.\n\nLoic has sung at NJR park Uitmarkt Symphonica.
