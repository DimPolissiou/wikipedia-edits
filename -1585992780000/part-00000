Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.

Its official creation date is July 1971 during the [[Bangladesh Sector Commanders Conference 1971]]. In 1971, with [[West Pakistan]] imposing a brutal military crackdown in [[East Pakistan]], the Bangladesh Liberation War was already underway. Many Bengali sailors and officers in the Pakistan Navy defected to form the nascent Bangladesh Navy. Initially, there were two ships, ''PADMA'' and ''PALASH'', and 45 navy personnel.  On 9 November 1971, the first naval fleet, consisting of six small [[patrol vessel]]s, was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=War_of_Liberation,_The|title=War of Liberation, The|publisher=banglapedia.org}}</ref> These ships tried to carry out raids on the Pakistani fleet, but were mistakenly hit and sunk by the [[Indian Air Force]] on 10 December 1971. The next major attack was launched on [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]] seaport. According to official figures from the Bangladesh Navy, a total of 334 sailors were involved with the newly created navy, with 22 being killed in action.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |title=Bangladesh Navy in Liberation War |website=Bangladesh Navy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613092723/http://bangladeshnavy.org/liber.html |archive-date=13 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Independence to the end of the 20th century===\nThe navy carried out around 45 operations during the war: traditional naval operations and unconventional [[commando]] operations including [[guerrilla warfare]].  In the first leg of the war, defecting [[Bengal]]i sailors joined the guerrilla forces. It was the eight sailors who defected from the [[Pakistan Navy]] submarine ''PNS Mangro'', under construction in France, that pioneered the formation of the naval element during the Liberation War.  Later many other naval personnel participated.  During the Liberation War, [[East Pakistan]] was divided into 11 sectors.  Each sector had a Commander and a demarcated area of responsibility except sector 10. Sector 10 was nominally responsible for the coastal belt but actually operated over the entire country.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Navy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704035414/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/history.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971, it was imperative for the occupation force to keep ports and harbours operative and the sea lines of communication open. The Bangladesh Navy fought to block the sea lines of communication, and to make the sea and river ports inoperative. They attacked all the seaports including many river ports. [[Operation Jackpot]] is one of the best known and most successful operations. They carried out [[Naval mine|mining]] in the [[Pasur River]] Channel by patrol craft. With other fighters they also carried out attacks against the Pakistan Army.  As a result, Bangladesh became an independent state within the shortest possible time.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Bangladesh Naval Academy|url=http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|website=Bangladesh Navy|publisher=bangladeshnavy.mil.bd|accessdate=3 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704015728/http://www.bangladeshnavy.mil.bd/bna.html|archive-date=4 July 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nAfter independence, especially in the 1970s, additional naval infrastructure was required.
