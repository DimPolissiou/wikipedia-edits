The oldest martial arts school in [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]], it was founded in 1972 as a [[dojo]] for [[Uechi-ryu]] [[karate]]. The school since expanded to include other martial arts, and currently provides instruction in [[Shohei-ryu]] karate (a spin-off of Uechi-ryu), [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[Muay Thai]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[Okinawan kobud\u014d|kobudo]], and [[self-defense]], and is the fastest growing martial arts community in Berkshire County. The school also contains a store which provides equipment, gear, and instructional media. It is affiliated with the Okinawan Karatedo Association, [[Demian Maia]] Jiu-Jitsu Association, and [[Team Sityodtong]] Boston, and is accredited by the [[North American Grappling Association]]. ZenQuest has received significant coverage by regional and local media in [[Berkshire County]], including ''[[The Berkshire Eagle]]'', ''Berkshires' Best Buys, Business, and Beyond'', and Pittsfield Cable Television, for its regular youth tournaments and seminars with high-ranking officials from the school's parent organizations.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = ZenQuest TrainingR1.jpg\n| width1    = 15\n| alt1      = Training room #1\n| caption1  = Training room #1 at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n| image2    = ZenQuest fitness room.jpg\n| width2    = 15\n| alt2      = Exercise and weight room\n| caption2  = Exercise and weight room at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n| image3    = ZenQuest TrainingR2.JPG\n| width3    = 15\n| alt3      = Training room #2\n| caption3  = Training room #2 at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n}}\nThe school was originally based in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], and was opened on Lyman Street in 1972 by [[Sensei]] Frank Gorman, who according to ''Berkshires' Best Buys Business & Beyond'' introduced [[Uechi-ryu]] karate to Berkshire County.<ref name=\"About Us\">{{cite web| title=About Us| url=http://zenquestmac.com/?page_id=2| work=Zenquestmac.com| publisher=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=berkshirebest>{{cite journal| title=Quality Martial Arts in Pittsfield| journal=Berkshires' Best Buys Business & Beyond| date=16 September \u2013 6 October 2008| volume=1| issue=10| pages=19}}</ref> It is the oldest martial arts school in Berkshire County.<ref name=Decberkbest>{{cite journal| title=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| journal=Berkshires' Best Buys, Business, and Beyond| date=December 6\u201319, 2011| volume=4| issue=15| pages=8| url=http://free.yudu.com/item/embedded_reader/446196/Berkshires--Best-December-6--2011| accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> In 1993 the school was moved to the Pittsfield Plaza on West Housatonic Street, developing a significant children's program. Senseis Mark and Connie Flynn took ownership of the school in August 2002. They previously lived and worked in [[Albany, New York]], and ran a smaller satellite dojo in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. The Flynns purchased the school from Bob and Lisken Dus, who stated at the time that they were entering into retirement and would focus on providing support to the Flynns.<ref name=berkshirebest /> In the fall of 2002, the Flynns widened the school's curriculum to include [[Brazil]]ian \"Gracie\" [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|jiu-jitsu]]. Mixed martial arts classes were added later.<ref name=berkshirebest /> The Flynns traveled to [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]], in 2003, 2007 and 2012 for training with world leaders in Uechi-Ryu/Shohei-Ryu. During the 2007 trip Mrs. Flynn was promoted to 5th Dan, and both attended the 2007 All Okinawa Championships, a worldwide championship event. Sensei Connie took third place in [[kata]], while Sensei Mark managed to reach fourth in [[kumite]].<ref name=berkshirebest /> In 2010, due to deterioration of the Pittsfield Plaza where it was located, and the need for additional space, the school relocated to Lenox Commons in [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], where it changed its name from Okinawan Karate School to ZenQuest Martial Arts Center.<ref>{{cite news| last=Dobrowolski| first=Tony| title=Pittsfield Plaza's last shop to leave| newspaper=[[Berkshire Eagle]]| date=14 February 2011| pages=A01}}</ref> Along with this relocation and name change the school updated classes to a full roster which includes Muay Thai kickboxing, boxing, wrestling and mixed martial arts.<ref>{{cite web| title=Martial Arts Training| url=http://zenquestmac.com/?page_id=260| work=zanquestmac.com| publisher=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref> The school is now the largest martial arts community in Berkshire County.<ref name=Decberkbest /> In 2016, Mark Flynn received a belt-belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, becoming the third person in Berkshire County to achieve that high a rank in the art and the second in the United States to be awarded a black belt by Demian Maia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/sports/ci_30112967/mark-flynn-earns-black-belt-brazilian-jiu-jitsu|title=Mark Flynn earns black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Events and seminars==\nThe school has received regular coverage by ''The Berkshire Eagle'' and Pittsfield Cable Television, including the school's annual hosting of a youth tournament<ref>{{cite video| people =Brian Schaffer (Producer)| date=28 March 2010| title =2010 Okinawan Karate School Adult & Youth Demonstration and Tournament|url=http://pittsfieldtv.dyndns.org/Cablecast/Public/Show.aspx?ChannelID=1&ShowID=13054| format=| medium =| language =| trans_title =| publisher =Pittsfield Cable Television| location  =[[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]| archiveurl  =| archivedate =| accessdate  =14 June 2011| time =| id  =| isbn =| oclc=| quote=| ref=}};

The oldest martial arts school in [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts|Berkshire County]], it was founded in 1972 as a [[dojo]] for [[Uechi-ryu]] [[karate]]. The school since expanded to include other martial arts, and currently provides instruction in [[Shohei-ryu]] karate (a spin-off of Uechi-ryu), [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]], [[mixed martial arts]], [[Muay Thai]], [[boxing]], [[wrestling]], [[Okinawan kobud\u014d|kobudo]], and [[self-defense]], and is the fastest growing martial arts community in Berkshire County. The school also contains a store which provides equipment, gear, and instructional media. It is affiliated with the Okinawan Karatedo Association, [[Demian Maia]] Jiu-Jitsu Association, and [[Team Sityodtong]] Boston, and is accredited by the [[North American Grappling Association]]. ZenQuest has received significant coverage by regional and local media in [[Berkshire County]], including ''[[The Berkshire Eagle]]'', ''Berkshires' Best Buys, Business, and Beyond'', and Pittsfield Cable Television, for its regular youth tournaments and seminars with high-ranking officials from the school's parent organizations.\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 100\n| image1    = ZenQuest TrainingR1.jpg\n| width1    = 15\n| alt1      = Training room #1\n| caption1  = Training room #1 at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n| image2    = ZenQuest fitness room.jpg\n| width2    = 15\n| alt2      = Exercise and weight room\n| caption2  = Exercise and weight room at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n| image3    = ZenQuest TrainingR2.JPG\n| width3    = 15\n| alt3      = Training room #2\n| caption3  = Training room #2 at ZenQuest Martial Arts Center\n}}\nThe school was originally based in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], and was opened on Lyman Street in 1972 by [[Sensei]] Frank Gorman, who according to ''Berkshires' Best Buys Business & Beyond'' introduced [[Uechi-ryu]] karate to Berkshire County.<ref name=\"About Us\">{{cite web| title=About Us| url=http://zenquestmac.com/?page_id=2| work=Zenquestmac.com| publisher=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=berkshirebest>{{cite journal| title=Quality Martial Arts in Pittsfield| journal=Berkshires' Best Buys Business & Beyond| date=16 September \u2013 6 October 2008| volume=1| issue=10| pages=19}}</ref> It is the oldest martial arts school in Berkshire County.<ref name=Decberkbest>{{cite journal| title=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| journal=Berkshires' Best Buys, Business, and Beyond| date=December 6\u201319, 2011| volume=4| issue=15| pages=8| url=http://free.yudu.com/item/embedded_reader/446196/Berkshires--Best-December-6--2011| accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> In 1993 the school was moved to the Pittsfield Plaza on West Housatonic Street, developing a significant children's program. Senseis Mark and Connie Flynn took ownership of the school in August 2002. They previously lived and worked in [[Albany, New York]], and ran a smaller satellite dojo in [[Guilderland, New York|Guilderland]]. The Flynns purchased the school from Bob and Lisken Dus, who stated at the time that they were entering into retirement and would focus on providing support to the Flynns.<ref name=berkshirebest /> In the fall of 2002, the Flynns widened the school's curriculum to include [[Brazil]]ian \"Gracie\" [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu|jiu-jitsu]]. Mixed martial arts classes were added later.<ref name=berkshirebest /> The Flynns traveled to [[Okinawa]], [[Japan]], in 2003, 2007 and 2012 for training with world leaders in Uechi-Ryu/Shohei-Ryu. During the 2007 trip Mrs. Flynn was promoted to 5th Dan, and both attended the 2007 All Okinawa Championships, a worldwide championship event. Sensei Connie took third place in [[kata]], while Sensei Mark managed to reach fourth in [[kumite]].<ref name=berkshirebest /> In 2010, due to deterioration of the Pittsfield Plaza where it was located, and the need for additional space, the school relocated to Lenox Commons in [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], where it changed its name from Okinawan Karate School to ZenQuest Martial Arts Center.<ref>{{cite news| last=Dobrowolski| first=Tony| title=Pittsfield Plaza's last shop to leave| newspaper=[[Berkshire Eagle]]| date=14 February 2011| pages=A01}}</ref> Along with this relocation and name change the school updated classes to a full roster which includes Muay Thai kickboxing, boxing, wrestling and mixed martial arts.<ref>{{cite web| title=Martial Arts Training| url=http://zenquestmac.com/?page_id=260| work=zanquestmac.com| publisher=ZenQuest Martial Arts Center| accessdate=14 June 2011}}</ref> The school is now the largest martial arts community in Berkshire County.<ref name=Decberkbest /> In 2016, Mark Flynn received a belt-belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, becoming the third person in Berkshire County to achieve that high a rank in the art and the second in the United States to be awarded a black belt by Demian Maia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.berkshireeagle.com/sports/ci_30112967/mark-flynn-earns-black-belt-brazilian-jiu-jitsu|title=Mark Flynn earns black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu|access-date=2016-07-11}}</ref>\n\n==Events and seminars==\nThe school has received regular coverage by ''The Berkshire Eagle'' and Pittsfield Cable Television, including the school's annual hosting of a youth tournament<ref>{{cite video| people =Brian Schaffer (Producer)| date=28 March 2010| title =2010 Okinawan Karate School Adult & Youth Demonstration and Tournament|url=http://pittsfieldtv.dyndns.org/Cablecast/Public/Show.aspx?ChannelID=1&ShowID=13054| format=| medium =| language =| trans_title =| publisher =Pittsfield Cable Television| location  =[[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]| archiveurl  =| archivedate =| accessdate  =14 June 2011| time =| id  =| isbn =| oclc=| quote=| ref=}};

{"title_page": "Economic liberalization in the post\u2013World War II era", "text_new": "{{Orphan|date=February 2014}}\n\nDirectly after [[World War II]] saw many countries adopt policies of [[economic liberalisation|economic liberalization]] in order to stimulate their economies.\n\nThe period directly after the war did not see many, the most notable exception being [[West Germany]]'s reforms of 1948, which set the stage for the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] in the 1950s and helped inform many of the liberalisations that were to come.\n\nHowever, it was not until the 1970s that the [[stagflation]] of the period forced many countries to look for new economic systems. The emergence of [[neoliberalism]] and other associated economically liberal doctrines saw a wave of economic liberalisations sweeping the globe.\n\nStarting with [[Chile]] in 1975, various governments adopted and implemented liberal policy. The most important of these were [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], who developed the initial wave of neoliberal thought in practise.\n\nChronic economic crisis throughout the 1980s and the collapse of the [[Communist bloc]] at the end of the 1980s, helped foster political opposition to state interventionism in favor of unregulated market reform policies. From the 1980s onward, a number of communist and socialist countries initiated various neoliberal market reforms, such as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the direction of [[Ante Markovi\u0107]] (until the country's collapse in the early 1990s), and the [[People's Republic of China]] under the direction of [[Deng Xiaoping]].\n\nIn the 1990s, a second more [[Social liberalism|socially-liberal]] wave of liberalisation swept the world under [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Tony Blair]].<ref name=\"Steger 2010 21\u201350\">{{cite book|last=Steger|first=Manfred|title=Neoliberalism: A Very Short Introduction|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press, Inc|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-956051-6|pages=21\u201350}}</ref>\n\n==Post-WWII economic liberalism==\n\n===West Germany===\n\n====Background====\n\nGermany ended the [[European theatre of World War II]] with its unconditional surrender on the [[Victory in Europe Day|8th of May, 1945]]. It faced war damage to its economy and the problems of mass migration due to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from areas east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]].\n\nApril 1945 to July 1947 saw the Allied occupation of Germany implement [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive 1067 ([[JCS 1067]]). The aim of this directive was to transfer Germany's economy from one centred on heavy industry to a pastoral one, in order to prevent Germany from having the capacity to wage war. Civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's \"approved peacetime needs\", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements. In May 1946, the first plan stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants. Restrictions on steel followed.\n\nIt soon became obvious that this policy was not sustainable. Germany could not grow enough food for itself and malnutrition was becoming increasingly common. The European post-war economic recovery did not materialise and it became increasingly obvious that the European economy had depended on German industry.<ref name=\"WikiMorgenthau\">See [[Morgenthau Plan]] for the variety of sources supporting this position when discussing the effect of the implementation of JCS 1067.</ref>\n\nIn July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\" the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\" It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"<ref name=\"TimePdP\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417-1,00.html Pas de Pagaille] Time Magazine, Jul. 28, 1947.</ref>\n\nBy 1948, Germany suffered from rampant hyperinflation. The currency of the time (the [[Reichsmark]]) had no public confidence, and thanks to that and price controls, [[black market]] trading boomed and bartering proliferated. Banks were over their heads in debt and surplus currency abounded.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\">[http://www.bundesbank.de/download/volkswirtschaft/mba/2002/200203_en_dmark.pdf Bundesbank.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718213908/http://www.bundesbank.de/download/volkswirtschaft/mba/2002/200203_en_dmark.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}, accessed June 13, 2010</ref>\n\nHowever, thanks to the introduction of JCS 1779 and the first Allied attempts to set up German governance, something could be done about this. [[Ludwig Erhard]], an economist, who had spent much time working on the problem of post war recovery, had worked his way up the administration created by the occupying American forces until he became the Director of Economics in the [[Bizone|Bizonal]] Economic Council in the joint British and American occupied zones (which would later, with the addition of the French occupied territory become the basis for West Germany). He was placed in charge of currency reform and became a central figure in events that were to follow.\n\n====Economic reforms====\n\nIn spring of 1948, the Allies decided to reform the currency. In preparation for this, a new central bank system was established in West Germany with independent Land Central Banks and the Bank deutscher Lander with headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nCurrency reform took effect on June 20, 1948, through the introduction of the [[Deutsche Mark]] to replace the [[Reichsmark]] and by transferring to the Bank deutscher Lander the sole right to print money. Each person received a per capita allowance of 60 DM, payable in two instalments (40 DM and 20 DM) and business quota of 60 DM per employee.\n\nUnder the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|German Currency Conversion Law]] on 27 June, private non-bank credit balances were converted at a rate of 10 RM to 1 DM, with half remaining in a frozen bank account. Although the money stock was very small in terms of national product, the adjustment in the price structure immediately led to sharp price increases, fuelled by the high velocity of money through the system. As a result, on the 4th of October, the military governments wiped out 70% of the remaining frozen balances, resulting in an effective exchange of 10:0.65. Holders of financial assets (including many small-time savers) were dispossessed and the banks' debt in Reichsmarks was eliminated, transferred instead into claims on the Lander and later the Federal Government. Wages, rents, pensions and other recurring liabilities were transferred at 1:1.\n\nOn the day of the currency reform, [[Ludwig Erhard]] announced, despite the reservations of the Allies, that rationing would be considerably relaxed and price controls abolished.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\n====Results====\n\nIn the short term, the currency reforms and abolition of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and was accepted by the public as a medium of payment. The currency reforms had ensured that money was once more scarce, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in the adoption of the new currency.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nIn the long term, these reforms helped set the stage for the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (German for economic miracle) in the 1950s.\n\n==Post-1970s economic liberalism==\n\nNeoliberalism ultimately developed through two major phases. The first phase carried out through the help of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the second phase through [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Tony Blair]].<ref name=\"Steger 2010 21\u201350\"/>\n\nChronic economic crisis throughout the 1980s and the collapse of the [[Communist bloc]] at the end of the 1980s, helped foster political opposition to state interventionism in favor of unregulated market reform policies. From the 1980s onward, a number of communist and socialist countries initiated various neoliberal market reforms, such as the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] under the direction of [[Ante Markovi\u0107]] (until the country's collapse in the early 1990s), and the [[People's Republic of China]] under the direction of [[Deng Xiaoping]].\n\nChanges occurred from the 1970s to the 1980s. Starting off with most of the democratic world, governments focused primarily on the primacy of economic individual rights, the rule of law and the role of governments in moderating relative unregulated trade. It was almost considered national self-determination at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe status of organized labour shifted when the governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher took strong stances to break down trade barriers entirely to reduce government power; thus allowing the market to be more important.

In addition to the neoliberal agenda, the Liberal government increased taxation through a 10% Goods and Services Tax [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]] (similar to European [[VAT]]).

Mexico joined GATT, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986 and has been a part of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since 1990. Another trading partnership Mexico entered into was the Uruguay Round (UR).\n\nThe reforms brought about by NAFTA resulted in a huge opening of the Mexican economy and \u201c increased the political and economic costs of trade policy reversals and restrained trade policy with other countries to compatibility with (if not subservience to) NAFTA,\u201d (Mena, 48). Tariffs were reduced across most sectors of the economy. They also opened the door for factories along the border of the US and Mexico. Maquiladoras account for most of the Mexican export market. A reform of the 1973 Foreign Investment Law, \u201cForeign Investment is not allowed in oil production or refining.\u201d (Mena, p.&nbsp;49).\n\nMexico benefited greatly from its relationship with the UR and the WTO. There were low tariffs on Mexican goods and Mexico was not bound to alter its tariffs for UR members. \u201cMexico\u2019s preferences on non-agricultural subsidies were largely borne out in the URAs,\u201d (Ortiz Mena, 60). Mexico continues to have restrictions on foreign ownership and has been criticized for not signing the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]]. NGOs are also critical of the reforms that had been made.\n\nAfter joining NAFTA, Mexico entered into over thirty Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Mexico also signed FTAs with the European Union (EU), European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and Japan. As a result of these agreements, exports increased, manufactured goods became more important and Mexico became the US\u2019s second largest trading partner.\n\nThe Mexican government feels that the benefits of liberalism have been slowed due to a lack of implementations of URA policies by developed countries. The government fears that environmental and labor issues might affect the trade agenda. They are looking to the developed nations to help with a clean transition to the post-Doha work program. There are eleven areas that Mexico will focus on in the future: agriculture, export subsidies, TRIM, Service, IPR, dispute settlements, FDI, competition policy, government procurement, industrial goods, and labor and environment. Also, Mexico seeks to improve access for its important exports by complying fully with URAs.<ref>Ortiz Mena, Antonio. 2004. \u201cA Regional Player in Multilateral Trade Negotiations.\u201d In Trade Policy Reforms in Latin America. pp. 47\u201371</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe term [[Rogernomics]] was created by analogy with [[Reaganomics]] to describe the [[economic reform|economic policies]] followed by New Zealand [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Roger Douglas]] from his appointment in 1984.\n\nThe policies included cutting agricultural subsidies and trade barriers, [[privatisation|privatising]] public assets and the control of [[inflation]] through measures rooted in [[monetarism]], and were regarded by many as a betrayal of traditional Labour ideals. The Labour Party subsequently retreated from pure Rogernomics, which became a core doctrine of the more right-wing [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party. Roger Douglas planned to create a 15% flat tax in New Zealand, and to privatise schools, roads and hospitals, which was moderated by the Labour cabinet at the time,<ref>Lange, David. ''My Life.''(2005) Viking. Auckland.</ref> although the resultant reforms were still generally considered radical in a global context. After Douglas left the Labour party, he went on to co-found ACT in 1993, which regards itself as the new liberal party of New Zealand.\n\nSince 1984, government subsidies including those for agriculture have been eliminated; import regulations have been reduced; exchange rates have been floated; controls on [[interest rates]], wages, and prices have been removed; and marginal rates of taxation reduced. Tight monetary policy and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987. The Deregulation of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s reduced government's role in the economy and permitted the retirement of some [[public debt]], but simultaneously massively increased the necessity for greater [[welfare state|welfare spending]] and has led to considerably higher rates of [[unemployment]] than were standard in New Zealand in earlier decades. However, unemployment in New Zealand lowered again by 2006\u20132007, hovering around 3.5% to 4%.\n\nDeregulation created a very business-friendly regulatory framework. A survey 2008 study ranked it 99.9% in \"Business freedom\", and 80% overall in \"Economic freedom\", noting amongst other things that it only takes 12 days to establish a business in New Zealand on average, compared with a worldwide average of 43 days. Other indicators measured were property rights, labour market conditions, government controls and corruption, the last being considered \"next to non-existent\" in the [[Heritage Foundation]] and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' study.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=34&objectid=10487077\n|title=Survey ranks NZ in top six for economic freedom |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date= 16 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn its ''Doing Business 2008'' survey, the World Bank (which in that year rated New Zealand as the second-most business-friendly country worldwide), gave New Zealand rank 13 out of 178 in the business-friendliness of its hiring laws.<ref>[http://www.doingbusiness.org/economyrankings/ Economy Rankings] (from the 'Doing Business' website of the [[World Bank]].

(Since the dollar is the international exchange currency, most international reserves are held as dollars, and the price of commodities such as oil are set in dollars, it is in general less risky to hold dollars than to hold other currencies, in the short term, at least.)

It faced war damage to its economy and the problems of mass migration due to the expulsion of ethnic Germans from areas east of the [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]].\n\nApril 1945 to July 1947 saw the Allied occupation of Germany implement [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directive 1067 ([[JCS 1067]]). The aim of this directive was to transfer Germany's economy from one centred on heavy industry to a pastoral one, in order to prevent Germany from having the capacity to wage war. Civilian industries which might have a military potential, which in the modern era of \"total war\" included virtually all, were to be severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany's \"approved peacetime needs\", which were defined to be set on the average European standard. In order to achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements. In May 1946, the first plan stated that German heavy industry was to be lowered to 50% of its 1938 levels by the destruction of 1,500 listed manufacturing plants. Restrictions on steel followed.\n\nIt soon became obvious that this policy was not sustainable. Germany could not grow enough food for itself and malnutrition was becoming increasingly common. The European post-war economic recovery did not materialise and it became increasingly obvious that the European economy had depended on German industry.<ref name=\"WikiMorgenthau\">See [[Morgenthau Plan]] for the variety of sources supporting this position when discussing the effect of the implementation of JCS 1067.</ref>\n\nIn July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on \"national security grounds\" the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.\" It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that \"[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"<ref name=\"TimePdP\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417-1,00.html Pas de Pagaille] Time Magazine, Jul. 28, 1947.</ref>\n\nBy 1948, Germany suffered from rampant hyperinflation. The currency of the time (the [[Reichsmark]]) had no public confidence, and thanks to that and price controls, [[black market]] trading boomed and bartering proliferated. Banks were over their heads in debt and surplus currency abounded.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\">[http://www.bundesbank.de/download/volkswirtschaft/mba/2002/200203_en_dmark.pdf Bundesbank.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718213908/http://www.bundesbank.de/download/volkswirtschaft/mba/2002/200203_en_dmark.pdf |date=2011-07-18 }}, accessed June 13, 2010</ref>\n\nHowever, thanks to the introduction of JCS 1779 and the first Allied attempts to set up German governance, something could be done about this. [[Ludwig Erhard]], an economist, who had spent much time working on the problem of post war recovery, had worked his way up the administration created by the occupying American forces until he became the Director of Economics in the [[Bizone|Bizonal]] Economic Council in the joint British and American occupied zones (which would later, with the addition of the French occupied territory become the basis for West Germany). He was placed in charge of currency reform and became a central figure in events that were to follow.\n\n====Economic reforms====\n\nIn spring of 1948, the Allies decided to reform the currency. In preparation for this, a new central bank system was established in West Germany with independent Land Central Banks and the Bank deutscher Lander with headquarters in Frankfurt am Main.\n\nCurrency reform took effect on June 20, 1948, through the introduction of the [[Deutsche Mark]] to replace the [[Reichsmark]] and by transferring to the Bank deutscher Lander the sole right to print money. Each person received a per capita allowance of 60 DM, payable in two instalments (40 DM and 20 DM) and business quota of 60 DM per employee.\n\nUnder the [[Deutsche Mark#Currency reform of June 1948|German Currency Conversion Law]] on 27 June, private non-bank credit balances were converted at a rate of 10 RM to 1 DM, with half remaining in a frozen bank account. Although the money stock was very small in terms of national product, the adjustment in the price structure immediately led to sharp price increases, fuelled by the high velocity of money through the system. As a result, on the 4th of October, the military governments wiped out 70% of the remaining frozen balances, resulting in an effective exchange of 10:0.65. Holders of financial assets (including many small-time savers) were dispossessed and the banks' debt in Reichsmarks was eliminated, transferred instead into claims on the Lander and later the Federal Government. Wages, rents, pensions and other recurring liabilities were transferred at 1:1.\n\nOn the day of the currency reform, [[Ludwig Erhard]] announced, despite the reservations of the Allies, that rationing would be considerably relaxed and price controls abolished.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\n====Results====\n\nIn the short term, the currency reforms and abolition of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and was accepted by the public as a medium of payment. The currency reforms had ensured that money was once more scarce, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in the adoption of the new currency.<ref name=\"Bundesbank\" />\n\nIn the long term, these reforms helped set the stage for the [[Wirtschaftswunder]] (German for economic miracle) in the 1950s.\n\n==Post-1970s economic liberalism==\n\nNeoliberalism ultimately developed through two major phases. The first phase carried out through the help of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], and the second phase through [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Tony Blair]].<ref name=\"Steger 2010 21\u201350\"/>\n\nChronic economic crisis throughout the 1980s and the collapse of the [[Communist bloc]] at the end of the 1980s, helped foster political opposition to state interventionism in favor of unregulated market reform policies.

Starting off with most of the democratic world, governments focused primarily on the primacy of economic individual rights, the rule of law and the role of governments in moderating relative unregulated trade. It was almost considered national self-determination at the time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe status of organized labour shifted when the governments of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher took strong stances to break down trade barriers entirely to reduce government power; thus allowing the market to be more important.

A series of reforms were enacted to empower capital in the labour market<ref>Saunders P ''[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2006/6.pdf Unleashing (Labour) Market Forces: the Social Policy Implications of Industrial Relations]'' University of New South Wales Law Journal, Vol 29(1) 2006</ref> but these reforms were largely through additional legislative restrictions on labour and not through labour market deregulation.\n\n===Canada===\nIn [[Canada]], the issues identified with neoliberalism (reducing taxes and welfare spending, minimizing of government and reform of public healthcare and education, among others) are often associated with [[Brian Mulroney]], [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]], [[Paul Martin]], [[Mike Harris]], [[Ralph Klein]], [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] and [[Stephen Harper]].<ref>[http://politics.lilithezine.com/The-Neo-Liberal-Dogma-and-Canada.html The Neo-Liberal Dogma & Canada], The Politics eZine - Canada</ref>\n\n[[Ralph Klein]], who supports and has supported extraction of [[Alberta]]'s vast oil and natural gas reserves, is credited by the [[Pembina Institute]] as generating a relatively small amount of provincial revenue compared to the increase in [[oil sand]] production.

Mexico joined GATT, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1986 and has been a part of the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since 1990. Another trading partnership Mexico entered into was the Uruguay Round (UR).\n\nThe reforms brought about by NAFTA resulted in a huge opening of the Mexican economy and \u201c increased the political and economic costs of trade policy reversals and restrained trade policy with other countries to compatibility with (if not subservience to) NAFTA,\u201d (Mena, 48). Tariffs were reduced across most sectors of the economy. They also opened the door for factories along the border of the US and Mexico. Maquiladoras account for most of the Mexican export market. A reform of the 1973 Foreign Investment Law, \u201cForeign Investment is not allowed in oil production or refining.\u201d (Mena, p.&nbsp;49).\n\nMexico benefited greatly from its relationship with the UR and the WTO. There were low tariffs on Mexican goods and Mexico was not bound to alter its tariffs for UR members. \u201cMexico\u2019s preferences on non-agricultural subsidies were largely borne out in the URAs,\u201d (Ortiz Mena, 60). Mexico continues to have restrictions on foreign ownership and has been criticized for not signing the [[Agreement on Government Procurement]]. NGOs are also critical of the reforms that had been made.\n\nAfter joining NAFTA, Mexico entered into over thirty Free Trade Agreements (FTA). Mexico also signed FTAs with the European Union (EU), European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA) and Japan. As a result of these agreements, exports increased, manufactured goods became more important and Mexico became the US\u2019s second largest trading partner.\n\nThe Mexican government feels that the benefits of liberalism have been slowed due to a lack of implementations of URA policies by developed countries. The government fears that environmental and labor issues might affect the trade agenda. They are looking to the developed nations to help with a clean transition to the post-Doha work program. There are eleven areas that Mexico will focus on in the future: agriculture, export subsidies, TRIM, Service, IPR, dispute settlements, FDI, competition policy, government procurement, industrial goods, and labor and environment. Also, Mexico seeks to improve access for its important exports by complying fully with URAs.<ref>Ortiz Mena, Antonio. 2004. \u201cA Regional Player in Multilateral Trade Negotiations.\u201d In Trade Policy Reforms in Latin America. pp. 47\u201371</ref>\n\n===New Zealand===\nThe term [[Rogernomics]] was created by analogy with [[Reaganomics]] to describe the [[economic reform|economic policies]] followed by New Zealand [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Roger Douglas]] from his appointment in 1984.\n\nThe policies included cutting agricultural subsidies and trade barriers, [[privatisation|privatising]] public assets and the control of [[inflation]] through measures rooted in [[monetarism]], and were regarded by many as a betrayal of traditional Labour ideals. The Labour Party subsequently retreated from pure Rogernomics, which became a core doctrine of the more right-wing [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party. Roger Douglas planned to create a 15% flat tax in New Zealand, and to privatise schools, roads and hospitals, which was moderated by the Labour cabinet at the time,<ref>Lange, David. ''My Life.''(2005) Viking. Auckland.</ref> although the resultant reforms were still generally considered radical in a global context. After Douglas left the Labour party, he went on to co-found ACT in 1993, which regards itself as the new liberal party of New Zealand.\n\nSince 1984, government subsidies including those for agriculture have been eliminated; import regulations have been reduced; exchange rates have been floated; controls on [[interest rates]], wages, and prices have been removed; and marginal rates of taxation reduced. Tight monetary policy and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987. The Deregulation of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s reduced government's role in the economy and permitted the retirement of some [[public debt]], but simultaneously massively increased the necessity for greater [[welfare state|welfare spending]] and has led to considerably higher rates of [[unemployment]] than were standard in New Zealand in earlier decades. However, unemployment in New Zealand lowered again by 2006\u20132007, hovering around 3.5% to 4%.\n\nDeregulation created a very business-friendly regulatory framework. A survey 2008 study ranked it 99.9% in \"Business freedom\", and 80% overall in \"Economic freedom\", noting amongst other things that it only takes 12 days to establish a business in New Zealand on average, compared with a worldwide average of 43 days. Other indicators measured were property rights, labour market conditions, government controls and corruption, the last being considered \"next to non-existent\" in the [[Heritage Foundation]] and ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' study.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/category/story.cfm?c_id=34&objectid=10487077\n|title=Survey ranks NZ in top six for economic freedom |newspaper=The New Zealand Herald |date= 16 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn its ''Doing Business 2008'' survey, the World Bank (which in that year rated New Zealand as the second-most business-friendly country worldwide), gave New Zealand rank 13 out of 178 in the business-friendliness of its hiring laws.<ref>[http://www.doingbusiness.org/economyrankings/ Economy Rankings] (from the 'Doing Business' website of the [[World Bank]].

Started in different times in the history of the country, the programme was intended and had mainstream goal to promote [[GDP growth]] for the [[Economy of Pakistan|national economy]] and economical and social values in the country.\n\nThis programme was first conceived in early 1980s and thoroughly studied by the [[Ministry of Finance (Pakistan)|ministry of finance]] led by [[Finance Minister of Pakistan|finance ministers]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] and [[Mahbub ul Haq|Mahbub-ul-Haq]] and was implemented first by [[Pakistan Muslim League (N)|Pakistan Muslim League]] and the [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]], as part of the [[Privatization in Pakistan|privatisation programme]] in 1990. The programme of economic liberalisation, as one of the counter-policy measure programme, came in a direct response to [[Nationalization in Pakistan|nationalization programme]] of [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) in the 1970s. After the [[1993 Pakistani general elections|1993 general elections]], the programme was halted and reversed by Prime minister [[Benazir Bhutto]] and the Peoples Party after the [[Pressler amendment]] went into complete effect and force, that led the economic and financial crises in Pakistan. A much powerful socialist capitalism version was adopted in order to secure the revenue and financial capital of existing state-owned enterprises, with enforcement of nationalisation and privatisation at once. Second attempt was again attempted by the Pakistan Muslim League and Prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] after securing [[exclusive mandate]] during the [[1997 Pakistani general elections|1997 general elections]], however abruptly terminated the programme after [[nuclear testing|weapon-test performances]] in [[Chagai Hills|Chagai weapons-testing laboratories]] in 1998 (See [[Chagai-I]] and [[Chagai-II]]) and the [[Kargil war|Karilg debacle]] in 1999.\n\nOnce again, the comprehensive and much more effective studies were conducted by then-Finance minister and Prime minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] in 2000 after assuming the charge of national economy as an aftermath of [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The fruits of liberalisation reached their peak in 2003\u201304 when Pakistan recorded its highest national GDP growth to 8.96%~9.9%. In 2008\u201310, Pakistan is ranked 47th largest in the world in nominal terms and 27th largest in the world in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).<ref name=\"East Asia Forum\">{{cite web

Second attempt was again attempted by the Pakistan Muslim League and Prime minister [[Nawaz Sharif]] after securing [[exclusive mandate]] during the [[1997 Pakistani general elections|1997 general elections]], however abruptly terminated the programme after [[nuclear testing|weapon-test performances]] in [[Chagai Hills|Chagai weapons-testing laboratories]] in 1998 (See [[Chagai-I]] and [[Chagai-II]]) and the [[Kargil war|Karilg debacle]] in 1999.\n\nOnce again, the comprehensive and much more effective studies were conducted by then-Finance minister and Prime minister [[Shaukat Aziz]] in 2000 after assuming the charge of national economy as an aftermath of [[1999 Pakistani coup d'\u00e9tat|1999 coup d'\u00e9tat]].

One of her relatives had a dispute with local government about a water pipeline and approached Sherry for help since Mr. Jiao Yong at [[China\u2019s Ministry of Water Resources]] is Sherry's former classmate in Hydrology. Sherry met with Mr. Jiao for 15 minutes and told him about her relative\u2019s complaint. Towards the end of the meeting, Mr. Jiao said his office was trying to fund the repairs of China\u2019s aging reservoir system and was curious how this may work in the U.S. As a favor to a former classmate and also for a fellow professional in the same field, Sherry agreed to help.\n\nOnce returned to USA, Sherry sent Mr. Jiao some public websites and also asked around at work to see if any of her co-workers could help. Her boss introduced her to talk to a colleague at Water Management Division of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|US Army Corps of Engineers]] (ACE). The colleague said Mr. Jiao could talk to her directly. Sherry then emailed Mr. Jiao to contact the colleague, without following up further herself. Later, the colleague reported Sherry to the government security agency, suggesting that Sherry may be a Chinese spy and may be stealing government information. Since then, Sherry had unwittingly become a Chinese spy suspect by the US government.\n\nIn June 2013, Sherry was interviewed in her office by two security agents from the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]]. It was a 7-hour marathon interrogation with no food, water, or break. The agents told Chen that she could not tell this interview to anyone, and that she didn't need a lawyer. Chen tried to cooperate and told the agents everything she knew. The agents failed to find any \u201cspying\u201d evidence. But they still claimed that Sherry was \u201clying\u201d to federal investigators because she couldn't quite recall some of the dates or events.\n\nOn October 20, 2014, six FBI agents took her away in handcuffs in front of her colleagues. The [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] (DOJ) issued an indictment with a punishment of up to 25 years in jail and $1M in fines.<ref name=\":0\" /> The original charges included accusing Sherry of stealing data, intentionally exceeded authorized access to a database and two false statements, meaning that she lied to investigators.\n\nSherry's lawyer, [[Peter Zeidenberg|Peter R. Zeidenberg]], a partner at [[Arent Fox]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], defended her case. He found fatal flaws in the case and filed three motions pointing out these flaws and request DOJ to have the case dismissed. The prosecutor went back to grand jury to fix the problems and came back with eight charges and added another prosecutor on his team. After extensive interviews of witness including almost all of Chen's coworkers, search of the history of Chen's bank account statements over twenty years since she came to the US, personal and official email accounts, computer activities, the government decided to drop all the charges against Chen in March 2015 without explanation<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/crime--law/federal-hacking-case-against-noaa-hydrologist-dismissed/wnKgX1PvofsRmzF9b07otL/|title=Federal Case Against Sherry Chen Dismissed}}</ref>.\n\n== Firing and MSPB Verdict ==\nDespite the dropping of all charges, the NWS fired her in March 2016 <ref name=\"Fuchs\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/judge-orders-reinstatement-federal-scientist-fired-after-dropped-spying-charges-n871191|title=Judge orders reinstatement of federal scientist fired after dropped spying charges|author=Fuchs, Chris|date=2018-05-04|publisher=[[NBC News]]|accessdate=2018-12-28}}</ref> citing many of the same reasons that she was originally prosecuted for<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/technology/chinese-american-cleared-of-spying-charges-now-faces-firing.html|title=Chinese-American Cleared of Spying Charges Now Faces Firing|last=Perlroth|first=Nicole|date=2015-09-15|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-03-17|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal. In 2017, a green jacket that was found at a thrift store in 1994 was sold at auction for $139,000.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/golf/2017/04/10/masters-style-green-jacket-bought-for-5-at-toronto-thrift-store-sells-for-139k.html |title=Masters-style green jacket bought for $5 at Toronto thrift store sells for $139K |newspaper=Toronto Star |agency=Associated Press |date=April 10, 2017 |access-date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Trophies====\nWinners also have their names engraved on the actual silver Masters trophy.

In 1954, they began presenting an amateur silver medal to the low amateur runner-up.<ref name=\"Hist\"/>\n\nThe original trophy weighs over 130 pounds, and sits on a four-foot wide base. It resides permanently at Augusta National and depicts the clubhouse of the classic course. The replica, which is significantly smaller, stands just 6.5 inches tall and weighs 20 pounds. The champion and the runner-up both have their names engraved on the permanent trophy, solidifying themselves in golf history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thegolfnewsnet.com/golfnewsnetteam/2016/09/19/masters-trophy-facts-size-weight-history-97937 |title=The Masters Trophy facts: Size, weight, history and more |date=September 19, 2016 |website=GolfNewsNet.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Double Eagle trophy was introduced in 1967 when [[Bruce Devlin]] holed out for double eagle on number 8.

The event was established as part of an effort to help promote the sport of golf among youth; the winners of local qualifiers in different age groups advance to the national finals, which have been held at Augusta National on the Sunday immediately preceding the Masters. The driving and chipping portions of the event are held on the course's practice range, but the putting portion has been played on the course's 18th hole.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.golfdigest.com/story/inaugural-drive-chip-and-putt |title=Inaugural Drive, Chip and Putt Championship has juniors living Augusta National dreams |last=Hennessey |first=Stephen |magazine=Golf Digest |date=April 4, 2014 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/golf/2013/04/08/masters-augusta-national-drive-chip-and-putt-contest/2064565/ |title=Masters unveils drive, chip and putt contest |newspaper=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=April 8, 2013 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22996264/drive-chip-putt-winners-crowned-augusta-national-ahead-masters |title=Drive, Chip & Putt winners crowned at Augusta |work=ESPN |first=Bob |last=Harig |date=Apr 1, 2018 |access-date=2018-04-08 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nOn April 4, 2018, prior to the 2018 tournament, new Augusta National chairman [[Fred Ridley]] announced that the club would host the [[Augusta National Women's Amateur]] beginning in 2019. The first two rounds will be held at the Champion's Retreat club in [[Evans, Georgia]], with the final two rounds hosted by Augusta National (the final round will take place on the Saturday directly preceding the tournament). Ridley stated that holding such an event at Augusta National would have the \"greatest impact\" on women's golf. Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

Argentine champion [[Roberto De Vicenzo]] signed his scorecard (attested by playing partner [[Tommy Aaron]]) incorrectly recording him as making a par 4 instead of a birdie 3 on the 17th hole of the final round.

The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the first year after their first victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they visit. The tradition began in 1949, when Sam Snead won his first of three Masters titles.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from Augusta National by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club.

In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

She was educated in Europe and traveled extensively. She lived in [[Florida]], [[New York City]], Japan, China, Tahiti and [[Tunisia]], among other places.\n\n==Career==\nTietjens was a [[World War I]] correspondent for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in France, 1917-1918. Her poems had already begun to be published in ''Poetry: A Magazine of Verse'', the noted poetry magazine, around 1913. She later became publisher [[Harriet Monroe]]\u2019s associate editor there for more than twenty-five years.\nTietjens' was considered a more patient and generous editor, whose style contrasted sharply with that of Monroe, who was not known to treat would-be contributors with \"kid gloves\".\n\nOne collection of stories, \"Burton Holmes Travel Stories: Japan, Korea and Formosa\" (1924) contains lively descriptions of East Asian countries. By contemporary standards, the stories seem provincial and quaintly Eurocentric. The stories contain descriptions of nationalities and ethnicities that can be understood to be racist. Here's an excerpt:\n\n\"...For a great many years this island of Formosa was a terror that haunted all the Western sailors who sailed in those seas. The sea around it is the birthplace of terrible tropical typhoons, which spring up suddenly and sweep helpless ships onto the sharp cliffs, where they are dashed to pieces.

She was educated in Europe and travelled heavily. She lived in [[Florida]], [[New York City]], Japan, China, Tahiti and [[Tunisia]], among other places.\n\n==Career==\nTietjens was a [[World War I]] correspondent for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'' in France, 1917-1918. Her poems had already begun to be published in ''Poetry: A Magazine of Verse'', the noted poetry magazine, around 1913. She later became publisher [[Harriet Monroe]]\u2019s associate editor there for more than twenty-five years.\nTietjens' was considered a more patient and generous editor, whose style contrasted sharply with that of Monroe, who was not known to treat would-be contributors with \"kid gloves\".\n\nOne collection of stories, \"Burton Holmes Travel Stories: Japan, Korea and Formosa\" (1924) contains lively descriptions of East Asian countries. By contemporary standards, the stories seem provincial and quaintly Eurocentric. The stories contain descriptions of nationalities and ethnicities that can be understood to be racist. Here's an excerpt:\n\n\"...For a great many years this island of Formosa was a terror that haunted all the Western sailors who sailed in those seas. The sea around it is the birthplace of terrible tropical typhoons, which spring up suddenly and sweep helpless ships onto the sharp cliffs, where they are dashed to pieces. And, before Japan tamed her tiger, if a few poor half-drowned sailors managed to land, they were usually captured by the savages who lived there and killed by them. Their heads were preserved as trophies and their bodies eaten, for these savages were cannibals.\"\n\nTietjens was also a Contributing Editor for the [[Compton's Encyclopedia|Compton\u2019s Encyclopedia]]. \n<!--Eunice Tietjens Head also wrote a [[memoir]], entitled ''The World at My Shoulder'' (1938), in which she confessed her \"dark lust\" for the \"savage pagans of the Pacific.\"-->\n\n==Personal life==\nHer first husband was [[Paul Tietjens]], whom she married in Paris in 1904<ref name=Tacoma>[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn88085187/1904-05-24/ed-1/seq-1/ ART STUDENT WEDS COMPOSER], in ''[[the Tacoma Times]]'' (via [[Chronicling America]]); published May 24, 1904; retrieved July 19, 2016</ref> and by whom she had two daughters, Idea and Janet.
