A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.<ref>Jonathan A.C.

If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect,  any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.<ref>Jonathan A.C.

A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.<ref>Jonathan A.C.

If she did not desist from her behavior, he should cease sleeping with her in their bed. If she still continued in her nushuz, he should then strike her to teach her the error of her ways. Shaffii law only allowed the husband to use his hand or a wound-up handkerchief (mina malfuf), not a whip or stick. All schools of law prohibited striking the wife in the face or in any sensitive area likely to cause injury. All except some Maliki jurists held that the wife could claim compensation payment (diya) from the husband for any injury she sustained, and Hanbalis, the later Shaffii school as well as the Maliki school, allowed a judge to dissolve the marriage at no cost to the wife if harm had been done. In effect,  any physical harm was grounds for compensation and divorce since the Prophet had limited striking one's wife to 'a light blow that leaves no mark.' Causing any injury thus meant that a husband had exceeded his rights. All schools of law agreed that if the wife died due to a beating, her family could claim her wergild or possibly even have the husband executed.<ref>Jonathan A.C.

Most species are [[deciduous]]; semi[[evergreen]] willows with [[coriaceous]] leaves are rare, e.g. ''Salix micans'' and ''S. australior'' in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. All the [[bud]]s are lateral; no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed. The buds are covered by a single scale.

Usually they are serrate, rounded at base, acute or acuminate. The leaf [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] are short, the [[stipule]]s often very conspicuous, resembling tiny, round leaves, and sometimes remaining for half the summer.  On some species, however, they are small, inconspicuous, and caducous (soon falling). In color, the leaves show a great variety of greens, ranging from yellowish to bluish color. Willows are among the earliest woody plants to leaf out in spring and the last to drop their leaves in autumn. Leafout may occur as early as February depending on the climate and is stimulated by air temperature. If daytime highs reach 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C) for a few consecutive days, a willow will attempt to put out leaves and flowers. Leaf drop in autumn occurs when day length shortens to approximately ten hours and 25 minutes, which varies by latitude (as early as the first week of October for boreal species such as ''S. alaxensis'' and as late as the third week of December for willows growing in far southern areas).\n\n===Flowers===\n[[File:Young-catkin.jpg|thumb|Young male [[catkin]]]]\nWillows are [[dioecious]], with male and female [[flower]]s appearing as [[catkin]]s on separate plants; the catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves.\n\nThe [[staminate]] (male) flowers are without either [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] with [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]; they consist simply of stamens, varying in number from two to 10, accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin, or ament. This scale is square, entire, and very hairy. The anthers are rose-colored in the bud, but orange or purple after the flower opens; they are two-celled and the cells open latitudinally. The filaments are threadlike, usually pale brown, and often bald.\n\nThe [[pistillate]] (female) flowers are also without calyx or corolla, and consist of a single ovary accompanied by a small, flat nectar gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is likewise borne on the rachis of a catkin. The ovary is one-celled, the style two-lobed, and the ovules numerous.\n\n==Cultivation==\nAlmost all willows take root very readily from [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]] or where broken branches lie on the ground. The few exceptions include the goat willow (''[[Salix caprea]]'') and peachleaf willow (''[[Salix amygdaloides]]''). One famous example of such growth from cuttings involves the poet [[Alexander Pope]], who begged a twig from a parcel tied with twigs sent from Spain to [[Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk|Lady Suffolk]]. This twig was planted and thrived, and legend has it that all of England's weeping willows are descended from this first one.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leland|first=John|title=Aliens in the Backyard: Plant and Animal Imports Into America|url=https://archive.org/details/aliensinbackyard0000lela|url-access=registration|year=2005|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-582-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/aliensinbackyard0000lela/page/70 70]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Laird|first=Mark|title=The Flowering of the Landscape Garden: English Pleasure Grounds, 1720-1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCbC-QQx6iEC&pg=PA403|year=1999|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=978-0-8122-3457-2|page=403}}</ref>\n\nWillows are often planted on the borders of streams so their interlacing roots may protect the bank against the action of the water.

The active extract of the bark, called salicin, was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by [[Henri Leroux]], a French pharmacist, and [[Raffaele Piria]], an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the compound in its pure state.  In 1897, [[Felix Hoffmann]] created a synthetically altered version of salicin (in his case derived from the ''[[Spiraea]]'' plant), which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid. The new drug, formally [[acetylsalicylic acid]], was named [[Aspirin]] by Hoffmann's employer [[Bayer|Bayer AG]].

One of the forms of Welsh [[coracle]] boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into [[wicker]], which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow is less likely to split while being woven than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of [[box]]es, [[broom]]s, [[cricket bat]]s, [[cradleboard|cradle boards]], chairmans and other furniture, [[doll]]s, [[willow flute|flutes]], [[Flagpole (structure)|poles]], [[sweat lodge]]s, toys, turnery, tool handles, [[wood veneer|veneer]], [[wand]]s and [[whistle]]s. In addition, [[tannin]], [[fibre]], paper, [[rope]] and string can be produced from the wood.  Willow is also used in the manufacture of double basses for backs, sides and linings, and in making splines and blocks for bass repair.\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Salix cinerea flowers-2.jpg|thumb|Male catkin of ''[[Salix cinerea]]'' with bee]]\n[[File:Willow tree in spring, England.JPG|thumb|Willow tree in spring, England]]\n[[File:Willow species with Honeysuckle woodbine.JPG|thumb|Willow tree with [[Lonicera periclymenum|woodbine honeysuckle]]]]\n[[File:Sandworm by Marco Casagrande @ Wenduine, Belgium.jpg|thumb|Environmental art installation \"[[Sandworm (installation)|Sandworm]]\" in the Wenduine Dunes, Belgium, made entirely out of willow]]\n\n* Agriculture: Willows produce a modest amount of [[nectar]] from which [[Bee|bees]] can make [[honey]], and are especially valued as a source of early pollen for bees.

Most species are [[deciduous]]; semi[[evergreen]] willows with [[coriaceous]] leaves are rare, e.g. ''Salix micans'' and ''S. australior'' in the eastern [[Mediterranean]]. All the [[bud]]s are lateral; no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed. The buds are covered by a single scale. Usually, the bud scale is fused into a cap-like shape, but in some species it wraps around and the edges overlap.<ref>{{cite journal |jstor=25027618 |title=The Genus ''Salix'' (Salicaceae) in the Southeastern United States |author=George W.

Usually they are serrate, rounded at base, acute or acuminate. The leaf [[petiole (botany)|petioles]] are short, the [[stipule]]s often very conspicuous, resembling tiny, round leaves, and sometimes remaining for half the summer.  On some species, however, they are small, inconspicuous, and caducous (soon falling). In color, the leaves show a great variety of greens, ranging from yellowish to bluish color. Willows are among the earliest woody plants to leaf out in spring and the last to drop their leaves in autumn. Leafout may occur as early as February depending on the climate and is stimulated by air temperature. If daytime highs reach 55&nbsp;\u00b0F (10&nbsp;\u00b0C) for a few consecutive days, a willow will attempt to put out leaves and flowers. Leaf drop in autumn occurs when day length shortens to approximately ten hours and 25 minutes, which varies by latitude (as early as the first week of October for boreal species such as ''S. alaxensis'' and as late as the third week of December for willows growing in far southern areas).\n\n===Flowers===\n[[File:Young-catkin.jpg|thumb|Young male [[catkin]]]]\nWillows are [[dioecious]], with male and female [[flower]]s appearing as [[catkin]]s on separate plants; the catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves.\n\nThe [[staminate]] (male) flowers are without either [[Calyx (botany)|calyx]] with [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]; they consist simply of stamens, varying in number from two to 10, accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin, or ament. This scale is square, entire, and very hairy. The anthers are rose-colored in the bud, but orange or purple after the flower opens; they are two-celled and the cells open latitudinally. The filaments are threadlike, usually pale brown, and often bald.\n\nThe [[pistillate]] (female) flowers are also without calyx or corolla, and consist of a single ovary accompanied by a small, flat nectar gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is likewise borne on the rachis of a catkin. The ovary is one-celled, the style two-lobed, and the ovules numerous.\n\n==Cultivation==\nAlmost all willows take root very readily from [[cutting (plant)|cuttings]] or where broken branches lie on the ground. The few exceptions include the goat willow (''[[Salix caprea]]'') and peachleaf willow (''[[Salix amygdaloides]]'').

The active extract of the bark, called salicin, was isolated to its crystalline form in 1828 by [[Henri Leroux]], a French pharmacist, and [[Raffaele Piria]], an Italian chemist, who then succeeded in separating out the compound in its pure state.  In 1897, [[Felix Hoffmann]] created a synthetically altered version of salicin (in his case derived from the ''[[Spiraea]]'' plant), which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid. The new drug, formally [[acetylsalicylic acid]], was named [[Aspirin]] by Hoffmann's employer [[Bayer|Bayer AG]]. This gave rise to the hugely important class of drugs known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ([[NSAID]]s).\n\n===Manufacturing===\nSome of humans' earliest manufactured items may have been made from willow.

One of the forms of Welsh [[coracle]] boat traditionally uses willow in the framework. Thin or split willow rods can be woven into [[wicker]], which also has a long history. The relatively pliable willow is less likely to split while being woven than many other woods, and can be bent around sharp corners in basketry. Willow wood is also used in the manufacture of [[box]]es, [[broom]]s, [[cricket bat]]s, [[cradleboard|cradle boards]], chairmans and other furniture, [[doll]]s, [[willow flute|flutes]], [[Flagpole (structure)|poles]], [[sweat lodge]]s, toys, turnery, tool handles, [[wood veneer|veneer]], [[wand]]s and [[whistle]]s. In addition, [[tannin]], [[fibre]], paper, [[rope]] and string can be produced from the wood.
