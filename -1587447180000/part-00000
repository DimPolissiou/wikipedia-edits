(film)|the 1965 film]] and its [[Help!|soundtrack album]]. It was released as a single in July 1965, and was number one for three weeks in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nCredited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], \"Help!\" was written by [[John Lennon]] with some help from [[Paul McCartney]]. During an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1980, Lennon recounted: \"The whole Beatles thing was just beyond comprehension. I was subconsciously crying out for help\".\n\nIt was ranked at number 29 on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|''Rolling Stone'''s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-beatles-help-20110525|title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nThe documentary series ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' revealed that Lennon wrote the lyrics of the song to express his stress after the Beatles' quick rise to success. \"I was fat and depressed and I ''was'' crying out for 'Help{{'\"}}, Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=555}} Writer [[Ian MacDonald]] describes the song as the first crack in the protective shell Lennon had built around his emotions during the Beatles' rise to fame, and an important milestone in his songwriting style.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\">{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA224|year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8296-6|page=224}}</ref><!-- Yes I'm sure Ian MacD wrote this, but we need a citation, and his book listed below-->\n\nIn the 1970 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' \"Lennon Remembers\" interviews, Lennon said that the song was one of his favourites among the Beatles songs he wrote. In these interviews, Lennon said he felt that \"Help!\" and \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" were his most honest, genuine Beatles songs and not just songs \"written to order\". According to Lennon's cousin and boyhood friend Stanley Parkes, \"Help!\" was written after Lennon \"came in from the studio one night. 'God,' he said, 'they've changed the title of the film: it's going to be called 'Help!' now. So I've had to write a new song with the title called 'Help!'.\"{{sfn|Lennon.net|2004|p=5}}\n\nAccording to McCartney, he was called in \"to complete it\", providing the \"[[counter-melody|countermelody]]\" arrangement, on 4 April 1965 at Lennon's house in [[Weybridge]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2003|p=153}}{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=199}}{{sfn|Beatles Interview Database|1984|p=2}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded \"Help!\" in 12 takes on 13 April 1965 using [[multitrack recording|four-track]] equipment. The first nine takes concentrated on the instrumental backing. The descending lead guitar riff that precedes each verse proved to be difficult, so by take 4 it was decided to postpone it for an overdub. To guide the later overdub by [[George Harrison]], Lennon thumped the beat on his [[acoustic guitar]] body, which can be heard in the final [[stereo]] mix. Lead and backing vocals were recorded twice onto take 9, along with a [[tambourine]]. A reduction mix was applied to the two vocal tracks, taking three attempts (takes 10 to 12), freeing up a track for the lead guitar overdub.{{sfn|Winn|2008|pp=314-316}} This was the group's first use of two 4-track machines for [[Ping-pong recording|\"bouncing\"]].<ref>Help! stereo remaster 2009 inlay card, \"Recording notes\".</ref>\n\nThe vocals were re-recorded for the film during a session on 24 May 1965 at CTS Studios, a facility specializing in [[post-synchronisation]].{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=320}} In addition to attempting a better vocal performance, the session might have been done to eliminate the tambourine (which had been on the same track as the vocals) since no tambourine appeared in the film sequence.{{sfn|Ryan|Kehew|2006|p=392}} With the new vocals, a mono mix was created at CTS Studios which was used for the film soundtrack. Mixes for record releases were prepared on 18 June. For the mono version, Martin decided to use a mix of the opening chorus of take 12 edited to the remainder of the CTS film mix.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=320}} Because all instruments were combined on a single track for the CTS session, it could not be used for a stereo mix, so the stereo mix was made from take 12.{{sfn|Ryan|Kehew|2006|p=392}}\n\nThis film version of the song was only heard on the original VHS releases of the movie, later replaced by the stereo mixes. A true release was never issued. New mixes were created for releases of the ''[[Help!]]'' CD (1987), the ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'' album (2006), and the ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' DVD (2007).{{sfn|Winn|2008|pp=314-316}}\n\n==Releases==\n[[File:Beatles press conference 1965.jpg|thumb|right|The Beatles at a press conference in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] in August 1965, shortly after the song's release]]\n\"Help!\" went to number 1 on both the UK and US singles charts in late summer 1965. It was the fourth of six number 1 singles in a row on the American charts: \"[[I Feel Fine]]\", \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\", \"[[Ticket to Ride]]\", \"Help!\", \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" and \"[[We Can Work It Out]]\".{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|pp=38\u201345}} At the following year's [[Ivor Novello Awards]], \"Help!\" was named as the second best-selling single of 1965, behind \"We Can Work It Out\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=236}}<ref>{{cite magazine|author=KRLA Beat staff|title=Lennon and McCartney Win Three Composer's Awards|magazine=[[KRLA Beat]]|date=13 August 1966|p=3}}</ref> \"Help!\" was nominated in four categories at the [[1966 Grammy Awards]] but failed to win in any of them.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=226}} \n\nThe song appears on the ''[[Help!]]'' LP, the US ''Help!'' soundtrack, ''[[1962\u20131966]]'', the ''[[Imagine: John Lennon (soundtrack)|Imagine: John Lennon]]'' soundtrack, ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'', ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'', and ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 2]]''. The mono version (with different vocals and no tambourine) was included on the Beatles' ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'' LP and in ''[[The Beatles in Mono]]'' collection. The American soundtrack album included a James Bond-type introduction to the song, followed by a [[caesura]] just before the opening lyric.  No such introduction appeared on the British soundtrack album, nor was it included in the released single in either country.\n\nAlthough Lennon was proud of \"Help!\" and the honesty it conveyed, he expressed regret that the Beatles had recorded it at such a fast [[tempo]] in the interests of giving the track more commercial appeal.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\" /> Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] refuted this idea, saying: \"'Help!' isn't a compromise; it's bursting with vitality \u2026 [Lennon] sounds triumphant, because he's found a group of kindred spirits who are offering the very spiritual assistance and emotional support for which he's begging. Paul's echoing harmonies, Ringo's jaunty drums, the boom of George's guitar speak to the heart of Lennon's passion, and though they cannot cure the wound, at least they add a note of reassurance that he's not alone with his pain.\"<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\" />\n\n==Promotional films==\nThe Beatles filmed the title performance for the movie ''Help!'' on 22 April 1965. The same footage (without the darts and credits seen in the film sequence) was used as a clip to promote the release of the single. It was shown starting in July 1965 on programmes such as ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2000|p=190}} They made another promotional clip of \"Help!\" on 23 November 1965 for inclusion in the year-end recap special of ''Top of the Pops''.

(film)|the 1965 film]] and its [[Help!|soundtrack album]]. It was released as a single in July 1965, and was number one for three weeks in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nCredited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], \"Help!\" was written by [[John Lennon]] with some help from [[Paul McCartney]]. During an interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' in 1980, Lennon recounted: \"The whole Beatles thing was just beyond comprehension. I was subconsciously crying out for help\".\n\nIt was ranked at number 29 on [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|''Rolling Stone'''s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-beatles-help-20110525|title=500 Greatest Songs of All Time|website=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\nThe documentary series ''[[The Beatles Anthology]]'' revealed that Lennon wrote the lyrics of the song to express his stress after the Beatles' quick rise to success. \"I was fat and depressed and I ''was'' crying out for 'Help{{'\"}}, Lennon told ''[[Playboy]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=555}} Writer [[Ian MacDonald]] describes the song as the first crack in the protective shell Lennon had built around his emotions during the Beatles' rise to fame, and an important milestone in his songwriting style.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\">{{cite book|last=Sullivan|first=Steve|title=Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA224|year=2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-8296-6|page=224}}</ref><!-- Yes I'm sure Ian MacD wrote this, but we need a citation, and his book listed below-->\n\nIn the 1970 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' \"Lennon Remembers\" interviews, Lennon said that the song was one of his favourites among the Beatles songs he wrote. In these interviews, Lennon said he felt that \"Help!\" and \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]\" were his most honest, genuine Beatles songs and not just songs \"written to order\". According to Lennon's cousin and boyhood friend Stanley Parkes, \"Help!\" was written after Lennon \"came in from the studio one night. 'God,' he said, 'they've changed the title of the film: it's going to be called 'Help!' now. So I've had to write a new song with the title called 'Help!'.\"{{sfn|Lennon.net|2004|p=5}}\n\nAccording to McCartney, he was called in \"to complete it\", providing the \"[[counter-melody|countermelody]]\" arrangement, on 4 April 1965 at Lennon's house in [[Weybridge]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2003|p=153}}{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=199}}{{sfn|Beatles Interview Database|1984|p=2}}\n\n==Recording==\nThe Beatles recorded \"Help!\" in 12 takes on 13 April 1965 using [[multitrack recording|four-track]] equipment. The first nine takes concentrated on the instrumental backing. The descending lead guitar riff that precedes each verse proved to be difficult, so by take 4 it was decided to postpone it for an overdub. To guide the later overdub by [[George Harrison]], Lennon thumped the beat on his [[acoustic guitar]] body, which can be heard in the final [[stereo]] mix. Lead and backing vocals were recorded twice onto take 9, along with a [[tambourine]]. A reduction mix was applied to the two vocal tracks, taking three attempts (takes 10 to 12), freeing up a track for the lead guitar overdub.{{sfn|Winn|2008|pp=314-316}} This was the group's first use of two 4-track machines for [[Ping-pong recording|\"bouncing\"]].<ref>Help! stereo remaster 2009 inlay card, \"Recording notes\".</ref>\n\nThe vocals were re-recorded for the film during a session on 24 May 1965 at CTS Studios, a facility specializing in [[post-synchronisation]].{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=320}} In addition to attempting a better vocal performance, the session might have been done to eliminate the tambourine (which had been on the same track as the vocals) since no tambourine appeared in the film sequence.{{sfn|Ryan|Kehew|2006|p=392}} With the new vocals, a mono mix was created at CTS Studios which was used for the film soundtrack. Mixes for record releases were prepared on 18 June. For the mono version, Martin decided to use a mix of the opening chorus of take 12 edited to the remainder of the CTS film mix.{{sfn|Winn|2008|p=320}} Because all instruments were combined on a single track for the CTS session, it could not be used for a stereo mix, so the stereo mix was made from take 12.{{sfn|Ryan|Kehew|2006|p=392}}\n\nThis film version of the song was only heard on the original VHS releases of the movie, later replaced by the stereo mixes. A true release was never issued. New mixes were created for releases of the ''[[Help!]]'' CD (1987), the ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'' album (2006), and the ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' DVD (2007).{{sfn|Winn|2008|pp=314-316}}\n\n==Releases==\n[[File:Beatles press conference 1965.jpg|thumb|right|The Beatles at a press conference in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] in August 1965, shortly after the song's release]]\n\"Help!\" went to number 1 on both the UK and US singles charts in late summer 1965. It was the fourth of six number 1 singles in a row on the American charts: \"[[I Feel Fine]]\", \"[[Eight Days a Week]]\", \"[[Ticket to Ride]]\", \"Help!\", \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]\" and \"[[We Can Work It Out]]\".{{sfn|Wallgren|1982|pp=38\u201345}} At the following year's [[Ivor Novello Awards]], \"Help!\" was named as the second best-selling single of 1965, behind \"We Can Work It Out\".{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=236}}<ref>{{cite magazine|author=KRLA Beat staff|title=Lennon and McCartney Win Three Composer's Awards|magazine=[[KRLA Beat]]|date=13 August 1966|p=3}}</ref> \"Help!\" was nominated in four categories at the [[1966 Grammy Awards]] but failed to win in any of them.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=226}} \n\nThe song appears on the ''[[Help!]]'' LP, the US ''Help!'' soundtrack, ''[[1962\u20131966]]'', the ''[[Imagine: John Lennon (soundtrack)|Imagine: John Lennon]]'' soundtrack, ''[[1 (The Beatles album)|1]]'', ''[[Love (The Beatles album)|Love]]'', and ''[[The Capitol Albums, Volume 2]]''. The mono version (with different vocals and no tambourine) was included on the Beatles' ''[[Rarities (1980 The Beatles album)|Rarities]]'' LP and in ''[[The Beatles in Mono]]'' collection. The American soundtrack album included a James Bond-type introduction to the song, followed by a [[caesura]] just before the opening lyric.  No such introduction appeared on the British soundtrack album, nor was it included in the released single in either country.\n\nAlthough Lennon was proud of \"Help!\" and the honesty it conveyed, he expressed regret that the Beatles had recorded it at such a fast [[tempo]] in the interests of giving the track more commercial appeal.<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\" /> Music critic [[Dave Marsh]] refuted this idea, saying: \"'Help!' isn't a compromise; it's bursting with vitality \u2026 [Lennon] sounds triumphant, because he's found a group of kindred spirits who are offering the very spiritual assistance and emotional support for which he's begging. Paul's echoing harmonies, Ringo's jaunty drums, the boom of George's guitar speak to the heart of Lennon's passion, and though they cannot cure the wound, at least they add a note of reassurance that he's not alone with his pain.\"<ref name=\"Sullivan2013\" />\n\n==Promotional films==\nThe Beatles filmed the title performance for the movie ''Help!'' on 22 April 1965. The same footage (without the darts and credits seen in the film sequence) was used as a clip to promote the release of the single. It was shown starting in July 1965 on programmes such as ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and ''[[Thank Your Lucky Stars (TV series)|Thank Your Lucky Stars]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|2000|p=190}} They made another promotional clip of \"Help!\" on 23 November 1965 for inclusion in the year-end recap special of ''Top of the Pops''.

It was included on reissues of the band's ''[[Greatest Hits Collection (Bananarama album)|The Greatest Hits Collection]]'' compilation in 1989.\n*1997: [[dc Talk]] released a live album called ''[[Welcome to the Freak Show]]'' which featured a shorter version of this song as the opening track.\n*2001: The soundtrack to the film ''[[I Am Sam]]'', which consisted entirely of Beatles covers, includes [[Howie Day]] performing a version of \"Help!\" at a slower tempo than the original. This tempo change is unique in the soundtrack, which was otherwise produced to mimic the tempos from the Beatles originals that were used in production, but changed to covers at the last minute due to licensing issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/vedder-crowes-meet-the-beatles-74198/|title=Vedder, Crowes Meet the Beatles|last=Devenish|first=Colin|last2=Devenish|first2=Colin|date=2001-11-07|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref>\n*2003: [[Art Paul Schlosser]] recorded a parody of \"Help!\" (\"Smelt\"), which appears on his ''Words of Cheese and Other Parrot'' CD.\n*2009: [[Silverstein (band)|Silverstein]] covered \"Help!\" as a bonus track on their fourth album ''[[A Shipwreck in the Sand]]''.\n*2013: [[Krokus (band)]] covered the song on their album ''[[Dirty Dynamite]]''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Badman |first=Keith |title=The Beatles Diary, Volume 2: After the Break-Up | publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London  |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2UA5rymtaQC&pg=PA352#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=978-0-85712-001-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Compton |first=Todd |year=2017 | title = Who Wrote the Beatle Songs?
