According to the concept of [[vitalism]] (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\".<ref name=G%E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>  During the first half of the nineteenth century,  some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Michel Chevreul]] started a study of [[soap]]s made from various [[fat]]s and [[alkali]]s. He separated the acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap.  Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from organic sources), producing new compounds, without \"vital force\". In 1828 [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] produced the ''organic'' chemical [[urea]] (carbamide), a constituent of [[urine]], from ''inorganic'' starting materials (the salts [[potassium cyanate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]]), in what is now called the [[W\u00f6hler synthesis]].  Although W\u00f6hler himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|author2=Herbert S.

The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by [[Adolf von Baeyer]]. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from [[petrochemical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Steingruber, Elmar (2004) \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.\n\nThe multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. [[Total synthesis]] of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to [[glucose]] and [[terpineol]]. For example, [[cholesterol]]-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as [[lysergic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]].<ref>{{cite book |author1= Nicolaou, K.C. |author2= Sorensen, E.J. |title= Classics in Total Synthesis: Targets, Strategies, Methods |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] |year= 1996 | isbn= 978-3-527-29231-8 }}</ref>\n[[image:cobalamin.png|thumb|left|230px|The [[total synthesis]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> marked a major achievement in organic chemistry.]]\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] and the development of the [[petrochemical industry]] spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum compounds into ''types'' of compounds by various chemical processes led to [[organic reactions]] enabling a broad range of industrial and commercial products including, among (many) others: [[plastics]], [[synthetic rubber]], organic [[adhesives]], and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.\n\nThe majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and [[biochemistry]] is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the [[history of biochemistry]] might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term ''biochemistry'' was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as [[BIOSIS Previews]] and [[Biological Abstracts]], which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic [[database]].<ref>Allan, Barbara. Livesey, Brian (1994). ''How to Use Biological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts and Index Chemicus''. Gower. {{ISBN|978-0-566-07556-8}}</ref>\n\n== Characterization ==\nSince organic compounds often exist as [[mixture]]s, a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity, especially important being [[chromatography]] techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[gas chromatography]].  Traditional methods of separation include [[distillation]], [[crystallization]], and [[solvent extraction]].\n\nOrganic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests, called \"wet methods\", but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis.<ref>Shriner, R.L.; Hermann, C.K.F.; Morrill, T.C.; Curtin, D.Y. and Fuson, R.C. (1997) ''The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds''. John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-59748-1}}</ref>  Listed in approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is the most commonly used technique, often permitting the complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using [[correlation spectroscopy]].  The principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry \u2013 hydrogen and carbon \u2013 exist naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C.\n* [[Elemental analysis]]: A destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule.  See also mass spectrometry, below.\n* [[Mass spectrometry]] indicates the [[molecular weight]] of a compound and, from the [[mass spectrum analysis|fragmentation patterns]], its structure.  High-resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in place of elemental analysis.  In former times, mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the \"mass spec\" of virtually any organic compound.\n* [[Crystallography]] can be useful for determining [[molecular geometry]] when a single crystal of the material is available.  Highly efficient hardware and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal.\n\nTraditional spectroscopic methods such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[optical rotation]], and [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]] provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds. Traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification.\n\n== Properties ==\nThe physical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features.  Quantitative information includes a melting point, boiling point, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties include odor, consistency, solubility, and color.\n\n===Melting and boiling properties===\n\nOrganic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, tending instead to degrade.  In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds.  The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight.  Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime, that is they evaporate without melting.  A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is [[para-dichlorobenzene]], the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs.  Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, although some exceptions exist.\n\n===Solubility===\nNeutral organic compounds tend to be [[hydrophobic]]; that is, they are less [[soluble]] in water than in organic solvents.  Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low [[molecular weight]] [[alcohol]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[carboxylic acid]]s where [[hydrogen bonding]] occurs.  Otherwise organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic [[solvent]]s.  Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.\n\n===Solid state properties===\n\nVarious specialized properties of [[Molecular solid|molecular crystals]] and [[Polymer|organic polymers]] with [[conjugated system]]s are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as [[piezoelectricity]], electrical conductivity (see [[conductive polymer]]s and [[organic semiconductor]]s), and electro-optical (e.g. [[non-linear optics]]) properties.  For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of [[polymer science]] and [[materials science]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}\n[[Image:OrgNom.svg|thumb|center|760px| Various names and depictions for one organic compound.]]\n\nThe names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from [[IUPAC]].  Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a [[parent structure]] within the molecule of interest.  This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome.  Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules.  To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.  Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and mono functionalized derivatives thereof.\n\nNonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic chemists.  Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound. They are common for complex molecules, which include most natural products.  Thus, the informally named [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] is systematically named\n(6a''R'',9''R'')-''N'',''N''-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-''fg''] quinoline-9-carboxamide.\n\nWith the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines.  Two popular formats are [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]].\n\n===Structural drawings===\nOrganic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or [[structural formula]]s, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols.  The [[Bond-line formula|line-angle formula]] is simple and unambiguous.  In this system, the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] carbon.\n[[File: Structural drawings of butane 854px.jpg|alt=Structural representations of butane|center|854x854px|This diagram shows 5 distinct structural representations of the organic compound butane. The left-most structure is a bond-line drawing where the hydrogen atoms are removed. The 2nd structure has the hydrogens added depicted-the dark wedged bonds indicate the hydrogen atoms are coming toward the reader, the hashed bonds indicate the atoms are oriented away from the reader, and the solid (plain) ponds indicate the bonds are in the plane of the screen/paper. The middle structure shows the four carbon atoms. The 4th structure is a representation just showing the atoms and bonds without 3-dimensions. The right-most structure is a condensed structure representation  of butane.]]\n\n===History===\nBy 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard described the situation as \"chaos le plus complet\" as due to the lack of convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This led to the creation of the [[Geneva Rules|Geneva rules]] in 1892.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evieux|first=E. A.|date=1954-06-01|title=The Geneva Congress on Organic Nomenclature, 1892|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=31|issue=6|pages=326|doi=10.1021/ed031p326|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1954JChEd..31..326E}}</ref>\n\n==Classification of organic compounds==\n\n===Functional groups===\n{{Main|Functional group}}\n[[Image:Acetic acid atoms.svg|right|thumb|The family of [[carboxylic]] acids contains a carboxyl (-COOH) [[functional group]]. [[Acetic acid]], shown here, is an example.]]\nThe concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties.  A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have a decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified based on their functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]], usually form [[ester]]s, and usually can be converted to the corresponding [[halide]]s.  Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Aliphatic compounds===\n{{Main|Aliphatic compound}}\nThe aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of [[homologous series]] according to their state of [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturation]]:\n* alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any [[Double bond|double]] or [[triple bond]]s, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds\n* alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons that contain one or more double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.\n* alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more triple bonds.\nThe rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present.  Such compounds can be \"straight-chain\", branched-chain or cyclic.  The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the [[octane number]] or [[cetane number]] in petroleum chemistry.\n\nBoth saturated ([[alicyclic]]) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered [[cyclopropane]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. [[Cycloalkane]]s do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the [[cycloalkene]]s and the cycloalkynes do.\n\n===Aromatic compounds===\n[[Image: Benzene-resonance-structures.svg|right|thumb|[[Benzene]] is one of the best-known aromatic compounds as it is one of the simplest and most stable aromatics.]]\n[[Aromatic]] hydrocarbons contain [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds. This means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is [[benzene]], the structure of which was formulated by [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Kekul\u00e9]] who first proposed the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] or [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] principle for explaining its structure.  For \"conventional\" cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer.  Particular instability ([[antiaromaticity]]) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.\n\n===Heterocyclic compounds===\n{{Main|Heterocyclic compound}}\nThe characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a [[heterocycle]].  [[Pyridine]] and [[furan]] are examples of aromatic heterocycles while [[piperidine]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] are the corresponding [[alicyclic]] heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.\n\nHeterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as [[alkaloids]], vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA).\n\nRings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give [[polycyclic compound]]s. The [[purine]] nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles.  Rings can also fuse on a \"corner\" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another.  Such compounds are termed [[spiro compound|spiro]] and are important in several [[natural product]]s.\n\n=== Polymers ===\n{{Main|Polymer}}\n\n[[Image: Girl with styrofoam swimming board.jpg|right|thumb|This swimming board is made of [[polystyrene]], an example of a polymer.]]\nOne important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks, that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process is called [[polymerization]], while the chains, or networks, are called [[polymer]]s. The source compound is called a [[monomer]].\n\nTwo main groups of polymers exist [[synthetic polymers]] and [[biopolymer]]s. Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to as [[plastic|industrial polymers]].<ref>\"industrial polymers, chemistry of.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. 2006</ref> Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.\n\n===Biomolecules===\n[[Image:Maitotoxin 2D structure.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Maitotoxin]], a complex organic biological toxin.]]\n[[Biomolecule|Biomolecular chemistry]] is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by [[biochemists]]. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain [[biopolymer]]s, and these include [[peptides]], [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and the [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]]es in animals and [[cellulose]]s in plants. The other main classes are [[amino acid]]s (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), [[carbohydrate]]s (which includes the polysaccharides), the [[nucleic acid]]s (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the [[lipid]]s. Besides, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the [[Krebs cycle]], and produces [[isoprene]], the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important [[steroid]] structural ([[cholesterol]]) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form [[terpene]]s, [[terpenoid]]s, some [[alkaloid]]s, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer poly iso pyrenoids present in the [[latex]] of various species of plants, which is the basis for making [[rubber]].\n\n; Peptide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Peptide synthesis]]''\n; Oligonucleotide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Oligonucleotide synthesis]]''\n; Carbohydrate Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Carbohydrate synthesis]]''\n\n=== Small molecules ===\n[[File:CAFENE~1.svg|right|thumb|Molecular models of [[caffeine]].]]\nIn pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is [[small molecule]]s, also referred to as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active but is not a [[polymer]]. In practice, small molecules have a [[molar mass]] less than approximately 1000 g/mol.\n\n=== Fullerenes ===\n\n[[Fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of [[materials science]]. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces\u2014a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named [[buckminsterfullerene]] (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.\n\n=== Others ===\nOrganic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as [[organosulfur chemistry]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[organophosphorus chemistry]] and [[Organosilicon|organosilicon chemistry]].\n\n== Organic reactions ==\n[[Organic reaction]]s are [[chemical reaction]]s involving [[organic compound]]s. Many of these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the [[electron affinity]] of key atoms, [[bond strength]]s and [[steric hindrance]]. These factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived [[reactive intermediate]]s, which usually directly determine the path of the reaction.\n\nThe basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions. An example of a common reaction is a [[substitution reaction]] written as:\n\n:Nu<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  C-X  \u2192 C-Nu + X<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nwhere X is some [[functional group]] and Nu is a [[nucleophile]].\n\nThe number of possible organic reactions is infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence\u2014although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.\n\nThe stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using  [[arrow pushing]] techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products.\n\n== Organic synthesis ==\n{{see also|Chemical synthesis|Organic synthesis}}\n[[Image:Corey oseltamivir synthesis.png|thumb|right|261px|A synthesis designed by [[E.J. Corey]] for [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu). This synthesis has 11 distinct reactions.]]\n\nSynthetic organic chemistry is an [[applied science]] as it borders [[engineering]], the \"design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes\". Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem-solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a [[carbonyl]] compound can be used as a [[nucleophile]] by converting it into an [[enolate]], or as an [[electrophile]]; the combination of the two is called the [[aldol reaction]]. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called [[total synthesis]].\n\nStrategies to design a synthesis include [[retrosynthesis]], popularized by [[E.J. Corey]], which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis. A \"synthetic tree\" can be constructed because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of organic chemistry}}\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Organic chemistry|Important publications in organic chemistry]]\n* [[List of organic reactions]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WVD}}\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/ MIT.edu], OpenCourseWare: Organic Chemistry I\n* [http://www.haverford.edu/wintnerorganicchem HaverFord.edu], Organic Chemistry Lectures, Videos and Text\n* [https://www.organic-chemistry.org Organic-Chemistry.org], Organic Chemistry Portal \u2013 Recent Abstracts and (Name)Reactions\n* [http://www.orgsyn.org/ Orgsyn.org], Organic Chemistry synthesis journal\n* [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry Khanacademy.org], [[Khan Academy]] - Organic Chemistry\n{{Organic chemistry}}\n{{BranchesofChemistry}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organic Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Organic chemistry| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Organic compounds|Chemistry]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Subdiscipline of chemistry}}\n[[File:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|175px|[[Methane]], CH<sub>4</sub>; the line-angle structural formula shows four carbon-hydrogen single bonds (\u03c3, in black), and the typical [[three dimensional|3D]] shape of [[tetrahedral geometry|tetrahedral]] molecules, with ~109\u00b0 interior [[bond angle]]s (in dashed-green).]]\n\n'''Organic chemistry''' is a subdiscipline of [[chemistry]] that studies the structure, properties and reactions of [[organic compound]]s, which contain [[carbon]] in [[covalent bonding]].<ref name=\"J.

According to the concept of [[vitalism]] (vital force theory), organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\".<ref name=G%E>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>  During the first half of the nineteenth century,  some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported. Around 1816 [[Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul|Michel Chevreul]] started a study of [[soap]]s made from various [[fat]]s and [[alkali]]s. He separated the acids that, in combination with the alkali, produced the soap.  Since these were all individual compounds, he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats (which traditionally come from  organic sources), producing new compounds, without \"vital force\". In 1828 [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] produced the ''organic'' chemical [[urea]] (carbamide), a constituent of [[urine]], from ''inorganic'' starting materials (the salts [[potassium cyanate]] and [[ammonium sulfate]]), in what is now called the [[W\u00f6hler synthesis]].  Although W\u00f6hler  himself was cautious about claiming he had disproved vitalism, this was the first time a substance thought to be organic was synthesized in the laboratory without biological (organic) starting materials. The event is now generally accepted as indeed disproving the doctrine of vitalism.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900|author=Henry Marshall Leicester|author2=Herbert S.

The latter half of the 19th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds. The development of synthetic indigo is illustrative. The production of indigo from plant sources dropped from 19,000 tons in 1897 to 1,000 tons by 1914 thanks to the synthetic methods developed by [[Adolf von Baeyer]]. In 2002, 17,000 tons of synthetic indigo were produced from [[petrochemical]]s.<ref name=Ullmann>Steingruber, Elmar (2004) \"Indigo and Indigo Colorants\" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.a14_149.pub2}}</ref>\n\nIn the early part of the 20th century, polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules, and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin.\n\nThe multiple-step synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis. [[Total synthesis]] of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to [[glucose]] and [[terpineol]]. For example, [[cholesterol]]-related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives. Since the start of the 20th century, complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as [[lysergic acid]] and [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]].<ref>{{cite book |author1= Nicolaou, K.C. |author2= Sorensen, E.J. |title= Classics in Total Synthesis: Targets, Strategies, Methods |publisher= [[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]] |year= 1996 | isbn= 978-3-527-29231-8 }}</ref>\n[[image:cobalamin.png|thumb|left|230px|The [[total synthesis]] of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> marked a major achievement in organic chemistry.]]\n\nThe discovery of [[petroleum]] and the development of the [[petrochemical industry]] spurred the development of organic chemistry. Converting individual petroleum compounds into ''types'' of compounds by various chemical processes led to [[organic reactions]] enabling a broad range of  industrial and commercial products including, among (many) others: [[plastics]], [[synthetic rubber]], organic [[adhesives]], and various property-modifying petroleum additives and catalysts.\n\nThe majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in fact carbon compounds, so the association between organic chemistry and [[biochemistry]] is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry. Although the [[history of biochemistry]] might be taken to span some four centuries, fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late 19th century and the actual term ''biochemistry'' was coined around the start of 20th century. Research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century, without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase, as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as [[BIOSIS Previews]] and [[Biological Abstracts]], which began in the 1920s as a single annual volume, but has grown so drastically that by the end of the 20th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic [[database]].<ref>Allan, Barbara. Livesey, Brian (1994). ''How to Use Biological Abstracts, Chemical Abstracts and Index Chemicus''. Gower. {{ISBN|978-0-566-07556-8}}</ref>\n\n== Characterization ==\nSince organic compounds often exist as [[mixture]]s, a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity, especially important being [[chromatography]] techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] and [[gas chromatography]].  Traditional methods of separation include [[distillation]], [[crystallization]], and [[solvent extraction]].\n\nOrganic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests, called \"wet methods\", but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer-intensive methods of analysis.<ref>Shriner, R.L.; Hermann, C.K.F.; Morrill, T.C.; Curtin, D.Y. and Fuson, R.C. (1997) ''The Systematic Identification of Organic Compounds''. John Wiley & Sons, {{ISBN|0-471-59748-1}}</ref>  Listed in approximate order of utility, the chief analytical methods are:\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] is the most commonly used technique, often permitting complete assignment of atom connectivity and even stereochemistry using [[correlation spectroscopy]].  The principal constituent atoms of organic chemistry \u2013 hydrogen and carbon \u2013 exist naturally with NMR-responsive isotopes, respectively <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C.\n* [[Elemental analysis]]: A destructive method used to determine the elemental composition of a molecule.  See also mass spectrometry, below.\n* [[Mass spectrometry]] indicates the [[molecular weight]] of a compound and, from the [[mass spectrum analysis|fragmentation patterns]], its structure.  High resolution mass spectrometry can usually identify the exact formula of a compound and is used in lieu of elemental analysis.  In former times, mass spectrometry was restricted to neutral molecules exhibiting some volatility, but advanced ionization techniques allow one to obtain the \"mass spec\" of virtually any organic compound.\n* [[Crystallography]] can be useful for determining [[molecular geometry]] when a single crystal of the material is available.  Highly efficient hardware and software allows a structure to be determined within hours of obtaining a suitable crystal.\n\nTraditional spectroscopic methods such as [[infrared spectroscopy]], [[optical rotation]], and [[UV/VIS spectroscopy]] provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds. Traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification.\n\n== Properties ==\nPhysical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features.  Quantitative information includes melting point, boiling point, and index of refraction. Qualitative properties include odor, consistency, solubility, and color.\n\n===Melting and boiling properties===\n\nOrganic compounds typically melt and many boil. In contrast, while inorganic materials generally can be melted, many do not boil, tending instead to degrade.  In earlier times, the melting point (m.p.) and boiling point (b.p.) provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds.  The melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight.  Some organic compounds, especially symmetrical ones, sublime, that is they evaporate without melting.  A well-known example of a sublimable organic compound is [[para-dichlorobenzene]], the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs.  Organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above 300&nbsp;\u00b0C, although some exceptions exist.\n\n===Solubility===\nNeutral organic compounds tend to be [[hydrophobic]]; that is, they are less [[soluble]] in water than in organic solvents.  Exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable (which can be converted in ions) groups as well as low [[molecular weight]] [[alcohol]]s, [[amine]]s, and [[carboxylic acid]]s where [[hydrogen bonding]] occurs.  Otherwise organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic [[solvent]]s.  Solubility varies widely with the organic solute and with the organic solvent.\n\n===Solid state properties===\n\nVarious specialized properties of [[Molecular solid|molecular crystals]] and [[Polymer|organic polymers]] with [[conjugated system]]s are of interest depending on applications, e.g. thermo-mechanical and electro-mechanical such as [[piezoelectricity]], electrical conductivity (see [[conductive polymer]]s and [[organic semiconductor]]s), and electro-optical (e.g. [[non-linear optics]]) properties.  For historical reasons, such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of [[polymer science]] and [[materials science]].\n\n== Nomenclature ==\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}\n[[Image:OrgNom.svg|thumb|center|760px| Various names and depictions for one organic compound.]]\n\nThe names of organic compounds are either systematic, following logically from a set of rules, or nonsystematic, following various traditions. Systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from [[IUPAC]].  Systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a [[parent structure]] within the molecule of interest.  This parent name is then modified by prefixes, suffixes, and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure. Given that millions of organic compounds are known, rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome.  Thus, IUPAC recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds, but not complex molecules.  To use the systematic naming, one must know the structures and names of the parent structures.  Parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons, heterocycles, and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof.\n\nNonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous, at least to organic chemists.  Nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound. They are common for complex molecules, which includes most natural products.  Thus, the informally named [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] is systematically named\n(6a''R'',9''R'')-''N'',''N''-diethyl-7-methyl-4,6,6a,7,8,9-hexahydroindolo-[4,3-''fg''] quinoline-9-carboxamide.\n\nWith the increased use of computing, other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines.  Two popular formats are [[SMILES]] and [[InChI]].\n\n===Structural drawings===\nOrganic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or [[structural formula]]s, combinations of drawings and chemical symbols.  The [[Bond-line formula|line-angle formula]] is simple and unambiguous.  In this system, the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon, and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by [[Tetravalence|tetravalent]] carbon.\n[[File:Stuctural drawings of butane 854px.jpg|alt=Structural representations of butane|center|854x854px|This diagram shows 5 distinct structural representations of the organic compound butane. The left-most structure is a bond-line drawing where the hydrogen atoms are removed. The 2nd structure has the hydrogens added depicted-the dark wedged bonds indicate the hydrogen atoms are coming toward the reader, the hashed bonds indicate the atoms are oriented away from the reader, and the solid (plain) ponds indicate the bonds are in the plane of the screen/paper. The middle structure shows the four carbon atoms. The 4th structure is a representation just showing the atoms and bonds without 3-dimensions. The right-most structure is a condensed structure representation  of butane.]]\n\n===History===\nBy 1880 an explosion in the number of chemical compounds being discovered occurred assisted by new synthetic and analytical techniques. Grignard described the situation as \"chaos le plus complet\" as due to the lack of convention it was possible to have multiple names for the same compound. This led to the creation of the [[Geneva Rules|Geneva rules]] in 1892.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evieux|first=E. A.|date=1954-06-01|title=The Geneva Congress on Organic Nomenclature, 1892|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=31|issue=6|pages=326|doi=10.1021/ed031p326|issn=0021-9584|bibcode=1954JChEd..31..326E}}</ref>\n\n==Classification of organic compounds==\n\n===Functional groups===\n{{Main|Functional group}}\n[[Image:Acetic acid atoms.svg|right|thumb|The family of [[carboxylic]] acids contains a carboxyl (-COOH) [[functional group]]. [[Acetic acid]], shown here, is an example.]]\nThe concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry, both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties.  A functional group is a molecular module, and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed, within limits, to be the same in a variety of molecules. Functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds. Molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups. Alcohols, for example, all have the subunit C-O-H. All alcohols tend to be somewhat [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]], usually form [[ester]]s, and usually can be converted to the corresponding [[halide]]s.  Most functional groups feature heteroatoms (atoms other than C and H). Organic compounds are classified according to functional groups, alcohols, carboxylic acids, amines, etc.<ref>{{March6th}}</ref>\n\n===Aliphatic compounds===\n{{Main|Aliphatic compound}}\nThe aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of [[homologous series]] according to their state of [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturation]]:\n* alkanes (paraffins): aliphatic hydrocarbons without any [[Double bond|double]] or [[triple bond]]s, i.e. just C-C, C-H single bonds\n* alkenes (olefins): aliphatic hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds, i.e. di-olefins (dienes) or poly-olefins.\n* alkynes (acetylenes): aliphatic hydrocarbons which have one or more triple bonds.\nThe rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present.  Such compounds can be \"straight-chain\", branched-chain or cyclic.  The degree of branching affects characteristics, such as the [[octane number]] or [[cetane number]] in petroleum chemistry.\n\nBoth saturated ([[alicyclic]]) compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives. The most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms, but large rings (macrocycles) and smaller rings are common. The smallest cycloalkane family is the three-membered [[cyclopropane]] ((CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>). Saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only, whereas aromatic rings have an alternating (or conjugated) double bond. [[Cycloalkane]]s do not contain multiple bonds, whereas the [[cycloalkene]]s and the cycloalkynes do.\n\n===Aromatic compounds===\n[[Image:Benzene-resonance-structures.svg|right|thumb|[[Benzene]] is one of the best-known aromatic compounds as it is one of the simplest and most stable aromatics.]]\n[[Aromatic]] hydrocarbons contain [[Conjugated system|conjugated]] double bonds. This means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp2 hybridized, allowing for added stability. The most important example is [[benzene]], the structure of which was formulated by [[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 von Stradonitz|Kekul\u00e9]] who first proposed the [[Delocalized electron|delocalization]] or [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] principle for explaining its structure.  For \"conventional\" cyclic compounds, aromaticity is conferred by the presence of 4n + 2 delocalized pi electrons, where n is an integer.  Particular instability ([[antiaromaticity]]) is conferred by the presence of 4n conjugated pi electrons.\n\n===Heterocyclic compounds===\n{{Main|Heterocyclic compound}}\nThe characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present, which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring (exocyclic) or as a member of the ring itself (endocyclic). In the case of the latter, the ring is termed a [[heterocycle]].  [[Pyridine]] and [[furan]] are examples of aromatic heterocycles while [[piperidine]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] are the corresponding [[alicyclic]] heterocycles. The heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen, sulfur, or nitrogen, with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems.\n\nHeterocycles are commonly found in a wide range of products including aniline dyes and medicines. Additionally, they are prevalent in a wide range of biochemical compounds such as [[alkaloids]], vitamins, steroids, and nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA).\n\nRings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give [[polycyclic compound]]s. The [[purine]] nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles.  Rings can also fuse on a \"corner\" such that one atom (almost always carbon) has two bonds going to one ring and two to another.  Such compounds are termed [[spiro compound|spiro]] and are important in a number of [[natural product]]s.\n\n=== Polymers ===\n{{Main|Polymer}}\n\n[[Image:Girl with styrofoam swimming board.jpg|right|thumb|This swimming board is made of [[polystyrene]], an example of a polymer.]]\nOne important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains, or networks, that are linked by carbon-carbon (carbon-to-carbon) bonds. The linking process is called [[polymerization]], while the chains, or networks, are called [[polymer]]s. The source compound is called a [[monomer]].\n\nTwo main groups of polymers exist: [[synthetic polymers]] and [[biopolymer]]s. Synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured, and are commonly referred to as [[plastic|industrial polymers]].<ref>\"industrial polymers, chemistry of.\" [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. 2006</ref> Biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment, or without human intervention.\n\n===Biomolecules===\n[[Image:Maitotoxin 2D structure.svg|400px|thumb|right|[[Maitotoxin]], a complex organic biological toxin.]]\n[[Biomolecule|Biomolecular chemistry]] is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by [[biochemists]]. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain [[biopolymer]]s, and these include [[peptides]], [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and the [[polysaccharide]]s such as [[starch]]es in animals and [[cellulose]]s in plants. The other main classes are [[amino acid]]s (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), [[carbohydrate]]s (which includes the polysaccharides), the [[nucleic acid]]s (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the [[lipid]]s. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the [[Krebs cycle]], and produces [[isoprene]], the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important [[steroid]] structural ([[cholesterol]]) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form [[terpene]]s, [[terpenoid]]s, some [[alkaloid]]s, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the [[latex]] of various species of plants, which is the basis for making [[rubber]].\n\n; Peptide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Peptide synthesis]]''\n; Oligonucleotide Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Oligonucleotide synthesis]]''\n; Carbohydrate Synthesis\n:: ''See also [[Carbohydrate synthesis]]''\n\n=== Small molecules ===\n[[File:CAFENE~1.svg|right|thumb|Molecular models of [[caffeine]].]]\nIn pharmacology, an important group of organic compounds is [[small molecule]]s, also referred to as 'small organic compounds'. In this context, a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active, but is not a [[polymer]]. In practice, small molecules have a [[molar mass]] less than approximately 1000 g/mol.\n\n=== Fullerenes ===\n\n[[Fullerene]]s and [[carbon nanotube]]s, carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures, have stimulated much research into the related field of [[materials science]]. The first fullerene was discovered in 1985 by Sir Harold W. Kroto of the United Kingdom and by Richard E. Smalley and Robert F. Curl, Jr., of the United States. Using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas, these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of 60 carbon atoms (C60) joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with 12 pentagonal and 20 hexagonal faces\u2014a design that resembles a football, or soccer ball. In 1996 the trio was awarded the Nobel Prize for their pioneering efforts. The C60 molecule was named [[buckminsterfullerene]] (or, more simply, the buckyball) after the American architect R. Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles.\n\n=== Others ===\nOrganic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen, oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately. Others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as [[organosulfur chemistry]], [[organometallic chemistry]], [[organophosphorus chemistry]] and [[Organosilicon|organosilicon chemistry]].\n\n== Organic reactions ==\n[[Organic reaction]]s are [[chemical reaction]]s involving [[organic compound]]s. Many of these reactions are associated with functional groups. The general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the [[electron affinity]] of key atoms, [[bond strength]]s and [[steric hindrance]]. These factors can determine the relative stability of short-lived [[reactive intermediate]]s, which usually directly determine the path of the reaction.\n\nThe basic reaction types are: addition reactions, elimination reactions, substitution reactions, pericyclic reactions, rearrangement reactions and redox reactions. An example of a common reaction is a [[substitution reaction]] written as:\n\n:Nu<sup>\u2212</sup>  +  C-X  \u2192 C-Nu + X<sup>\u2212</sup>\n\nwhere X is some [[functional group]] and Nu is a [[nucleophile]].\n\nThe number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite. However, certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions. Each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence\u2014although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone.\n\nThe stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using  [[arrow pushing]] techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products.\n\n== Organic synthesis ==\n{{see also|Chemical synthesis|Organic synthesis}}\n[[Image:Corey oseltamivir synthesis.png|thumb|right|261px|A synthesis designed by [[E.J. Corey]] for [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu). This synthesis has 11 distinct reactions.]]\n\nSynthetic organic chemistry is an [[applied science]] as it borders [[engineering]], the \"design, analysis, and/or construction of works for practical purposes\". Organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task, where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials. Complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule. The synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule. For example, a [[carbonyl]] compound can be used as a [[nucleophile]] by converting it into an [[enolate]], or as an [[electrophile]]; the combination of the two is called the [[aldol reaction]]. Designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory. The scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called [[total synthesis]].\n\nStrategies to design a synthesis include [[retrosynthesis]], popularized by [[E.J. Corey]], which starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions. The pieces, or the proposed precursors, receive the same treatment, until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached. Then, the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis. A \"synthetic tree\" can be constructed, because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses.\n\n==See also==\n{{Main|Outline of organic chemistry}}\n* [[List of important publications in chemistry#Organic chemistry|Important publications in organic chemistry]]\n* [[List of organic reactions]]\n* [[Molecular modelling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{WVD}}\n{{Wikibooks}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-12-organic-chemistry-i-spring-2005/ MIT.edu], OpenCourseWare: Organic Chemistry I\n* [http://www.haverford.edu/wintnerorganicchem HaverFord.edu], Organic Chemistry Lectures, Videos and Text\n* [https://www.organic-chemistry.org Organic-Chemistry.org], Organic Chemistry Portal \u2013 Recent Abstracts and (Name)Reactions\n* [http://www.orgsyn.org/ Orgsyn.org], Organic Chemistry synthesis journal\n* [https://www.khanacademy.org/science/organic-chemistry Khanacademy.org], [[Khan Academy]] - Organic Chemistry\n{{Organic chemistry}}\n{{BranchesofChemistry}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Organic Chemistry}}\n[[Category:Organic chemistry| ]]\n[[Category:Chemistry]]\n[[Category:Organic compounds|Chemistry]]\n", "name_user": "Aqeelrazarizvi", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling mistakes", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry"}

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

The [[El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation]] was in its neutral phase and was thus not expected to be a key predictor for the season. As a result, other oscillations such as the Madden\u2013Julian Oscillation and the Arctic Oscillation were anticipated to be more significant drivers of the seasonal weather, particularly in the form of large temperature and precipitation swings. From the outlook, the greatest likelihoods for above-normal temperatures were for Alaska and Hawaii, with lower but still above-normal odds of above-average temperatures for most of the lower 48 states. The exception was for the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes regions, which were ascribed equal changes for above-, near-, or below-average temperatures. No area in the United States was favored to have below-average temperatures. In terms of precipitation, wetter-than-average conditions were most likely in Alaska, Hawaii, part of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S. Drier-than-average conditions were favored for Louisiana and parts of Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Oklahoma, as well as parts of central and northern California, with the rest of the U.S. having equal changes of above-, near-, or below-average precipitation. The drought outlook highlighted the presence of abnormally dry conditions across much of the Southern U.S, with improvement expected in part of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, Alaska, and Hawaii. Drought was expected to persist in central Texas and the Southwestern U.S, with further development anticipated in parts of central California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Winter Outlook: Warmer than average for many, wetter in the North: Drought improvement expected in the Southeast|url=https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/winter-outlook-warmer-than-average-for-many-wetter-in-north|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|date=October 17, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n=== Early November winter storm ===\nRecord breaking temperatures and snowfall caused disruption throughout the Midwestern United States in early November.

Todorov further assumed that infected individuals may have not been identified because of improper application of testing procedures.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://e-vestnik.bg/31900/barkat-s-testovete-za-koronavirus-u-nas-zatova-ne-otkrivat/?fbclid=IwAR2_fhX6HCxpaKAQ0m9dXidrJu8E1pmJRyauCyXW0XPA3wKb1viuUqxOy6Q |title=\u0411\u044a\u0440\u043a\u0430\u0442 \u0441 \u0442\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0441 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441, \u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432\u0430 \u043d\u0435 \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0442 |date=4 March 2020 |access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Prof. Milan Milanov, former manager of Pirogov Hospital, the government's response was \"catastrophically delayed\", although he added that there's no room for panic as COVID-19 treatment was \"the same as with influenza\".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.24chasa.bg/novini/article/8286282 |title=\u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444. \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043d \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432: \u041e\u0447\u0430\u043a\u0432\u0430\u043c \u0432\u0437\u0440\u0438\u0432 \u043e\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0443\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f |access-date=11 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Impact ==\n\nBulgaria recorded 31,643 newly registered unemployed for the period between 13 March to 1 April.
