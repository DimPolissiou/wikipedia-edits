{"title_page": "Paleontology in Wisconsin", "text_new": "[[image:Map of USA WI.svg|thumb|The location of the [[state of Wisconsin]]]]\n'''Paleontology in Wisconsin''' refers to [[paleontological]] research occurring within or conducted by people from the [[United States|U.S. state]] of [[Wisconsin]]. The state has fossils from the [[Precambrian]], much of the [[Paleozoic]], and the later part of the [[Cenozoic]]. Most of the Paleozoic rocks are marine in origin. Because of the thick blanket of [[Pleistocene]] glacial sediment that covers the rock strata in most of the state, Wisconsin\u2019s [[fossil record]] is relatively sparse. In spite of this, certain Wisconsin paleontological occurrences provide exceptional insights concerning the history and diversity of life on Earth. \n\n\n==Prehistory==\n\n\n===[[Precambrian]]===\nMany [[metamorphic]], [[igneous]] and [[sedimentary]] rock units are exposed in the north-central part of Wisconsin. Although they are mostly barren of fossils, some of the sedimentary ones contain [[stromatolites]].<ref name=\"wisconsin-paleoportal-general\" /><ref name=\"wisconsin-stromatolites\" />\n\n===[[Cambrian]]===\nExposures of Cambrian rock units, many of which are fossiliferous, occur in western and central Wisconsin, especially along the banks of the Mississippi, Saint Croix and Wisconsin Rivers. Most of the rocks are Upper Cambrian; however, others are thought to be Middle Cambrian. Fossils of many groups of organisms have been found including stromatolites, [[conulariids]], [[brachiopods]], [[gastropods]], [[monoplacophora]]ns, [[trilobites]], [[graptolites]], and [[conodont]] elements. Wisconsin\u2019s Cambrian rocks have also produced fossils of more [[aglaspidid]] species (around 12) than those of any other state. A portion of central Wisconsin known as [[Blackberry Hill]] is a [[Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte]] famous for its many types of trace fossils, mass strandings of [[jellyfish]], and especially for producing fossils of one of the first animals to emerge from the sea and walk on land (i.e., a species of [[euthycarcinoid]]).<ref name=\"gass-solving\" /><ref name=\"collette-protichnites\" />\n<center>\n{{gallery\n|width=200\n|height=180\n|lines = 7\n|Stranded Cambrian scyphozoans.jpg|Stranded [[scyphozoans]] (jellyfish) at [[Blackberry Hill]].\n|File:Prosaukia.jpg|The Cambrian [[trilobite]] ''Prosaukia'' from Prairie du Sac.\n|File:Climactichnites wilsoni, [[Blackberry Hill]], Wisconsin, Cambrian - Todd Gass.jpg|''[[Climactichnites]] wilsoni'', the trackways from a large, slug-like mollusk at [[Blackberry Hill]].

Fossils include stromatolites, [[stromatoporoid]]s, sponges, conulariids, rugose and tabulate corals, bryozoans, brachiopods, gastropods, monoplacophorans, bivalves, nautiloids, trilobites, ostracods, [[phyllocarid]]s, [[cystoids]], crinoids, graptolites, conodont elements, and jawless fish bones. During the Middle-Late Silurian, the area around modern [[Milwaukee]] contained a massive [[reef]] system. The [[fauna]] that lived there at that time is among the most diverse for its age on the entire continent. Donald G. Mikulic has called it \"a textbook example of ancient reefs.\" <ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /> Also of much significance is the [[Waukesha Biota]], which is a Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte famous for its superbly preserved fossils of strange [[arthropods]], [[worm]]s, and other organisms not previously recorded from Silurian rocks. Among the Waukesha Biota's fossil organisms seldom preserved in other Silurian occurrences are a possible [[scorpion]], [[synziphosurine]]s, a [[cheloniellid]], a [[thylacocephala]]n, [[lobopod]]s, a [[leech]] and other 'worms,' a [[cubozoan]], [[graptolites]], and [[chordates]].<ref name=\"wendruff-paleobiology\" /><ref name=\"mikulic-new\" /><ref name=\"meyer-discovering\" />\n<center>\n{{gallery\n|width=200\n|height=180\n|lines = 7\n|File:Mackenziurus lauriae.jpg|Drawing of the Silurian trilobite ''Mackenziurus lauriae'' Gass, Edgecombe, Ramskold, Mikulic, and Watkins, 1992.\n|File:Meroperyx.jpg| The Silurian styginid trilobite ''Meroperyx'' from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Dalmanitid trilobite.jpg| A Silurian dalmanitid trilobite from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Probable leech from the Waukesha Biota.jpg|Silurian worm, possibly a leech, from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Cheloniellid.jpg|Silurian cheloniellid, from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n}}\n</center>\n\n===[[Devonian]]===\nFour Devonian formations are located in the southeastern portion of Wisconsin in the vicinity of Milwaukee.

In spite of its elusiveness, one unit---the [[Milwaukee Formation]]---has been found to have one of the most diverse biotas of its age (late [[Givetian]]) coming from a single formation. Its fossil biota includes around 250 species of agglutinated [[foraminifers]], [[radiolarians]], [[chitinozoans]], conulariids, rugose and tabulate corals, [[tentaculitoids]], bryozoans, [[hederelloids]], brachiopods, [[hyoliths]], gastropods, [[rostroconch]]s, bivalves, nautiloids, actinoceratoids, [[ammonoids]], [[annelid worms]] ([[scolecodonts]]), trilobites, ostracods, phyllocarids, crinoids, [[blastoids]], [[edrioasteroids]], graptolites, conodont elements, fishes ([[placoderms]], [[sharks]], [[acanthodians]], [[sarcopterygians]]), [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] [[fungi]], and [[land plants]] ([[cladoxylopsid]]s? and [[lycopods]]).

As a result, [[dinosaurs]] and other organisms of this age did not leave fossils in Wisconsin.<ref name=\"wisconsin-paleoportal-general\" />\n\n===[[Quaternary]]===\nDuring the Quaternary, deposition resumed; however, the local climate was cold and glaciers would come to cover nearly all of the state's land area. Wisconsin contains sediment from all of the Pleistocene glacial stages, especially the stage that bears the state's name. [[Apiaceae|Hemlock]] and [[spruce]] trees formed forests inhabited by creatures like [[giant beavers]], [[horses]], and [[woolly mammoths]]. [[Pinniped|Seals]], [[walruses]], and [[whales]] left behind fossil remains in the state near the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name=\"wisconsin-paleoportal-general\" />\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Increase Lapham.meteor.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Lapham examining a [[meteorite]] which had fallen in Wisconsin in 1868]]\n[[File:Calymene celebra Raymond, 1916.jpg|thumb|The Silurian trilobite ''Calymene celebra''; Wisconsin's state fossil.]]\nPolymath naturalist [[Increase Allen Lapham]] is regarded as Wisconsin's first [[geologist]].<ref name=\"hayes-increase-2\" /> During the late 1830s Lapham discovered a wide variety of fossils in great abundance in some rocky hills near Milwaukee.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /> He wondered about the [[stratigraphic]] relationship between the rocks preserving his fossils and those from [[Paleontology in New York|New York]] described in [[James Hall (paleontologist)|James Hall]]'s recent research. Lapham sent a sizable sampling of the local fossils to Hall in 1846.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /><ref name=\"hayes-increase-2\" /> Hall began researching the area and in 1862 recognized the local [[reefs]] for what they were. The Silurian-aged reefs of the Milwaukee area were the first Paleozoic reefs in the world to be described for the scientific literature. They were also the first fossil reefs in North America to be properly recognized as such. Hall set out to formally describe the fossils of the reef, and found them to be among the most diverse of the period on the entire continent.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" />  Lapham died in 1875 and most of his fossils and mineral specimens were sold to the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Sadly, most of his specimens were destroyed nine years later during a fire that consumed the university's science building.<ref name=\"hayes-increase-2\" /> During the second half of the 19th century the region was prospected by \"gentleman naturalists\" who collected fossils on behalf of Hall and other well known paleontologists. Examples include [[T. A. Greene]] and [[E. E. Teller]] who collected near Milwaukee, [[P. R. Hoy]], who collected near [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], and [[F. H. Day]], who collected in the [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] area. In 1877 research by [[T. C. Chamberlin]] uncovered differences in the composition and fossils of the reef-bearing rocks of the Milwaukee area as compared to those that didn't contain reefs. Donald G. Mikulic praised Chamberlin's research on the Milwaukee reefs as \"a classic work of [[paleoecology]] and [[sedimentology]]\".<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /> In the early 20th century the reefs commanded the research attention of figures like [[W. C. Alden]], [[A. W. Grabau]], and [[R. R. Schrock]]. Gradually scientific interest in the Silurian reefs of Milwaukee waned along with the decline in local quarrying.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" />\n\nLapham, Greene, Teller, Day, and another gentleman naturalist, [[C. E. Monroe]], also gathered extensive collections from the Devonian Milwaukee Formation. The majority of those fossils came from natural cement quarries that operated between 1876 and 1911 along the Milwaukee River in the area now occupied by Estabrook and Lincoln Parks. Greene and some of the others would pay the quarry workers for their fossil finds, resulting in large numbers of high quality fossils. These beds soon became well known for containing one of the most diverse Devonian fish faunas in the United States. Most of that material as well as that collected after closure of the quarries now resides in museums, such as the Thomas A. Greene Geological Museum, Milwaukee Public Museum, Weis Earth Science Museum, Field Museum of Natural History, National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian), Museum of Comparative Zoology, and Buffalo Museum of Science. Much of that material has not been studied in depth for over one hundred years, but a preliminary study conducted in 2019 indicates that the Milwaukee Formation contains one of the richest and most diverse biotas in North America coming from a single formation of its age.<ref name=\"gass-fossils\" />\n\nOther significant, more recent developments in Wisconsin paleontology include the discovery of the [[Waukesha Biota]] and [[Blackberry Hill]], as discussed above.\n\nThe Silurian trilobite ''[[Calymene celebra]]'' was designated as Wisconsin's [[state fossil]] in 1985.\n\n==People==\n* [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] was born in [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] on January 26, [[1884 in paleontology|1884]].\n* [[Amadeus William Grabau]] was born in [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|Cedarburg]] on January 9, [[1870 in paleontology|1870]].\n* [[Everett C.

A portion of central Wisconsin known as [[Blackberry Hill]] is a [[Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte]] famous for its many types of trace fossils, mass strandings of [[jellyfish]], and especially for producing fossils of one of the first animals to emerge from the sea and walk on land (i.e., a species of [[euthycarcinoid]]).<ref name=\"gass-solving\" /><ref name=\"collette-protichnites\" />\n<center>\n{{gallery\n|width=200\n|height=180\n|lines = 7\n|Stranded Cambrian scyphozoans.jpg|Stranded [[scyphozoans]] (jellyfish) at [[Blackberry Hill]].\n|File:Prosaukia.jpg|The Cambrian [[trilobite]] ''Prosaukia'' from Prairie du Sac.\n|File:Climactichnites wilsoni, [[Blackberry Hill]], Wisconsin, Cambrian - Todd Gass.jpg|''[[Climactichnites]] wilsoni'', the trackways from a large, slug-like mollusk at [[Blackberry Hill]].

During the Middle-Late Silurian, the area around modern [[Milwaukee]] contained a massive [[reef]] system. The [[fauna]] that lived there at that time is among the most diverse for its age on the entire continent. Donald G. Mikulic has called it \"a textbook example of ancient reefs.\" <ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /> Also of much significance is the [[Waukesha Biota]], which is a Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte famous for its superbly preserved fossils of strange [[arthropods]], [[worm]]s, and other organisms not previously recorded from Silurian rocks. Among the Waukesha Biota's fossil organisms seldom preserved in other Silurian occurrences are a possible [[scorpion]], [[synziphosurine]]s, a [[cheloniellid]], a [[thylacocephala]]n, [[lobopod]]s, a [[leech]] and other 'worms,' a [[cubozoan]], [[graptolites]], and [[chordates]].<ref name=\"wendruff-paleobiology\" /><ref name=\"mikulic-new\" /><ref name=\"meyer-discovering\" />\n<center>\n{{gallery\n|width=200\n|height=180\n|lines = 7\n|File:Mackenziurus lauriae.jpg|Drawing of the Silurian trilobite ''Mackenziurus lauriae'' Gass, Edgecombe, Ramskold, Mikulic, and Watkins, 1992.\n|File:Scutelluid trilobite.jpg| The Silurian styginid trilobite ''Meroperyx'' from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Dalmanitid trilobite.jpg| A Silurian dalmanitid trilobite from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Probable leech from the Waukesha Biota.jpg|Silurian worm, possibly a leech, from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n|File:Cheloniellid.jpg|Silurian cheloniellid, from the [[Waukesha Biota]].\n}}\n</center>\n\n===[[Devonian]]===\nFour Devonian formations are located in the southeastern portion of Wisconsin in the vicinity of Milwaukee.

In spite of its elusiveness, one unit---the [[Milwaukee Formation]]---has been found to have one of the most diverse biotas of its age (late [[Givetian]]) coming from a single formation. Its fossil biota includes around 250 species of agglutinated [[foraminifers]], [[radiolarians]], [[chitinozoans]], conulariids, rugose and tabulate corals, [[tentaculitoids]], bryozoans, [[hederelloids]], brachiopods, [[hyoliths]], gastropods, [[rostroconch]]s, bivalves, nautiloids, actinoceratoids, [[ammonoids]], [[annelid worms]] ([[scolecodonts]]), trilobites, ostracods, phyllocarids, crinoids, [[blastoids]], [[edrioasteroids]], graptolites, conodont elements, fishes ([[placoderms]], [[sharks]], [[acanthodians]], [[sarcopterygians]]), [[terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] [[fungi]], and [[land plants]] ([[cladoxylopsid]]s? and [[lycopods]]).

Wisconsin contains sediment from all of the Pleistocene glacial stages, especially the stage that bears the state's name.

Lapham sent a sizable sampling of the local fossils to Hall in 1846.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /><ref name=\"hayes-increase-2\" /> Hall began researching the area and in 1862 recognized the local [[reefs]] for what they were. The Silurian-aged reefs of the Milwaukee area were the first Paleozoic reefs in the world to be described for the scientific literature. They were also the first fossil reefs in North America to be properly recognized as such. Hall set out to formally describe the fossils of the reef, and found them to be among the most diverse of the period on the entire continent.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" />  Lapham died in 1875 and most of his fossils and mineral specimens were sold to the [[University of Wisconsin]]. Sadly, most of his specimens were destroyed nine years later during a fire that consumed the university's science building.<ref name=\"hayes-increase-2\" /> During the second half of the 19th century the region was prospected by \"gentleman naturalists\" who collected fossils on behalf of Hall and other well known paleontologists. Examples include [[T. A. Greene]] and [[E. E. Teller]] who collected near Milwaukee, [[P. R. Hoy]], who collected near [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]], and [[F. H. Day]], who collected in the [[Wauwatosa, Wisconsin|Wauwatosa]] area. In 1877 research by [[T. C. Chamberlin]] uncovered differences in the composition and fossils of the reef-bearing rocks of the Milwaukee area as compared to those that didn't contain reefs. Donald G. Mikulic praised Chamberlin's research on the Milwaukee reefs as \"a classic work of [[paleoecology]] and [[sedimentology]]\".<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" /> In the early 20th century the reefs commanded the research attention of figures like [[W. C. Alden]], [[A. W. Grabau]], and [[R. R. Schrock]]. Gradually scientific interest in the Silurian reefs of Milwaukee waned along with the decline in local quarrying.<ref name=\"reefs-abstract-7\" />\n\nLapham, Greene, Teller, Day, and another gentleman naturalist, [[C. E. Monroe]], also gathered extensive collections from the Devonian Milwaukee Formation. The majority of those fossils came from natural cement quarries that operated between 1876 and 1911 along the Milwaukee River in the area now occupied by Estabrook and Lincoln Parks. Greene and some of the others would pay the quarry workers for their fossil finds, resulting in large numbers of high quality fossils. These beds soon became well known for containing one of the most diverse Devonian fish faunas in the United States. Most of that material as well as that collected after closure of the quarries now resides in museums, such as the Thomas A. Greene Geological Museum, Milwaukee Public Museum, Weis Earth Science Museum, Field Museum of Natural History, National Museum of Natural History (Smithsonian), Museum of Comparative Zoology, and Buffalo Museum of Science. Much of that material has not been studied in depth for over one hundred years, but a preliminary study conducted in 2019 indicates that the Milwaukee Formation contains one of the richest and most diverse biotas in North America coming from a single formation of its age.<ref name=\"gass-fossils\" />\n\nOther significant, more recent developments in Wisconsin paleontology include the discovery of the [[Waukesha Biota]] and [[Blackberry Hill]], as discussed above.\n\nThe Silurian trilobite ''[[Calymene celebra]]'' was designated as Wisconsin's [[state fossil]] in 1985.\n\n==People==\n* [[Roy Chapman Andrews]] was born in [[Beloit, Wisconsin|Beloit]] on January 26, [[1884 in paleontology|1884]].\n* [[Amadeus William Grabau]] was born in [[Cedarburg, Wisconsin|Cedarburg]] on January 9, [[1870 in paleontology|1870]].\n* [[Everett C.

The eastern boundary is formed by the [[River Trent]]. Prior to 1884, the parish included {{convert|155|acre|ha}} of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of [[Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire|Kettlethorpe]].<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=23}}</ref> Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922.<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=7}}</ref> The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry.<ref>{{harvnb |Thirsk |1991 |p=68}}</ref> In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768\u20139 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are a number of [[listed building]]s in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1276573 |desc=Manor Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233547 |desc=Binge Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233548 |desc=Willow Tree Cottage, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable-ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233549 |desc=Willow Tree Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of the influence of the [[enclosure movement]], the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village.{{sfn |Workgroup |2006 |p=7}} Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of [[George III of England|George III]]'s reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's {{convert|1589|acre|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=142, 172}} There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 [[messuage]]s and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799.<ref>{{cite work |title=Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society |volume=Vol 36|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/whs/36-2.pdf |editor-first=Rev John C |editor-last=Bowmer |date=June 1967 |p=59}}</ref> The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suggested Laneham Heritage Trails |publisher=Nottinghamshire County Council |p=1 |url=http://laneham.org.uk/LanehamLeaflet2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLaneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224. King Henry III stayed at Laneham on 3 October 1255 <ref>Close Rolls, Henry III, 1255</ref> and King Edward III on 15-16 April 1303<ref>Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward I, vol 5, p.83-7</ref>.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=284}}</ref>\n\nThe drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a {{convert|43|hp|kW|adj=on|abbr=on}} steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was {{convert|26.5|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|2.25|ft|m}} wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an [[Gwynnes Limited|Allen-Gwynnes]] {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} electric pump.<ref>{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=199}}</ref> With the passing of the [[Land Drainage Act 1930]], most land drainage authorities were superseded by [[Internal Drainage Board]]s (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for {{convert|78.5|mi|km}} of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} of low-lying land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |title=Laneham IDB \u2013 Summary details |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223023241/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |title=Laneham IDB Biodiversity Action Plan |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |date=January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093115/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811225709/http://naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=History |publisher=Trent Valley IDB |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Margery Ellen |last=Brown\n  |title=Aspects of Parliamentary Enclosure in Nottinghamshire\n  |publisher=Proquest for UMI Dissertation Publishing\n  |year=1995\n  |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/35536/1/U071859.pdf\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Charities\n  |title=Reports for Commissioners\n  |publisher=House of Commons\n  |year=1828\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=K.

The eastern boundary is formed by the [[River Trent]]. Prior to 1884, the parish included {{convert|155|acre|ha}} of land used for parture on the eastern bank of the Trent, but most of this was transferred to the parish of [[Kettlethorpe, Lincolnshire|Kettlethorpe]].<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=23}}</ref> Communication to the east was once easier, as a ferry crossed the river here until 1922.<ref>{{harvnb |Workgroup |2008 |p=7}}</ref> The ferry had a very long history, since a list of stock held by the manor in 1388 included two gangways, which were used by passengers boarding the ferry.<ref>{{harvnb |Thirsk |1991 |p=68}}</ref> In earlier times the parish suffered some flooding from the Trent and the village beck, but the situation was improved by an Act of 1768\u20139 which set up drainage commissioners who were to protect Laneham and several other villages from flooding and improve the drainage of the land.\n\n==Infrastructure==\nThere are a number of [[listed building]]s in the village, including Manor Farmhouse, with three bays and two storeys, built in the early nineteenth century,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1276573 |desc=Manor Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> and Binge Farmhouse, with five bays and two storeys, together with a basement and garret, built in the middle eighteenth century.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233547 |desc=Binge Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> Willow Tree Cottage is a single-storeyed eighteenth-century building with three bays and an attic,<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233548 |desc=Willow Tree Cottage, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> while Willow Tree Farmhouse is an L-shaped building, consisting of a seventeenth-century gable-ended wing and a nineteenth-century wing.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233549 |desc=Willow Tree Farmhouse, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref> As a result of the influence of the [[enclosure movement]], the village prospered, and this is reflected in the substantial farmhouses and the well-ordered field system surrounding the village.{{sfn |Workgroup |2006 |p=7}} Laneham was enclosed by Act of Parliament in 1772, the 12th year of [[George III of England|George III]]'s reign; the enclosure involved 1,073 of the parish's {{convert|1589|acre|km2}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Enclosure was first mentioned in October 1767, but it was another five years until an Act was obtained.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=142, 172}} There was local opposition to the idea of enclosure, but it is unclear how many people were involved, as the opposition is listed as property on which it was assessed, and consisted of 9 [[messuage]]s and cottages, 83 acres of enclosed ground, 129 acres of open arable and meadow, and 52 beastgates. No breakdown of who owned this property exists.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |pp=206, 209}}\n\nThe village had three public houses: The Butchers Arms (demolished 2009\u201310), The Ferryboat, and the Ring o' Bells which stood on the site of the present senior citizens' bungalows. A village hall makes use of the former school building. The [[St Peter's Church, Laneham|Parish Church of St. Peter]] remains open, and is a [[grade I listed]] building. Various parts were constructed in the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th centuries. It was restored in 1891, and the porch was renovated in 1932. The church is the focal point of [[Church Laneham]]; it is built on a small knoll above the river and contains a large, elaborate alabaster memorial to Ellis Markham and his son Jervase, which dates from 1636.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1233511 |desc=Church of St Peter, Laneham |accessdate=27 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nA small, disused Methodist chapel still stands in the village. A Laneham Methodist congregation was first recorded in the Society Book of the Epworth Circuit in 1799.<ref>{{cite work |title=Proceedings of the Wesley Historical Society |volume=Vol 36|url=http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/whs/36-2.pdf |editor-first=Rev John C |editor-last=Bowmer |date=June 1967 |p=59}}</ref> The chapel was erected in 1834, and renovations to it were carried out in 1884.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suggested Laneham Heritage Trails |publisher=Nottinghamshire County Council |p=1 |url=http://laneham.org.uk/LanehamLeaflet2.pdf}}</ref>\n\nLaneham had a school in Tudor times since biographical records indicate that Gervase Markham attended it for four years before going to Cambridge. There was no school in the 1860s, when local children were having to go to Dunham, as is the case now.\n\n==Charities==\nInformation about village charities is displayed in the church and hall. The Laneham poor charity has existed since at least 1700. In that year four Laneham men \u2018surrendered\u2019 a close of about two acres, the revenues of this being used to feed the poor of the parish. Every three years this land was put up for rental on Easter Monday, yielding around \u00a311 6s a year in 1827. The money was paid to the Overseer of the Poor who then commissioned a village baker to provide two shillings worth of bread every Sunday, to be given out as penny and twopenny loaves at the Church. This only cost \u00a35-5-0d a year, so the rest was used to buy coal for the poor.{{sfn |Charities |1828 |p=447}}\n\nDuring the 1820s the Overseer was also receiving 13s from the occupier of three closes in Laneham which belonged to the Vicar of Applethorpe, but no one knew how this arose. More money came from the bequest of William Skelton, who had left \u00a320 for the poor of Laneham. Half of this had been \u2018vested\u2019 in a Rampton farmer, Elizabeth Draper, who paid 10 shillings a year interest; the other half was vested in John Popple, who paid nothing until his death in 1815 when Mrs Anne Warrener took the capital and started to pay out. A woman called Sarah Fillingham also left a close called Clay Half to provide 20 shillings a year for distribution to \u2018honest widows.\u2019{{sfn |Charities |1828 |pp=447-448}}\n\nThe population of the village in 1811 was 337, and in 1815, 25 of these were officially \"poor\", representing 7.42 percent of the population. This was slightly higher than the 6.96 percent average for Nottinghamshire at the time.{{sfn |Brown |1995 |p=277}}\n\n==Historical events==\nThe archbishops of Canterbury held Laneham Manor from an early date, certainly by the time of the Domesday book when 100 acres of pasture at Newton were said to belong to the Archbishop's manor. One who seems to have benefited was William of Laneham who was on the Archbishop's staff in the early 1200s and became Archdeacon of Durham by 1224.\n\nThomas de Corbridge, Archbishop of York, decided to spend the summer months in his residence at Laneham in July 1303 \u2013 to which he presumably travelled by water. However, while staying in the village he became ill and died on 22 September. He was known as a hard-working archbishop and was still handling his business until five days before his death. His body was taken to Southwell for burial, presumably again by water, with most of his final journey being via the Trent. The archdiocese of York properties of Laneham, Scrooby and Askham were leased to Samuel Sandys by his father, Archbishop Sandys, just before his death in 1588 and reputedly on advantageous terms. The family retained an interest in the Laneham manor for several generations and in 1663 it was held by John Sandys 'of Laneham' and Francis Sandys 'of Scrooby.'<ref>I. J. Gentles and W. J. Sheils, Confiscation and Restoration: The Archbishopric Estates and\nthe Civil War (York: Borthwick Institute of Historical Research, 1981), 2.</ref> There are old references to the remains of a moat from the palace, but these were apparently ploughed out in the 1970s.\n\nIn 1315 the people of Dunham on Trent were ordered to surrender those who had taken the Archbishop of York's swans from Laneham.<ref>A Calendar of the Register of Richard Scrope, Archbishop of York ..., Volume 11,p.87.</ref>{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Another known event in Laneham is one of the first legal cases involving a \u2018carrier\u2019, i.e. someone responsible for transporting another person or their goods. In 1346 William, a ferryman at Laneham, took a man named Richard, his horse and his goods across the river by ferry. However, he only took them part of the way, because William threw the horse and goods into the river. Possibly this might have been as the ferry was overloaded and they were all at risk of drowning (as in another case a couple of years later) but we know William\u2019s conduct \u2018inflicted other enormities to the grave damage and against the peace\u2019. Damages to Richard\u2019s property amounted to 40 marks.{{sfn |Palmer |1994 |p=174}}\n\nLittle is yet been found about Laneham having a role in civil administration, but it is known that at least one major 'trial' was held in the village. Thomas Hancock was the Puritan vicar of Headon from 1605 to 1623, arriving from Elkesley. In 1620 he was fined \"6d for riot\", at a special sessions in Laneham to try 26 people indicted for riotous assault. Hancock had something of a record for challenging the establishment, having also been one of the Puritan curates sheltered by the Brewsters at Scrooby in the 1690s when he had conducted the apparently illegal wedding of another cleric, Robert Southworth.\n\nAn old family history of the Markham family ('Markham Memorials vol 1' by Sir Clements Markham, 1913) sheds interesting light on the two Markhams who kneel facing the east in Laneham church, and have done so for hundreds of years.\n\nAt the front is Ellis Markham (c1515-1578) who was the grandson of a famous Lord Chief Justice. He had a career as an administrator, both with the Duchy of Lancaster-based around Ripon and in the household of the Archbishop of York. In 1536 he was working for Archbishop Lee and played a minor role in organising matters during the Lincolnshire Rebellion against the policies of Henry VIII. But by 1547 he was described as being in the household of Queen Catherine Parr which would indicate strong Protestant leanings. \nHe was elected an MP in 1555-7 but Markham achieved some notoriety when Mary I gave him the job of investigating the financial affairs of the disgraced Archbishop Holgate. He gathered in all sorts of treasure and finery at Cawood \u2013 to the extent that the next archbishop under Queen Elizabeth tried to sue him for damages.\n\nEllis Markham had two sons \u2013 Gervase and Jerome. The boys apparently went to school in Laneham, and then to Cambridge \u2013 Jerome arriving there at the age of 16 in 1576. However, by the 1590s the Markhams were embroiled in a bitter dispute with a ruffian named George Noel, and Noel called the Markhams out for a duel.\n\nThis was at Edward Stanhope's house, probably at Shelford east of Nottingham \u2013 the Stanhopes were earls of Chesterfield eventually. Jerome accepted the challenge although Edmund Elvois said, 'Alas, Jerome is a very young man and without experience in any fray.' They went out into the fields and Noel attacked Jerome, breaking his sword; with his opponent defenceless, Noel proceeded to kill him in an act which many saw as murder. He was buried in Nottingham. Edmund Elvois may well have been the Askham man whose name was usually spelt 'Helwys' \u2013 and father of [[Thomas Helwys]] the Baptist pioneer who paid for the 'Pilgrims' to go to Holland. Noel was a braggart and a bully, with a whole string of local quarrels including with George Lassells at Sturton. Soon afterwards someone spoke up for Noel at a meeting in the archbishop's palace at Southwell, nearly causing another quarrel as the Markhams reacted angrily.\n\nJerome's brother Gervase lived on but he lived anything but a good life \u2013 with a reputation for seducing wenches and stockpiling treasure. Gervase had some success as a soldier and returned home to live mainly at Dunham on Trent. He was known to be the 'gallant' of the Countess of Shrewsbury, a term that was clearly meant to imply more than knightly devotion. He was described as 'a proper handsome gentleman, and of great courage.\u2019\n\nIn 1616 Markham was involved in somewhat scandalous legal dispute with Lord Darcy, following an incident with the noble Lord's dog whilst they were both at a hunting event. After this he got involved in a dispute between Sir John Holles and the Stanhope family, as a result of which Holles accused him of 'lying like a villain.' Markham took this as a challenge to a duel, which he offered to fight in Worksop Park \u2013 territory of one of Holles' enemies, so Holles declined. Markham took this as a 'refusal'. However the two men met by chance in Sherwood Forect and Holles declared he would 'spoil' Markham; they duelled with rapiers, and Holles ran through Markham 'through the middle of the guts and up to the hilt, and out behind toward the small of the back.\u2019\n\nThis incident almost led to full-scale battle between Holles' men and those of Markham's friends, but Markham survived. Apparently he rashly swore to never eat supper or take the sacrament until he had gained revenge \u2013 but never did manage to! Despite his poor reputation, in 1625 Markham was Sheriff of Nottinghamshire with lands at Laneham and Dunham. While he was away from his home at Dunham one day, two youths who were reputed to be his 'bastards' robbed his house of property worth \u00a35000 \u2013 at least \u00a3800,000 today. Perhaps to evade capture, the youths buried their treasure in Gamston Woods. In 1627, when he was elderly and bedridden, one of the Holles family ordered his home to be searched for a fugitive catholic priest. This was widely interpreted as the action of someone denouncing Markham for reasons of a grudge, and the vicar of Dunham certified that he had routinely attended his parish church.\n\nHe cannot have been that ill in 1625 as he was still alive in 1636, though living the life of a miser. He was spending \u00a340 a year though his income from land was \u00a3800 and he had \u00a340,000 in money \u2013 so a substantial millionaire in today's values. Markham had no family and refused to acknowledge any of his extramarital offspring, so spent it on no-one. Despite this he refused to pay the king's new tax, Ship Money, and was ordered to be arrested.  The vicar had to certify that he was too ill to travel to London, reporting that he had taken communion in his bed for many years \u2013 so perhaps he had given up on his vengeance vow!\nHe died in 1637, old and crippled, and was buried in Laneham church beneath an effigy of himself as a young and handsome man that had been there many years already \u2013 having been presumably commissioned by his father.\n\nThere also seem to have been a few Quakers in the village. In 1689 Gervase Harrison was prosecuted at the ecclesiastical court following an action by Richard Bradley, vicar of Laneham, for not paying the sum of 6d each for three communicants in his household. Harrison did not appear to answer the case and was committed to Nottingham Gaol for nine weeks, including two weeks in one of its nefarious dungeons. IN 1707 John Parker was prosecuted for non-payment of tithes, a typical Quaker offence.\n\nIn 1810 the church tower was rebuilt after being struck by lightning and four bells added at a cost of \u00a3800. According to a Church of England report at the time, efforts to raise funds for this locally failed 'as the parishioners are too poor.'\n\nAccording to the Notts Guardian in 1865 there was a grave in the churchyard for James Penant, a blacksmith, who died on 27 May 1763, with the inscription:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:My tongs and hammer I\u2019ve declined\n:My bellows they have lost their wind\n:My fires extinct my forge decayed\n:And in the dust my vice is laid\n:My coals are spent my iron gone\n:My nails are drove my work is done.\n{{Refend}}\nOnly a few parts of this text are still legible.\n\nThe poverty of Laneham\u2019s former curate was reported in the news in 1842 when an income tax return was sent back from the village with the following verse attached:\n{{Refbegin}}\n:There\u2019s nothing here but poverty,\n:Scottish rags and hunger;\n:If Sir Robert Peel has sent you here\n:Surely it was in anger.\n{{Refend}}\nThe writer was Rev. John Irvine, a Scottish man who had taken on the curacy of both Laneham and Rampton for the \u2018shamefully small\u2019 stipend of \u00a350 a year. At that time it was quite common for a parish to have a vicar or rector \u2013 usually well-connected \u2013 who drew most of the income and then paid a small portion to a less well-connected clergyman to act as curate and do most of the work. After a year or two Irvine had to give up the role at Rampton (we do not know why) and was reduced to just the Laneham role for which he was paid 10&nbsp;shillings (\u00a30.50) a week \u2013 so his pay was little more than that of an agricultural labourer. When Laneham\u2019s rector died, Irvine felt he had a strong claim on the senior position and petitioned the patron of the benefice, the Dean and Chapter of York, for the place \u2013 without success.\n\nTo make ends meet, Irvine was forced to open a parish school where he could charge parents for the education of their children, but clearly this produced only a small income for him.\n\nSome of the vicars of Laneham were also interesting. In 1764 John Welch was \"not able to do any duty, being a little insane\". In 1842 Edmund Wallis died, having been vicar for 60 years; this perhaps explains some aspects of Irvine's story.\n\nA few minor crimes have received press coverage giving an insight into Laneham life in the past. In 1839 two women \u2018had words\u2019 in the street and then took to blows in a \u2018desperate encounter\u2019, which ended with one at death\u2019s door apparently. In 1843 at harvest the locals mixed with Irish itinerant workers in one of the village inns, but hostility was bubbling under the surface; Charles Parr, Thomas Lane and other local \u2018ruffians\u2019 were found \u2018absolutely roasting\u2019 a young Irish reaper on the fire of the inn until its landlord intervened.\n\n==Local boys made good==\nLaneham boys George Warriner and Enoch Hodgkinson left the village in the later 1700s for a career in London, where they became successful retail drapers with a shop at 124 New Bond Street. In 1788 two women were transported to Australia for seven years after being caught \u2018shoplifting\u2019 from the \u2018expensive\u2019 shop they ran.\n\nGeorge (1745-1822) was born in Laneham to parents who married in the village in 1739. In London, he bought a nice house in Lisson Grove. Having made his fortune, Warriner then reinvented himself as a country gentleman. He married a lady named Elizabeth and bought a small estate at Bloxham in 1797, Oxfordshire. In 1812 the area was visited by the famous agricultural author Arthur Young, who was impressed by the modern farming techniques in use on the estate. Warriner had a son, named Enoch Hodgkinson Warriner after his friend, who went to Oxford and became a clergyman at Footscray in Kent; Mrs Warriner\u2019s letters to her son are preserved in the National Archives. Bloxham stayed in the Warriner family until 1915 but his great grandson Henry inherited the Weston Park estate of the Earl of Camperdown, for whom he had been gamekeeper. Perhaps George\u2019s most enduring memorial is actually the secondary school in Bloxham, which is called the Warriner School.\n\nEnoch is less easy to trace but he had an active business career as well as the drapery side. He was a director of the Hand in Hand Fire Office, an insurance company, and owned properties at Blackfriars Bridge and Child\u2019s Hill, Middlesex. He was living \u2018above the shop\u2019 in 1773 and later in Stamford Street. Both he and George were supporters of the Lock Charity Hospital in London. He died in May 1810 at Stamford Street, aged 77. Hodkinson seems to have been a noted supporter of various charities including for poor clergymen and imprisoned debtors.\n\n==Suspected murder case==\nLaneham hit the headlines in December 1845 with the death of farmer Robert Draper. Draper, the oldest son of a wealthy Rampton farmer, had been born in 1776 and moved to the village after the breakdown of his marriage. He married in 1812 but very soon split from his wife; his wife sued for restitution of conjugal rights in 1838 but lost the case - it having taken her a very long time to bring one! (The Jurist, Volume 1, p.&nbsp;872) Most of the farm was left to Draper\u2019s younger brother although he clearly had some independent means and eventually bought himself 70 acres, farmed with the help of a labourer named in The Times as Hood (also reported as 'Troop').\n\nDraper was an eccentric collector of old coins, swords, pistols and watches. \u201cFor anything that might take his fancy, he was not particular as to the price he might pay,\u201d The Times noted after his death. At 8pm every night he would lock himself into his sitting room with his chronometers and a book, staying up all night until the villagers got up at 6am; if he heard a noise outside, he would fire his pistols through an \u2018aperture\u2019 in the window.\n\nIn 1844 he took in a servant girl, Harriet Trevor. She it was who reported that she had got up one morning to find all the doors locked, but had spied him on his hands and knees in the sitting room. She and Hood lay him down, but took several days to summon Mr Oliver, the surgeon. Oliver could do little to stop his death, but did notice he had bumped his head.\n\nDraper was buried in Laneham church, after which the trustees of his will noticed property missing. By this time Harriet Trevor had gone home, but she was traced and her possessions searched \u2013 she had \u00a340, an enormous sum for a servant girl. A gold chain was found stitched 'inside her stays.' She confessed that she and Hood had robbed Draper, so Hood\u2019s cottage was searched and more property found hidden in a stocking. Then a witness recalled Draper\u2019s head had seemed \u2018soft and boggy\u2019 on one side. It was decided to exhume him.\n\nThe body was dug up and placed in \u2018an empty tenement\u2019 near the church while the coroner\u2019s inquest \u2013 with a jury \u2013 met at the Butcher\u2019s Arms. Viewing the corpse was unpleasant \u2013 \u201cthe stench was awful and the colour of the face as black as that of an Indian. The beard had grown considerably and was covered with a kind of blue mould,\u201d The Times noted. The surgeon told the inquest that marks to the head could have been made with a spade or the blunt end of an axe. Perhaps fearing to place an accusation that could lead to the gallows against people they knew, the jury recorded a view that \u2018there was no satisfactory evidence as to cause of death.\u2019 Hood and Trevor were remarkably lucky to escape with a charge of robbery.\n\n==Laneham drainage==\nIn December 1768, a group of landowners from this part of Nottinghamshire asked the civil engineer [[John Grundy, Jr.]] to investigate the possibility of draining some {{convert|10|sqmi|km2}} of land on the west bank of the [[River Trent]], stretching from Laneham to [[West Burton, Nottinghamshire|West Burton]]. He was accompanied by Samuel Goodhand, his clerk, on the initial site visit, and proposed three components to a solution. The first was a catchwater drain, which would intercept the streams flowing into the area at its western edge, and discharge into the Trent at West Burton. To prevent high water levels in the river flooding the land, he proposed a {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} flood bank, which would run from Laneham to West Burton. Finally, rainwater would be collected by a Mother Drain and numerous side drains, which would discharge into the Trent through an outfall sluice at Sturton Cow Pasture.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |pp=281\u2013282}}</ref>\n\nThe landowners liked the plans, asking Grundy to produce detailed proposals, and to supervise the obtaining of an [[Act of Parliament]] to authorise the work. Assisted by the surveyor George Kelk and a colleague called David Buffery, who checked the levels, he spent six weeks producing his plans, which he presented in February 1769. He estimated that {{convert|5900|acre|ha}} would be improved by the scheme, which would cost \u00a32,700 for the catchwater drain, \u00a36,800 for the bank along the river from Laneham to West Burton, \u00a32,400 for the Mother Drain, with an additional \u00a31,200 for the side drains, and \u00a3900 for the sluice at Sturton, making a total of \u00a314,000. He spent most of March and April in London, to ensure the bill passed through Parliament, and received \u00a3329 for his work up to this point. A detailed plan of the area at a scale of 1:21,120 (3 miles to the inch) was published.<ref name=skempton282>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=282}}</ref>\n\nThe Act appointed Drainage Commissioners, who met for the first time on 29 May 1769. Grundy became the engineer for the scheme, Buffery was the surveyor of works, and Kelk was the land surveyor. Grundy's plans for Sturton Sluice show a {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} waterway. Brickwork and masonry were erected by local contractors, while the major excavations were handled by Dyson and Pinkerton. Grundy changed the plans somewhat, as he decided that a drainage mill would be needed at Sturton. This had a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} [[scoop wheel]], and was completed in April 1770 by Henry Bennett from [[Spalding, Lincolnshire|Spalding]], at a cost of \u00a3458. The works were finished on time in May 1772, with the final cost amounting to around \u00a315,000. Grundy visited the works at least seven times to ensure that his specifications were being met.<ref name=skempton282/> The only known details of the scheme are preserved in Grundy's ''Report Books'', which he spent the last few years of his life preparing. Running to 12 volumes and 4,000 pages, they were lost, but were re-discovered in the library at the [[University of Leeds]] in 1988. The Laneham Drainage scheme is covered in volumes 10 and 11.<ref>{{harvnb |Skempton |2002 |p=284}}</ref>\n\nThe drainage mill which pumped water from the Mother Drain into the Trent was replaced by a {{convert|43|hp|kW|adj=on|abbr=on}} steam-powered beam engine in 1847. It had a larger scoop wheel, which was {{convert|26.5|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|2.25|ft|m}} wide. It was scrapped some time before 1937, and has been replaced by an [[Gwynnes Limited|Allen-Gwynnes]] {{convert|24|in|cm|adj=on}} electric pump.<ref>{{harvnb |Hinde |2006 |p=199}}</ref> With the passing of the [[Land Drainage Act 1930]], most land drainage authorities were superseded by [[Internal Drainage Board]]s (IDBs), and the original scheme formed the central section of the Laneham IDB, who were responsible for {{convert|78.5|mi|km}} of drains and ditches, which helped to prevent flooding of {{convert|22.9|sqmi|km2}} of low-lying land.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |title=Laneham IDB \u2013 Summary details |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223023241/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/IDBindex.asp?Ref=22 |archivedate=23 February 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> They maintained 10 pumping stations, which included those at the end of the catchwater drain and the Mother Drain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |title=Laneham IDB Biodiversity Action Plan |publisher=Shire Group of IDBs |date=January 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323093115/http://www.shiregroup-idbs.gov.uk/Admin/Environmental/Laneham%20IDB%20BAP%20FINAL.pdf |archivedate=23 March 2012 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> In April 2012, they amalgamated with the Newark, Kingston Brook, and Fairham Brook internal drainage boards to become part of the Trent Valley IDB.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811225709/http://naidb.co.uk/general.htm |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=History |publisher=Trent Valley IDB |accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=Margery Ellen |last=Brown\n  |title=Aspects of Parliamentary Enclosure in Nottinghamshire\n  |publisher=Proquest for UMI Dissertation Publishing\n  |year=1995\n  |url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/bitstream/2381/35536/1/U071859.pdf\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |last=Charities\n  |title=Reports for Commissioners\n  |publisher=House of Commons\n  |year=1828\n  |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZTZbAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA447&lpg=PA447\n  |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book\n  |first=K.

Ezekiel, while a number of other sayings of Rav's that occur in the Talmud without the name of the transmitter likewise were handed down by Judah.<ref>[[Rashi]] to [[Hullin]] 44a</ref>\n\nIn recording the words of his teachers, Judah used extreme care, and frequently stated explicitly that his authority for a given saying was uncertain, and that his informant did not know positively whether it was Rav's or Samuel's.<ref>Hullin 18b</ref> His own memory, however, never failed him, and the traditions recorded by him are reliable. When his brother Rami says, in one place, that a certain sentence of Rav's, quoted by Judah, should be disregarded,<ref>Hullin 44a</ref> he does not question the accuracy of Judah's citation, but implies that Rav had afterward abandoned the opinion quoted by Judah, and had, in a statement which the latter had not heard, adopted an opposite view.\n\n===New method of dialectics===\nIn the school which Judah built up at [[Pumbedita]], he introduced a new and original method of instruction: by emphasizing the need of an exact differentiation between, and a critical examination of, the subjects treated, he became the founder of [[Talmudic]] [[dialectics]].<ref>[[Sanh.|Sanhedrin]] 17b; [[Hullin]] 110b; [[Bava Metzia]] 38b</ref> His method of instruction, however, did not please some of his older pupils, and they left him; among these was [[Ze'era]], who went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] despite Judah's declaration that no man should leave [[Babylonia]] for that country.<ref>[[Ket.|Ketuvot]] 111a</ref> But the new method was acceptable to most of his disciples, and was especially attractive to the young, so that the school at Pumbedita steadily increased in importance and popularity. After the death of [[Rav Huna]], head of the [[Academy of Sura]], most of his pupils went to Pumbedita, which, until the death of Judah, remained the only seat of Talmudic learning. Although Judah devoted himself chiefly to dialectics, he did not fail to interpret the [[mishnayot]], to explain peculiar words in them,<ref>[[Pesachim]] 2a; [[Mo'ed Katan]] 6b</ref> or to determine the correct reading where several were given.<ref>[[Be\u1e93ah]] 35b; [[Suk.|Sukkah]] 50b</ref>\n\nJudah gave little attention to [[aggadah]], and what work he did in that field was almost entirely lexicographical.<ref>[[Ned.|Nedarim]] 62b; [[Hullin]] 63a; [[Ta'an.|Ta'anit]] 9b; [[Gi\u1e6d.|Gittin]] 31b</ref> In his daily conversation he took pains to acquire the habit of exact and appropriate expression, for which his contemporary [[Na\u1e25man b.

Ezekiel, while a number of other sayings of Rav's that occur in the Talmud without the name of the transmitter likewise were handed down by Judah.<ref>[[Rashi]] to [[Hullin]] 44a</ref>\n\nIn recording the words of his teachers, Judah used extreme care, and frequently stated explicitly that his authority for a given saying was uncertain, and that his informant did not know positively whether it was Rav's or Samuel's.<ref>Hullin 18b</ref> His own memory, however, never failed him, and the traditions recorded by him are reliable. When his brother Rami says, in one place, that a certain sentence of Rav's, quoted by Judah, should be disregarded,<ref>Hullin 44a</ref> he does not question the accuracy of Judah's citation, but implies that Rav had afterward abandoned the opinion quoted by Judah, and had, in a statement which the latter had not heard, adopted an opposite view.\n\n===New method of dialectics===\nIn the school which Judah built up at [[Pumbedita]], he introduced a new and original method of instruction: by emphasizing the need of an exact differentiation between, and a critical examination of, the subjects treated, he became the founder of [[Talmudic]] [[dialectics]].<ref>[[Sanh.|Sanhedrin]] 17b; [[Hullin]] 110b; [[Bava Metzia]] 38b</ref> His method of instruction, however, did not please some of his older pupils, and they left him; among these was [[Ze'era]], who went to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] despite Judah's declaration that no man should leave [[Babylonia]] for that country.<ref>[[Ket.|Ketuvot]] 111a</ref> But the new method was acceptable to most of his disciples, and was especially attractive to the young, so that the school at Pumbedita steadily increased in importance and popularity. After the death of [[Rav Huna]], head of the [[Academy of Sura]], most of his pupils went to Pumbedita, which, until the death of Judah, remained the only seat of Talmudic learning. Although Judah devoted himself chiefly to dialectics, he did not fail to interpret the [[mishnayot]], to explain peculiar words in them,<ref>[[Pesachim]] 2a; [[Mo'ed Katan]] 6b</ref> or to determine the correct reading where several were given.<ref>[[Be\u1e93ah]] 35b; [[Suk.|Sukkah]] 50b</ref>\n\nJudah gave little attention to [[aggadah]], and what work he did in that field was almost entirely lexicographical.<ref>[[Ned.|Nedarim]] 62b; [[Hullin]] 63a; [[Ta'an.|Ta'anit]] 9b; [[Gi\u1e6d.|Gittin]] 31b</ref> In his daily conversation he took pains to acquire the habit of exact and appropriate expression, for which his contemporary [[Na\u1e25man b. Jacob]] praised him.<ref>[[\u1e32id.|Kiddushin]] 70a, b</ref>\n\nA lover of nature, Judah was a close observer of the animal and plant life around him. \"When in the springtime you see Nature in her beauty, you shall thank God that He has formed such beautiful creatures and plants for the good of mankind\".<ref>[[R. H.|Rosh Hashana]] 11a</ref> Several of his explanations of natural phenomena have been preserved,<ref>[[Ta'an.|Ta'anit]] 3b, 9b</ref> as well as etymologies of the names of animals and descriptions of their characteristics.<ref>[[Hullin]] 63a; [[Mo'ed Katan]] 6b; [[Shab.|Shabbat]] 77b</ref>\n\nAccording to him, piety consists chiefly in fulfilling one's obligations to one's fellow creatures and in observing the laws of \"meum et tuum\" ([[Latin language|Latin]]: \"mine and thine\", referring to the respect of private property):\n{{cquote|''One who wishes to be pious should observe the principles of Nezikin (Damages)''<ref>[[Bava Kamma]] 30a</ref>}}\n\nIt was probably for this reason that he applied himself chiefly to the [[Mishnaic]] treatise [[Nezi\u1e33in]].<ref>[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachot]] 20a</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=J&artid=626|article=Judah b.

The first known reference to the city was in a [[Pope|papal]] register of duties in 1334 when it was mentioned by its Hungarian name, a ''sacerdos de Oduorhel''.<ref name=\"J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai\">{{cite web|author=J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai|title= Tekint\u0151 \u2013 Erd\u00e9lyi Helyn\u00e9vk\u00f6nyv}}[http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_3._kotet_Q-ZS.pdf Transylvanian Toponym Book]</ref> Since 1615, when [[Gabriel Bethlen]], Prince of Transylvania, reaffirmed the rights of the town, the place has been referred to as Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely.\n\nUdvarhely was the location of the first assembly of [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] in 1357. A fortress was built in the town in 1451. It was rebuilt and strengthened by [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]] in 1565, in order to control the Sz\u00e9kelys. [[Wallachia]]n Prince [[Michael the Brave]] allied with the Szekelys and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]]  destroyed the fortress in 1599 during his campaign in Transylvania. It was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed again during history. The ruins of the structure are nowadays known as \"''The Sz\u00e9kely-Attacked Fortress''\".\n\nThe town was historically part of the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land|Szeklerland]] region of [[Transylvania]]. It was the seat of Udvarhelysz\u00e9k District until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the [[Udvarhely County]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, it became part of [[Romania]] and fell within [[Odorhei County]] during the interwar period. In 1940, the [[Second Vienna Award]] granted [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary, which then held the town until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and it became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the town fell within the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], between 1960 and 1968 the Mure\u0219-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the town has been part of Harghita County.<ref>{{cite book |title= Transylvania: the roots of ethnic conflict|author1=John F.

This gave rise to controversy, as one of the statues (''The Wandering Szekler'') was interpreted in the Romanian press as being the portrait of controversial writer and poet [[Albert Wass]].\n\n==Education==\nThe town is renowned in the region for its long and distinguished tradition in [[secondary education]].

The first known reference to the city was in a [[Pope|papal]] register of duties in 1334 when it was mentioned by its Hungarian name, a ''sacerdos de Oduorhel''.<ref name=\"J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai\">{{cite web|author=J\u00e1nos Andr\u00e1s Vistai|title= Tekint\u0151 \u2013 Erd\u00e9lyi Helyn\u00e9vk\u00f6nyv}}[http://www.fatornyosfalunk.com/helynevkonyv_-_3._kotet_Q-ZS.pdf Transylvanian Toponym Book]</ref> Since 1615, when [[Gabriel Bethlen]], Prince of Transylvania, reaffirmed the rights of the town, the place has been referred to as Sz\u00e9kelyudvarhely.\n\nUdvarhely was the location of the first assembly of [[Sz\u00e9kelys]] in 1357. A fortress was built in the town in 1451. It was rebuilt and strengthened by [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya|John II Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]] in 1565, in order to control the Sz\u00e9kelys. [[Wallachia]]n Prince [[Michael the Brave]] allied with the Szekelys and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]]  destroyed the fortress in 1599 during his campaign in Transylvania. It was repeatedly rebuilt and destroyed again during history. The ruins of the structure are nowadays known as \"''The Sz\u00e9kely-Attacked Fortress''\".\n\nThe town was historically part of the [[Sz\u00e9kely Land|Szeklerland]] region of [[Transylvania]]. It was the seat of Udvarhelysz\u00e9k District until the administrative reform of Transylvania in 1876, when it fell within the [[Udvarhely County]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. After the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920, it became part of [[Romania]] and fell within [[Odorhei County]] during the interwar period. In 1940, the [[Second Vienna Award]] granted [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary, which then held the town until 1944. After Soviet occupation, the Romanian administration returned and it became officially part of Romania in 1947. Between 1952 and 1960, the town fell within the [[Magyar Autonomous Region]], between 1960 and 1968 the Mure\u0219-Magyar Autonomous Region. In 1968, the province was abolished, and since then, the town has been part of Harghita County.<ref>{{cite book |title= Transylvania: the roots of ethnic conflict|author1=John F.

This gave rise to controversy, as one of the statues (''The Wandering Szekler'') was interpreted in the Romanian press as being the portrait of controversial writer and poet [[Albert Wass]].\n\n==Education==\nThe town is renowned in the region for its long and distinguished tradition in [[secondary education]].
