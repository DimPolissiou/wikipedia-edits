Indigo, which is chemically very similar to Tyrian purple, behaves similarly. See: http://www.indigopage.com/chemistry.htm</ref>\n<blockquote>The most favourable season for taking these [shellfish] is after the rising of the [[Sirius|Dog-star]], or else before spring; for when they have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers' workshops, although it is a point of primary importance. After it is taken, the vein [i.e. hypobranchial gland] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [about 20&nbsp;fl.&nbsp;oz.] to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin [or lead], and every hundred amphorae ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed at the end of a long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.</blockquote>\n\nArchaeological data from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] indicate that the snails were collected in large vats and left to decompose. This produced a hideous stench that was actually mentioned by ancient authors. Not much is known about the subsequent steps, and the actual ancient method for mass-producing the two murex dyes has not yet been successfully reconstructed; this special \"blackish clotted blood\" colour, which was prized above all others, is believed to be achieved by double-dipping the cloth, once in the indigo dye of ''H.&nbsp;trunculus'' and once in the purple-red dye of ''B.&nbsp;brandaris''.<ref name=Pigments_WebExhibits/><ref name=Moorey1999 />\n[[File:Theodoor van Thulden - The Discovery of Purple.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Hercules' Dog Discovers Purple Dye|The Discovery of Purple by Hercules's Dog]]'' by [[Theodoor van Thulden]], c. 1636]]\nThe Roman [[mythographer]] [[Julius Pollux]], writing in the 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;CE, asserted (''Onomasticon'' I, 45\u201349) that the purple dye was first discovered by the philosopher Heracles of Tyre, or rather, by his dog, whose mouth was stained purple from chewing on snails along the coast at Tyre.

David Jacoby concludes that \"no Byzantine emperor nor any Latin ruler in former Byzantine territories could muster the financial resources required for the pursuit of murex purple production. On the other hand, murex fishing and dyeing with genuine purple are attested for Egypt in the tenth to 13th centuries.\"<ref>Jacoby (2004), p.&nbsp;210.</ref> By contrast, Jacoby finds that there are no mentions of purple fishing or dyeing, nor trade in the colorant in any Western source, even in the Frankish Levant.

Indigo, which is chemically very similar to Tyrian purple, behaves similarly. See: http://www.indigopage.com/chemistry.htm</ref>\n<blockquote>The most favourable season for taking these [shellfish] is after the rising of the [[Sirius|Dog-star]], or else before spring; for when they have once discharged their waxy secretion, their juices have no consistency: this, however, is a fact unknown in the dyers' workshops, although it is a point of primary importance. After it is taken, the vein [i.e. hypobranchial gland] is extracted, which we have previously spoken of, to which it is requisite to add salt, a sextarius [about 20&nbsp;fl.&nbsp;oz.] to every hundred pounds of juice. It is sufficient to leave them to steep for a period of three days, and no more, for the fresher they are, the greater virtue there is in the liquor. It is then set to boil in vessels of tin [or lead], and every hundred amphorae ought to be boiled down to five hundred pounds of dye, by the application of a moderate heat; for which purpose the vessel is placed at the end of a long funnel, which communicates with the furnace; while thus boiling, the liquor is skimmed from time to time, and with it the flesh, which necessarily adheres to the veins. About the tenth day, generally, the whole contents of the cauldron are in a liquefied state, upon which a fleece, from which the grease has been cleansed, is plunged into it by way of making trial; but until such time as the colour is found to satisfy the wishes of those preparing it, the liquor is still kept on the boil. The tint that inclines to red is looked upon as inferior to that which is of a blackish hue. The wool is left to lie in soak for five hours, and then, after carding it, it is thrown in again, until it has fully imbibed the colour.</blockquote>\n\nArchaeological data from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] indicate that the snails were collected in large vats and left to decompose. This produced a hideous stench that was actually mentioned by ancient authors. Not much is known about the subsequent steps, and the actual ancient method for mass-producing the two murex dyes has not yet been successfully reconstructed; this special \"blackish clotted blood\" colour, which was prized above all others, is believed to be achieved by double-dipping the cloth, once in the indigo dye of ''H.&nbsp;trunculus'' and once in the purple-red dye of ''B.&nbsp;brandaris''.<ref name=Pigments_WebExhibits/><ref name=Moorey1999 />\n[[File:Theodoor van Thulden - The Discovery of Purple.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Hercules' Dog Discovers Purple Dye|The Discovery of Purple by Hercules's Dog]]'' by [[Theodoor van Thulden]], c. 1636]]\nThe Roman [[mythographer]] [[Julius Pollux]], writing in the 2nd&nbsp;century&nbsp;CE, asserted (''Onomasticon'' I, 45\u201349) that the purple dye was first discovered by the philosopher Heracles of Tyre, or rather, by his dog, whose mouth was stained purple from chewing on snails along the coast at Tyre. This story was depicted by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] in his painting ''[[Hercules' Dog Discovers Purple Dye]]''. According to [[John Malalas]], the incident happened during the reign of the legendary [[Phoenix (son of Agenor)|King Phoenix of Tyre]], the eponymous progenitor of the Phoenicians, and therefore he was the first ruler to wear Tyrian purple and legislate on its use.<ref>John Malalas, ''Chronographia'' II:9.</ref>\n\nRecently, the archaeological discovery of substantial numbers of Murex shells on [[Crete]] suggests that the [[Minoans]] may have pioneered the extraction of Imperial purple centuries before the Tyrians.

David Jacoby concludes that \"no Byzantine emperor nor any Latin ruler in former Byzantine territories could muster the financial resources required for the pursuit of murex purple production. On the other hand, murex fishing and dyeing with genuine purple are attested for Egypt in the tenth to 13th centuries.\"<ref>Jacoby (2004), p.&nbsp;210.</ref> By contrast, Jacoby finds that there are no mentions of purple fishing or dyeing, nor trade in the colorant in any Western source, even in the Frankish Levant. The European West turned instead to [[vermilion]] provided by the insect ''[[Kermes vermilio]]'', known as ''grana'', or [[crimson]].\n\nIn 1909, Harvard anthropologist [[Zelia Nuttall]] compiled an intensive comparative study on the historical production of the purple dye produced from the carnivorous [[murex snail]], source of the [[royal purple]] dye valued higher than gold in the ancient Near East and ancient Mexico.  Not only did the people of ancient Mexico use the same methods of production as the Phoenicians, they also valued murex-dyed cloth above all others, as it appeared in codices as the attire of nobility. \"Nuttall noted that the Mexican murex-dyed cloth bore a \"disagreeable \u2026 strong fishy smell, which appears to be as lasting as the color itself.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Nutall |first=Zelia |chapter=A curious survival in Mexico of the use of the Purpura shell-fish for dyeing |editor-last=Boas |editor-first=F. |title=Anthropological Essays Presented to Fredrick Ward Putnam in Honor of his Seventieth Birthday, by his Friends and Associates |publisher=G.

Thus \"colleagues\" are literally \"persons who have been selected to work together\". In [[ancient Rome]] a ''[[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'' was a\n\"body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild\".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.107</ref> Thus a college was a form of [[corporation]] or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, for example in [[chantry chapel]]s; modern survivals include the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the [[College of Arms]] in London (a body of [[herald]]s enforcing heraldic law), an [[electoral college]] (to elect representatives), etc., all groups of persons \"selected in common\" to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch, founder or other person in authority. As for the modern \"college of education\", it was a body created for that purpose, for example [[Eton College]] was founded in 1440 by [[letters patent]] of King Henry VI for the constitution of a college ''of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men, with one master or governor'', whose duty it shall be to instruct these scholars and any others who may resort thither from any part of England in the knowledge of letters, and especially of grammar, without payment\".<ref>Cust, Lionel, ''History of Eton College'', 1899, p.5[https://archive.org/stream/historyofetoncol00custuoft/historyofetoncol00custuoft_djvu.txt]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Higher education===\n[[File:Strand102.jpg|thumb|upright|[[King's College London]], established by a [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the [[University of London]].]]\nWithin higher education, the term can be used to refer to:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/college_1|title=college noun (EDUCATION)|work=Cambridge Dictionary Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904005447/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/college_1|archivedate=4 September 2011}}</ref>\n* A constituent part of a [[collegiate university]], for example [[King's College, Cambridge]], or of a federal university, for example [[King's College London]].\n*A [[liberal arts college]], an independent institution of higher education focusing on undergraduate education, such as [[Williams College]] or [[Amherst College]].\n* A liberal arts division of a university whose undergraduate program does not otherwise follow a liberal arts model, such as the [[Yuanpei College]] at [[Peking University]].\n* An [[institute]] providing specialised training, such as a college of [[further education]], for example [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], a teacher training college, or an art college.\n* In the [[United States]], college is sometimes but rarely a synonym for a research university, such as [[Dartmouth College]], one of the eight universities in the [[Ivy League].\n\n===Further education===\n{{main|Sixth form college}}\nA [[sixth form college]] or [[college of further education]] is an educational institution in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Belize]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Malta]], [[Norway]], [[Brunei]], or [[Southern Africa]], among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]], [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]], HND or its equivalent and the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]], or school-level qualifications such as [[GCSEs]].

[[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Cranbrook School, Sydney]] and [[The King's School, Parramatta]] are considered colleges.\n\nThere has also been a recent trend to rename or create government [[secondary schools]] as \"colleges\". In the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], some state high schools are referred to as ''secondary colleges'', although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in [[Melbourne]] is still named [[Melbourne High School]]. In Western Australia, South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], \"college\" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In [[New South Wales]], some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as \"secondary colleges\". In [[Queensland]] some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled ''state college'', but state schools offering only secondary education are called \"State High School\". In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], \"college\" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, \"college\" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of ''matriculation college''.\n\nIn a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called \"collegiates\" or \"[[collegiate institutes]]\" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word \"college\" which avoids the usual \"post-secondary\" connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as [[Upper Canada College]], [[Vancouver College]]) choose to use the word \"college\" in their names nevertheless.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp Private Elementary and Secondary Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109045046/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp |date=9 January 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014enter \"college\" in the \"name contains\" field and check the \"secondary\" checkbox</ref> Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word \"college\" or \"collegiate\" in their names.<ref>[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=8 September 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014click \"Secondary\" and \"Separate\"</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand the word \"college\" normally refers to a secondary school for ages 13 to 17 and \"college\" appears as part of the name especially of private or integrated schools. \"Colleges\" most frequently appear in the North Island, whereas \"high schools\" are more common in the South Island.\n\n[[File:St Johns College Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|[[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College, Johannesburg]], a [[Single-sex education|boys' school]] in [[South Africa]].]]\n\nIn South Africa, some secondary schools, especially private schools on the English public school model, have \"college\" in their title. Thus no less than six of South Africa's Elite Seven high schools call themselves \"college\" and fit this description. A typical example of this category would be [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College]].\n\nPrivate schools that specialize in improving children's marks through intensive focus on examination needs are informally called \"cram-colleges\".\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] the word \"college\" (known as ''Vidyalaya'' in ''[[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]'') normally refers to a secondary school, which usually signifies above the 5th standard. During the British colonial period a limited number of exclusive secondary schools were established based on English public school model ([[Royal College Colombo]], [[S. Thomas' College|S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]], [[Trinity College, Kandy]]) these along with several Catholic schools ([[St. Joseph's College, Colombo]], [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy|St Anthony's College]]) traditionally carry their name as colleges. Following the start of free education in 1931 large group of [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas|central colleges]] were established to educate the rural masses. Since Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948, many schools that have been established have been named as \"college\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal College Colombo]], a [[Single-sex education|boys' school]] located in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]].]]\n\nAs well as an educational institution, the term can also refer, following its etymology, to any formal group of colleagues set up under statute or regulation; often under a Royal Charter. Examples are an [[electoral college]], the [[College of Arms]], a [[College (canon law)|college of canons]], and the [[College of Cardinals]]. Other collegiate bodies include professional associations, particularly in medicine and allied professions. In the UK these include the [[Royal College of Nursing]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. Examples in the United States include the [[American College of Physicians]], the [[American College of Surgeons]], and the American College of Dentists. An example in Australia is the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]].\n\n==College by country==\n{{See also|Category:Higher education by country}}\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia a college may be an institution of tertiary education that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger universities.\n\nReferring to parts of a university, there are ''residential colleges'' which provide residence for students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, called [[University college#Australia|university colleges]]. These colleges often provide additional tutorial assistance, and some host [[theology|theological]] study. Many colleges have strong traditions and rituals, so are a combination of dormitory style accommodation and fraternity or sorority culture.\n\nMost technical and further education institutions ([[TAFE]]s), which offer certificate and diploma vocational courses, are styled \"TAFE colleges\" or \"Colleges of TAFE\".\n\nSome senior high schools are also referred to as colleges.\n\n===Canada===\n{{tone|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{Main|College (Canada)}}\nIn Canadian English, the term \"college\" usually refers to a trades school, applied arts/science/technology/business/health school or [[Community college#Canada|community college]]. These are [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], diplomas, [[associate's degree]], and in some cases [[bachelor's degree]]s. In [[Quebec]], the term is seldom used; with the French acronym for public colleges, [[CEGEP]] (''Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel'', \"college of general and professional education\") is more commonly used. CEGEP is a [[College education in Quebec|collegiate level]] institutions in Quebec, that a student typically enrols in if they wish to continue onto university in the [[Education in Quebec|Quebec education system]].{{notetag|Exceptions are made for \"mature\" student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least 2 years}}, or to learn a trade. In [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]], there are also institutions which are designated [[university college]]s, as they only grant undergraduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not.\n\nIn Canada, there is a strong distinction between \"college\" and \"university\". In conversation, one specifically would say either \"they are going to university\" (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or \"they are going to college\" (i.e., studying at a technical/career training).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Usage in a university setting====\nThe term ''college'' also applies to distinct entities that formally act as an affiliated institution of the university, formally referred to as [[federated school|federated college]], or affiliated colleges. A university may also formally include several constituent colleges, forming a [[collegiate university]]. Examples of collegiate universities in Canada include [[Trent University]], and the [[University of Toronto]]. These types of institutions act independently, maintaining their own endowments, and properties. However, they remain either affiliated, or federated with the overarching university, with the overarching university being the institution that formally grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]]. Several centralized universities in Canada have mimicked the collegiate university model; although constituent colleges in a centralized university remains under the authority of the central administration. Centralized universities that have adopted the collegiate model to a degree includes the University of British Columbia, with [[Green College, University of British Columbia|Green College]] and [[St. John's College, University of British Columbia|St. John's College]]; and the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], with [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]].\n\nOccasionally, \"college\" refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither ''federated'' nor ''affiliated''\u2014College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |title=College of Biological Science |publisher=University of Guelph |accessdate=19 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626040312/http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |archivedate=26 June 2010}}</ref> among others.\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is a [[military college]] which trains officers for the [[Canadian Armed Forces]]. The institution is a full-fledged university, with the authority to issue graduate degrees, although it continues to word the term ''college'' in its name. The institution's sister schools, [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] also uses the term college in its name, although it academic offering is akin to a CEGEP institution in Quebec. A number of post-secondary [[art schools]] in Canada formerly used the word ''college'' in their names, despite formally being universities. However, most of these institutions were renamed, or re-branded in the early 21st century, omitting the word ''college'' from its name.\n\n====Usage in secondary education====\nThe word ''college'' continues to be used in the names public [[separate school|separate]] secondary schools in Ontario.<ref>[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=2009-09-08 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014click \"Secondary\" and \"Separate\"</ref> A number of [[independent school]]s across Canada also use the word ''college'' in its name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouver.cdncompanies.com/other/canada-capstone-college-vancouver/|title=Canada Capstone College \u2013 Opening hours \u2013 360 Robson Street, Vancouver, British Columbia \u2013 Customer Reviews {{!}} Canada Online|website=vancouver.cdncompanies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref>\n\nPublic [[secular education|secular]] school boards in Ontario also refer to their secondary schools as ''[[collegiate institute]]s''. However, usage of the word ''collegiate institute'' varies between school boards. ''Collegiate institute'' is the predominant name for secondary schools in [[Lakehead District School Board]], and [[Toronto District School Board]], although most school boards in Ontario use ''collegiate institute'' alongside ''high school'', and ''secondary school'' in the names of their institutions. Similarly, secondary schools in Regina, and Saskatoon are referred to as ''Collegiate''.\n\n===Chile===\nIn Chile, the term \"college\" is usually used in the name of some bilingual schools, like [[Santiago College]], [[Saint George's College, Santiago|Saint George's College]] etc.\nSince 2009 the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] incorporated college as a bachelor's degree, it has a Bachelor of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, a Bachelor of Social Science and a Bachelor of Arts and Humanities.

Portuguese?-->\n\nIn India, the term \"college\" is commonly reserved for institutions that offer high school diplomas at year 12 (\"''Junior College''\", similar to American ''high schools''), and those that offer the [[bachelor's degree]]; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to [[PhD]] level. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university. Colleges may be either Autonomous or non-autonomous.  Autonomous Colleges are empowered to establish their own syllabus, and conduct and assess their own examinations; in non-autonomous colleges, examinations are conducted by the university, at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges, often a large number.\n\nThe first liberal arts and sciences college in India was [[C. M. S. College Kottayam]], Kerala, established in 1817, and the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], also 1817, initially known as Hindu College. The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was [[Serampore College]] (1818). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] (1830). The first commerce and economics college in India was [[Sydenham College]], [[Mumbai]] (1913).\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[File:Trinity college front square cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Parliament Square, [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].]]\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term \"college\" is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. University students often say they attend \"college\" rather than \"university\". Until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.\n\nThere are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word \"college\" in their names: these are either older, private schools (such as [[Belvedere College]], [[Gonzaga College]], [[Castleknock College]], and [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]) or what were formerly a particular kind of secondary school. These secondary schools, formerly known as \"technical colleges,\" were renamed \"community colleges,\" but remain secondary schools.\n\nThe country's only [[ancient university]] is the [[University of Dublin]]. Created during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of [[Trinity College Dublin]] today; although both are usually considered one and the same, the university and college are completely distinct corporate entities with separate and parallel governing structures.\n\nAmong more modern foundations, the [[National University of Ireland]], founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities \u2013 institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] and the creation of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and [[Queen's University Belfast]].\n\nThe state's two new universities, [[Dublin City University]] and [[University of Limerick]], were initially [[National Institute for Higher Education]] institutions. These institutions offered university level academic degrees and research from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this.\n\nThird level technical education in the state has been carried out in the [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have ''delegated authority'' which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI) in their own names.\n\nA number of private colleges exist such as [[Dublin Business School]], providing undergraduate and postgraduate courses validated by QQI and in some cases by other universities.\n\nOther types of college include colleges of education, such as the [[Church of Ireland College of Education]]. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both undergraduate and postgraduate academic degrees for people who want to train as teachers.\n\nA number of state-funded further education colleges exist \u2013 which offer vocational education and training in a range of areas from business studies and [[information and communications technology]] to sports injury therapy. These courses are usually one, two or less often three years in duration and are validated by QQI at Levels 5 or 6, or for the BTEC [[Higher National Diploma]] award, which is a Level 6/7 qualification, validated by [[Edexcel]]. There are numerous private colleges (particularly in Dublin and Limerick){{citation needed|reason=need support limiting density to these two cities|date=November 2012}} which offer both further and higher education qualifications. These degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications at Levels 6, 7 and 8.\n\n===Israel===\n{{Main|List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges}}\nIn Israel, any non university higher-learning facility is called a college. Institutions accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] (CHE) to confer a bachelor's degree are called \"Academic Colleges.\"<ref>Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 Mikhlala; pl. \u05de\u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea Mikhlalot</ref> These colleges (at least 4 for 2012) may also offer master's degrees and act as Research facilities.

This educational facility is mostly used to provide basic training for low tech jobs and for job seekers without any training that are provided by the nation's Employment Service ([[:he:\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4]]).\n\n===Macau===\nFollowing the Portuguese usage, the term \"college\" (''col\u00e9gio'') in [[Macau]] has traditionally been used in the names for private (and non-governmental) pre-university educational institutions, which correspond to form one to form six level tiers. Such schools are usually run by the Roman Catholic church or missionaries in Macau. Examples include [[Chan Sui Ki Perpetual Help College]], [[Yuet Wah College]], and Sacred Heart Canossian College.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:Universityofotagoclocktower small.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Otago]] in [[New Zealand]].]]\n\nThe constituent colleges of the former [[University of New Zealand]] (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of \"college\", particularly at the [[University of Otago]] (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as \"Teacher-training colleges\" now style themselves \"College of education\".\n\nSome universities, such as the [[University of Canterbury]], have divided their university into constituent administrative \"Colleges\" \u2013 the College of Arts containing departments that teach Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Science containing Science departments, and so on. This is largely modelled on the Cambridge model, discussed above.\n\nLike the United Kingdom some professional bodies in New Zealand style themselves as \"colleges\", for example, the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]].\n\nIn some parts of the country, secondary school is often referred to as college and the term is used interchangeably with high school. This sometimes confuses people from other parts of New Zealand. But in all parts of the country many secondary schools have \"College\" in their name, such as [[Rangitoto College]], New Zealand's largest secondary.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main|Higher education in the Philippines}}\nIn the Philippines, colleges usually refer to institutions of learning that grant degrees but whose scholastic fields are not as diverse as that of a university ([[University of Santo Tomas]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[Far Eastern University]], and [[AMA University]]), such as the [[San Beda College]] which specializes in law, [[AMA Computer College]] whose campuses are spread all over the Philippines which specializes in information and computing technologies, and the [[Map\u00faa Institute of Technology]] which specializes in engineering, or to component units within universities that do not grant degrees but rather facilitate the instruction of a particular field, such as a College of Science and College of Engineering, among many other colleges of the [[University of the Philippines]].\n\nA state college may not have the word \"college\" on its name, but may have several component colleges, or departments. Thus, the Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology is a state college by classification.\n\nUsually, the term \"college\" is also thought of as a hierarchical demarcation between the term \"university\", and quite a number of colleges seek to be recognized as universities as a sign of improvement in academic standards ([[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], [[San Beda College]]), and increase in the diversity of the offered degree programs (called \"courses\"). For private colleges, this may be done through a survey and evaluation by the Commission on Higher Education and accrediting organizations, as was the case of Urios College which is now the [[Fr. Saturnino Urios University]]. For state colleges, it is usually done by a legislation by the Congress or Senate. In common usage, \"going to college\" simply means attending school for an undergraduate degree, whether it's from an institution recognized as a college or a university.\n\nWhen it comes to referring to the level of education, ''college'' is the term more used to be synonymous to tertiary or higher education. A student who is or has studied his/her undergraduate degree at either an institution with ''college'' or ''university'' in its name is considered to be going to or have gone to ''college''.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|Education in Portugal}}\nPresently in [[Portugal]], the term ''col\u00e9gio'' (college) is normally used as a generic reference to a private (non-government) school that provides from [[basic education|basic]] to [[secondary education]]. Many of the private schools include the term ''col\u00e9gio'' in their name. Some special public schools \u2013 usually of the boarding school type \u2013 also include the term in their name, with a notable example being the ''[[Col\u00e9gio Militar]]'' (Military College). The term ''col\u00e9gio interno'' (literally \"internal college\") is used specifically as a generic reference to a [[boarding school]].\n\nUntil the 19th century, a ''col\u00e9gio'' was usually a secondary or pre-university school, of public or religious nature, where the students usually lived together. A model for these colleges was the Royal College of Arts and Humanities, founded in [[Coimbra]] by King [[John III of Portugal]] in 1542.\n\n===Singapore===\nThe term \"college\" in [[Singapore]] is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called \"Junior Colleges\", which provide the final two years of secondary education (equivalent to sixth form in British terms or grades 11\u201312 in the American system). Since 1 January 2005, the term also refers to the three campuses of the [[Institute of Technical Education]] with the introduction of the \"collegiate system\", in which the three institutions are called [[ITE College East]], [[ITE College Central]], and [[ITE College West]] respectively.\n\nThe term \"university\" is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called \"[[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]\", while other institutions are often referred to as \"institutes\" and so forth.\n\n===South Africa===\nAlthough the term \"college\" is hardly used in any context at any university in South Africa, some non-university tertiary institutions call themselves colleges. These include teacher training colleges, business colleges and wildlife management colleges. See: [[List of universities in South Africa#Private colleges and universities]]; [[List of post secondary institutions in South Africa]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThere are several professional and vocational institutions that offer post-secondary education without granting degrees that are referred to as \"colleges\". This includes the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], the many Technical Colleges and Teaching Colleges.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:A view of Birkbeck, University of London.jpg|[[Birkbeck, University of London]]|thumb]]\n\n====Secondary education and further education====\n\nFurther education (FE) colleges and [[sixth form college]]s are institutions providing further education to students over 16. Some of these also provide higher education courses (see below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/further-education-institutions/|title=Further education \u2013 Colleges and other institutions|website=Education UK|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119035610/http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/further-education-institutions/|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref> In the context of secondary education, 'college' is used in the names of some private schools, e.g. [[Eton College]] and [[Winchester College]].\n\n====Higher education====\n\n{{See also|Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|Residential college|University college#United Kingdom}}\n\nIn higher education, a college is normally a provider that does not hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a [[collegiate university|collegiate or federal university]] or a grouping of academic [[faculty (division)|faculties]] or departments within a university. Traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, but this is no longer the case with [[Newcastle College#NCG|NCG]] having gained taught degree awarding powers (the same as some universities) on behalf of its colleges,<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcastle education group to become first in the country to award its own degree courses|date=29 June 2016|work=ChronicleLive|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|author=Keiran Southern|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918192508/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|archivedate=18 September 2016}}</ref> and many of the [[colleges of the University of London]] holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. Most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.\n\nIn England, {{as of|2016|August|lc=y}}, over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by [[HEFCE]] (208/340) are sixth-form or further education colleges, often termed colleges of further and higher education, along with 17 colleges of the University of London, one [[university college]], 100 universities, and 14 other providers (six of which use 'college' in their name). Overall, this means over two thirds of state-supported higher education providers in England are colleges of one form or another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/search/Overview|title=Overview|website=Register of HE providers|publisher=[[HEFCE]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903141438/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/search/Overview|archivedate=3 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/getthedata/|title=Get the data|website=Register of HE providers|publisher=[[HEFCE]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911010828/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/getthedata/|archivedate=11 September 2016}}</ref> Many private providers are also called colleges, e.g. the [[New College of the Humanities]] and [[St Patrick's College, London]].\n\nColleges within universities vary immensely in their responsibilities. The large constituent colleges of the [[University of London]] are effectively universities in their own right; colleges in some universities, including those of the [[University of the Arts London]] and smaller colleges of the [[University of London]], run their own degree courses but do not award degrees; those at the [[University of Roehampton]] provide accommodation and pastoral care as well as delivering the teaching on university courses; those at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] deliver some teaching on university courses as well as providing accommodation and pastoral care; and those in [[Durham University|Durham]], [[University of Kent|Kent]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] and [[University of York|York]] provide accommodation and pastoral care but do not normally participate in formal teaching. The legal status of these colleges also varies widely, with University of London colleges being independent corporations and recognised bodies, Oxbridge colleges, colleges of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]] (UHI) and some Durham colleges being independent corporations and listed bodies, most Durham colleges being owned by the university but still listed bodies, and those of other collegiate universities not having formal recognition. When applying for undergraduate courses through [[UCAS]], University of London colleges are treated as independent providers, colleges of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and UHI are treated as locations within the universities that can be selected by specifying a 'campus code' in addition to selecting the university, and colleges of other universities are not recognised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ucas.com|title=Search courses|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826142005/http://search.ucas.com/|archivedate=26 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/news/2004-durham-colleges|title=The Collegiate System at the University of Durham|author=R.

Americans \"go to college\" after [[High school (North America)|high school]], regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university. Some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. The word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.\n\nStudents must pay for college before taking classes. Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, or grants, or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree.

Two-year colleges, also known as [[junior college|junior]] or [[community college]]s, usually offer an [[associate's degree]], and four-year colleges usually offer a [[bachelor's degree]]. Often, these are entirely [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] institutions, although some have [[graduate school]] programs.\n\nFour-year institutions in the U.S. that emphasize a [[liberal arts]] curriculum are known as [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]. Until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Masci|first=David|title=Should colleges get back to basics?|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|series=CQ Researcher|date=1998}}</ref> These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.\n\nWhile there is no national standard in the United States, the term \"university\" primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and [[graduate education]]. A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a [[liberal arts]] curriculum, also culminating in a [[bachelor's degree]]. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is [[Vincennes University]], [[Indiana]], which is styled and chartered as a \"university\" even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as [[Dartmouth College]] and [[The College of William & Mary]], have retained the term \"college\" in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case, [[Boston College]] and [[Boston University]], the former located in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and the latter located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.\n\n[[File:BCburnslawnsunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boston College]]]]\nUsage of the terms varies among the states. In 1996 for example, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities, and all of its [[vocation]]al technology schools to [[Institute of technology|technical colleges]].\n\n[[File:Johnson Student Center and Freeman College Union.jpg|left|thumb|[[Occidental College]]]]\nThe terms \"university\" and \"college\" do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include \"Polytechnic\" ([[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]),  \"Institute of Technology\" ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]), \"academy\" ([[United States Military Academy]]), \"union\" ([[Cooper Union]]), \"conservatory\" ([[New England Conservatory]]), and \"school\" ([[Juilliard School]]). In colloquial use, they are still referred to as \"college\" when referring to their undergraduate studies.\n\nThe term ''college'' is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions, the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as '''the college''' (such as The [[College of the University of Chicago]], [[Harvard College]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], or [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) while at others, such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], each of the faculties may be called a \"college\" (the \"college of engineering\", the \"college of nursing\", and so forth). There exist other variants for historical reasons; for example, [[Duke University]], which was called Trinity College until the 1920s, still calls its main undergraduate subdivision [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]].\n\n====Residential colleges====\n[[File:Scripps College for Women-9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scripps College]]]]\nSome American universities, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] have established [[residential college]]s (sometimes, as at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the first to establish such a system in the 1930s, known as houses) along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/reading/morison-1936/|title=Samuel Eliot Morison on the Harvard Houses|work=The Collegiate Way|author=Robert J.

The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities \u2013 they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to \u2013 small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these \"colleges\" assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority\u2014for example, [[The College of William & Mary]] has a [[Royal Charter]] from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while [[Dartmouth College]] has a charter permitting it to award degrees \"as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.\"\n\n[[File:Agnes Scott College - Buttrick Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Agnes Scott College]]]]\nThe leaders of [[Harvard College]] (which granted America's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, few new colleges were founded there, and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term \"college\" had stuck and \"colleges\" have arisen across the United States.\n\nIn U.S. usage, the word \"college\" embodies not only a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in \"going to college\" or \"college savings accounts\" offered by banks.\n\nIn a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone. By comparison, the group says that's the equivalent of 39 percent of tuition and fees at a community college, and 14 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public university.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bidwell|first1=Allie|title=Report: High Textbook Prices Have College Students Struggling|website=U.S. News|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|accessdate=2015-02-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227180009/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Morrill Land-Grant Act====\n[[File:SUNY Purchase College.jpg|thumb|[[SUNY Purchase College]]]]\nIn addition to private colleges and universities, the U.S. also has a system of government funded, [[public university|public universities]]. Many were founded under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] of 1862.  A movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses, as \"...many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young Americans to receive some sort of advanced education.\"<ref name = \"enbkii\"/> The Morrill Act \"...made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens.\"<ref name=\"enbkii\" /> Its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country, specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/laws/history.html|title=A Land-Grant Institution|publisher=Dafvm.msstate.edu|date=11 August 2009|accessdate=14 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610150606/http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/laws/history.html|archivedate=10 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and to provide formal education in \"...agriculture, home economics, mechanical arts, and other professions that seemed practical at the time.\"<ref name=\"enbkii\">{{cite web|last=Lightcap|first=Brad|url= http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/morrill.html|website=ND.edu|title=The Morrill Act of 1862|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108111525/http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/morrill.html|archive-date=8 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually all states, to establish such institutions.

A student can complete secondary education (International General Certificate of Secondary Education, [[IGCSE]]) at 16 years and proceed straight to a poly-technical college or they can proceed to Advanced level (16 to 19 years) and obtain a General Certificate of Education ([[General Certificate of Education|GCE]]) certificate which enables them to enrol at a university, provided they have good grades.  Alternatively, with lower grades the GCE certificate holders will have an added advantage over their [[GCSE]] counterparts if they choose to enrol at a poly-technical college.

Thus \"colleagues\" are literally \"persons who have been selected to work together\". In [[ancient Rome]] a ''[[collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]]'' was a\n\"body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild\".<ref>Cassell's Latin Dictionary, Marchant, J.R.V, & Charles, Joseph F., (Eds.), Revised Edition, 1928, p.107</ref> Thus a college was a form of [[corporation]] or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, for example in [[chantry chapel]]s; modern survivals include the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the [[College of Arms]] in London (a body of [[herald]]s enforcing heraldic law), an [[electoral college]] (to elect representatives), etc., all groups of persons \"selected in common\" to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch, founder or other person in authority. As for the modern \"college of education\", it was a body created for that purpose, for example [[Eton College]] was founded in 1440 by [[letters patent]] of King Henry VI for the constitution of a college ''of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men, with one master or governor'', whose duty it shall be to instruct these scholars and any others who may resort thither from any part of England in the knowledge of letters, and especially of grammar, without payment\".<ref>Cust, Lionel, ''History of Eton College'', 1899, p.5[https://archive.org/stream/historyofetoncol00custuoft/historyofetoncol00custuoft_djvu.txt]</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n\n===Higher education===\n[[File:Strand102.jpg|thumb|upright|[[King's College London]], established by a [[Royal charter|Royal Charter]] in 1829, is one of the founding colleges of the [[University of London]].]]\nWithin higher education, the term can be used to refer to:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/college_1|title=college noun (EDUCATION)|work=Cambridge Dictionary Online|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904005447/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/college_1|archivedate=4 September 2011}}</ref>\n* A constituent part of a [[collegiate university]], for example [[King's College, Cambridge]], or of a federal university, for example [[King's College London]].\n*A [[liberal arts college]], an independent institution of higher education focusing on undergraduate education, such as [[Williams College]] or [[Amherst College]].\n* A liberal arts division of a university whose undergraduate program does not otherwise follow a liberal arts model, such as the [[Yuanpei College]] at [[Peking University]].\n* An [[institute]] providing specialised training, such as a college of [[further education]], for example [[Belfast Metropolitan College]], a teacher training college, or an art college.\n* In the [[United States]], college is sometimes but rarely a synonym for a research university, such as [[Dartmouth College]], one of the eight universities in the [[Ivy League].\n\n===Further education===\n{{main|Sixth form college}}\nA [[sixth form college]] or [[college of further education]] is an educational institution in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Belize]], the [[Caribbean]], [[Malta]], [[Norway]], [[Brunei]], or [[Southern Africa]], among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]], [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]], HND or its equivalent and the [[International Baccalaureate Diploma]], or school-level qualifications such as [[GCSEs]].

[[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Cranbrook School, Sydney]] and [[The King's School, Parramatta]] are considered colleges.\n\nThere has also been a recent trend to rename or create government [[secondary schools]] as \"colleges\". In the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], some state high schools are referred to as ''secondary colleges'', although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in [[Melbourne]] is still named [[Melbourne High School]]. In Western Australia, South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], \"college\" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In [[New South Wales]], some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as \"secondary colleges\". In [[Queensland]] some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled ''state college'', but state schools offering only secondary education are called \"State High School\". In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], \"college\" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, \"college\" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of ''matriculation college''.\n\nIn a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called \"collegiates\" or \"[[collegiate institutes]]\" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word \"college\" which avoids the usual \"post-secondary\" connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as [[Upper Canada College]], [[Vancouver College]]) choose to use the word \"college\" in their names nevertheless.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp Private Elementary and Secondary Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109045046/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp |date=9 January 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014enter \"college\" in the \"name contains\" field and check the \"secondary\" checkbox</ref> Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word \"college\" or \"collegiate\" in their names.<ref>[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=8 September 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014click \"Secondary\" and \"Separate\"</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand the word \"college\" normally refers to a secondary school for ages 13 to 17 and \"college\" appears as part of the name especially of private or integrated schools. \"Colleges\" most frequently appear in the North Island, whereas \"high schools\" are more common in the South Island.\n\n[[File:St Johns College Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|[[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College, Johannesburg]], a [[Single-sex education|boys' school]] in [[South Africa]].]]\n\nIn South Africa, some secondary schools, especially private schools on the English public school model, have \"college\" in their title. Thus no less than six of South Africa's Elite Seven high schools call themselves \"college\" and fit this description. A typical example of this category would be [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College]].\n\nPrivate schools that specialize in improving children's marks through intensive focus on examination needs are informally called \"cram-colleges\".\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] the word \"college\" (known as ''Vidyalaya'' in ''[[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]'') normally refers to a secondary school, which usually signifies above the 5th standard. During the British colonial period a limited number of exclusive secondary schools were established based on English public school model ([[Royal College Colombo]], [[S. Thomas' College|S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]], [[Trinity College, Kandy]]) these along with several Catholic schools ([[St. Joseph's College, Colombo]], [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy|St Anthony's College]]) traditionally carry their name as colleges. Following the start of free education in 1931 large group of [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas|central colleges]] were established to educate the rural masses. Since Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948, many schools that have been established have been named as \"college\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal College Colombo]], a [[Single-sex education|boys' school]] located in [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka]].]]\n\nAs well as an educational institution, the term can also refer, following its etymology, to any formal group of colleagues set up under statute or regulation; often under a Royal Charter. Examples are an [[electoral college]], the [[College of Arms]], a [[College (canon law)|college of canons]], and the [[College of Cardinals]]. Other collegiate bodies include professional associations, particularly in medicine and allied professions. In the UK these include the [[Royal College of Nursing]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. Examples in the United States include the [[American College of Physicians]], the [[American College of Surgeons]], and the American College of Dentists. An example in Australia is the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]].\n\n==College by country==\n{{See also|Category:Higher education by country}}\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia a college may be an institution of tertiary education that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger universities.\n\nReferring to parts of a university, there are ''residential colleges'' which provide residence for students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, called [[University college#Australia|university colleges]]. These colleges often provide additional tutorial assistance, and some host [[theology|theological]] study. Many colleges have strong traditions and rituals, so are a combination of dormitory style accommodation and fraternity or sorority culture.\n\nMost technical and further education institutions ([[TAFE]]s), which offer certificate and diploma vocational courses, are styled \"TAFE colleges\" or \"Colleges of TAFE\".\n\nSome senior high schools are also referred to as colleges.\n\n===Canada===\n{{tone|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{Main|College (Canada)}}\nIn Canadian English, the term \"college\" usually refers to a trades school, applied arts/science/technology/business/health school or [[Community college#Canada|community college]]. These are [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], diplomas, [[associate's degree]], and in some cases [[bachelor's degree]]s. In [[Quebec]], the term is seldom used; with the French acronym for public colleges, [[CEGEP]] (''Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel'', \"college of general and professional education\") is more commonly used. CEGEP is a [[College education in Quebec|collegiate level]] institutions in Quebec, that a student typically enrols in if they wish to continue onto university in the [[Education in Quebec|Quebec education system]].{{notetag|Exceptions are made for \"mature\" student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least 2 years}}, or to learn a trade. In [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]], there are also institutions which are designated [[university college]]s, as they only grant undergraduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not.\n\nIn Canada, there is a strong distinction between \"college\" and \"university\". In conversation, one specifically would say either \"they are going to university\" (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or \"they are going to college\" (i.e., studying at a technical/career training).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n====Usage in a university setting====\nThe term ''college'' also applies to distinct entities that formally act as an affiliated institution of the university, formally referred to as [[federated school|federated college]], or affiliated colleges. A university may also formally include several constituent colleges, forming a [[collegiate university]]. Examples of collegiate universities in Canada include [[Trent University]], and the [[University of Toronto]]. These types of institutions act independently, maintaining their own endowments, and properties. However, they remain either affiliated, or federated with the overarching university, with the overarching university being the institution that formally grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]]. Several centralized universities in Canada have mimicked the collegiate university model; although constituent colleges in a centralized university remains under the authority of the central administration. Centralized universities that have adopted the collegiate model to a degree includes the University of British Columbia, with [[Green College, University of British Columbia|Green College]] and [[St. John's College, University of British Columbia|St. John's College]]; and the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], with [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]].\n\nOccasionally, \"college\" refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither ''federated'' nor ''affiliated''\u2014College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |title=College of Biological Science |publisher=University of Guelph |accessdate=19 June 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626040312/http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |archivedate=26 June 2010}}</ref> among others.\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]] is a [[military college]] which trains officers for the [[Canadian Armed Forces]]. The institution is a full-fledged university, with the authority to issue graduate degrees, although it continues to word the term ''college'' in its name. The institution's sister schools, [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] also uses the term college in its name, although it academic offering is akin to a CEGEP institution in Quebec. A number of post-secondary [[art schools]] in Canada formerly used the word ''college'' in their names, despite formally being universities. However, most of these institutions were renamed, or re-branded in the early 21st century, omitting the word ''college'' from its name.\n\n====Usage in secondary education====\nThe word ''college'' continues to be used in the names public [[separate school|separate]] secondary schools in Ontario.<ref>[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=2009-09-08 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014click \"Secondary\" and \"Separate\"</ref> A number of [[independent school]]s across Canada also use the word ''college'' in its name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouver.cdncompanies.com/other/canada-capstone-college-vancouver/|title=Canada Capstone College \u2013 Opening hours \u2013 360 Robson Street, Vancouver, British Columbia \u2013 Customer Reviews {{!}} Canada Online|website=vancouver.cdncompanies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref>\n\nPublic [[secular education|secular]] school boards in Ontario also refer to their secondary schools as ''[[collegiate institute]]s''. However, usage of the word ''collegiate institute'' varies between school boards. ''Collegiate institute'' is the predominant name for secondary schools in [[Lakehead District School Board]], and [[Toronto District School Board]], although most school boards in Ontario use ''collegiate institute'' alongside ''high school'', and ''secondary school'' in the names of their institutions. Similarly, secondary schools in Regina, and Saskatoon are referred to as ''Collegiate''.\n\n===Chile===\nIn Chile, the term \"college\" is usually used in the name of some bilingual schools, like [[Santiago College]], [[Saint George's College, Santiago|Saint George's College]] etc.\nSince 2009 the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]] incorporated college as a bachelor's degree, it has a Bachelor of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, a Bachelor of Social Science and a Bachelor of Arts and Humanities. It has the same system as the American universities, it combines majors and minors. And it let the students continue a higher degree in the same university once finished.\n\n===Greece===\n'''''Kollegio''''' (in [[Greek language|Greek]] \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bf) refers to the Centers of Post-Lyceum Education (in Greek \u039a\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf \u039c\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03c5\u03ba\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03ba\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, abbreviated as KEME), which are principally private and belong to the Greek post-secondary education system.

Many older secondary schools have the term 'college' as part of their names.\n\n===India===\n{{See also|Colleges and institutes in India}}\n\nThe modern system of education was heavily influenced by the British starting in 1835.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://latasinha.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/impact-of-modern-education-on-the-culture-of-india/|title=Influence of modern education on the culture of India|date=14 March 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730041305/https://latasinha.wordpress.com/2010/03/14/impact-of-modern-education-on-the-culture-of-india/|archivedate=30 July 2017}}</ref><!--notice that this date doesn't really explain Karala's claim of 1817 below. Portuguese?-->\n\nIn India, the term \"college\" is commonly reserved for institutions that offer high school diplomas at year 12 (\"''Junior College''\", similar to American ''high schools''), and those that offer the [[bachelor's degree]]; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to [[PhD]] level. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university. Colleges may be either Autonomous or non-autonomous.  Autonomous Colleges are empowered to establish their own syllabus, and conduct and assess their own examinations; in non-autonomous colleges, examinations are conducted by the university, at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges, often a large number.\n\nThe first liberal arts and sciences college in India was [[C. M. S. College Kottayam]], Kerala, established in 1817, and the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], also 1817, initially known as Hindu College. The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was [[Serampore College]] (1818). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] (1830). The first commerce and economics college in India was [[Sydenham College]], [[Mumbai]] (1913).\n\n===Ireland===\n{{See also|Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland}}\n[[File:Trinity college front square cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Parliament Square, [[Trinity College, Dublin]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].]]\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term \"college\" is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. University students often say they attend \"college\" rather than \"university\". Until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.\n\nThere are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word \"college\" in their names: these are either older, private schools (such as [[Belvedere College]], [[Gonzaga College]], [[Castleknock College]], and [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]) or what were formerly a particular kind of secondary school. These secondary schools, formerly known as \"technical colleges,\" were renamed \"community colleges,\" but remain secondary schools.\n\nThe country's only [[ancient university]] is the [[University of Dublin]]. Created during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of [[Trinity College Dublin]] today; although both are usually considered one and the same, the university and college are completely distinct corporate entities with separate and parallel governing structures.\n\nAmong more modern foundations, the [[National University of Ireland]], founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities \u2013 institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] and the creation of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and [[Queen's University Belfast]].\n\nThe state's two new universities, [[Dublin City University]] and [[University of Limerick]], were initially [[National Institute for Higher Education]] institutions. These institutions offered university level academic degrees and research from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this.\n\nThird level technical education in the state has been carried out in the [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have ''delegated authority'' which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI) in their own names.\n\nA number of private colleges exist such as [[Dublin Business School]], providing undergraduate and postgraduate courses validated by QQI and in some cases by other universities.\n\nOther types of college include colleges of education, such as the [[Church of Ireland College of Education]]. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both undergraduate and postgraduate academic degrees for people who want to train as teachers.\n\nA number of state-funded further education colleges exist \u2013 which offer vocational education and training in a range of areas from business studies and [[information and communications technology]] to sports injury therapy. These courses are usually one, two or less often three years in duration and are validated by QQI at Levels 5 or 6, or for the BTEC [[Higher National Diploma]] award, which is a Level 6/7 qualification, validated by [[Edexcel]]. There are numerous private colleges (particularly in Dublin and Limerick){{citation needed|reason=need support limiting density to these two cities|date=November 2012}} which offer both further and higher education qualifications. These degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications at Levels 6, 7 and 8.\n\n===Israel===\n{{Main|List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges}}\nIn Israel, any non university higher-learning facility is called a college. Institutions accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] (CHE) to confer a bachelor's degree are called \"Academic Colleges.\"<ref>Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 Mikhlala; pl. \u05de\u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea Mikhlalot</ref> These colleges (at least 4 for 2012) may also offer master's degrees and act as Research facilities.

This educational facility is mostly used to provide basic training for low tech jobs and for job seekers without any training that are provided by the nation's Employment Service ([[:he:\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4|\u05e9\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05ea\u05e2\u05e1\u05d5\u05e7\u05d4]]).\n\n===Macau===\nFollowing the Portuguese usage, the term \"college\" (''col\u00e9gio'') in [[Macau]] has traditionally been used in the names for private (and non-governmental) pre-university educational institutions, which correspond to form one to form six level tiers. Such schools are usually run by the Roman Catholic church or missionaries in Macau. Examples include [[Chan Sui Ki Perpetual Help College]], [[Yuet Wah College]], and Sacred Heart Canossian College.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:Universityofotagoclocktower small.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Otago]] in [[New Zealand]].]]\n\nThe constituent colleges of the former [[University of New Zealand]] (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of \"college\", particularly at the [[University of Otago]] (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as \"Teacher-training colleges\" now style themselves \"College of education\".\n\nSome universities, such as the [[University of Canterbury]], have divided their university into constituent administrative \"Colleges\" \u2013 the College of Arts containing departments that teach Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Science containing Science departments, and so on. This is largely modelled on the Cambridge model, discussed above.\n\nLike the United Kingdom some professional bodies in New Zealand style themselves as \"colleges\", for example, the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]].\n\nIn some parts of the country, secondary school is often referred to as college and the term is used interchangeably with high school. This sometimes confuses people from other parts of New Zealand. But in all parts of the country many secondary schools have \"College\" in their name, such as [[Rangitoto College]], New Zealand's largest secondary.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main|Higher education in the Philippines}}\nIn the Philippines, colleges usually refer to institutions of learning that grant degrees but whose scholastic fields are not as diverse as that of a university ([[University of Santo Tomas]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[Far Eastern University]], and [[AMA University]]), such as the [[San Beda College]] which specializes in law, [[AMA Computer College]] whose campuses are spread all over the Philippines which specializes in information and computing technologies, and the [[Map\u00faa Institute of Technology]] which specializes in engineering, or to component units within universities that do not grant degrees but rather facilitate the instruction of a particular field, such as a College of Science and College of Engineering, among many other colleges of the [[University of the Philippines]].\n\nA state college may not have the word \"college\" on its name, but may have several component colleges, or departments. Thus, the Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology is a state college by classification.\n\nUsually, the term \"college\" is also thought of as a hierarchical demarcation between the term \"university\", and quite a number of colleges seek to be recognized as universities as a sign of improvement in academic standards ([[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], [[San Beda College]]), and increase in the diversity of the offered degree programs (called \"courses\"). For private colleges, this may be done through a survey and evaluation by the Commission on Higher Education and accrediting organizations, as was the case of Urios College which is now the [[Fr. Saturnino Urios University]]. For state colleges, it is usually done by a legislation by the Congress or Senate. In common usage, \"going to college\" simply means attending school for an undergraduate degree, whether it's from an institution recognized as a college or a university.\n\nWhen it comes to referring to the level of education, ''college'' is the term more used to be synonymous to tertiary or higher education. A student who is or has studied his/her undergraduate degree at either an institution with ''college'' or ''university'' in its name is considered to be going to or have gone to ''college''.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|Education in Portugal}}\nPresently in [[Portugal]], the term ''col\u00e9gio'' (college) is normally used as a generic reference to a private (non-government) school that provides from [[basic education|basic]] to [[secondary education]]. Many of the private schools include the term ''col\u00e9gio'' in their name. Some special public schools \u2013 usually of the boarding school type \u2013 also include the term in their name, with a notable example being the ''[[Col\u00e9gio Militar]]'' (Military College). The term ''col\u00e9gio interno'' (literally \"internal college\") is used specifically as a generic reference to a [[boarding school]].\n\nUntil the 19th century, a ''col\u00e9gio'' was usually a secondary or pre-university school, of public or religious nature, where the students usually lived together. A model for these colleges was the Royal College of Arts and Humanities, founded in [[Coimbra]] by King [[John III of Portugal]] in 1542.\n\n===Singapore===\nThe term \"college\" in [[Singapore]] is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called \"Junior Colleges\", which provide the final two years of secondary education (equivalent to sixth form in British terms or grades 11\u201312 in the American system). Since 1 January 2005, the term also refers to the three campuses of the [[Institute of Technical Education]] with the introduction of the \"collegiate system\", in which the three institutions are called [[ITE College East]], [[ITE College Central]], and [[ITE College West]] respectively.\n\nThe term \"university\" is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called \"[[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]\", while other institutions are often referred to as \"institutes\" and so forth.\n\n===South Africa===\nAlthough the term \"college\" is hardly used in any context at any university in South Africa, some non-university tertiary institutions call themselves colleges. These include teacher training colleges, business colleges and wildlife management colleges. See: [[List of universities in South Africa#Private colleges and universities]]; [[List of post secondary institutions in South Africa]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThere are several professional and vocational institutions that offer post-secondary education without granting degrees that are referred to as \"colleges\". This includes the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], the many Technical Colleges and Teaching Colleges.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:A view of Birkbeck, University of London.jpg|[[Birkbeck, University of London]]|thumb]]\n\n====Secondary education and further education====\n\nFurther education (FE) colleges and [[sixth form college]]s are institutions providing further education to students over 16. Some of these also provide higher education courses (see below).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/further-education-institutions/|title=Further education \u2013 Colleges and other institutions|website=Education UK|publisher=[[British Council]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119035610/http://www.educationuk.org/global/articles/further-education-institutions/|archivedate=19 January 2017}}</ref> In the context of secondary education, 'college' is used in the names of some private schools, e.g. [[Eton College]] and [[Winchester College]].\n\n====Higher education====\n\n{{See also|Colleges within universities in the United Kingdom|Residential college|University college#United Kingdom}}\n\nIn higher education, a college is normally a provider that does not hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a [[collegiate university|collegiate or federal university]] or a grouping of academic [[faculty (division)|faculties]] or departments within a university. Traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, but this is no longer the case with [[Newcastle College#NCG|NCG]] having gained taught degree awarding powers (the same as some universities) on behalf of its colleges,<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcastle education group to become first in the country to award its own degree courses|date=29 June 2016|work=ChronicleLive|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|author=Keiran Southern|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918192508/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|archivedate=18 September 2016}}</ref> and many of the [[colleges of the University of London]] holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. Most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.\n\nIn England, {{as of|2016|August|lc=y}}, over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by [[HEFCE]] (208/340) are sixth-form or further education colleges, often termed colleges of further and higher education, along with 17 colleges of the University of London, one [[university college]], 100 universities, and 14 other providers (six of which use 'college' in their name). Overall, this means over two thirds of state-supported higher education providers in England are colleges of one form or another.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/search/Overview|title=Overview|website=Register of HE providers|publisher=[[HEFCE]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160903141438/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/search/Overview|archivedate=3 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/getthedata/|title=Get the data|website=Register of HE providers|publisher=[[HEFCE]]|accessdate=28 August 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911010828/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/reg/register/getthedata/|archivedate=11 September 2016}}</ref> Many private providers are also called colleges, e.g. the [[New College of the Humanities]] and [[St Patrick's College, London]].\n\nColleges within universities vary immensely in their responsibilities. The large constituent colleges of the [[University of London]] are effectively universities in their own right; colleges in some universities, including those of the [[University of the Arts London]] and smaller colleges of the [[University of London]], run their own degree courses but do not award degrees; those at the [[University of Roehampton]] provide accommodation and pastoral care as well as delivering the teaching on university courses; those at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] deliver some teaching on university courses as well as providing accommodation and pastoral care; and those in [[Durham University|Durham]], [[University of Kent|Kent]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] and [[University of York|York]] provide accommodation and pastoral care but do not normally participate in formal teaching. The legal status of these colleges also varies widely, with University of London colleges being independent corporations and recognised bodies, Oxbridge colleges, colleges of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]] (UHI) and some Durham colleges being independent corporations and listed bodies, most Durham colleges being owned by the university but still listed bodies, and those of other collegiate universities not having formal recognition.

Americans \"go to college\" after [[High school (North America)|high school]], regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university. Some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. The word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.\n\nStudents must pay for college before taking classes. Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, or grants, or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. For state-owned schools (called \"public\" universities), the subsidy was given to the college, with the student benefiting from lower tuition.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.air.org/focus-area/education/index.cfm?fa=viewContent&content_id=1288&id=6|title=Taxpayer Subsidies for Most Colleges and Universities Average Between $8,000 to More than $100,000 for Each Bachelor's Degree, New Study Finds|publisher=American Institutes for Research|date=12 May 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230231938/http://www.air.org/focus-area/education/index.cfm?fa=viewContent&content_id=1288&id=6|archivedate=30 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html|title=State Education Subsidies Shift Students to Public Universities|website=www.nber.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924104945/http://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html|archivedate=24 September 2017}}</ref> The state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/131372|title=Why Does Tuition Go Up?

Two-year colleges, also known as [[junior college|junior]] or [[community college]]s, usually offer an [[associate's degree]], and four-year colleges usually offer a [[bachelor's degree]]. Often, these are entirely [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] institutions, although some have [[graduate school]] programs.\n\nFour-year institutions in the U.S. that emphasize a [[liberal arts]] curriculum are known as [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]. Until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the United States.<ref>{{cite book|last=Masci|first=David|title=Should colleges get back to basics?|publisher=Congressional Quarterly|series=CQ Researcher|date=1998}}</ref> These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.\n\nWhile there is no national standard in the United States, the term \"university\" primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and [[graduate education]]. A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a [[liberal arts]] curriculum, also culminating in a [[bachelor's degree]]. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is [[Vincennes University]], [[Indiana]], which is styled and chartered as a \"university\" even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as [[Dartmouth College]] and [[The College of William & Mary]], have retained the term \"college\" in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case, [[Boston College]] and [[Boston University]], the former located in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts and the latter located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.\n\n[[File:BCburnslawnsunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boston College]]]]\nUsage of the terms varies among the states. In 1996 for example, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities, and all of its [[vocation]]al technology schools to [[Institute of technology|technical colleges]].\n\n[[File:Johnson Student Center and Freeman College Union.jpg|left|thumb|[[Occidental College]]]]\nThe terms \"university\" and \"college\" do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include \"Polytechnic\" ([[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]),  \"Institute of Technology\" ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]), \"academy\" ([[United States Military Academy]]), \"union\" ([[Cooper Union]]), \"conservatory\" ([[New England Conservatory]]), and \"school\" ([[Juilliard School]]). In colloquial use, they are still referred to as \"college\" when referring to their undergraduate studies.\n\nThe term ''college'' is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions, the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as '''the college''' (such as The [[College of the University of Chicago]], [[Harvard College]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], or [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) while at others, such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], each of the faculties may be called a \"college\" (the \"college of engineering\", the \"college of nursing\", and so forth). There exist other variants for historical reasons; for example, [[Duke University]], which was called Trinity College until the 1920s, still calls its main undergraduate subdivision [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]].\n\n====Residential colleges====\n[[File:Scripps College for Women-9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scripps College]]]]\nSome American universities, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] have established [[residential college]]s (sometimes, as at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the first to establish such a system in the 1930s, known as houses) along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/reading/morison-1936/|title=Samuel Eliot Morison on the Harvard Houses|work=The Collegiate Way|author=Robert J.

The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities \u2013 they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to \u2013 small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these \"colleges\" assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority\u2014for example, [[The College of William & Mary]] has a [[Royal Charter]] from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while [[Dartmouth College]] has a charter permitting it to award degrees \"as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.\"\n\n[[File:Agnes Scott College - Buttrick Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Agnes Scott College]]]]\nThe leaders of [[Harvard College]] (which granted America's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, few new colleges were founded there, and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term \"college\" had stuck and \"colleges\" have arisen across the United States.\n\nIn U.S. usage, the word \"college\" embodies not only a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in \"going to college\" or \"college savings accounts\" offered by banks.\n\nIn a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone. By comparison, the group says that's the equivalent of 39 percent of tuition and fees at a community college, and 14 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public university.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bidwell|first1=Allie|title=Report: High Textbook Prices Have College Students Struggling|website=U.S. News|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|accessdate=2015-02-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227180009/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Morrill Land-Grant Act====\n[[File:SUNY Purchase College.jpg|thumb|[[SUNY Purchase College]]]]\nIn addition to private colleges and universities, the U.S. also has a system of government funded, [[public university|public universities]]. Many were founded under the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]] of 1862.  A movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses, as \"...many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young Americans to receive some sort of advanced education.\"<ref name = \"enbkii\"/> The Morrill Act \"...made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens.\"<ref name=\"enbkii\" /> Its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country, specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/laws/history.html|title=A Land-Grant Institution|publisher=Dafvm.msstate.edu|date=11 August 2009|accessdate=14 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610150606/http://www.dafvm.msstate.edu/laws/history.html|archivedate=10 June 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and to provide formal education in \"...agriculture, home economics, mechanical arts, and other professions that seemed practical at the time.\"<ref name=\"enbkii\">{{cite web|last=Lightcap|first=Brad|url= http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/morrill.html|website=ND.edu|title=The Morrill Act of 1862|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108111525/http://www.nd.edu/~rbarger/www7/morrill.html|archive-date=8 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]], and eventually all states, to establish such institutions.

A student can complete secondary education (International General Certificate of Secondary Education, [[IGCSE]]) at 16 years and proceed straight to a poly-technical college or they can proceed to Advanced level (16 to 19 years) and obtain a General Certificate of Education ([[General Certificate of Education|GCE]]) certificate which enables them to enrol at a university, provided they have good grades.  Alternatively, with lower grades the GCE certificate holders will have an added advantage over their [[GCSE]] counterparts if they choose to enrol at a poly-technical college.

The title of portreeve is conferred annually, with the Portreeve being sworn in on the first Monday after Michaelmas at the Big Court. The Corporation holds a [[court leet]] half-yearly formerly dealing with criminal cases, and a [[court baron]] every fortnight, dealing with civil suits within the lordship, especially in matters related to land, where administration of the common fields was dealt with.<ref name=jisc/> The Laugharne [[open field system]] is one of only two surviving and still in use today in Britain. The most senior 76 burgesses get a strang of land on Hugden for life, to be used in a form of mediaeval strip farming.\n\nCustoms associated with the Corporation include the Common walk (also known as [[beating the bounds]]),  which occurs on [[Whit Monday]] every three years. This event is attended by most of the young and firm local population, their number swelled by many visitors.

After Henry\u2019s death, Rhys seized St. Clears, Llanstephan and Laugharne, and then lost them again to the crown. In 1215 Llewelyn ap Iorwerth (Llewelyn Mawr) Prince of Gwynedd, renewed the offensive for the Welsh and razed the three strongholds to the ground. King John in the last year of his reign (1216) restored Norman authority and granted the Lordship of Laugharne to Gui de Brienne who had espoused the daughter of the Lord Dynefor. It was de Brienne who granted Laugharne its famous Charter, and it was ratified by Edward I, at some time between 1270\u20131290. The Charter reads,\n{{quotation\n|\nTo all the faithful in Christ, to whom this present writing shall come, Gwydo de Brione, the younger [wishes] eternal salvation in the Lord. Let all of you know that we have granted to our beloved and faithful burgesses of Thalacharn, for us and for our heirs and for our successors, whoever they may be, all the good laws and customs that the burgesses of Carmarthen have up to now used and enjoyed in the time of King John, the grandfather of the Lord Edward I, the son of Henry III, and their predeccessors, Kings of England; preserving the weights and measures that were in the time of Gwydo de Brione, the elder.\n\nWe have also granted to the same men a free common in all our northern wood, that is to say, in the whole forest of Coydebech, and all that common pasture in the marsh of Thalacharn which is called Menecors along the marks and boundaries as it is perambulated, and also all that free common from the rivulet which is named Mackorellis on proceeding upwards as far as Greensladeshead, and so towards the east over Eynonsdown by the way that leads to Brangweys, and from there to Corranshead and so upwards to Horilake and from there to the top of Tadhill, and so downwards to Passenant\u2019s Lake and so towards the east to the bounds between Moldhill and that carrucate of land that formerly belonged to Rice, the son of William and downwards to the water of the Taf and so to Heming\u2019s well and from there upwards to Horestone and so to Pensernes and from there downwards to Blindwell and so to Rochcomb and so downwards to the ancient whirlpool of the Taf and from there to Howelscroft and so upwards to the Burch and Mere, and so downwards to the long rock which is near our virgate of Thalacharn.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men one way sixteen feet in which to drive their cattle from the common pasture aforesaid near Passenant\u2019s lake to the water of the Taf.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men one customary acre in length and breadth for digging turfs where they suitably wish to choose in the Turbary near Passenant\u2019s Lake.\n\nWe have also granted to our burgesses aforesaid that they themselves for the transgression or forfeiture of their servants may not lose their own chattels and goods found in the hands of the servants or placed aside anywhere by the servants themselves within our land, as far as they will be able to prove that they are their own. And that, if the aforesaid burgesses, or some among them, within our land have died testate or intestate, neither we nor our heirs shall cause their goods to be confiscated so that their heirs do not have the things themselves entirely, as far as it will be established that the aforesaid chattels were those of the said deceased, provided that then knowledge or confidence may be had concerning the aforesaid heirs.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men that no one of them within our land be troubled for the debt of some neighbour, unless he be his debtor or his surety, and that the surety of any one should not be compelled to pay, provided the debtor has wherewith he can pay, and that all off ences committed within their township be corrected according to the judgment of the same people, as has hitherto been accustomed to be done in the borough of Kymarden. We have also granted to the same men, if anyone of them within his township shall have incurred forfeiture towards anyone, he may not be led within the gates of the castle, provided that then he can find good and safe sureties for his standing trial. And that no one of them be compelled to provide his lord, or any bailiff of his, beyond twelve pence, unless he wishes to do it of his own good will, and that no inquisition of affairs of non-burgesses be made by the aforesaid burgesses, but by the freeholders of the country, nor of the burgesses by non-burgesses.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same our burgesses that they themselves choose twice in a year two competent burgesses to the office of our Port- reeve, that is to say one in the next hundred-court after the feast of Saint Michael, the other in the next hundred-court after Easter, by the common consent of the same men and not by our authority or that of someone, a bailiff of ours, to hold the hundred-court and to receive the attachments belonging to the hundred and to receive the rent from the township and the toll. And that the said portreeves pay the aforesaid rent and toll to us or to our aforesaid bailiff, appointed for this purpose, within the township of Thalacharn by Tally.\n\nAnd that they should not have any other duty of buying of exchange, or any other service whatsoever that could harm them within the township or without.\n\nWe have also granted to the same men that the aforesaid burgesses be free from every kind of servitude and service of ploughing, harrowing, making hay, reaping, binding corn and of any kind of carting, of repsiring the mill or its pond and from all other kinds of services that could tend to their slavery or their loss within the township and without.\n\nAnd that they go not to the army except to guard their township, as the burgesses of Kymarden do.\n\nWe wish also and grant that, if any one in the open day, in the presence of his neighbours, should buy anything, and afterwards that thing should be ill-spoken of, as if stolen, the buyer lose nothing except then that thing, but it shall he sworn on the oath of his neighbours that he did not know that he had bought that thing from a thief.\n\nAnd, that this our grant and the confirmation of our present charter for us and for our heirs and for our successors or assigns, whoever they may be, should remain firm and unshaken for ever, we have strengthened this present charter with the impression of our seal, these men being witnesses.

After Henry\u2019s death, Rhys seized St. Clears, Llanstephan and Laugharne, and then lost them again to the crown. In 1215 Llewelyn ap Iorwerth (Llewelyn Mawr) Prince of Gwynedd, renewed the offensive for the Welsh and razed the three strongholds to the ground. King John in the last year of his reign (1216) restored Norman authority and granted the Lordship of Laugharne to Gui de Brienne who had espoused the daughter of the Lord Dynefor. It was de Brienne who granted Laugharne its famous Charter, and it was ratified by Edward I, at some time between 1270\u20131290. The Charter reads,\n{{quotation\n|\nTo all the faithful in Christ, to whom this present writing shall come, Gwydo de Brione, the younger [wishes] eternal salvation in the Lord. Let all of you know that we have granted to our beloved and faithful burgesses of Thalacharn, for us and for our heirs and for our successors, whoever they may be, all the good laws and customs that the burgesses of Carmarthen have up to now used and enjoyed in the time of King John, the grandfather of the Lord Edward I, the son of Henry III, and their predeccessors, Kings of England; preserving the weights and measures that were in the time of Gwydo de Brione, the elder.\n\nWe have also granted to the same men a free common in all our northern wood, that is to say, in the whole forest of Coydebech, and all that common pasture in the marsh of Thalacharn which is called Menecors along the marks and boundaries as it is perambulated, and also all that free common from the rivulet which is named Mackorellis on proceeding upwards as far as Greensladeshead, and so towards the east over Eynonsdown by the way that leads to Brangweys, and from there to Corranshead and so upwards to Horilake and from there to the top of Tadhill, and so downwards to Passenant\u2019s Lake and so towards the east to the bounds between Moldhill and that carrucate of land that formerly belonged to Rice, the son of William and downwards to the water of the Taf and so to Heming\u2019s well and from there upwards to Horestone and so to Pensernes and from there downwards to Blindwell and so to Rochcomb and so downwards to the ancient whirlpool of the Taf and from there to Howelscroft and so upwards to the Burch and Mere, and so downwards to the long rock which is near our virgate of Thalacharn.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men one way sixteen feet in which to drive their cattle from the common pasture aforesaid near Passenant\u2019s lake to the water of the Taf.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men one customary acre in length and breadth for digging turfs where they suitably wish to choose in the Turbary near Passenant\u2019s Lake.\n\nWe have also granted to our burgesses aforesaid that they themselves for the transgression or forfeiture of their servants may not lose their own chattels and goods found in the hands of the servants or placed aside anywhere by the servants themselves within our land, as far as they will be able to prove that they are their own. And that, if the aforesaid burgesses, or some among them, within our land have died testate or intestate, neither we nor our heirs shall cause their goods to be confiscated so that their heirs do not have the things themselves entirely, as far as it will be established that the aforesaid chattels were those of the said deceased, provided that then knowledge or confidence may be had concerning the aforesaid heirs.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same men that no one of them within our land be troubled for the debt of some neighbour, unless he be his debtor or his surety, and that the surety of any one should not be compelled to pay, provided the debtor has wherewith he can pay, and that all off ences committed within their township be corrected according to the judgment of the same people, as has hitherto been accustomed to be done in the borough of Kymarden. We have also granted to the same men, if anyone of them within his township shall have incurred forfeiture towards anyone, he may not be led within the gates of the castle, provided that then he can find good and safe sureties for his standing trial. And that no one of them be compelled to provide his lord, or any bailiff of his, beyond twelve pence, unless he wishes to do it of his own good will, and that no inquisition of affairs of non-burgesses be made by the aforesaid burgesses, but by the freeholders of the country, nor of the burgesses by non-burgesses.\n\nAlso we have granted to the same our burgesses that they themselves choose twice in a year two competent burgesses to the office of our Port- reeve, that is to say one in the next hundred-court after the feast of Saint Michael, the other in the next hundred-court after Easter, by the common consent of the same men and not by our authority or that of someone, a bailiff of ours, to hold the hundred-court and to receive the attachments belonging to the hundred and to receive the rent from the township and the toll. And that the said portreeves pay the aforesaid rent and toll to us or to our aforesaid bailiff, appointed for this purpose, within the township of Thalacharn by Tally.\n\nAnd that they should not have any other duty of buying of exchange, or any other service whatsoever that could harm them within the township or without.\n\nWe have also granted to the same men that the aforesaid burgesses be free from every kind of servitude and service of ploughing, harrowing, making hay, reaping, binding corn and of any kind of carting, of repsiring the mill or its pond and from all other kinds of services that could tend to their slavery or their loss within the township and without.\n\nAnd that they go not to the army except to guard their township, as the burgesses of Kymarden do.\n\nWe wish also and grant that, if any one in the open day, in the presence of his neighbours, should buy anything, and afterwards that thing should be ill-spoken of, as if stolen, the buyer lose nothing except then that thing, but it shall he sworn on the oath of his neighbours that he did not know that he had bought that thing from a thief.\n\nAnd, that this our grant and the confirmation of our present charter for us and for our heirs and for our successors or assigns, whoever they may be, should remain firm and unshaken for ever, we have strengthened this present charter with the impression of our seal, these men being witnesses.

He was billed as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Magnum T.A.]], which made him a target for the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> They finally got to him in the summer of 1985 when [[Tully Blanchard]], [[Ole Anderson]], and [[Arn Anderson]] ([[kayfabe]]) broke his arm during a six-man tag team match.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\nIn late 1985, he feuded with [[Barry Darsow|Krusher Khruschev]] over the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship]], which he won in January 1986.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He then feuded with [[Black Bart (wrestler)|Black Bart]], who won the title from him a few months later.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\nHouston formed a cowboy-themed tag team with [[Nelson Royal]] during the summer of 1986.\n\n=== Central States Wrestling (1986) ===\nHouston moved on to the Central States Territory later that year, where he won the title while feuding with Bulldog Bob Brown and [[Bill Dundee]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/>\n\n=== Universal Wrestling Federation (1987) ===\nHis first few months of 1987 were spent in the [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] where he teamed up with Terry Taylor for a short period of time.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation (1987-1991) ===\nHouston moved on to the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWF]] in the spring, making his debut on May 9, 1987 by defeating [[Sika Anoa\u02bbi|Sika]] on a house show in St. Louis, Missouri. Houston was undefeated in his first month, defeating Terry Gibbs, Steve Lombardi, and others at TV taping dark matches and arena shows.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm</ref> On June 7 he made his first television appearance, defeating Gibbs on Wrestling Challenge in a match taped in Houston, TX. At the same event Houston came out to help a newly arrived [[Ted DiBiase]] (who had made his first WWF appearance as a babyface) clear the ring of [[The One Man Gang]].\n\nHouston's first loss came a few weeks later when he was defeated by another new arrival, [[Bam-Bam Bigelow]] at a house show in Jackson, Mississippi on June 25. One night later in Houston, Texas he tag-teamed with DiBiase against The One Man Gang and [[Ron Bass]]. The babyface duo lost when DiBiase turned heel on his partner. Houston remained off US television, wrestling opening matches on house shows against Tiger Chung Lee, Jose Estrada, Barry Horowitz, and others, winning most of these encounters. He finally made his television debut on October 31, 1987 on ''WWF Superstars'' when he upset [[Dangerous Danny Davis|Danny Davis]], handing the former referee his first televised loss. He moved into the winter wrestling [[Ron Bass (wrestler)|Outlaw Ron Bass]] on the house show circuit, with many of the matches ending in draws. In December 1987 he began a series with Danny Davis, trading wins with him on various house show matches in a feud that lasted all the way into June 1988, and would continue sporadically into 1989. During his time in WWF he teamed with fellow cowboy Scott Casey on a number of occasions and a match that included his brother Jake Roberts (though the audience didn't know the relationship at the time), with Houston saving Roberts from elimination on a number of occasions.\n\nHe wrestled in the first ever [[Royal Rumble]] match on January 24, 1988, and two months later made his first pay-per-view appearance when he appeared at [[WrestleMania IV]]'s twenty man battle royal.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/88.htm</ref> That summer Houston entered a house show series with Big Boss Man, but unlike his previous house show series he was winless. Houston also fell in matches against [[King Haku]], [[Frenchy Martin]], and the newly arrived [[Curt Hennig]] and [[Terry Taylor]]. His biggest win in the summer of 1988 was against [[Jos LeDuc]]. He also continued to gain televised victories on Prime Time Wrestling, and was usually successful against lower level competition such as [[Steve Lombardi]]. He made his second PPV appearance of the year when he teamed with The Ultimate Warrior, The Blue Blazer ([[Owen Hart]]), Jim Brunzell, and Brutus Beefcake in a winning effort against Honky Tonk Man, Greg Valentine, Ron Bass, Bad News Brown, and Danny Davis in the second annual [[Survivor Series (1988)|Survivor Series]].\n\nHouston defeated Steve Lombardi in the dark match at the 1989 Royal Rumble but was unable to move past lower level competition. On the February 11th edition of WWF Superstars he lost to [[The Honky Tonk Man]] in less than two minutes.<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/89.htm</ref> After this Houston wrestled primarily on house shows, facing [[Barry Windham]] and [[Lanny Poffo|The Genius]]. In 1990 he appeared sporadically, although he wrestled [[Jerry Sags]] in the dark match of the 1991 Royal Rumble.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\">http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/90.htm</ref> His final match was against [[The Barbarian (wrestler)|The Barbarian]] on February 7, 1991 in Salt Lake City, UT.<ref name=\"thehistoryofwwe.com\"/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling (1991) ===\nAfter continuing to flounder in the WWF's mid-card as a jobber to the stars, Houston left WWF in February 1991 and joined World Championship Wrestling. His first appearance came on April 17 in Gadsden, Alabama when he defeated [[Jack Victory]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw91.htm</ref> On the May 12 edition of ''[[WCW Main Event]]'', Houston lost to WCW World Champion [[Ric Flair]]. Houston would go on to face [[Scott Hall|The Diamond Studd]], Larry Zbyszko, Arn Anderson, and Steve Austin that summer. His final match came on August 11 when he was defeated by [[The One Man Gang]] at a house show in Roanoke, Virginia.\n\n=== Independent circuit (1991-1993) ===\nHouston next went to the United States Wrestling Association promotion, which had bought up the World Class Championship Wrestling promotion in Dallas where he feuded once again with Black Bart.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> After leaving there he then wrestled on the independent wrestling scene before showing up in January 1992 at the [[Global Wrestling Federation]].
