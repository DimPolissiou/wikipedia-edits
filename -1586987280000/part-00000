Emmerich experienced visions on the life and [[passion of Jesus Christ]], reputed to be revealed to her by the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>Emmerich, Anna Catherine: ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' {{ISBN|978-0-89555-210-5}} page viii</ref>\n\nDuring her bedridden years, a number of well-known figures were inspired to visit her.<ref name=Vatican /> The poet [[Clemens Brentano]] interviewed her at length and wrote two books based on his notes of her visions.<ref name=AndrewWeeks /> The authenticity of Brentano's writings has been questioned and critics have characterized the books as \"conscious elaborations by a poet\" and a \"well-intentioned fraud\" by Brentano.<ref name=America /><ref name=Anvil />\n\nEmmerich was [[beatified]] on 3 October 2004, by [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]].<ref name=Vatican /> However, the Vatican focused on her own personal piety rather than the religious writings associated to her by Clemens Brentano.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Emmerickhaus.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of Anne Catherine Emmerich in Coesfeld-Flamschen]]\nEmmerich was born into a family of poor farmers and had nine brothers and sisters. The family's surname was derived from an ancestral town. From an early age, she helped with the house and farm work. Her schooling was rather brief, but all those who knew her noticed that she felt drawn to prayer from an early age.<ref name=Vatican /> At twelve, she started to work at a large farm in the vicinity for three years and later learned to be a seamstress and worked as such for several years.<ref name=CathEnc>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05406b.htm Graham, Edward. \"Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 Feb. 2014]</ref>\n\nShe applied for admission to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a [[dowry]]. Eventually, the [[Poor Clares]] in [[M\u00fcnster]] agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist S\u00f6ntgen in [[Coesfeld]] to study music and learn to play the organ, but the poverty of the S\u00f6ntgen family prompted her to work there and to sacrifice her small savings in an effort to help them.<ref name=CathEnc /> Later, one of the S\u00f6ntgen daughters entered the convent with her.<ref name=Vatican />\n\n==Religious life==\nIn 1802, at the age of  28, Emmerich and her friend Klara S\u00f6ntgen finally managed to join the [[Augustinian nun]]s at the convent of Agnetenberg in [[D\u00fclmen]]. The following year, Emmerich took her [[Vow#Divine vows|religious vows]].<ref name=Vatican /> In the convent, she became known for her strict observance of the order's rule; but, from the beginning to 1811, she was often quite ill and had to endure great pain. At times, her zeal and strict adherence to rules disturbed some of the more tepid sisters, who were puzzled by her weak health and religious ecstasies.<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nWhen [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], [[Kingdom of Westphalia|King of Westphalia]], [[Religious intolerance|suppressed the convent]] in 1812, she found refuge in a widow's house.\n\n==Stigmata==\n\nIn early 1813, marks of the [[stigmata]] were reported on Emmerich's body. The parish priest called in two doctors to examine her. When word of the phenomenon spread three months later, he notified the vicar general. With the news causing considerable talk in the town, the ecclesiastical authorities conducted a lengthy investigation. Many doctors wished to examine the case, and although efforts were made to discourage the curious, there were visitors whose rank or status gained them entry.<ref name=Thurston>[https://books.google.com/books?id=J789AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA237 Thurston, Herbert. \"The Problem of Anne Catherine Emmerich\", ''The Month'', Vol. 138, p. 238, Simpkin, Marshall, and Company, 1921]</ref> During this time, the poet and romanticist Clemens Brentano first visited.\n\nAt the end of 1818, the periodic bleeding of Emmerich's hands and feet had stopped and the wounds had closed. While many in the community viewed the stigmata as real, others considered Emmerich an impostor conspiring with her associates to perpetrate a fraud. In August 1819, the civil authorities intervened and moved Emmerich to a different house, where she was kept under observation for three weeks. The members of the commission could find no evidence of fraud and were divided in their opinions.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nAs the cross on her breastbone had the unusual shape of a \"Y\", similar to a cross in the local church of Coesfeld, English priest [[Herbert Thurston]] surmised that \"the subjective impressions of the stigmatic exercise a preponderating influence upon the manifestations which appear exteriorly,\"<ref name=Thurston/> the same pathway to Stigmata described in the works of [[John of Ruusbroec]].\n\n==Visions and inspirations==\nEmmerich said that as a child she had [[vision (religion)|visions]] in which she talked with Jesus, saw the souls in [[Purgatory]], and witnessed the core of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the form of three concentric, interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core, and the smallest and brightest sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God's core placed in [[heaven]]. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich's childhood, she was visited by a child (suggested as being Jesus), who told her of plants she should ingest in order to heal, including Morning Glory flower's juice, known to contain [[Ergine]].\n\nEmmerich had many mystical visions which she spoke about. The following seems to be mirrored in many traditions as truth: She wrote, for instance, of 'a Mount of Prophets, which she clearly identified as the Himalayas, where live Enoch, Elijah and others who did not die in the ordinary way but ascended, and where unicorns which survived the Flood may also be found'. Some say she was seeing the legendary spiritual fortress of Shambala (Eastern tradition), or the Magical City of Luz (Hebrew Tradition), basically a place found in many ancient traditions where those who are immortal, or special in such a way, go. ( This is mostly based on page 173 of 'The Secret History of the World' by Jonathan Black)\n\nBased on Emmerich's growing reputation, a number of figures who were influential in the renewal movement of the church early in the 19th century came to visit her, among them [[Clemens August von Droste zu Vischering|Clemens von Droste zu Vischering]], the future [[Archbishop of Cologne]]; [[Johann Michael Sailer]], the [[Bishop of Ratisbon]], since 1803 the sole surviving Elector Spiritual of the Holy Roman Empire;  [[Bernhard Heinrich Overberg|Bernhard Overberg]] and authors [[Luise Hensel]] and [[Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg|Friedrich Stolberg]].<ref name=Vatican /> Clemens von Droste, at the time still vicar\u2011general of the Archdiocese, called Emmerich \"a special friend of God\" in a letter he wrote to Stolberg.<ref name=Vatican />\n\n===Clemens Brentano's visits===\n[[File:D\u00fclmen Hl. Kreuz Anna-Katharina Emmerick Sterbezimmer.jpg|thumb|The reconstruction of Emmerich's room with the original furniture, at the Holy Cross church in [[D\u00fclmen]], Germany]]\nAt the time of Emmerich's second examination in 1819, Brentano visited her and she immediately recognized him. He claimed that she told him he was sent to help her fulfill God's command, to express in writing the revelations made to her. Brentano became one of Emmerich's many supporters at the time, believing her to be a \"chosen Bride of Christ\". Professor Andrew Weeks claims that Brentano's own [[Complex (psychology)|personal complexes]] were a factor in substituting Emmerich as a maternal figure in his own life.<ref name=AndrewWeeks />\n\nFrom 1819 until Emmerich's death in 1824, Brentano filled many notebooks with accounts of her visions involving scenes from the [[New Testament]] and the life of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Because Emmerich only spoke the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian dialect]], Brentano could not transcribe her words directly, and often could not even take notes in her presence,<ref name=Corl /> so he would quickly write in [[German language|standard German]] when he returned to his own apartment a set of notes based on what he remembered of the conversations he had with Emmerich.<ref name=Corl /> Brentano edited the notes later, years after the death of Emmerich.<ref name=Corl />\n\nAbout ten years after Emmerich had recounted her visions, Brentano completed editing his records for publication.<ref name=Corl /> In 1833, he published his first volume, ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ According to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich''. Brentano then prepared ''The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich'' for publication, but he died in 1842. The book was published posthumously in 1852 in [[Munich]].\n\nCatholic priest Father Karl Schmoger  edited Brentano's manuscripts and from 1858 to 1880 published the three volumes of ''The Life of Our Lord''. In 1881, a large illustrated edition followed. Schmoger also penned a biography of Anne Catherine Emmerich in two volumes that has been republished in English language editions.\n\nThe Vatican does not endorse the authenticity of the books written by Brentano.<ref name=CNSFeb2004 /><ref name=CNSOct2004 /> However, it views their general message as \"an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation\".<ref>\"Her words, which have reached innumerable people in many languages from her modest room in D\u00fclmen through the writings of Clemens Brentano, are an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation right up to the present day\".

Emmerich experienced visions on the life and [[passion of Jesus Christ]], reputed to be revealed to her by the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] under [[religious ecstasy]].<ref>Emmerich, Anna Catherine: ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' {{ISBN|978-0-89555-210-5}} page viii</ref>\n\nDuring her bedridden years, a number of well-known figures were inspired to visit her.<ref name=Vatican /> The poet [[Clemens Brentano]] interviewed her at length and wrote two books based on his notes of her visions.<ref name=AndrewWeeks /> The authenticity of Brentano's writings has been questioned and critics have characterized the books as \"conscious elaborations by a poet\" and a \"well-intentioned fraud\" by Brentano.<ref name=America /><ref name=Anvil />\n\nEmmerich was [[beatified]] on 3 October 2004, by [[Pope John Paul II|Pope John Paul&nbsp;II]].<ref name=Vatican /> However, the Vatican focused on her own personal piety rather than the religious writings associated to her by Clemens Brentano.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Emmerickhaus.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of Anne Catherine Emmerich in Coesfeld-Flamschen]]\nEmmerich as born into a family of poor farmers and had nine brothers and sisters. The family's surname was derived from an ancestral town. From an early age, she helped with the house and farm work. Her schooling was rather brief, but all those who knew her noticed that she felt drawn to prayer from an early age.<ref name=Vatican /> At twelve, she started to work at a large farm in the vicinity for three years and later learned to be a seamstress and worked as such for several years.<ref name=CathEnc>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05406b.htm Graham, Edward. \"Ven. Anne Catherine Emmerich.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 Feb. 2014]</ref>\n\nShe applied for admission to various convents, but she was rejected because she could not afford a [[dowry]]. Eventually, the [[Poor Clares]] in [[M\u00fcnster]] agreed to accept her, provided she would learn to play the organ. She went to the organist S\u00f6ntgen in [[Coesfeld]] to study music and learn to play the organ, but the poverty of the S\u00f6ntgen family prompted her to work there and to sacrifice her small savings in an effort to help them.<ref name=CathEnc /> Later, one of the S\u00f6ntgen daughters entered the convent with her.<ref name=Vatican />\n\n==Religious life==\nIn 1802, at the age of  28, Emmerich and her friend Klara S\u00f6ntgen finally managed to join the [[Augustinian nun]]s at the convent of Agnetenberg in [[D\u00fclmen]]. The following year, Emmerich took her [[Vow#Divine vows|religious vows]].<ref name=Vatican /> In the convent, she became known for her strict observance of the order's rule; but, from the beginning to 1811, she was often quite ill and had to endure great pain. At times, her zeal and strict adherence to rules disturbed some of the more tepid sisters, who were puzzled by her weak health and religious ecstasies.<ref name=CathEnc />\n\nWhen [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]], [[Kingdom of Westphalia|King of Westphalia]], [[Religious intolerance|suppressed the convent]] in 1812, she found refuge in a widow's house.\n\n==Stigmata==\n\nIn early 1813, marks of the [[stigmata]] were reported on Emmerich's body. The parish priest called in two doctors to examine her. When word of the phenomenon spread three months later, he notified the vicar general. With the news causing considerable talk in the town, the ecclesiastical authorities conducted a lengthy investigation. Many doctors wished to examine the case, and although efforts were made to discourage the curious, there were visitors whose rank or status gained them entry.<ref name=Thurston>[https://books.google.com/books?id=J789AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA237 Thurston, Herbert. \"The Problem of Anne Catherine Emmerich\", ''The Month'', Vol. 138, p. 238, Simpkin, Marshall, and Company, 1921]</ref> During this time, the poet and romanticist Clemens Brentano first visited.\n\nAt the end of 1818, the periodic bleeding of Emmerich's hands and feet had stopped and the wounds had closed. While many in the community viewed the stigmata as real, others considered Emmerich an impostor conspiring with her associates to perpetrate a fraud. In August 1819, the civil authorities intervened and moved Emmerich to a different house, where she was kept under observation for three weeks. The members of the commission could find no evidence of fraud and were divided in their opinions.<ref name=Thurston/>\n\nAs the cross on her breastbone had the unusual shape of a \"Y\", similar to a cross in the local church of Coesfeld, English priest [[Herbert Thurston]] surmised that \"the subjective impressions of the stigmatic exercise a preponderating influence upon the manifestations which appear exteriorly,\"<ref name=Thurston/> the same pathway to Stigmata described in the works of [[John of Ruusbroec]].\n\n==Visions and inspirations==\nEmmerich said that as a child she had [[vision (religion)|visions]] in which she talked with Jesus, saw the souls in [[Purgatory]], and witnessed the core of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the form of three concentric, interpenetrating full spheres. The largest but dimmest of the spheres represented the Father core, the medium sphere the Son core, and the smallest and brightest sphere the Holy Spirit core. Each sphere of omnipresent God is extended toward infinity beyond God's core placed in [[heaven]]. The Brentano compilation tells that during an illness in Emmerich's childhood, she was visited by a child (suggested as being Jesus), who told her of plants she should ingest in order to heal, including Morning Glory flower's juice, known to contain [[Ergine]].\n\nEmmerich had many mystical visions which she spoke about. The following seems to be mirrored in many traditions as truth: She wrote, for instance, of 'a Mount of Prophets, which she clearly identified as the Himalayas, where live Enoch, Elijah and others who did not die in the ordinary way but ascended, and where unicorns which survived the Flood may also be found'. Some say she was seeing the legendary spiritual fortress of Shambala (Eastern tradition), or the Magical City of Luz (Hebrew Tradition), basically a place found in many ancient traditions where those who are immortal, or special in such a way, go. ( This is mostly based on page 173 of 'The Secret History of the World' by Jonathan Black)\n\nBased on Emmerich's growing reputation, a number of figures who were influential in the renewal movement of the church early in the 19th century came to visit her, among them [[Clemens August von Droste zu Vischering|Clemens von Droste zu Vischering]], the future [[Archbishop of Cologne]]; [[Johann Michael Sailer]], the [[Bishop of Ratisbon]], since 1803 the sole surviving Elector Spiritual of the Holy Roman Empire;  [[Bernhard Heinrich Overberg|Bernhard Overberg]] and authors [[Luise Hensel]] and [[Friedrich Leopold zu Stolberg-Stolberg|Friedrich Stolberg]].<ref name=Vatican /> Clemens von Droste, at the time still vicar\u2011general of the Archdiocese, called Emmerich \"a special friend of God\" in a letter he wrote to Stolberg.<ref name=Vatican />\n\n===Clemens Brentano's visits===\n[[File:D\u00fclmen Hl. Kreuz Anna-Katharina Emmerick Sterbezimmer.jpg|thumb|The reconstruction of Emmerich's room with the original furniture, at the Holy Cross church in [[D\u00fclmen]], Germany]]\nAt the time of Emmerich's second examination in 1819, Brentano visited her and she immediately recognized him. He claimed that she told him he was sent to help her fulfill God's command, to express in writing the revelations made to her. Brentano became one of Emmerich's many supporters at the time, believing her to be a \"chosen Bride of Christ\". Professor Andrew Weeks claims that Brentano's own [[Complex (psychology)|personal complexes]] were a factor in substituting Emmerich as a maternal figure in his own life.<ref name=AndrewWeeks />\n\nFrom 1819 until Emmerich's death in 1824, Brentano filled many notebooks with accounts of her visions involving scenes from the [[New Testament]] and the life of the [[Virgin Mary]]. Because Emmerich only spoke the [[Westphalian language|Westphalian dialect]], Brentano could not transcribe her words directly, and often could not even take notes in her presence,<ref name=Corl /> so he would quickly write in [[German language|standard German]] when he returned to his own apartment a set of notes based on what he remembered of the conversations he had with Emmerich.<ref name=Corl /> Brentano edited the notes later, years after the death of Emmerich.<ref name=Corl />\n\nAbout ten years after Emmerich had recounted her visions, Brentano completed editing his records for publication.<ref name=Corl /> In 1833, he published his first volume, ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ According to the Meditations of Anne Catherine Emmerich''. Brentano then prepared ''The Life of the Blessed Virgin Mary from the Visions of Anna Catherine Emmerich'' for publication, but he died in 1842. The book was published posthumously in 1852 in [[Munich]].\n\nCatholic priest Father Karl Schmoger  edited Brentano's manuscripts and from 1858 to 1880 published the three volumes of ''The Life of Our Lord''. In 1881, a large illustrated edition followed. Schmoger also penned a biography of Anne Catherine Emmerich in two volumes that has been republished in English language editions.\n\nThe Vatican does not endorse the authenticity of the books written by Brentano.<ref name=CNSFeb2004 /><ref name=CNSOct2004 /> However, it views their general message as \"an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation\".<ref>\"Her words, which have reached innumerable people in many languages from her modest room in D\u00fclmen through the writings of Clemens Brentano, are an outstanding proclamation of the gospel in service to salvation right up to the present day\".
