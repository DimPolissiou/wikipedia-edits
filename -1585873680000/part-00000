He serves as the [[antihero]] and [[unreliable narrator]] of the series.\n\n==Personality==\nGreg Heffley is mischievous, lazy, [[paranoia|paranoid]], arrogant, and dishonest. He is known to become jealous easily. He also tends to be a poor friend, something even he agrees with. He doesn't like taking the blame for negative events, and attempts to twist any situation he can in his favor, so that he may go up his \"popularity ladder.\" Despite all of these negative traits, he has displayed a kinder side. Throughout the series, Greg's schemes to acquire money and popularity always backfire. He also enjoys playing video games, particularly the fictional \"Twisted Wizard\".\n\nHis best friend is [[Rowley Jefferson]] (they often get into arguments). Rowley takes part in Greg's schemes and is sometimes a victim of Greg's manipulation and deception. The two have a very complicated relationship, as Greg sometimes takes advantage of Rowley's good nature, and his own schemes fail due to Rowley's foolishness, such as Rowley's \"confession\" to the vandalized wall. Rowley's parents, mostly his father, view Greg as a bad influence on their son. This is because Greg has a tendency for getting himself and Rowley into trouble. In 'Wrecking Ball', it is revealed that Greg truly did have a soft spot for Rowley, as Greg cries when it is time to say goodbye to him.\n\nAt school, Greg receives bad grades, gets bullied, deals with the hardships of middle school, and is always trying to earn popularity points in order to gain attention and respect (though his plans to do so often result in either his own popularity dropping, or unintentionally boosting Rowley's popularity). At home, Greg has a mixed relationship with his family, especially with his younger brother Manny, who is overly pampered and protected by his parents (particularly his mother Susan). His mother tries to devise ways for Greg and his older brother Rodrick to get along but which never work out. Greg's father, Frank, is annoyed by Greg's antics and laziness and tries to make him more active. Greg has a love/hate relationship with his older brother, Rodrick. Greg is often tormented and bullied by Rodrick and is also the victim of his pranks yet they do care for each other deep down. In addition, he has inherited many of Rodrick's traits (such as laziness, large ego, disdain for sports, being a trickster, etc.). In fact, many of Greg's teachers dislike him because they originally had Rodrick as a student even though Greg's classroom behavior does not mirror Rodrick's.\n\nA notable trait of Greg that becomes more apparent as the novels go on is his lack of logical and critical thinking. A lot of his actions are shown to have no thought or consideration prior to being acted out, and usually end in disastrous repercussions. This is shown in when he delays his family by drying his sock after stepping in a slush puddle while heading to an airport, and later burning the sock while attempting to dry it. Greg also has been shown to display constant forgetfulness as well as no linear thinking. A good example of this is when he constantly has to remind himself to put his socks before his shoes after a string of incidents involving him doing the opposite act.\n\nGreg is a fan of video games and comic books and he sees them as talents, which annoys his father Frank. His greatest gift is for cartooning and [[deadpan|dry humor]], evidenced by the many comic strips he has drawn.\n\nAnother character trait of Greg is his paranoia, which sometimes seems to get the better of him. A notable example of this is in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever|Cabin Fever]]'', in which he is worried that his old doll, Alfrendo, will come back to haunt him, and the Santa's Scout doll that he fears is actually following him around before finally realizing it is Rodrick who is doing it. Another notable example is in 'Wrecking Ball', when Gregs fears an imaginary monster called 'The Grout' and locks himself in his room until his father screws the door out.\n\nGreg rarely learns from his ill-fated mistakes and continues to scheme and plot for his various goals. Because of this and his impulsive nature, he usually puts himself and others in trouble, and will often try to find another person to take the blame.\n\nNeighboring Greg is his awkward, unpopular and eccentric schoolmate named Fregley, whose vast variety of oddities disgust and befuddle those around him, including Greg, who tries to distance himself from Fregley as much as possible. Though Greg detests the fact that he is next-door-neighbors with Fregley, the only time he has ever shown interest in acquiring friendship with Fregley is in the eighth book ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck|Hard Luck]]'', where he becomes friends with Fregley (though this was really to Greg's advantage to become popular).\n\nGreg is also noted for having many attractions to girls throughout the series, most notably a girl named Holly Hills, his classmate. His schemes usually fail in the hope of attracting girls though. One very notable example is ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel|The Third Wheel]]'', where Greg attempts to use Rowley as a wingman to get himself a date for the upcoming Valentine's Day dance. He succeeds in obtaining the chance to take a girl named Abigail to the dance, but Rowley, who tags along as a third wheel, hence the name, proves to be a better date than Greg at the dance. This ultimately leads to Rowley and Abigail becoming a couple, setting the stage for ''Hard Luck.''\n\nGreg has also been known to be very clumsy, as he forgets his homework, and when he was eight, wet the bed. Despite his many flaws and the situations they have landed him in, Greg can be caring, intelligent, courageous, compassionate and thoughtful, and has done a number of good deeds to prove this, such as deceiving his classmates that he threw the cheese away (to save Rowley's reputation), helping Rodrick complete his science project, etc. Greg also showed unusual maturity when he chose to conceal his late Meemaw's diamond ring that he found in an Easter egg, not wanting to see his family fight over it because it had not been willed to anyone.\n\n==In other works==\nGreg Heffley appears on ''[[Poptropica]]'s'' 18th island, \"Wimpy Wonderland,\" which revolves around the ''Wimpy Kid'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poptropica.com/island-tour/wimpy-wonderland-island.html|title=Wimpy Wonderland Island Tour|website=www.poptropica.com}}</ref> Greg has also appeared as a balloon in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] since 2010. ''Poptropica's'' 28th island, \"Wimpy Boardwalk,\" also revolves around the ''Wimpy Kid'' series. Wimpy Boardwalk was the first time that Greg was shown in color.\n\n==In the films==\n{{main|Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)}}\n[[File:Greg cropped (Zachary Gordon).jpg|thumb|right|[[Zachary Gordon]] as Greg Heffley.]]\nIn the first three adaptions of the series, Greg was portrayed by actor [[Zachary Gordon]].

Bowers returns as director, and the film follows Greg's rough summer break.

This ultimately leads to Rowley and Abigail becoming a couple, setting the stage for ''Hard Luck.''\n\nGreg has also been known to be very clumsy, as he forgets his homework, and when he was eight, wet the bed. Despite his many flaws and the situations they have landed him in, Greg can be caring, intelligent, courageous, compassionate and thoughtful, and has done a number of good deeds to prove this, such as deceiving his classmates that he threw the cheese away (to save Rowley's reputation), helping Rodrick complete his science project, etc. Greg also showed unusual maturity when he chose to conceal his late Meemaw's diamond ring that he found in an Easter egg, not wanting to see his family fight over it because it had not been willed to anyone.\n\n==In other works==\nGreg Heffley appears on ''[[Poptropica]]'s'' 18th island, \"Wimpy Wonderland,\" which revolves around the ''Wimpy Kid'' series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poptropica.com/island-tour/wimpy-wonderland-island.html|title=Wimpy Wonderland Island Tour|website=www.poptropica.com}}</ref> Greg has also appeared as a balloon in the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] since 2010.

As a result, he suggested, newly-acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations \u2212 a biological proposition akin to the [[Lamarckian inheritance]] theory.

These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established [[scientific theories]]. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and [[unfalsifiable]].

He concluded by saying, \"whether scientists will be willing to take [Sheldrake] seriously is ... [a question] that need not concern most readers. While I do not think this book will change the world, it will cause plenty of harmless fun.\"<ref name=\"Hawkes\"/>\n\n=== ''Dogs That Know When Their Owners are Coming Home'' (1999)===\n''Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home'', published in 1999, covered his research into proposed telepathy between humans and animals, particularly dogs. Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nThe book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including [[animal migration]] and the [[Homing pigeon|homing of pigeons]], and on animal [[precognition]], including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly [[Statistical significance|significant]] statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines.<ref name=\"the\">{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/if-the-truth-is-out-there-weve-not-found-it-yet/147748.article | title=If the truth is out there, we've not found it yet | work=Times Higher Education | date=30 August 1999 | accessdate=19 February 2015 |last=Blackmore|first=Susan}}</ref> Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nBefore the publication of ''Dogs That Know When Their Owners Are Coming Home'', Sheldrake invited [[Richard Wiseman]], Matthew Smith, and Julie Milton to conduct an independent experimental study with the dog Jaytee. They concluded that their evidence did not support telepathy as an explanation for the dog's behaviour,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sheldrake|first1=Rupert|last2=Smart|first2=Pamela |title=A Dog That Seems To Know When His Owner is Coming Home: Videotaped Experiments and Observations |journal=[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]] |date=2000 |volume=14 |pages=233\u2013255 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/a-dog-that-seems-to-know-when-his-owner-is-coming-home-videotaped-experiments-and-observations |accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref> and proposed possible alternative explanations for Sheldrake's conclusions, involving artefacts, bias resulting from [[experimental design]], and [[post hoc analysis]] of unpublished data.<ref name=wiseman2/><ref name=wiseman1/> The group observed that Sheldrake's observed patterns could easily arise if a dog were simply to do very little for a while, before visiting a window with increasing frequency the longer that its owner was absent, and that such behaviour would make sense for a dog awaiting its owner's return. Under this behaviour, the final measurement period, ending with the owner's return, would always contain the most time spent at the window.<ref name=wiseman2/> Sheldrake argued that the actual data in his own and in Wiseman's tests did not bear this out, and that the dog went to wait at the window sooner when his owner was returning from a short absence, and later after a long absence, with no tendency for Jaytee to go to the window early in the way that he did for shorter absences.<ref name=\"Commentary99\">{{cite journal | last=Sheldrake | first=Rupert | title=Commentary on a paper by Wiseman, Smith and Milton on the 'psychic pet' phenomenon | journal=Journal of the Society for Psychical Research | date=1999 | volume=63 | pages=306\u2013311 | url=http://www.sheldrake.org/research/animal-powers/commentary-on-wiseman-smith-and-milton | accessdate=18 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the book, [[Susan Blackmore]] criticised Sheldrake for comparing the 12 tests of random duration \u2013 which were all less than an hour in duration \u2013 to the initial tests where the dog may have been responding to patterns in the owner's journeys.

He argues that there are many powerful taboos that circumscribe what scientists can legitimately direct their attention towards.{{r|ssf|page1=6\u201312}} The mainstream view of modern science is that it proceeds by [[methodological naturalism]] and does not require philosophical materialism.<ref>{{cite book |title=Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk |last=Pigliucci|first=Massimo |authorlink=Massimo Pigliucci |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=2010 |page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&pg=PA192 |isbn=9780226667874}}</ref>\n\nSheldrake questions conservation of energy; he calls it a \"standard scientific dogma,\"{{r|ssf|page1=337}} says that perpetual motion devices and [[inedia]] should be investigated as possible phenomena,{{r|ssf|page1=72\u201373}} and has stated that \"the evidence for energy conservation in living organisms is weak.\"{{r|ssf|page1=83}} He argues in favour of [[alternative medicine]] and [[psychic phenomena]], saying that their recognition as being legitimate is impeded by a \"scientific priesthood\" with an \"authoritarian mentality.\"{{r|ssf|page1=327}} Citing his earlier \"psychic staring effect\" experiments and other reasons, he stated that minds are not confined to brains and remarks that \"liberating minds from confinement in heads is like being released from prison.\"{{r|ssf|page1=229}} He suggests that [[DNA]] is insufficient to explain [[heredity|inheritance]], and that inheritance of form and behaviour is mediated through morphic resonance.{{r|ssf|page1=157\u2013186}} He also promotes morphic resonance in broader fashion as an explanation for other phenomena such as memory.{{r|ssf|page1=187\u2013211}}\n\nReviews were mixed.

He attributes the origin of his morphic resonance idea to two influences: his studies of the [[holistic]] tradition in biology, and French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s book ''[[Matter and Memory]]''. He says that he took Bergson's concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective past memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, \"There's nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient [[rishis]].\" Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.<ref name=presencepast/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=John David |title=From Cellular Aging to the Physics of Angels: A Conversation with Rupert Sheldrake |journal=The Quest |date=Spring 1998 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/D&C/interviews/Quest.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022014635/http://www.sheldrake.org/D%26C/interviews/Quest.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]], with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, described by Jung as [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=presencepast/> However, whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms \"mechanistic biology.\"\n\n[[Lewis Wolpert]], one of Sheldrake's critics, has described morphic resonance as being an updated [[Hans Driesch|Drieschian]] [[vitalism]].<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Cape|first=Jonathan|title=The believer and the sceptic|date=18 June 1986|page=11|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Full list of books ==\n* ''A New Science of Life: the hypothesis of formative causation'', Los Angeles, CA: J.P.

In 2009, [[Adam Rutherford]], geneticist and deputy editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', criticised Sheldrake's books for containing research that was not subjected to the [[peer-review]] process expected for science, and suggested that his books were best \"ignored.\"<ref name=Rutherford/>\n\n=== ''A New Science of Life'' (1981) ===\nSheldrake's ''A New Science of Life: The Hypothesis of Morphic Resonance'' (1981) proposed that through morphic resonance, various perceived phenomena, particularly biological ones, become more probable the more often they occur, and that biological growth and behaviour thus become guided into patterns laid down by previous similar events. As a result, he suggested, newly-acquired behaviours can be passed down to future generations \u2212 a biological proposition akin to the [[Lamarckian inheritance]] theory. He generalised this approach to assert that it explains many aspects of science, from [[evolution]] to the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] which, in Sheldrake's formulation, are merely mutable habits that have been evolving and changing since the [[Big Bang]].\n\nJohn Davy wrote in ''[[The Observer]]'' that the implications of ''A New Science of Life'' were \"fascinating and far-reaching, and would turn upside down a lot of orthodox science,\" and that they would \"merit attention if some of its predictions are supported by experiment.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Davy|first=J.|date=9 August 1981 |title=Old rats and new tricks |work=The Observer}}</ref>\n\nIn subsequent books, Sheldrake continued to promote morphic resonance.\n\nThe morphic resonance hypothesis is rejected by numerous critics on many grounds, and has been labelled [[pseudoscience]] and [[magical thinking]]. These grounds include the lack of evidence for it and its inconsistency with established [[scientific theories]]. The idea of morphic resonance is also seen as lacking scientific credibility because it is overly vague and [[unfalsifiable]]. Furthermore, Sheldrake's experimental methods have been criticised for being poorly designed and subject to [[experimenter bias]].  His analyses of results have also drawn criticism.{{efn|Sources:\n* pseudoscience<ref name=gardner/><ref name=sharma/><ref name=samuel/><ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=impostures/><ref name=\"Jones\"/>\n* magical thinking<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=skepdic/>\n* lack of evidence<ref name=hood/><ref name=\"Blackmore 2009\"/><ref name=Rutherford/><ref name=sciam/><ref name=\"Rose 1988\"/>\n* inconsistency with established scientific theories<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=\"Blackmore 1999\"/>\n* overly vague<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=\"Jones\"/><ref name=\"Parkin\"/>\n* unfalsifiable<ref name=\"Maddox 1981\"/><ref name=rose/><ref name=sciam/>\n* experimental methods poorly designed and subject to experimenter bias<ref name=MarksColwell/><ref name=\"Blackmore 1999\"/><ref name=alcock/>\n* analyses of results have also drawn criticism<ref name=rose/><ref name=wiseman2/>\n}}\n\n=== ''The Presence of the Past'' (1988)===\nIn ''The Presence of the Past: Morphic Resonance and the Habits of Nature'' (1988), Sheldrake expanded on his morphic resonance hypothesis and marshalled experimental evidence which he said supported the hypothesis.<ref name=presencepast/> The book was reviewed favourably in ''[[New Scientist]]'' by historian [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], who called it \"engaging, provocative\" and \"a tour de force.\"<ref name=\"Roszak\"/> When the book was re-issued in 2011 with those quotes on the front cover, ''New Scientist'' remarked, \"Back then, Roszak gave Sheldrake the benefit of the doubt.

Sheldrake suggests that such interspecies telepathy is a real phenomenon and that morphic fields are responsible for it.<ref name=dogs/>\n\nThe book is in three sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, including [[animal migration]] and the [[Homing pigeon|homing of pigeons]], and on animal [[precognition]], including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of dogs and cats that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes for half an hour or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at the window for an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when she was on her way home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at the window for an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly [[Statistical significance|significant]] statistically.

According to a statement issued by TED staff, TED's scientific advisors \"questioned whether his list is a fair description of scientific assumptions\" and believed that \"there is little evidence for some of Sheldrake's more radical claims, such as his theory of morphic resonance.\" The advisors recommended that the talk \"should not be distributed without being framed with caution.\" The video of the talk was moved from the TEDx YouTube channel to the TED blog accompanied by the framing language called for by the advisors.

Scientists around the world consistently get different measurements for such \"constants\" as the [[gravitational force]] or the [[speed of light]], he said, but they insist that the variation is attributable to experimental error, or they \"make up\" proportions of dark energy and matter to fit what they've observed into the established paradigm. \"What if the laws of nature vary throughout the day,\" Sheldrake asked. \"After much consideration, it seems that what Sheldrake is suggesting isn\u2019t as radical as it seems,\" concludes George Gillett for ''[[The Oxford Student]]''. \"What is surprising is the reliance modern science seems to have on opinions and dogmas, and how certain beliefs in science appear to be immune from scrutiny or inquiry.

He attributes the origin of his morphic resonance idea to two influences: his studies of the [[holistic]] tradition in biology, and French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]]'s book ''[[Matter and Memory]]''. He says that he took Bergson's concept of memories not being materially embedded in the brain and generalised it to morphic resonance, where memories are not only immaterial but also under the influence of the collective past memories of similar organisms. While his colleagues at Cambridge were not receptive to the idea, Sheldrake found the opposite to be true in India. He recounts his Indian colleagues saying, \"There's nothing new in this, it was all known millennia ago to the ancient [[rishis]].\" Sheldrake thus characterises morphic resonance as a convergence between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] thought, yet found by himself first in Western philosophy.<ref name=presencepast/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Ebert |first=John David |title=From Cellular Aging to the Physics of Angels: A Conversation with Rupert Sheldrake |journal=The Quest |date=Spring 1998 |url=http://www.sheldrake.org/D&C/interviews/Quest.html |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022014635/http://www.sheldrake.org/D%26C/interviews/Quest.html |archivedate=22 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nSheldrake has also noted similarities between morphic resonance and [[Carl Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]], with regard to collective memories being shared across individuals and the coalescing of particular behaviours through repetition, described by Jung as [[Jungian archetypes|archetypes]].<ref name=presencepast/> However, whereas Jung assumed that archetypal forms were transmitted through physical inheritance, Sheldrake attributes collective memories to morphic resonance, and rejects any explanation of them involving what he terms \"mechanistic biology.\"\n\n[[Lewis Wolpert]], one of Sheldrake's critics, has described morphic resonance as being an updated [[Hans Driesch|Drieschian]] [[vitalism]].<ref name=\"Wolpert 1984\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Cape|first=Jonathan|title=The believer and the sceptic|date=18 June 1986|page=11|work=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\n== Full list of books ==\n* ''A New Science of Life: the hypothesis of formative causation'', Los Angeles, CA: J.P.
