It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time.

Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]].

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes of this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present in the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> Bowie at different points declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and Brechtian theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23 January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of 3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''[[Station to Station]]'' and on ''Re:Call 2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

Since obliquity is the angle between the axis of rotation and the direction perpendicular to the orbital plane, it changes as the orbital plane changes due to the influence of other planets. But the axis of rotation can also move ([[axial precession]]), due to torque exerted by the sun on a planet's equatorial bulge. Like Earth, all of the rocky planets show axial precession. If the precession rate were very fast the obliquity would actually remain fairly constant even as the orbital plane changes.<ref name=Ward>{{cite journal|last1=William Ward|title=Large-Scale Variations in the Obliquity of Mars|journal=Science|volume=181|issue=4096|pages=260\u2013262|date=20 July 1973|doi=10.1126/science.181.4096.260|pmid=17730940|bibcode=1973Sci...181..260W}}</ref> The rate varies due to [[Tidal acceleration|tidal dissipation]] and [[Planetary core|core]]-[[Mantle (geology)|mantle]] interaction, among other things. When a planet's precession rate approaches certain values, [[orbital resonance]]s may cause large changes in obliquity. The amplitude of the contribution having one of the resonant rates is divided by the difference between the resonant rate and the precession rate, so it becomes large when the two are similar.<ref name=Ward/> [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] have most likely been stabilized by the tidal dissipation of the Sun.

{"title_page": "Welfare in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n{{Lead too short|date=July 2010}}\n\n'''Social welfare''' has long been an important part of New Zealand society and a significant political issue. It is concerned with the provision by the state of benefits and services. Together with fiscal welfare and [[occupational welfare]], it makes up the [[social policy]] of New Zealand. [[Social welfare]] is mostly funded through general taxation. Since the 1980s welfare has been provided on the basis of need; the exception is universal superannuation.\n\n== State housing ==\n{{main|State housing}}\nThe government provides State housing to those in need. The number of houses owned by the State has varied over the years and between different governments. Currently the level of rent paid in state housing is related to the level of income of the people living in the house (income-related rents) so that those on low incomes pay below market rents. Where a household's income is relatively high the rents are set at the market rate.\n\nIn addition to the provision of State housing the government also provides an Accommodation Supplement. This is payable as a contribution to rent, board or mortgage payments for qualifying people. The Accommodation Supplement is not paid to those paying income-related rents in a State house.\n\nIn some instances a person may also qualify for a rates rebate to help with the cost of local government rates.\n\n==Social security==\nSocial security benefits are administered by [[Work and Income]]. As of July 2013, they include:\n\n*'''Child Disability Allowance''' \u2013 for people providing full-time care for a child or young person (under 18) with a disability\n*'''Jobseeker Support''' \u2013 for unemployed people aged 18 and over looking for employment. Formerly ''Unemployment Benefit''.\n*'''New Zealand Superannuation''' \u2013 for people aged 65 and above.\n*'''Orphan's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents because they are deceased, incapacitated or can't be located.\n*'''[[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Sole Parent Support]]''' \u2013 for [[single parent]]s aged 19 and over, who are caring for children aged under 14. Formerly ''Domestic Purposes Benefit - Sole Parent''.\n*'''Supported Living Payment''' \u2013 for people who cannot work due to disability, and people providing full-time care for someone 18 and over with a disability. \n*'''Unsupported Child's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents due to a family breakdown.\n*'''Veteran's Pension''' \u2013 for people who have served in the New Zealand Defence Force during a war or emergency and have a war-related disability.\n*'''Young Parent Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201318 and caring for children aged under 14, who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n*'''Youth Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201317 who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n\n=== Unemployment Benefit (Jobseeker Support)===\n====Unemployment Act 1930====\nIn 1930, while Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was in London for the [[1930 Imperial Conference]], the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]] Government passed the Unemployment Act, promising relief payments to those who registered as unemployed. Upon his return to New Zealand in January 1931, Forbes announced there would be no payments made without work, meaning those registered would have to participate in government 'make work' schemes such as building roads and working on farms or in forestry projects. When the register was opened in February, 23,000 people put their names down; by June the number of registered unemployed had risen to 51,000 as the [[Great Depression]] worsened. The register did not include women, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], or boys under 16.

It provides State financial support primarily for single parents, irrespective of whether the other parent is contributing to maintenance payments (a feature of earlier legislation) and irrespective of fault. While there is a Widow's Benefit for women with children whose partner has died, this is not available to men.\n\nUntil July 2013, there are three forms of Domestic Purposes Benefit:\n* DPB \u2013 Sole Parent\n* DPB \u2013 Care for the Sick or Infirm\n* DPB \u2013 Woman Alone\n\nThe rate of payment of a DPB is greater than the rate paid for the Unemployment Benefit and the Sickness Benefit. The rate of payment for the DPB: Care for the Sick or Infirm is the same as for the Invalid's Benefit.\n\nPeople receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent are encouraged to name the other partner and to seek [[child support]] payments. There is a financial penalty for Sole Parents (section 70A of the [[Social Security Act 1964]]) who do not seek child support without sufficient reason. Any child support payments are generally used to offset the State cost of the DPB payment, with any excess going to the sole parent.\n\nAt the end of December 2012, 109,118 people were receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent, of which around 12% were male.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html |title= Benefit Fact sheets |publisher= Ministry of Social Development New Zealand |accessdate= 12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the DPB Women Alone and DPB Care for the Sick or Infirm were removed, with those on them moving to the unemployment benefit (Jobseeker Support) and the new Supported Living Payment respectively. The DPB Sole Parent was renamed \"Sole Parent Support\" at the same time.\n\n===Health benefits (Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit)===\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nTwo types of health benefits were introduced with the 1938 legislation, the Invalid's Benefit and the Sickness Benefit.\n\nThe Invalid's Benefit is paid to those permanently incapacitated or totally blind (excluding those already receiving an age benefit). An applicant must have been at least 16 years of age and residentially qualified. The applicant was residentially qualified when their incapacity arose in New Zealand or they were resident in New Zealand on 4 September 1936 and had lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years immediately before applying for the benefit. In 2007 the residence requirement was set at two years.\n\nThe Sickness Benefit is payable to those who are temporarily incapacitated from working through sickness or accident, excluding the first seven days of incapacity. To qualify, an applicant must have suffered a loss of salary, wages, or other earnings, and have resided in New Zealand for at least 12 months. The rate of benefit at the time it was introduced could not exceed the loss of earnings through incapacity. The rate now is currently the same as the Unemployment Benefit. As with other benefits introduced in 1938, the applicant had to be over 16 years of age.<ref name=socialsecurityact />\n\n====Controversies====\nIn recent years the government has been accused of exaggerating drops in unemployment by transferring people to Sickness Benefits,<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment on the drop, labour shortage a downside | work = Gisborne Herald | url = http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article.asp?aid=7434&iid=583&sud=27 | date = 29 November 2006}}</ref> welfare commentator Lindsay Mitchell wrote in an October 2006 press release \"There is a constant flow between benefits.

It was progressively implemented between October 2004 and April 2007.\n\nThe package, which commenced operating on 1 April 2005, has three primary aims: to make work pay; to ensure income adequacy; and to support people into work. It replaced the system known as Family Support as well as the child components of the main social welfare benefits. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was renamed the Minimum Family Tax Credit and the level of support was changed to encourage working families to leave the benefit system.\n\nThe Working for Families package includes several components:\n\n* Working for Families [[Tax credits]]\n* increases in Childcare Assistance\n* increases in Accommodation Supplement payments\n* changes to some benefit rules\n\nBecause parts of the package use tax credits it is also delivered by the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].\n\nThe package is thought to cover approximately 75% of all families with dependent children.\n\n==Minimum wage==\nThe minimum wage is in two forms \u2013 the standard wage for all workers (considered adults) over the age of 18, and new entrants wage for young people aged 16 and 17.\n\nThe minimum wage rates are reviewed every year and are gross amounts before tax.. As of 1 April 2019, the adult minimum wage rate that applies to employees aged 18 or over is $17.70 per hour. The new entrants minimum rate is $14.16 per hour, and this applies to 16 and 17 year olds for the first three months of employment, after which they become eligible for the adult minimum wage rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/workers-rights/minimum-wage/|title=Minimum wage|publisher=Employment New Zealand|accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n==History of changes==\n=== Liberal Government reforms ===\nAmong the early forms of social welfare in New Zealand was the old age pension, introduced by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] in 1898. The scheme was introduced to avoid what MP [[William Pember Reeves]] described as the \"worst social evils and miseries\" referring to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[workhouse]]s where the elderly lived in spartan institutional circumstances. The pension scheme was non-contributory and was available only to the \"deserving poor\"; men and women who had become destitute through no fault of their own. The prime responsibility for protecting individuals from the hazards of sickness and unemployment lay with individuals themselves, their families and various charity organisations.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n \nA decade later a widows' pension was introduced for women with children who had lost their husbands. The Liberals also passed the Workers Dwellings Act in 1905 allowing the government to buy land, build houses, and rent them to workers and their families. The small-scale scheme that resulted from this legislation can be seen as a precursor to the much larger state housing introduced by the first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government in the 1930s.<ref name=king>''The Penguin History of New Zealand'' Michael King Penguin Books (NZ) 2005. pp. 269\u2013270, 346\u201347, 356\u201359,466</ref>\n\n=== First Labour Government ===\nThe [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] was won by the first Labour government. A regular [[unemployment benefit]] was introduced with the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938. Under the Act the Government introduced a raft of social welfare benefits, mostly means tested, that were more generous and covered more people than before. The welfare state they created was a male wage-earners welfare state. Alongside policies to create full employment were policies to set fair wages sufficient for a man to provide for a family.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n=== Change in approach in the 1980s ===\nBy 1984 the political culture changed, with social welfare targeted according to need, not distributed universally according to citizenship. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] did not overtly change the main welfare system, however, real expenditure per benefit recipient fell. Some benefits were removed such as the unemployment benefit for under 18-year olds and funding for state housing was cut back.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\">''New Zealand Politics in Transition'' edited by Raymond Miller Oxford University Press (NZ) 1997. p. 256-267</ref> These changes were somewhat ad hoc in nature.\n\n=== Cutbacks of the 1990s ===\n{{main|Ruthanasia}}\nIn the early 1990s the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]] embarked on a [[free market]] programme aimed at reducing public spending and 'dependence on the state'. Welfare benefits were drastically cut in December 1990  and 'user-pays' charges were introduced for many formerly free public services. As a result these policies were widely known as \"Ruthanasia\" after [[Finance Minister (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Ruth Richardson]], although the welfare portfolio was managed by Social Welfare Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] who oversaw major cuts in her portfolio and abolished the Universal Family Benefit. An attempt in 1994 to end the Special Benefit was opposed by the Labour Party (who ostensibly abolished it in 2004) and community organisations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 7)| work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of these changes was particularly pronounced as the unemployment rate was high due to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stockmarket crash]] and the cost-cutting programmes of the previous [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]], which had reduced the staff of many state services. The cutbacks were, however, only partially reversed by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|fifth Labour government]] but inflation meant that in real terms benefits are still lower before April 1991.\n\nBy this time the Government had moved away from a policy of full employment and universal welfare to a more targeted system. The programme of reforms had a bias in favour of families, in particular working families and were intended to make it more attractive for beneficiaries to move into the workforce.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n===Work focused support in the 21st century===\n\nAnnounced in October 2006 the Working New Zealand reform includes changes to the service delivery of [[Work and Income New Zealand|Work and Income]] and changes to the Social Security Act 1964. Amending legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] in June 2007 including introducing a 'Purpose and Principles' section.\n\nThe government says<ref>{{cite web | title = Government press release Working New Zealand | work = [[New Zealand Ministry of Social Development|Ministry of Social Development]] | url = http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-10-26.html}}</ref> the changes will introduce an intensive employment support to every New Zealander who is receiving a benefit and is able to work.\n\nWorking New Zealand involved:\n\n*extending employment assistance to Independent Youth, [[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Domestic Purposes]], Sickness and Invalid's Benefit clients\n*setting stronger work expectations for clients in some circumstances\n*providing targeted employment initiatives to reduce the high [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Unemployment Benefit rate\n*offering a Job Search Service for all work-ready clients\n*continuing to align rules and criteria of different benefits.\n\nFrom September 2007 there have been a number of changes to the delivery of welfare benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training or education. People applying for the Unemployment Benefit will be required to undertake work or training-related activities in the period between their first contact with Work and Income and their benefit commencing. They will also be required to look for and accept any offer of suitable work during that time.<ref name=\"Social Security Amendment Bill\"/>\nSimilar new measures will also apply to people on Sickness and Invalid Benefits, and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.\n\n'''Criticisms'''\n\nIn 2004 the Special Benefit was abolished and replaced with a new Temporary Support Assistance, this attracted criticism from the Child Poverty Action Group.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 2) | work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref> Related new measures were also criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' \"Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that we want to work, but we want the appropriate kind of work\".<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\"/>\n\nSusan St John and Louise Humpage have also commented that the changes \"wipes away any notion that our social security system is about ensuring everyone can participate as citizens.

However, this did not eventuate before the November 2008 general election. After the election, the newly elected National Government proposed and implemented alternative reforms under the title \"Future Focus\" and established a Welfare Working Group to report on further reforms.\n\n===Historical welfare trends in New Zealand===\n\nThe benefit level for a married couple in relation to earnings in New Zealand (1961\u201378):<ref>Social Policy and the Welfare State in New Zealand by Brian Easton</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

It is concerned with the provision by the state of benefits and services. Together with fiscal welfare and [[occupational welfare]], it makes up the [[social policy]] of New Zealand. [[Social welfare]] is mostly funded through general taxation. Since the 1980s welfare has been provided on the basis of need; the exception is universal superannuation.\n\n== State housing ==\n{{main|State housing}}\nThe government provides State housing to those in need. The number of houses owned by the State has varied over the years and between different governments. Currently the level of rent paid in state housing is related to the level of income of the people living in the house (income-related rents) so that those on low incomes pay below market rents. Where a household's income is relatively high the rents are set at the market rate.\n\nIn addition to the provision of State housing the government also provides an Accommodation Supplement. This is payable as a contribution to rent, board or mortgage payments for qualifying people. The Accommodation Supplement is not paid to those paying income-related rents in a State house.\n\nIn some instances a person may also qualify for a rates rebate to help with the cost of local government rates.\n\n==Social security==\nSocial security benefits are administered by [[Work and Income]]. As of July 2013, they include:\n\n*'''Child Disability Allowance''' \u2013 for people providing full-time care for a child or young person (under 18) with a disability\n*'''Jobseeker Support''' \u2013 for unemployed people aged 18 and over looking for employment. Formerly ''Unemployment Benefit''.\n*'''New Zealand Superannuation''' \u2013 for people aged 65 and above.\n*'''Orphan's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents because they are deceased, incapacitated or can't be located.\n*'''[[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Sole Parent Support]]''' \u2013 for [[single parent]]s aged 19 and over, who are caring for children aged under 14. Formerly ''Domestic Purposes Benefit - Sole Parent''.\n*'''Supported Living Payment''' \u2013 for people who cannot work due to disability, and people providing full-time care for someone 18 and over with a disability. \n*'''Unsupported Child's Benefit''' \u2013 for people who are raising children who can't live with their parents due to a family breakdown.\n*'''Veteran's Pension''' \u2013 for people who have served in the New Zealand Defence Force during a war or emergency and have a war-related disability.\n*'''Young Parent Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201318 and caring for children aged under 14, who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n*'''Youth Payment''' \u2013 for young people aged 16\u201317 who can't live with their parents and are unsupported by them.\n\n=== Unemployment Benefit (Jobseeker Support)===\n====Unemployment Act 1930====\nIn 1930, while Prime Minister [[George Forbes (New Zealand politician)|George Forbes]] was in London for the [[1930 Imperial Conference]], the [[United Party (New Zealand)|United]] Government passed the Unemployment Act, promising relief payments to those who registered as unemployed. Upon his return to New Zealand in January 1931, Forbes announced there would be no payments made without work, meaning those registered would have to participate in government 'make work' schemes such as building roads and working on farms or in forestry projects. When the register was opened in February, 23,000 people put their names down; by June the number of registered unemployed had risen to 51,000 as the [[Great Depression]] worsened. The register did not include women, [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]], or boys under 16. In 1933 (by which time the number of unemployed had reached 80,000), MP [[Gordon Coates]] introduced the Small Farms (Relief of Unemployment) Bill to help turn unemployed workers into small farmers.<ref name=king />\n\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nAfter winning the [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] the newly elected Labour government immediately issued a Christmas bonus to the unemployed.<ref name=king /> However, a regular [[unemployment benefit]] was not introduced until the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938; that benefit was \"payable to a person 16 years of age and over who has been in New Zealand for at least 12 months and is unemployed, is capable of and willing to undertake suitable work, and has taken reasonable steps to secure employment\".<ref name=socialsecurityact>{{cite web | title = Social Security \u2013 Scope of Legislation of 1938 | work = Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand | url = http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/S/SocialSecurity/ScopeOfLegislationOf1938/en}}</ref>\n\n====Today====\nThe criteria for receiving an unemployment benefit remain similar to the original 1938 legislation. At 1 December 2011, a person could get Unemployment Benefit if they were:\n* not in full-time work\n* available for, and looking for full-time work\n* over 18 years of age (or 16\u201317 if they are married or in a civil union or in a de facto relationship and have one or more children they support)\n* be a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident\n* have lived in New Zealand for at least 2 years at any one time since becoming a New Zealand citizen or resident (unless you are a refugee)\n* normally living in New Zealand and intending to stay there.\nThey might still qualify if they were a full-time trainee on an approved work related course (usually less than 12 weeks) and looking for work.\n\nThe Unemployment Benefit gross rate at 1 April 2011 ranged between $150.01 and $375.04 a week depending on the applicant's age and living situation.<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment Benefit rate | work = Work and Income New Zealand | url = http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130223035200/http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/manuals-and-procedures/deskfile/main_benefits_rates/unemployment_benefit_tables.htm| url-status = dead| archive-date = 2013-02-23}}</ref>\n\nFrom September 2007 there has been a number of changes to the delivery of unemployment benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15- to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training, or education.

Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.

It provides State financial support primarily for single parents, irrespective of whether the other parent is contributing to maintenance payments (a feature of earlier legislation) and irrespective of fault. While there is a Widow's Benefit for women with children whose partner has died, this is not available to men.\n\nUntil July 2013, there are three forms of Domestic Purposes Benefit:\n* DPB \u2013 Sole Parent\n* DPB \u2013 Care for the Sick or Infirm\n* DPB \u2013 Woman Alone\n\nThe rate of payment of a DPB is greater than the rate paid for the Unemployment Benefit and the Sickness Benefit. The rate of payment for the DPB: Care for the Sick or Infirm is the same as for the Invalid's Benefit.\n\nPeople receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent are encouraged to name the other partner and to seek [[child support]] payments. There is a financial penalty for Sole Parents (section 70A of the [[Social Security Act 1964]]) who do not seek child support without sufficient reason. Any child support payments are generally used to offset the State cost of the DPB payment, with any excess going to the sole parent.\n\nAt the end of December 2012, 109,118 people were receiving DPB \u2013 Sole Parent, of which around 12% were male.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html |title= Benefit Fact sheets: |publisher= Ministry of Social Development New Zealand |accessdate= 12 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, the DPB Women Alone and DPB Care for the Sick or Infirm were removed, with those on them moving to the unemployment benefit (Jobseeker Support) and the new Supported Living Payment respectively. The DPB Sole Parent was renamed \"Sole Parent Support\" at the same time.\n\n===Health benefits (Sickness Benefit and Invalid's Benefit)===\n====Social Security Act 1938====\nTwo types of health benefits were introduced with the 1938 legislation, the Invalid's Benefit and the Sickness Benefit.\n\nThe Invalid's Benefit is paid to those permanently incapacitated or totally blind (excluding those already receiving an age benefit). An applicant must have been at least 16 years of age and residentially qualified. The applicant was residentially qualified when their incapacity arose in New Zealand or they were resident in New Zealand on 4 September 1936 and had lived in New Zealand for at least 10 years immediately before applying for the benefit. In 2007 the residence requirement was set at two years.\n\nThe Sickness Benefit is payable to those who are temporarily incapacitated from working through sickness or accident, excluding the first seven days of incapacity. To qualify, an applicant must have suffered a loss of salary, wages, or other earnings, and have resided in New Zealand for at least 12 months. The rate of benefit at the time it was introduced could not exceed the loss of earnings through incapacity. The rate now is currently the same as the Unemployment Benefit. As with other benefits introduced in 1938, the applicant had to be over 16 years of age.<ref name=socialsecurityact />\n\n====Controversies====\nIn recent years the government has been accused of exaggerating drops in unemployment by transferring people to Sickness Benefits,<ref>{{cite web | title = Unemployment on the drop, labour shortage a downside | work = Gisborne Herald | url = http://www.gisborneherald.co.nz/article.asp?aid=7434&iid=583&sud=27 | date = 29 November 2006}}</ref> welfare commentator Lindsay Mitchell wrote in an October 2006 press release \"There is a constant flow between benefits. Taking this into account the net gain from the unemployment benefit to the sickness benefit over the five years to April 2005 was 20,870.

Those figures should finally put to rest the accusation that the Opposition spokesperson on social welfare consistently makes that these outstanding figures for the reduction in those on the unemployment benefit are as a result of a transfer to another benefit.

A family allowance was introduced in 1926, payable at two shillings a week for each child over two years old, but still subject to means testing. The Social Security Act of 1938 extended and modified existing pension arrangements, and added a social security tax to pay for them.<ref name=\"1966 History of Monetary Benefits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/W/WelfareServices/HistoryOfMonetaryBenefits/en|title=History of Monetary Benefits}}</ref>\n\n{{rquote|right|A woman with two children received the equivalent of at least a full day's pay for a labourer as benefits, unlike wages, were not taxed.

The social security tax was raised but this was compensated for by the dropping of the national security (war) tax.

It was progressively implemented between October 2004 and April 2007.\n\nThe package, which commenced operating on 1 April 2005, has three primary aims: to make work pay; to ensure income adequacy; and to support people into work. It replaced the system known as Family Support as well as the child components of the main social welfare benefits. The Guaranteed Minimum Family Income was renamed the Minimum Family Tax Credit and the level of support was changed to encourage working families to leave the benefit system.\n\nThe Working for Families package includes several components:\n\n* Working for Families [[Tax credits]]\n* increases in Childcare Assistance\n* increases in Accommodation Supplement payments\n* changes to some benefit rules\n\nBecause parts of the package use tax credits it is also delivered by the [[Inland Revenue Department (New Zealand)|Inland Revenue Department]].\n\nThe package is thought to cover approximately 75% of all families with dependent children.\n\n==Minimum wage==\nThe minimum wage is in two forms \u2013 the standard wage for all workers (considered adults) over the age of 18, and new entrants wage for young people aged 16 and 17.\n\nThe minimum wage rates are reviewed every year and are gross amounts before tax.. As of 1 April 2019, the adult minimum wage rate that applies to employees aged 18 or over is $17.70 per hour. The new entrants minimum rate is $14.16 per hour, and this applies to 16 and 17 year olds for the first three months of employment, after which they become eligible for the adult minimum wage rate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govt.nz/browse/work/workers-rights/minimum-wage/|title=Minimum wage|publisher=Employment New Zealand|accessdate=19 December 2019}}</ref>\n{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}\n\n==History of changes==\n=== Liberal Government reforms ===\nAmong the early forms of social welfare in New Zealand was the old age pension, introduced by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand|Liberal Government]] in 1898. The scheme was introduced to avoid what MP [[William Pember Reeves]] described as the \"worst social evils and miseries\" referring to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[workhouse]]s where the elderly lived in spartan institutional circumstances. The pension scheme was non-contributory and was available only to the \"deserving poor\"; men and women who had become destitute through no fault of their own. The prime responsibility for protecting individuals from the hazards of sickness and unemployment lay with individuals themselves, their families and various charity organisations.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n \nA decade later a widows' pension was introduced for women with children who had lost their husbands. The Liberals also passed the Workers Dwellings Act in 1905 allowing the government to buy land, build houses, and rent them to workers and their families. The small-scale scheme that resulted from this legislation can be seen as a precursor to the much larger state housing introduced by the first [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] government in the 1930s.<ref name=king>''The Penguin History of New Zealand'' Michael King Penguin Books (NZ) 2005. pp. 269\u2013270, 346\u201347, 356\u201359,466</ref>\n\n=== First Labour Government ===\nThe [[1935 New Zealand general election|1935 election]] was won by the first Labour government. A regular [[unemployment benefit]] was introduced with the passing of the [[Social Security Act 1938|Social Security Act]] in 1938. Under the Act the Government introduced a raft of social welfare benefits, mostly means tested, that were more generous and covered more people than before. The welfare state they created was a male wage-earners welfare state. Alongside policies to create full employment were policies to set fair wages sufficient for a man to provide for a family.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n=== Change in approach in the 1980s ===\nBy 1984 the political culture changed, with social welfare targeted according to need, not distributed universally according to citizenship. The [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]] did not overtly change the main welfare system, however, real expenditure per benefit recipient fell. Some benefits were removed such as the unemployment benefit for under 18-year olds and funding for state housing was cut back.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\">''New Zealand Politics in Transition'' edited by Raymond Miller Oxford University Press (NZ) 1997. p. 256-267</ref> These changes were somewhat ad hoc in nature.\n\n=== Cutbacks of the 1990s ===\n{{main|Ruthanasia}}\nIn the early 1990s the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|fourth National government]] embarked on a [[free market]] programme aimed at reducing public spending and 'dependence on the state'. Welfare benefits were drastically cut in December 1990  and 'user-pays' charges were introduced for many formerly free public services. As a result these policies were widely known as \"Ruthanasia\" after [[Finance Minister (New Zealand)|Finance Minister]] [[Ruth Richardson]], although the welfare portfolio was managed by Social Welfare Minister [[Jenny Shipley]] who oversaw major cuts in her portfolio and abolished the Universal Family Benefit. An attempt in 1994 to end the Special Benefit was opposed by the Labour Party (who ostensibly abolished it in 2004) and community organisations.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 7)| work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe impact of these changes was particularly pronounced as the unemployment rate was high due to the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stockmarket crash]] and the cost-cutting programmes of the previous [[Fourth Labour Government of New Zealand|fourth Labour government]], which had reduced the staff of many state services. The cutbacks were, however, only partially reversed by the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|fifth Labour government]] but inflation meant that in real terms benefits are still lower before April 1991.\n\nBy this time the Government had moved away from a policy of full employment and universal welfare to a more targeted system. The programme of reforms had a bias in favour of families, in particular working families and were intended to make it more attractive for beneficiaries to move into the workforce.<ref name=\"Politics in Transition\"/>\n\n===Work focused support in the 21st century===\n\nAnnounced in October 2006 the Working New Zealand reform includes changes to the service delivery of [[Work and Income New Zealand|Work and Income]] and changes to the Social Security Act 1964. Amending legislation was passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] in June 2007 including introducing a 'Purpose and Principles' section.\n\nThe government says<ref>{{cite web | title = Government press release Working New Zealand | work = [[New Zealand Ministry of Social Development|Ministry of Social Development]] | url = http://www.msd.govt.nz/media-information/press-releases/2006/pr-2006-10-26.html}}</ref> the changes will introduce an intensive employment support to every New Zealander who is receiving a benefit and is able to work.\n\nWorking New Zealand involved:\n\n*extending employment assistance to Independent Youth, [[Domestic Purposes Benefit|Domestic Purposes]], Sickness and Invalid's Benefit clients\n*setting stronger work expectations for clients in some circumstances\n*providing targeted employment initiatives to reduce the high [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] Unemployment Benefit rate\n*offering a Job Search Service for all work-ready clients\n*continuing to align rules and criteria of different benefits.\n\nFrom September 2007 there have been a number of changes to the delivery of welfare benefits, the changes focus mainly on youth with a goal of having all 15-year-olds to 19-year-olds engaged in employment, training or education. People applying for the Unemployment Benefit will be required to undertake work or training-related activities in the period between their first contact with Work and Income and their benefit commencing. They will also be required to look for and accept any offer of suitable work during that time.<ref name=\"Social Security Amendment Bill\"/>\nSimilar new measures will also apply to people on Sickness and Invalid Benefits, and the Domestic Purposes Benefit. Beneficiaries could have their benefits cut by up to 50% if they fail to comply.\n\n'''Criticisms'''\n\nIn 2004 the Special Benefit was abolished and replaced with a new Temporary Support Assistance, this attracted criticism from the Child Poverty Action Group.<ref>{{cite web | title = Working for families - A benefit cut (pg 2) | work = [[Child Poverty Action Group (Aotearoa New Zealand)|Child Poverty Action Group]] | url = https://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/Wgtn%20People's%20Centre.pdf}}</ref> Related new measures were also criticised by the DPA (formerly Disabled Persons Assembly) a spokesperson told the ''[[New Zealand Herald]]'' \"Disabled people have been telling Social Welfare for years that we want to work, but we want the appropriate kind of work\".<ref name=\"nzherald.co.nz\"/>\n\nSusan St John and Louise Humpage have also commented that the changes \"wipes away any notion that our social security system is about ensuring everyone can participate as citizens. Instead, it makes getting people into a job, any job, the fundamental duty of citizenship.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = A bill the poor will pay for | work = The New Zealand Herald | url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/466/story.cfm?c_id=466&objectid=10444701 | date = 11 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nFurther changes were expected, including further [[welfare benefit simplification]] in 2008. However, this did not eventuate before the November 2008 general election. After the election, the newly elected National Government proposed and implemented alternative reforms under the title \"Future Focus\" and established a Welfare Working Group to report on further reforms.\n\n===Historical welfare trends in New Zealand===\n\nThe benefit level for a married couple in relation to earnings in New Zealand (1961\u201378):<ref>Social Policy and the Welfare State in New Zealand by Brian Easton</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: right\"\n|-\n!

In an unprecedented move they committed most of ''King Kong's'' promotional budget to television spots. The re-release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. ''King Kong'' generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had.<ref name=Erb/> Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year.<ref name=Morton/> It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon.

One channel in New York showed the film seventeen times in a single week, with each showing topping the ratings. From then on, the film was a television mainstay that captured many new fans.<ref name=Morton/>\n\nThere is a reference to the real-world revival and massive success of ''King Kong'' in the 1950s in the 1959 movie ''[[A Summer Place (film)|A Summer Place]]''. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents that they are going to a classic movie showing of ''King Kong'', when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls ''King Kong'' \"one of those wonderful old horror numbers.\" Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, \"It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end. That's the part everybody remembers.\".<ref name=Erb/> In 1974's ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'' [[Alonzo Hawk]] has been having nightmares about [[Herbie]]. During his [[dream sequence|nightmare sequence]] there is a ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like [[airplane|plane]]s flying around him and squirting [[oil]] until he falls off the [[Empire State Building]]. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the [[Daily Planet]] building.\n\nKing Kong reached the height of its public visibility in the twentieth century in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a nostalgic trend to 1930s Hollywood. ''King Kong'' was becoming a cult film with nostalgia value. During this period the character and story of King Kong was most frequently used as a parody in popular culture. The frequency of its use as a parody at this time shows how significant it had become in popular culture.<ref name=Erb/> In the 1968 film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the characters look in a room where a monster ape smashes through a window to get at a screaming woman on a bed. \"Do you think we're interrupting something?\" [[George Harrison|George]] nonchalantly comments of it, to which [[John Lennon|John]] replies, \"I think so.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s RKO began to license a series of King Kong-related products in response to a heavy demand from the public. These products included comic books, games, models, and posters. In 1969 most of the censored shots were found. In 1971 a version of ''King Kong'' with these long-missing portions returned to their proper places was released to [[art house]]s.\n\nReferences to King Kong in popular culture have been widespread since the 1960s. The references have different tones, with some being parodies while others are parodies or oppositional critiques. Some of these references are fleeting (for example, [[Frank Zappa]] named one of his more complex compositions with the Mothers of Invention after Kong), but nevertheless are evidence of King Kong's importance in popular culture. King Kong has been cited in films such as ''[[Morgan!]]'' (1966), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' (1987).<ref name=Erb/> In ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the song \"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\" pays homage to King Kong with the lyric: \"Then something went wrong for [[Fay Wray]] and King Kong ... they got caught in a celluloid jam.\" At the end of the film, Rocky carries Dr. Frankenfurter on the RKO logo, replicating what King Kong carrying Fay Wray in the climax of King Kong.\n\nIn 1965 ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]'', a [[political satire]] magazine, cohosted a publisher's party at the Empire State Building with [[Bantam Books]], who were reissuing [[Delos W. Lovelace]]'s novelization of ''King Kong''. A panel of ''Monocle'' satirists was due to give an ironic commentary on ''King Kong'', followed by a screening of the film. One of the titles on the satirists\u2019 program was \"King Kong to Viet Cong: Thirty Years of Gorilla Warfare\". [[Andy Warhol]], who was not on the guest list, used the occasion to generate publicity and create a performance by complaining to the press that ''King Kong'' should be screened with his own film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964). Warhol was permitted to show three minutes of ''Empire'' after ''King Kong''. ''Empire'' was then criticized in the press for being too dull and being upstaged by ''King Kong''.<ref name = Erb/>\n\nBy the 1970s the character of King Kong was constantly referenced in cartoons and jokes. In a 1972 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoon, a man at a cocktail party atop the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] comments that he is impressed that it was \"finished so quickly and without incident,\" while King Kong climbs up the building below him. It was at this time that the film began to be studied by academics and film theoreticians, who found hidden subtexts and symbolic meanings in the film. However, [[Merian C. Cooper]] maintained that the film was nothing more than a simple adventure story.<ref name=Morton/>\n\n[[Thomas Pynchon]], in his post-modern 1973 novel, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', treats the King Kong/[[Ann Darrow]] relationship as an obvious metaphor for Americans' historical racist paranoia of black men dating white women.  He quotes the fictional film reviewer, Mitchel Prettyplace, from his \"definitive 18-volume study of King Kong\", which includes \"even interviews with King Kong Kultists, who to be eligible for the group must have seen the movie at least 100 times and be prepared to pass an 8-hour entrance exam.\"\n\nKing Kong influenced the 1974 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]\", where the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] and his friends in [[UNIT (Doctor Who)|UNIT]] must stop Experimental Prototype Robot K-1 aiding the evil Scientific Reform Society in conquering the world. In homage to King Kong, K-1 falls for the Doctor's friend [[Sarah Jane Smith]], and views her as the one human being it is willing to spare from destruction. When the Doctor is forced to destroy K-1 with a metal-eating virus, Sarah is visibly saddened.\n\nAfter the highly promoted but vastly inferior 1976 remake of ''King Kong'', [[Elliot Stein]] wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to ''King Kong'' called \"My Life with Kong\" in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Stein was one of the most famous of the \"Kongophiles\" along with [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] and [[Jean Boullet]]. In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen ''King Kong'' during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like [[Radio City Music Hall]], and the [[RKO Roxy]] and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an [[art deco]] retrospective of ''King Kong'' at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a ''King Kong'' homage was staged for the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in the 1970s.<ref name=Erb/> King Kong was also mentioned by name by [[Kermit the Frog]] in lyrics from the song \"I Hope that Something Better Comes Along\" from ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'': ''\"She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something better comes along.\"''\n\nAdditionally, King Kong is one of the epithets [[Redd Foxx]]'s character, Fred G. Sanford, from ''[[Sanford and Son (TV series)|Sanford and Son]]'' used referring to his sister-in-law Esther.\n\nThe corpse of King Kong, said to be a leftover prop, appears in the 1978 film ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]'', where a small [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] is found inside of it.\n\n==1980s to the present ==\n''King Kong'' was the first film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' was actually the first\u2014although it featured a rampaging ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' rather than a non-science-based monster\u2014but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film that has been made since 1933. These include ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).<ref name=Jones/> The dinosaur scenes from ''King Kong'' are referenced or mimicked in the three ''Jurassic Park'' films, especially the second film, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'') is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called ''The Venture'', which is the name of the ship in ''King Kong''). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in ''King Kong'', [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character asks, \"What have they got in there, King Kong?\" In the third film in this series, a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' vs. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fight is similar to the Kong\u2013rex battle in the original and the second remake.<ref name=Hirschman>Hirschman, Elizabeth C., 2000, ''Heroes, Monster & Messiahs'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7407-0485-0}}.</ref>\n[[File:kinghomer.jpg|thumb|[[Homer Simpson]] as [[King Kong]].

This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials.<ref name=Jones/> A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring ''Simpsons'' characters, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as Kong, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as Ann Darrow and [[Mr. Burns]] as [[Carl Denham]]. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people; at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for \"[[Deep, Deep Trouble]]\" from ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening [[couch gag]] of \"[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]].\" Homer grabs Marge from the couch and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes.<ref name=Erb/> King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of [[Marge Simpson]]) in the episode \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\". The character also appeared in video games such as ''[[Bart's Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Treehouse of Horror (video game)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode \"[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]\", where Mr. Burns captures the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.<ref name=Snpp>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911091156/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 |date=2007-09-11 }} episode capsule at [[The Simpsons Archive]].</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'' episode \"Hostile Makeover\", Jenny is turned into a Neanderthal and gorilla-like monster; when the cameras flashed their lights to take pictures of her, she roared.\n\nIn the second ''[[Futurama]]'' film, ''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]'' Richard Nixon's head remarks about an alien invasion that King Kong is \"too old to save us this time\", and the camera pans to an elderly King Kong holding Ann Darrow's skeleton.\n\nKing Kong is often used in commercial culture, for example in advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Energizer Batteries]].<ref name=Erb/><ref name=Morton/> A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life.<ref name=Morton/> A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) to get rid of the [[Energizer Bunny]] for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with [[biplanes]] flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling.<ref name=Sweet>Sweet, Leonard, 2001, ''Soultsunami: Sink Or Swim in New Millennium Culture'', Zondervan, {{ISBN|0-310-24312-2}}.</ref> In 1990 [[Kongfrontation]] became one of the original rides at [[Universal Studios Florida]].\n\nThe film character was the inspiration for the 1981 [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and subsequent spin-offs. In the game, the hero must rescue his girlfriend from the [[Donkey Kong (character)|eponymous ape]]. The marauding ape climbs a huge structure after kidnapping the woman, as in the film. The game's creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], intended the name \"Donkey Kong\" to mean \"stubborn gorilla\". [[MCA/Universal]] attempted to sue Nintendo for [[copyright infringement]] in ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', claiming that the game infringed its copyright for the film. However, they lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages when it was discovered that King Kong was in fact in the [[public domain]] at that time and that MCA/Universal knew this when they filed the lawsuit.

''[[Time magazine]]'' named it \"Movie of the Year\". The film's studio [[RKO]] tried an experimental reissue of ''King Kong'' in the Midwest United States in 1952. In an unprecedented move they committed most of ''King Kong's'' promotional budget to television spots. The re-release was an enormous success, with the film attracting triple the usual business in its markets. This showed that television was a powerful tool for promotion. ''King Kong'' generated more box office receipts than the original 1933 release had.<ref name=Erb/> Theatre owners named it Picture of the Year.<ref name=Morton/> It was at this time that King Kong acquired its reputation as a popular culture phenomenon. The two most significant spinoffs of King Kong in this period were ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949) and ''Godzilla'' (1954). Godzilla was inspired by King Kong's popularity in Japan. Godzilla revived and reconfigured parts of the King Kong story more powerfully than any other spinoff has.<ref name=Erb/> RKO theatrically re-released ''King Kong'' for the last time in 1956.\n\n''King Kong'' was sold to television after the conclusion of the 1956 release. One channel in New York showed the film seventeen times in a single week, with each showing topping the ratings. From then on, the film was a television mainstay that captured many new fans.<ref name=Morton/>\n\nThere is a reference to the real-world revival and massive success of ''King Kong'' in the 1950s in the 1959 movie ''[[A Summer Place (film)|A Summer Place]]''. In the movie, two teenagers, Molly and Johnny, tell their parents that they are going to a classic movie showing of ''King Kong'', when they are actually going to an abandoned lookout. Molly calls ''King Kong'' \"one of those wonderful old horror numbers.\" Johnny frets that if he doesn't watch the movie, he might not be able to answer his parent's questions, but Molly tells him, \"It's kind of sad dreams If anybody asks, just tell 'em about the end.

During his [[dream sequence|nightmare sequence]] there is a ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]''-themed dream. Alonzo dreams he's Kong with Herbie-like [[airplane|plane]]s flying around him and squirting [[oil]] until he falls off the [[Empire State Building]]. In a Superman story, an ape grew to giant size and gained kryptonite vision due to meteors of kryptonite and uranium, and was called Titano the Super-Ape. This ape had a liking to Lois Lane, and in one story climbed up the [[Daily Planet]] building.\n\nKing Kong reached the height of its public visibility in the twentieth century in the 1960s and 1970s, as part of a nostalgic trend to 1930s Hollywood. ''King Kong'' was becoming a cult film with nostalgia value. During this period the character and story of King Kong was most frequently used as a parody in popular culture. The frequency of its use as a parody at this time shows how significant it had become in popular culture.<ref name=Erb/> In the 1968 film ''[[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]]'', the characters look in a room where a monster ape smashes through a window to get at a screaming woman on a bed. \"Do you think we're interrupting something?\" [[George Harrison|George]] nonchalantly comments of it, to which [[John Lennon|John]] replies, \"I think so.\"\n\nIn the mid-1960s RKO began to license a series of King Kong-related products in response to a heavy demand from the public. These products included comic books, games, models, and posters. In 1969 most of the censored shots were found. In 1971 a version of ''King Kong'' with these long-missing portions returned to their proper places was released to [[art house]]s.\n\nReferences to King Kong in popular culture have been widespread since the 1960s. The references have different tones, with some being parodies while others are parodies or oppositional critiques. Some of these references are fleeting (for example, [[Frank Zappa]] named one of his more complex compositions with the Mothers of Invention after Kong), but nevertheless are evidence of King Kong's importance in popular culture. King Kong has been cited in films such as ''[[Morgan!]]'' (1966), ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'' (1975), and ''[[Amazon Women on the Moon]]'' (1987).<ref name=Erb/> In ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show'', the song \"[[Science Fiction/Double Feature]]\" pays homage to King Kong with the lyric: \"Then something went wrong for [[Fay Wray]] and King Kong ... they got caught in a celluloid jam.\" At the end of the film, Rocky carries Dr. Frankenfurter on the RKO logo, replicating what King Kong carrying Fay Wray in the climax of King Kong.\n\nIn 1965 ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]'', a [[political satire]] magazine, cohosted a publisher's party at the Empire State Building with [[Bantam Books]], who were reissuing [[Delos W. Lovelace]]'s novelization of ''King Kong''. A panel of ''Monocle'' satirists was due to give an ironic commentary on ''King Kong'', followed by a screening of the film. One of the titles on the satirists\u2019 program was \"King Kong to Viet Cong: Thirty Years of Gorilla Warfare\". [[Andy Warhol]], who was not on the guest list, used the occasion to generate publicity and create a performance by complaining to the press that ''King Kong'' should be screened with his own film ''[[Empire (1964 film)|Empire]]'' (1964). Warhol was permitted to show three minutes of ''Empire'' after ''King Kong''. ''Empire'' was then criticized in the press for being too dull and being upstaged by ''King Kong''.<ref name = Erb/>\n\nBy the 1970s the character of King Kong was constantly referenced in cartoons and jokes. In a 1972 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoon, a man at a cocktail party atop the newly constructed [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] comments that he is impressed that it was \"finished so quickly and without incident,\" while King Kong climbs up the building below him. It was at this time that the film began to be studied by academics and film theoreticians, who found hidden subtexts and symbolic meanings in the film. However, [[Merian C. Cooper]] maintained that the film was nothing more than a simple adventure story.<ref name=Morton/>\n\n[[Thomas Pynchon]], in his post-modern 1973 novel, ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'', treats the King Kong/[[Ann Darrow]] relationship as an obvious metaphor for Americans' historical racist paranoia of black men dating white women.  He quotes the fictional film reviewer, Mitchel Prettyplace, from his \"definitive 18-volume study of King Kong\", which includes \"even interviews with King Kong Kultists, who to be eligible for the group must have seen the movie at least 100 times and be prepared to pass an 8-hour entrance exam.\"\n\nKing Kong influenced the 1974 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story \"[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]\", where the [[Fourth Doctor|Doctor]] and his friends in [[UNIT (Doctor Who)|UNIT]] must stop Experimental Prototype Robot K-1 aiding the evil Scientific Reform Society in conquering the world. In homage to King Kong, K-1 falls for the Doctor's friend [[Sarah Jane Smith]], and views her as the one human being it is willing to spare from destruction. When the Doctor is forced to destroy K-1 with a metal-eating virus, Sarah is visibly saddened.\n\nAfter the highly promoted but vastly inferior 1976 remake of ''King Kong'', [[Elliot Stein]] wrote a nostalgic fan homage essay to ''King Kong'' called \"My Life with Kong\" in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Stein was one of the most famous of the \"Kongophiles\" along with [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] and [[Jean Boullet]]. In the essay Stein talks about the contexts in which he has seen ''King Kong'' during his life, including in the 1930s in New York picture palaces like [[Radio City Music Hall]], and the [[RKO Roxy]] and in Paris with Jean Boullet in the 1950s. There was an [[art deco]] retrospective of ''King Kong'' at the Radio City Music Hall in the 1974 and a ''King Kong'' homage was staged for the [[Telluride Film Festival]] in the 1970s.<ref name=Erb/> King Kong was also mentioned by name by [[Kermit the Frog]] in lyrics from the song \"I Hope that Something Better Comes Along\" from ''[[The Muppet Movie]]'': ''\"She made a monkey out of old King Kong/I hope that something better comes along.\"''\n\nAdditionally, King Kong is one of the epithets [[Redd Foxx]]'s character, Fred G. Sanford, from ''[[Sanford and Son (TV series)|Sanford and Son]]'' used referring to his sister-in-law Esther.\n\nThe corpse of King Kong, said to be a leftover prop, appears in the 1978 film ''[[Bye Bye Monkey]]'', where a small [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] is found inside of it.\n\n== King Kong from the 1980s to the present ==\n''King Kong'' was the first film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' was actually the first\u2014although it featured a rampaging ''[[Brontosaurus]]'' rather than a non-science-based monster\u2014but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film that has been made since 1933. These include ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!|Godzilla]]'' (1954) and ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993).<ref name=Jones/> The dinosaur scenes from ''King Kong'' are referenced or mimicked in the three ''Jurassic Park'' films, especially the second film, ''[[The Lost World: Jurassic Park]]'' (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a ''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]'') is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called ''The Venture'', which is the name of the ship in ''King Kong''). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in ''King Kong'', [[Jeff Goldblum]]'s character asks, \"What have they got in there, King Kong?\" In the third film in this series, a ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' vs. ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' fight is similar to the Kong\u2013rex battle in the original and the second remake.<ref name=Hirschman>Hirschman, Elizabeth C., 2000, ''Heroes, Monster & Messiahs'', Andrews McMeel Publishing, {{ISBN|0-7407-0485-0}}.</ref>\n[[File:kinghomer.jpg|thumb|[[Homer Simpson]] as [[King Kong]]. From the \"King Homer\" segment of \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\". Courtesy of ''[[The Simpsons]]''.]]\n\nOne of the most frequently used images of King Kong in popular culture is the scene where King Kong and Ann Darrow are on top of the Empire State Building. This image has been copied or parodied in cartoons, comic books, horror films, and television commercials.<ref name=Jones/> A popular television spoof was the segment 'King Homer' from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode \"[[Treehouse of Horror III]]\", in which the King Kong story was retold featuring ''Simpsons'' characters, with [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] as Kong, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] as Ann Darrow and [[Mr. Burns]] as [[Carl Denham]]. The spoof follows the plot of the 1933 film closely; however, it ends with Marge marrying King Homer after he collapses in exhaustion, failing to climb beyond the second story of the Springfield State Building. King Kong's family, consisting of smaller apes, appear at the wedding, and Homer has a habit of eating people; at the end he eats Marge's father. King Homer also has a cameo in the music video for \"[[Deep, Deep Trouble]]\" from ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' CD, and years later, makes another appearance in the opening [[couch gag]] of \"[[Jazzy and the Pussycats]].\" Homer grabs Marge from the couch and scales the Empire State Building, all while fending off 1930s-style airplanes.<ref name=Erb/> King Homer (or Homer Kong) would reappear battling Bridezilla (a Godzilla version of [[Marge Simpson]]) in the episode \"[[Wedding for Disaster]]\". The character also appeared in video games such as ''[[Bart's Nightmare]]'' and ''[[Treehouse of Horror (video game)|Treehouse of Horror]]'' as well as various merchandise such as toys and T-shirts. The original film was referenced again on ''The Simpsons'' in the episode \"[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]\", where Mr. Burns captures the [[Loch Ness Monster]] and brings him back to America to entertain an audience; however, instead of the Monster going berserk during its debut, Burns himself is startled by the flash photography and causes the carnage.<ref name=Snpp>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 \"Monty Can't Buy Me Love\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911091156/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/AABF17 |date=2007-09-11 }} episode capsule at [[The Simpsons Archive]].</ref>\n\nIn the ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]'' episode \"Hostile Makeover\", Jenny is turned into a Neanderthal and gorilla-like monster; when the cameras flashed their lights to take pictures of her, she roared.\n\nIn the second ''[[Futurama]]'' film, ''[[The Beast With a Billion Backs]]'' Richard Nixon's head remarks about an alien invasion that King Kong is \"too old to save us this time\", and the camera pans to an elderly King Kong holding Ann Darrow's skeleton.\n\nKing Kong is often used in commercial culture, for example in advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Energizer Batteries]].<ref name=Erb/><ref name=Morton/> A New York insurance company used clips from the film to persuade people of the hazards of city life.<ref name=Morton/> A two-part Energizer Battery commercial had the 1933 Kong himself contracted by a rival battery corporation (SuperVolt) to get rid of the [[Energizer Bunny]] for them. The commercials were done in black-and-white, and used cleverly edited 1933 Kong sequences (possibly combined with new computer-generated Kong shots). The concluding second-part had Kong cornering the Bunny on the roof of a New York City building, complete with [[biplanes]] flying in the sky. His foot in an open window interrupts a couple that resemble Ann Darrow and Jack Driscoll having a romantic moment. The woman, extremely annoyed, slams the window on Kong's toes, making him lose his balance and grip, sending him falling.<ref name=Sweet>Sweet, Leonard, 2001, ''Soultsunami: Sink Or Swim in New Millennium Culture'', Zondervan, {{ISBN|0-310-24312-2}}.</ref> In 1990 [[Kongfrontation]] became one of the original rides at [[Universal Studios Florida]].\n\nThe film character was the inspiration for the 1981 [[Nintendo]] [[video game]] ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' and subsequent spin-offs. In the game, the hero must rescue his girlfriend from the [[Donkey Kong (character)|eponymous ape]]. The marauding ape climbs a huge structure after kidnapping the woman, as in the film. The game's creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], intended the name \"Donkey Kong\" to mean \"stubborn gorilla\". [[MCA/Universal]] attempted to sue Nintendo for [[copyright infringement]] in ''[[Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]'', claiming that the game infringed its copyright for the film. However, they lost and had to pay Nintendo $1.8 million in damages when it was discovered that King Kong was in fact in the [[public domain]] at that time and that MCA/Universal knew this when they filed the lawsuit. They did not own the copyright to ''King Kong'' and had not trademarked the name \"King Kong\".

Reggie Warrington (a comedian from earlier in the film) exclaims, \"Run for the hills, it's [[Godzilla|Fatzilla]]!

They set out to remake the movies, and one of them is ''King Kong''.\n\nIn [[The Mr. Men Show]] episode \"Skyscrapers\", he was seen carrying [[Little Miss Sunshine (character)|Little Miss Sunshine]] up a building.\n\nIn the ''[[Total Drama Action]]'' (2009\u20132010) episode \"Celebrity Manhunt's Total Drama Action Reunion Special\", the character Izzy plays a role as Ann Darrow and a monkey plays King Kong portraying a scene on the empire state building.\n\nIn the 25th Anniversary [[Super Sentai]] Series \"''[[Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger]]''\" (2001), one of the living [[Power Animal (Gaoranger)|Power Animal]] [[mecha]] is a large green gorilla called Gao Gorilla, which stands over 100&nbsp;ft. tall and is regularly seen in the series against the GaoRanger's enemy, the [[kaiju]] Orgu. The toy [[repaint]] of Gao Gorilla is featured prominently in the ''GaoRanger'' theatrical film in the same year, \"''[[Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger#The Fire Mountain Roars|Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger- The Movie: Fire Mountain Howls]]''\", and is called Gao Kong. The primarily-red colored Gao Kong makes his debut from out of the crater of an erupting [[volcano]], and forms the torso & head of the Hyakujuu Gattai Gao Knight giant robot combination. Both Gao Kong and Gao Knight are only seen in the movie, but are not mentioned or seen in the TV series.\n\nIn the anime-manga series ''[[Toriko]]'', the protagonist is a gourmet hunter whose job is to travel around the world to hunt the most delicious animals and creatures. One of the first animals Toriko faces is a group of giant four-armed gorillas named Trollkongs that are led by an elder and even larger one named Silverblack Trollkong. The name of these creatures and the idea of a giant ape are based on King Kong's concept.\n\nIn ''[[the Script]]'''s song, ''[[Hall of Fame]]'', it mentions King Kong (you can be King Kong banging on his chest).\n\nIn an episode of [[Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures]] \"Jurassic Pac\" It was shown in a parody where Pac-Man (In the style of King Kong) was seen carrying Cylindria up to a building (Empire State Building).\n\nIn [[The Fairly OddParents]] from the episode 'The Good Old Days', that King Kong was arrested by Carl Denham and others and in another episode, King Kong dealt that banana is for Remy Buxeplenty's get from a scavenger hunt.\n\nA special ''King Kong'' themed wine was put out by [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s winery in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.mercurynews.com/eat-drink-play/2016/08/22/king-kong-wine/ |title=Coppola releases a \u2018King Kong\u2019 wine|publisher=mercurynews |date=August 26, 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.francisfordcoppolawinery.com/wine/directors-great-movies/cabernet-sauvignon |title=Director's Great Movies.
