They put a young associate, Stu Billett, in charge of selling it, but the networks were not interested. Billett later went out on his own and refined the concept into a show shot in a studio rather than a real courtroom.  Small-claims court participants agreed to drop their court cases and accept binding arbitration in a simulated courtroom. The networks expressed interest, but still did not buy it; however, it did sell into the first-run [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grace|first=Roger|title='People's Court': the Show the Networks Spurned|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/reminiscing070303.htm|work=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>  The series was executive produced by [[Ralph Edwards]], who also created and hosted the documentary show ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', and Stu Billett, who later went on to create ''[[Moral Court]]''.  John Masterson, whom many consider a pioneer and originator of \"reality TV\" also created ''Bride and Groom'' and ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]''.\n\n''The People's Court'' is the first court show to use binding [[arbitration]], introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, ''The People's Court'' is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only [[Court show#List of originally nontraditional court shows|loosely related]] to judicial proceedings, except for one: ''[[Court show#List of originally nontraditional court shows|Parole]]'' (1959) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings.<ref>http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_&_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116141958/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_%26_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.pdf |date=2014-01-16 }}</ref> Prior to ''The People's Court'', the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used [[actor]]s, and [[Judge show#List of originally traditional court shows|recreated or fictional cases]] (as did [[Court show#Court show genre beginnings|radio before that]]). Among examples of these types of court shows include ''[[Famous Jury Trials]]'' and ''[[Your Witness (TV series)|Your Witness]]''.\n\n''The People's Court'' has had two incarnations. The show's first life was presided over solely by former [[Los Angeles County]] [[Superior Court]] Judge [[Joseph Wapner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/judge-joseph-wapner/|title=Judge Joseph Wapner|last=Troutman|first=Andrew|publisher=latimes.com|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/09/08/arts/tv-people-s-court-reality-in-the-morning.html \"TV: 'People's Court', 'Reality' in the Morning\"], ''New York Times'', September 8, 1981</ref> His tenure lasted from the show's debut on September 14, 1981, until May 17, 1993, when the show was cancelled due to low ratings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oR5efowlmdQ|title=People's Court Final Airing 5-17-93|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=17 October 2016}}</ref>  This left the show with a total of 2,484 half-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being cancelled, reruns aired in syndication until September 9, 1994,<ref>The Intelligencer \u2013 September 9, 1994</ref> and on the [[USA Network]] from October 16, 1995, to June 6, 1997.<ref>The Intelligencer \u2013 October 16, 1995</ref><ref>The Post Standard \u2013 June 6, 1997</ref>\n\nOn September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, ''The People's Court'' was revived for a second life in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. Former lawyer and [[Mayor of New York]] [[Ed Koch]] was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for two seasons. By the 1999\u20132000 season, former [[New York State Supreme Court]] Judge [[Jerry Sheindlin]] (husband of [[Judy Sheindlin]] from ''[[Judge Judy]]'') succeeded Koch. Sheindlin only lasted one and a half seasons and was replaced towards the end of the 2000\u201301 season. Since spring 2001, Marilyn Milian has been the judge.\n\n==First version (1981-1993)==\n''The People's Court'' pilot episode was taped on October 23, 1980, with a second pilot episode taped on January 13, 1981. The show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981.\nThe judge from the show's first 12 seasons (including the 1980 pilot), was [[Joseph Wapner]]. Rusty Burrell was his [[bailiff]],<ref>Rusty Burrell (1925\u20132002) was a sheriff's department court bailiff in several famous Los Angeles trials, the [[Manson murders]], [[The Onion Field]] murder, the [[Patty Hearst]]/SLA bank robbery, and the [[Caryl Chessman]] \"Red Light Bandit\". Burrell had appeared on TV in the 1950s ''[[Divorce Court]]'', and it was also his job at that show to find real attorneys to appear on camera. One of those regular ''Divorce Court'' attorneys was Judge Joseph Wapner's father.

He also interviewed the [[plaintiff]] and the [[defendant]] after the court ruling, to gauge their responses to the verdict. Llewelyn often ended each episode with a jaunty \"If you're in a dispute with another party and you can't seem to work things out, don't take the law into your own hands; you take 'em to court,\" which became something of a 1980s [[catchphrase]]. If a case ended with a [[verdict]] for the defendant, however, Llewelyn instead ended the episode by saying, \"If someone files a lawsuit against you and yet you're convinced you've done nothing wrong, don't be intimidated. The best policy is to go to court and stand up for your rights.\" The cases often had [[pun]]-related names, such as \"The Overdone Underthings\" and \"A Head with a Beer on It\". Judge Wapner greeted his litigants by saying, \"I know you've been sworn. I've read your complaint...\" Occasionally, if an episode wrapped up a few minutes early, Judge Wapner fielded questions from the courtroom observers, or the legal consultant explained the legal reasons behind Wapner's decisions.\n\n''The People's Court'' deals in small-claims matters. When the show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981, litigants could not sue for more than US$1,500, which was the limit for small-claims court at the time in California. As the laws in California changed, so did this amount. Starting in 1990, litigants could sue for up to US$5,000, which is now the law in most states.\nResearchers for the show examined small-claims filings in [[Southern California]] and approached the plaintiff and defendant in interesting cases. The producers offered to have Judge Wapner arbitrate the dispute if they would agree to dismiss their action and be bound by Judge Wapner's decision. Through this approach, the show could get real people with real cases. Though the show is decorated and run like a real courtroom, it is not a real court or part of any judicial system, but instead a form of binding [[arbitration]].\n\nThe losing party does not actually need to pay the judgment, as such. Instead (as is stated in the disclaimer at the end of each show), both parties are paid from a fund (set up by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions). This fund was based on the amount of the lawsuit claim, but an exact formula was not stated. The fund was to be first divided equally, then any monetary judgment ordered was subtracted from the loser's half (and presumably both halves in the case of cross judgments). Each litigant received at least what remained of their half in shows concluding with that disclaimer.\nThe disclaimer did not call this fund an \"appearance fee\", a term which appeared later in connection with ''The People's Court'' and other court shows. There may have been a later period when ''The People's Court'' paid the judgment, plus expenses and only a modest appearance fee to each litigant.<ref name=\"NYT1989\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D71F3BF936A25755C0A96F948260|title='People's Court' Finds Itself Before the Dock|last=AP|accessdate=22 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1989-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===Cancellation===\nAfter 12 seasons on ''The People's Court'', Wapner was not invited back to the court show in 1993. The producers of ''The People's Court'' wished to revamp the series, but they didn't notify him of the decision, which he eventually learned of from his brother-in-law, who read about it in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Wapner expressed holding great resentment and bitterness at the court show's producers for finding out this way, and additional resentment over being let go when, according to him, the show was still doing well. However, although the show had a good run ratings-wise, the ratings had dropped to an all-time low at around the time ''The People's Court'' was cancelled.\n\nWapner stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings, but that it was exactly what they did. He also stated that he was not notified when the producers decided to revamp the series, and that he held no opinions on ''The People's Court'' judges who succeeded him as he never watched the program. He did, however, note that the two ''People's Court'' judges who succeeded him, [[Ed Koch]] and [[Jerry Sheindlin]], only lasted two seasons each, whereas he lasted 12 seasons. He also emphasized that judges need to be respectful of litigants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/joseph-a-wapner|title=Joseph A.

The series as a whole reached its 35th season on September 9, 2019, with its 23rd season in its current production cycle. By that point, the 1997 revival has already outlasted its original version, which ran 12 seasons. The show's second life has been headed by three judges since its debut.\n\n===Ed Koch (1997-1999)===\nWhen ''The People's Court'' returned to the airwaves on September 8, 1997, the show expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York newscaster [[Carol Martin (journalist)|Carol Martin]] of [[WCBS-TV]] hosted from a studio, with [[Harvey Levin]] serving as a co-host in the field taking questions, and opinions from people at the [[Manhattan Mall]], and then, returning to the studio at the end of the show for a wrap-up. Curt Chaplin replaced Jack Harrell as the show's announcer, and appeared on camera as the court reporter, although with the addition of a host, his role was limited to interviewing the litigants after the conclusion of each case.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]] presided over the court from September 8, 1997 to June 25, 1999, with reruns airing until September 10.<ref name=\"Sheindlin\"/> In 1998, Martin left the show, with Levin becoming the sole host. The studio segments were done away with and Levin hosted the entire episodes from the viewing area, which eventually moved from the Manhattan Mall to the Times Square visitors' center. Since Levin is now based in Los Angeles with [[TMZ.com|TMZ]], the viewing area has moved to the [[Third Street Promenade]] in [[Santa Monica, California]], while production of ''The People's Court'' has moved to Connecticut. The opening outlines of the taped cases are shown to people in the outdoor viewing area on a monitor.

They put a young associate, Stu Billett, in charge of selling it, but the networks were not interested. Billett later went out on his own and refined the concept into a show shot in a studio rather than a real courtroom.  Small-claims court participants agreed to drop their court cases and accept binding arbitration in a simulated courtroom. The networks expressed interest, but still did not buy it; however, it did sell into the first-run [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] market.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grace|first=Roger|title='People's Court': the Show the Networks Spurned|url=http://www.metnews.com/articles/reminiscing070303.htm|work=Metropolitan News-Enterprise|accessdate=9 August 2013}}</ref>  The series was executive produced by [[Ralph Edwards]], who also created and hosted the documentary show ''[[This Is Your Life]]'', and Stu Billett, who later went on to create ''[[Moral Court]]''.  John Masterson, whom many consider a pioneer and originator of \"reality TV\" also created ''Bride and Groom'' and ''[[Breakfast in Hollywood]]''.\n\n''The People's Court'' is the first court show to use binding [[arbitration]], introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show's successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, ''The People's Court'' is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only [[Court show#List of originally nontraditional court shows|loosely related]] to judicial proceedings, except for one: ''[[Court show#List of originally nontraditional court shows|Parole]]'' (1959) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings.<ref>http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_&_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116141958/http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/exhibits/mason_%26_associates/documents/reality_series_by_title.pdf |date=2014-01-16 }}</ref> Prior to ''The People's Court'', the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used [[actor]]s, and [[Judge show#List of originally traditional court shows|recreated or fictional cases]] (as did [[Court show#Court show genre beginnings|radio before that]]).

Former lawyer and [[Mayor of New York]] [[Ed Koch]] was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for two seasons. By the 1999\u20132000 season, former [[New York State Supreme Court]] Judge [[Jerry Sheindlin]] (husband of [[Judy Sheindlin]] from ''[[Judge Judy]]'') succeeded Koch. Sheindlin only lasted one and a half seasons and was replaced towards the end of the 2000\u201301 season. Since spring 2001, Marilyn Milian has been the judge.\n\n==First version (1981-1993)==\n''The People's Court'' pilot episode was taped on October 23, 1980, with a second pilot episode taped on January 13, 1981. The show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981.\nThe judge from the show's first 12 seasons (including the 1980 pilot), was [[Joseph Wapner]]. Rusty Burrell was his [[bailiff]],<ref>Rusty Burrell (1925\u20132002) was a sheriff's department court bailiff in several famous Los Angeles trials, the [[Manson murders]], [[The Onion Field]] murder, the [[Patty Hearst]]/SLA bank robbery, and the [[Caryl Chessman]] \"Red Light Bandit\". Burrell had appeared on TV in the 1950s ''[[Divorce Court]]'', and it was also his job at that show to find real attorneys to appear on camera. One of those regular ''Divorce Court'' attorneys was Judge Joseph Wapner's father.

He also interviewed the [[plaintiff]] and the [[defendant]] after the court ruling, to gauge their responses to the verdict. Llewelyn often ended each episode with a jaunty \"If you're in a dispute with another party and you can't seem to work things out, don't take the law into your own hands; you take 'em to court,\" which became something of a 1980s [[catchphrase]]. If a case ended with a [[verdict]] for the defendant, however, Llewelyn instead ended the episode by saying, \"If someone files a lawsuit against you and yet you're convinced you've done nothing wrong, don't be intimidated. The best policy is to go to court and stand up for your rights.\" The cases often had [[pun]]-related names, such as \"The Overdone Underthings\" and \"A Head with a Beer on It\". Judge Wapner greeted his litigants by saying, \"I know you've been sworn. I've read your complaint...\" Occasionally, if an episode wrapped up a few minutes early, Judge Wapner fielded questions from the courtroom observers, or the legal consultant explained the legal reasons behind Wapner's decisions.\n\n''The People's Court'' deals in small-claims matters. When the show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, [[1981]], litigants could not sue for more than US$1,500, which was the limit for small-claims court at the time in California. As the laws in California changed, so did this amount. Starting in 1990, litigants could sue for up to US$5,000, which is now the law in most states.\nResearchers for the show examined small-claims filings in [[Southern California]] and approached the plaintiff and defendant in interesting cases. The producers offered to have Judge Wapner arbitrate the dispute if they would agree to dismiss their action and be bound by Judge Wapner's decision. Through this approach, the show could get real people with real cases. Though the show is decorated and run like a real courtroom, it is not a real court or part of any judicial system, but instead a form of binding [[arbitration]].\n\nThe losing party does not actually need to pay the judgment, as such. Instead (as is stated in the disclaimer at the end of each show), both parties are paid from a fund (set up by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions). This fund was based on the amount of the lawsuit claim, but an exact formula was not stated. The fund was to be first divided equally, then any monetary judgment ordered was subtracted from the loser's half (and presumably both halves in the case of cross judgments). Each litigant received at least what remained of their half in shows concluding with that disclaimer.\nThe disclaimer did not call this fund an \"appearance fee\", a term which appeared later in connection with ''The People's Court'' and other court shows. There may have been a later period when ''The People's Court'' paid the judgment, plus expenses and only a modest appearance fee to each litigant.<ref name=\"NYT1989\">{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2D71F3BF936A25755C0A96F948260|title='People's Court' Finds Itself Before the Dock|last=AP|accessdate=22 June 2018|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1989-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===Cancellation===\nAfter 12 seasons on ''The People's Court'', Wapner was not invited back to the court show in 1993. The producers of ''The People's Court'' wished to revamp the series, but they didn't notify him of the decision, which he eventually learned of from his brother-in-law, who read about it in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Wapner expressed holding great resentment and bitterness at the court show's producers for finding out this way, and additional resentment over being let go when, according to him, the show was still doing well. However, although the show had a good run ratings-wise, the ratings had dropped to an all-time low at around the time ''The People's Court'' was cancelled.\n\nWapner stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings, but that it was exactly what they did. He also stated that he was not notified when the producers decided to revamp the series, and that he held no opinions on ''The People's Court'' judges who succeeded him as he never watched the program. He did, however, note that the two ''People's Court'' judges who succeeded him, [[Ed Koch]] and [[Jerry Sheindlin]], only lasted two seasons each, whereas he lasted 12 seasons. He also emphasized that judges need to be respectful of litigants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/joseph-a-wapner|title=Joseph A.

The series as a whole reached its 35th season on September 9, 2019, with its 23rd season in its current production cycle. By that point, the 1997 revival has already outlasted its original version, which ran 12 seasons. The show's second life has been headed by three judges since its debut.\n\n===Ed Koch (1997-1999)===\nWhen ''The People's Court'' returned to the airwaves on September 8, 1997, the show expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York newscaster [[Carol Martin (journalist)|Carol Martin]] of [[WCBS-TV]] hosted from a studio, with [[Harvey Levin]] serving as a co-host in the field taking questions, and opinions from people at the [[Manhattan Mall]], and then, returning to the studio at the end of the show for a wrap-up. Curt Chaplin replaced Jack Harrell as the show's announcer, and appeared on camera as the court reporter, although with the addition of a host, his role was limited to interviewing the litigants after the conclusion of each case.\n\nFormer New York City Mayor [[Ed Koch]] presided over the court from September 8, 1997 to June 25, 1999, with reruns airing until September 10.<ref name=\"Sheindlin\"/> In 1998, Martin left the show, with Levin becoming the sole host. The studio segments were done away with and Levin hosted the entire episodes from the viewing area, which eventually moved from the Manhattan Mall to the Times Square visitors' center.

The participants are not actors. They are the actual people who have already either filed suit or been served a summons to appear in a California Municipal Court. Both parties in the suit have agreed to dismiss their court cases, and have their disputes settled here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nBeginning in Season 6 (1986-1987), and ran until the end of the Wapner run on May 17, 1993, the opening disclaimer by Jack Harrell was changed:{{quote|What you are witnessing is real. The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with a case pending in a California Municipal Court. Both parties have agreed to dismiss their court cases, and have their disputes settled here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nOn September 8, 1997, when ''The People's Court'' returned to the airwaves, and expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York mayor [[Ed Koch]] took over as the judge, the show moved to [[New York City]], and the opening disclaimer was changed, and was read by [[Curt Chaplin]]:{{quote|What you are witnessing is real. The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with a case pending in a New York Metropolitan Area Court. Both parties have agreed to drop their claims, and have their dispute settled here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nOn September 13, 1999, when [[Jerry Sheindlin]] took over as the judge, the opening disclaimer by [[Curt Chaplin]] was changed:{{quote|What you are witnessing is real. The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with a case pending in civil court. Both sides have agreed to settle their dispute here in Judge Jerry Sheindlin's forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nWhen Marilyn Milian became the current judge on March 12, 2001, the opening disclaimer was changed:{{quote|What you are witnessing is real. The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with real cases. They will settle their disputes here...in Judge Marilyn Milian's forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nLater, Milian's opening disclaimer was changed:{{quote|There's a new judge in town, the honorable Marilyn Milian. She will be hearing real cases presented by real litigants who have agreed to have their disputes settled here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nThen, in later seasons, Milian's opening disclaimer was changed:\n{{quote|The whole country's talking about the honorable Marilyn Milian... [soundbite of Judge Milian saying, \"Judge here!\"]... the hottest judge on television. [Soundbite of Judge saying, \"It's my ruling!\"] She'll hear real cases from real litigants. Here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nAfter a few months, the soundbites of Judge Milian's voice were removed from the opening, and Curt Chaplin's opening disclaimer was slightly changed:{{quote|Everybody's talking about the honorable Marilyn Milian, the hottest judge on television. Real cases, real litigants. Here...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\nIn September 2009, the current opening disclaimer was used:{{quote|What you are about to witness is real. The participants are not actors. They are actual litigants with a case pending in civil court. Both parties have agreed to drop their claims, and have their cases settled here, before Judge Marilyn Milian...in our forum...''The People's Court''.}}\n\n===Litigant compensation===\nAt the end of each show, the following disclaimer appears:\n<blockquote>Both the plaintiff and the defendant have been paid from a fund for their appearance. The amount, if any, awarded in the case, is deducted from this fund, and the remainder is divided equally between both litigants. The amount of the fund is dependent on the size of the judgment.</blockquote>\nNo information is given as to what relation the amount of the fund bears to the size of the judgment, nor the amount of the fund if a verdict for the defense is rendered.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn a talk-show appearance, Judge Wapner gave a few more specifics as to how compensation was typically calculated. In his words, if the plaintiff won, the show would pay his/her judgment and give the defendant $50 for his time, whereas if the defendant won, the parties would \"split $500\". {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn 1989, a litigant sued the producers, claiming, \"I was only willing to appear because they guaranteed me $1,500. I never would have appeared on that show and made a fool out of myself for a chintzy $250.\" (In response, an associate producer said that before going on the show, participants are given a packet of information \"where everything is clearly outlined to the nth degree.\")<ref name=\"NYT1989\"/>\n\n''[[The New York Post]]'' reported on some of the details surrounding compensation for a lawsuit filed by Claudia Evart. \"The show pays all damages awarded to defendants and plaintiffs, as well as a $250 appearance fee.\"<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boniello|first1=Kathianne|title='The People's Court' rocked by possible murder mystery, episode controversy|url=https://nypost.com/2012/01/29/the-peoples-court-rocked-by-possible-murder-mystery-episode-controversy/|accessdate=February 4, 2016|work=[[New York Post]]|date=January 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Production notes==\nThe 1981\u201393 life of the show was initially taped at [[KTLA|Golden West Broadcasters]] and, later, [[Metromedia]] in Los Angeles, before moving to The Production Group. In New York City, ''The People's Court'' first taped episodes at the NEP/Image studios in the former Grand Ballroom of the [[Hotel Pennsylvania]], which was also the studio for the [[talk show]] ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]''. In 1998, the show began taping at the MTI Studios on the 8th floor at 401 Fifth Avenue, where the courtroom received a makeover. In 2006, the MTI Studios were sold to NEP/Image. At the end credits of some episodes, the show is said to be taped at the NEP/Image studios. The former MTI studios are officially part of [[NEP Broadcasting]]'s NEP Penn Studios. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nIn 2012, the show moved to the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, taking advantage of the same state tax credits which attracted [[NBCUniversal]]'s syndication and cable divisions to the Stamford area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onsetproductions.com/calendar/tickets.aspx?showID=209|title=Tickets & Information|publisher=Onset Productions|date=2012-09-05|accessdate=2013-09-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206112436/http://onsetproductions.com/calendar/tickets.aspx?showID=209|archivedate=2013-12-06}}</ref>\nThe aired episodes are sometimes spliced together in a different order from which they are taped (a common procedure on some hour-long shows). This is why the judge's blouse color may change and why fewer courtroom observers may be seen during the second half of the show than during the first half. For the 2012 season, the show started broadcasting in widescreen standard definition, before eventually converting to high-definition broadcast shortly thereafter.\n\nAll versions of ''The People's Court'' are \"A Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Production\" in association with [[Telepictures Productions]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution]] (including its predecessors Telepictures  and later [[Lorimar-Telepictures]]), all of which are now part of [[AT&T Inc.]]'s [[WarnerMedia]] unit. \n\n===Theme music===\nThe theme music, \"The Big One (People's Court Theme)\", was composed by [[Alan Tew|Alan Stanley Tew]]. The uptempo theme music, with prominent piano theme and bongo drum rhythm, has been sampled by many artists, including [[Nelly]]. It has also been featured in several films and television shows, including the 1977 pornographic film ''[[Barbara Broadcast]]'', the 1979 low-budget film ''[[Malibu High]]'', the [[CHAN-DT|BCTV]] current affairs show [[Jack Webster (journalist)|''Webster!'']], ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', ''[[The Loud House]]'', [[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|\"Blue Harvest\"]], the sixth-season premiere episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'', the December 5, 2005, and December 21, 2009, editions of ''[[WWE Raw]]'' in Tampa, Florida, ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', and ''[[Popular (TV series)|Popular]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n==Ratings==\nAs of September 2017, ''The People's Court'' ranks third behind number one ''Judge Judy'' and number two ''[[Hot Bench]]'' in the ratings for TV court shows.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Albiniak|first1=Paige|title=Syndication Ratings: 'Judge Judy' Premieres Season 22 Far in Front|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/distribution/syndication-ratings-judge-judy-premieres-season-22-far-front/168921|website=Broadcasting & cABLE|publisher=NewBay Media, LLC|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==British version==\nA British version of the show was produced by [[STV Productions]] (then known as \"SMG TV Productions\") to replace [[Trisha Goddard]]'s talk show on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2005.
