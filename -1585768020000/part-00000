They introduced Edmondson to several artist friends, including Starr's boyhood friend Meyer (Mike) Wolfe and his wife [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]]. Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.'' She attempted to publish his work but newspaper chain mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], had a prejudice against showing Negro art as he seen them as nothing other than servants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/william-edmondson-down-home-artist-forging-beauty-stone|title=William Edmondson, a down home artist forging beauty from stone|work=aaregistry.org|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" /> She then brought Edmondson's work to the attention of fellow Tennessean Thomas Mabry and his boss [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\nEdmondson's career lasted for about fifteen years. His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed. Edmondson professed to be uninterested in fame, and he appears to have struggled financially for the final years of his life. He is believed to have created about 300 works during his working lifetime.  \n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Bird_ca._1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|291x291px|Bird ca. 1937, carved limestone, gift from Margaret Z. Robson]]\nEdmondson was given a one-man show, the first by an African American artist, at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from October 20th to December 1st 1937<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery.\n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David C. Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels. This exhibit displeayed twenty-one of Edmondon's sculptures which is the largest collection of Edmondson's art in the country<ref name=\":4\" />. In 2016 the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] received one of its largest gifts of folk art work from Margaret Z. Robson, among them were three of Edmondson's sculptures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-american-art-museum-acquires-major-collection-self-taught-american-art|title=Smithsonian American Art Museum Acquires Major Collection of Self-Taught American Art|last=Baptiste|first=Laura|date=December 13, 2016|website=Smithsonian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nEdmondson's art is displayed permanently at the [[The Newark Museum of Art]],  [[American Folk Art Museum]], the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the the Montclair Musuem in New Jersey<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince his death, Edmondson's work has gradually come to be highly appreciated by critics and collectors, and his sculptures garner up to $70,000-$300,000 at auction<ref name=\":4\" />. Recently in January 2016, \"A Boxer\" sold at a private auction for $785,000 the highest price ever paid <ref name=\":5\" />.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, Mayor [[Karl Dean]] opened Nashville's first arts park, named in Edmondson's honor. The park, managed by the Nashville Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, includes sculptures by [[Thornton Dial]] and [[Lonnie Holley]] inspired by the work of William Edmondson. The park is located in a traditionally African-American neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edmondson Park dedication officially opens city's first arts park |url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3178/Edmondson-Park-dedication-officially-opens-citys-first-arts-park.aspx |website=Nashville.gov |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> Even though the site of Edmondson's house at 1434 Fourteenth Avenue South is now a public school, it has been officially recognized with a Tennessee historical marker.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n<br />\n==Selected Recent Exhibitions==\n*Cheekwood Museum of Art, Nashville, TN\n**''The Art of William Edmondson'' 1999 organized with the American Folk Art Museum, New York, NY\n** ''William Edmondson and Friends: Breaking the Mold, 2014''\n** [https://cheekwood.org/explore/art-4/exhibitions/past-exhibitons/edmondson-2017/ ''Visions from Above: The Life and Work of William Edmondson''], 2017\n\n== Collections with Edmondson Works ==\n\n*[[American Folk Art Museum]], New York, NY\n*[https://collections.artsmia.org/search/William%20Edmondson Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN]\n*[https://www.nga.gov/features/exhibitions/outliers-and-american-vanguard-artist-biographies/william-edmondson.html The National Gallery of Art], Washington, DC\n*[https://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio-items/william-edmondson/?portfolioCats=126%2C22%2C23 Ricco Maresca Gallery, New York, NY]\n*[https://americanart.si.edu/search?query=Edmondson Smithsonian Museum of American Art], Washington, DC\n*[http://www.tnstate.edu/library/digital/EDMONDS.HTM Tennessee State LIbrary], Nashville, TN\n*[https://tnmuseum.org/temporary-exhibits/temporary%20exhibits/insearchofthenew The Tennessee State Museum], Nashville, TN\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Thompson, Lovett, Freeman, McWillie, Gundaker and Sims, ''The Art of William Edmondson'', Cheekwood Museum of Art, Nashville, Tennessee and University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 1999\n*The WPA Guide to Tennessee, Compiled and Written by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Projects Administration for the State of Tennessee, The University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, 1986\n* ''Outsider Art Sourcebook'', ed.

Dahl-Wolfe was a photographer who had recently begun work for ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' fashion magazine in [[New York City|New York]]. She made over a hundred of photographs of Edmondson's at work in his backyard shop, which she presented to the editor of Harper's Bazaar''.'' She attempted to publish his work but newspaper chain mogul [[William Randolph Hearst]], had a prejudice against showing Negro art as he seen them as nothing other than servants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/william-edmondson-down-home-artist-forging-beauty-stone|title=William Edmondson, a down home artist forging beauty from stone|work=aaregistry.org|accessdate=May 23, 2015}}</ref> <ref name=\":4\" /> She then brought Edmondson's work to the attention of fellow Tennessean Thomas Mabry and his boss [[Alfred Barr]], the director of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA)<ref name=\":1\" />.  \n\nEdmondson's career lasted for about fifteen years. His work never commanded large sums during his lifetime. In 1939 and again in 1941, he worked under the [[Works Progress Administration]], a government sponsored relief program that included artists. In the late 1940s, his health began to fail and his artistic production slowed. Edmondson professed to be uninterested in fame, and he appears to have struggled financially for the final years of his life. He is believed to have created about 300 works during his working lifetime.  \n\n== Exhibitions ==\n[[File:Bird_ca._1937.jpg|alt=|thumb|291x291px|Bird ca. 1937, carved limestone, gift from Margaret Z. Robson]]\nEdmondson was given a one-man show, the first by an African American artist, at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] from October 20th to December 1st 1937<ref name=\":1\" />. In 1938, through MoMA's influence, William Edmondson's sculpture was included in the \"Three Centuries of Art in the United States\" in [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Interest in his work on the national and international stage was short-lived, and he was viewed primarily as a novelty, or exemplar of the \"primitive\" race-memory of an untutored, naive old Negro stone carver. Locally, Alfred Starr continued to promote Edmondson's work to his artistic friends and acquaintances, who bought work directly from Edmondson's \"sculpture yard\" or through the local Lyzon Gallery. Starr introduced the famed modernist photographer [[Edward Weston]] to Edmondson in 1941, and Weston made several striking photographs of Edmondson at work in his shop and yard. Also in 1941, he received the only other solo show accorded during his lifetime, at the Nashville Art Gallery.\n\nAfter very sporadic exhibition through the 1950s and 1960s (mostly as part of \"folk art\" exhibits), collector [[Edmund Fuller]] wrote a biography of Edmondson which was published in 1973. His sculpture was included in the influential \"[[Two Centuries of Black American Art]]\" exhibition curated by [[Fisk University]] Art Department chairman [[David C. Driskell]] in 1976.  In 1981 the new [[Tennessee State Museum]] opened with a permanent solo exhibition with six of Edmondson's sculptures featuring loaned sculptures from Elizabeth Starr's personal collection<ref name=\":1\" />, and the essays in the accompanying catalog sought to elevate appreciation of Edmondson's work as fine art. Through the 1980s and 1990s Edmondson's sculptures were exhibited extensively, though often in the limiting context of the labels \"outsider\", \"folk art\", \"self-taught\", and \"naive\". In 1999, Nashville's [[Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art|Cheekwood Museum of Art]] mounted a major traveling retrospective exhibition and catalog that included in-depth biographical and critical essays on his life and work This exhibit also sculptures from Elizabeth Starrs personal collection of which she donated to the museum.<ref name=\":1\" /> A 2006 exhibition, \"William Edmondson, Bill Traylor, and the Modernist Impulse,\" paired Edmondson with another well-known self-taught artist and argued for Edmondson's acceptance as an artist without limiting labels. This exhibit displeayed twenty-one of Edmondon's sculptures which is the largest collection of Edmondson's art in the country<ref name=\":4\" />. In 2016 the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] received one of its largest gifts of folk art work from Margaret Z. Robson, among them were three of Edmondson's sculptures<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.edu/newsdesk/releases/smithsonian-american-art-museum-acquires-major-collection-self-taught-american-art|title=Smithsonian American Art Museum Acquires Major Collection of Self-Taught American Art|last=Baptiste|first=Laura|date=December 13, 2016|website=Smithsonian|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>. \n\nCurrently Edmondson's art is displayed permanently at the [[The Newark Museum of Art]],  [[American Folk Art Museum]], the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], the [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Folk Art Museum]], the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] and the the Montclair Musuem in New Jersey<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\n<br />\n\n== Legacy ==\nSince his death, Edmondson's work has gradually come to be highly appreciated by critics and collectors, and his sculptures garner up to $70,000-$300,000 at auction<ref name=\":4\" />. Recently in January 2016, \"A Boxer\" sold at a private auction for $785,000 the highest price ever paid <ref name=\":5\" />.\n\nOn August 20, 2014, Mayor [[Karl Dean]] opened Nashville's first arts park, named in Edmondson's honor. The park, managed by the Nashville Metropolitan Development and Housing Agency, includes sculptures by [[Thornton Dial]] and [[Lonnie Holley]] inspired by the work of William Edmondson. The park is located in a traditionally African-American neighborhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edmondson Park dedication officially opens city's first arts park |url=http://www.nashville.gov/News-Media/News-Article/ID/3178/Edmondson-Park-dedication-officially-opens-citys-first-arts-park.aspx |website=Nashville.gov |publisher=Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County |accessdate=June 12, 2018 |date=August 20, 2014}}</ref> Even though the site of Edmondson's house at 1434 Fourteenth Avenue South is now a public school, it has been officially recognized with a Tennessee historical marker.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\n<br />\n==Selected Recent Exhibitions==\n*Cheekwood Museum of Art, Nashville, TN\n**''The Art of William Edmondson'' 1999 organized with the American Folk Art Museum, New York, NY\n** ''William Edmondson and Friends: Breaking the Mold, 2014''\n** [https://cheekwood.org/explore/art-4/exhibitions/past-exhibitons/edmondson-2017/ ''Visions from Above: The Life and Work of William Edmondson''], 2017\n\n== Collections with Edmondson Works ==\n\n*[[American Folk Art Museum]], New York, NY\n*[https://collections.artsmia.org/search/William%20Edmondson Minneapolis Institute of Art, Minneapolis, MN]\n*[https://www.nga.gov/features/exhibitions/outliers-and-american-vanguard-artist-biographies/william-edmondson.html The National Gallery of Art], Washington, DC\n*[https://www.riccomaresca.com/portfolio-items/william-edmondson/?portfolioCats=126%2C22%2C23 Ricco Maresca Gallery, New York, NY]\n*[https://americanart.si.edu/search?query=Edmondson Smithsonian Museum of American Art], Washington, DC\n*[http://www.tnstate.edu/library/digital/EDMONDS.HTM Tennessee State LIbrary], Nashville, TN\n*[https://tnmuseum.org/temporary-exhibits/temporary%20exhibits/insearchofthenew The Tennessee State Museum], Nashville, TN\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n\n*Thompson, Lovett, Freeman, McWillie, Gundaker and Sims, ''The Art of William Edmondson'', Cheekwood Museum of Art, Nashville, Tennessee and University Press of Mississippi, Jackson, 1999\n*The WPA Guide to Tennessee, Compiled and Written by the Federal Writers' Project of the Works Projects Administration for the State of Tennessee, The University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville, 1986\n* ''Outsider Art Sourcebook'', ed.

''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

ECW Press, 2009, p. 149.</ref> Following several house shows and a television taping at [[Universal Studios Florida]], Brody was entrusted with finding a venue for the promotion's first [[pay per view]] event in June 1991. Brody suggested the [[Odeum Expo Center]] in Chicago. Abrams insisted on holding [[Beach Brawl]] at [[Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, FL]].<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 156.</ref> The pay per view was a disaster in both attendance and pay per view buys. Following Beach Brawl, Abrams ran one final television taping in Florida before running out of fresh footage for ''Fury Hour''. He struck a deal with Brody to use footage from Ladies Major League Wrestling to fulfill his obligations with SportsChannel America, and the two parted ways in the Fall of 1991.<ref>Brody, Howard. ''Swimming with Piranhas: Surviving the Politics of Professional Wrestling''. ECW Press, 2009, p. 163.</ref>\n\nAbrams would only run three more shows after his initial SportsChannel America deal expired in late 1991. This included a television taping at [[Spartanburg Memorial Auditorium]] in June 1992, a television taping at [[North Dakota State Fair]] in July 1993, and the [[Blackjack Brawl]] show at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in September 1994. The latter show aired live on SportsChannel America and was a disaster in both attendance and television ratings.\n\nAbrams left for New York City to take care of his ailing mother in December 1994, and wrestler Al Burke was put in charge of the company.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewalburke.htm</ref> [[Zoogz Rift]] also worked for the company during this time, and claimed Abrams' addiction to [[cocaine]] drained the company of money needed to do further shows.<ref>http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm</ref> Abrams died of a heart attack in July 1996 while still in New York.\n\nAl Burke claimed ownership of the UWF tape library as abandoned property following the death of Abrams. In recent years, Burke partnered with Todd Okerlund of Classic Wrestling to repackage and license the library through [[DirecTV]] and [[ESPN Classic (Canada)|ESPN Classic Canada]].\n\n==Major events==\n===Beach Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Beach Brawl}}\nUWF held two major events during its run. The first event, Beach Brawl, was the only pay-per-view event in the company's history and was held on June 7, 1991 at the [[Bradenton Area Convention Center|Manatee Civic Center]] in [[Palmetto, Florida]]. The event was headlined by a match between [[Steve Williams (wrestler)|Steve Williams]] and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]], which was the final round match of a sixteen-man tournament for the crowning of the first [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF SportsChannel Television Championship|UWF SportsChannel Television Champion]]. Williams defeated Bigelow to become the first SportsChannel Television Champion. The event was an overall failure with a low buyrate of 0.1 and a crowd of 500 in attendance at the arena.\n\n===Blackjack Brawl===\n{{main|UWF Blackjack Brawl}}\nAfter the failure of Beach Brawl, UWF decided to air a live television special called Blackjack Brawl on September 23, 1994 on [[SportsChannel America]], which was UWF's last major attempt to secure a major television deal and survive in the professional wrestling industry. The event was held at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Like its predecessor Beach Brawl, the event saw very low attendance of just 600 fans and received negative response from critics and audiences for weak quality, weakly performed matches, nonsense booking and weak commentary. The event featured nine championship matches, with two vacant championships being decided at the event, and seven new championships being contested at the event. The event was headlined by a [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams) championships#UWF World Heavyweight Championship|UWF World Heavyweight Championship]] match between defending champion Steve Williams and [[Sid Eudy|Sid Vicious]]. The event was received negatively by fans especially due to the main event match ending in a disqualification, and this was UWF's final show.\n\n==''Fury Hour''==\n{{Infobox television\n|show_name = UWF Fury Hour\n|image = UWF Fury Hour.JPG\n|creator = [[Herb Abrams]]\n|caption = ''UWF Fury Hour'' logo\n|picture_format = [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]])\n|camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multicamera setup]]\n|runtime = 60 minutes (including commercials)\n|company = Abrams Productions\n|starring =\n|country = United States\n|network = [[SportsChannel America]]\n|first_aired = {{Start date|1990}}\n|last_aired = {{End date|1993}}\n|num_episodes = 69 (SportsChannel America)<br>24 (ESPN2)\n|opentheme = \"[[The Equalizer#Music|The Equalizer Busy Equalizing]]\" by [[Stewart Copeland]]\n|website = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821416/\n}}\n\nIn 1990, the company signed a one-year deal with national cable network [[SportsChannel America]]. A weekly program called '''''Fury Hour''''' debuted in October 1990 and aired on Monday nights. Reruns of the program, along with sporadic new episodes, continued airing on the network through 1993.\n\nIn 1991, Herb Abrams was owed money by Steve Ray and wrongly suspected that Ray was sleeping with his wife. On May 10, 1991 during a television taping at the [[New York Penta]], Abrams paid [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams|Steve Williams]] an extra $100 for the night to break Ray's nose during their match. Ray would years later claim this was a Worked Shoot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com/interviewzoogzrift2.htm|title=UWF - Interview - Zoogz Rift|website=herbabramsuwf.googlepages.com}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lkjnUCA7tA|title=Wrestling With Wregret - UWF|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfwX767OOPY</ref>\n\nIn 1995, existing episodes were repackaged to a half-hour format and aired on [[ESPN2]].

He thought his first novels, ''[[Knots and Crosses]]'' and ''[[Hide and Seek (Ian Rankin novel)|Hide and Seek]]'', were mainstream books, more in keeping with the Scottish traditions of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and even [[Muriel Spark]]. He was disconcerted by their classification as genre fiction. The [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] [[Allan Massie]], who tutored Rankin while Massie was writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh, reassured him by saying, \"Do you think [[John Buchan]] ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?\"<ref name=\"Barnett\">{{cite news|author=Barnett, Laura|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/11/ian-rankin-portrait|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Ian Rankin, Author\u2014Portrait of the Artist|date=11 December 2012|accessdate= 8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nRankin's [[Inspector Rebus]] novels are set mainly in Edinburgh.

his [[Inspector Rebus]] novels.\n\n==Early life==\nRankin was born in [[Cardenden]], Fife. His father, James, owned a grocery shop, and his mother, Isobel, worked in a school canteen.<ref name = Sturgis>{{cite news|last1=Sturgis|first1=India|title=If I Could See Me Now... What Your Younger Self Would Make of you Today \u2013 Ian Rankin|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|issue = Weekend supplement |date=26 December 2015}}</ref> He was educated at [[Beath High School]], [[Cowdenbeath]]. His parents were horrified when he then chose to study literature at university, as they had expected him to study for a trade.<ref name = Sturgis/> Encouraged by his English teacher, he persisted and graduated in 1982 from the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he also worked on a doctorate on [[Muriel Spark]] but did not complete it.<ref name = BBC2>{{cite web|title=Ian Rankin 1960-  Biography|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00mr8yj/profiles/ian-rankin|website=BBC Two;  Writing Scotland|accessdate=27 December 2015|date=September 2004}}</ref> He has taught at the university and retains an involvement with the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]].

He thought his first novels, ''[[Knots and Crosses]]'' and ''[[Hide and Seek (Ian Rankin novel)|Hide and Seek]]'', were mainstream books, more in keeping with the Scottish traditions of [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and even [[Muriel Spark]]. He was disconcerted by their classification as genre fiction. The [[List of Scottish novelists|Scottish novelist]] [[Allan Massie]], who tutored Rankin while Massie was writer-in-residence at the University of Edinburgh, reassured him by saying, \"Do you think [[John Buchan]] ever worried about whether he was writing literature or not?\"<ref name=\"Barnett\">{{cite news|author=Barnett, Laura|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/11/ian-rankin-portrait|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Ian Rankin, Author\u2014Portrait of the Artist|date=11 December 2012|accessdate= 8 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nRankin's [[Inspector Rebus]] novels are set mainly in Edinburgh. They are considered major contributions to the [[tartan noir]] genre. Ten of the novels were adapted as a [[Rebus (TV)|television series]] on ITV, starring [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]] as Rebus in series 1 and 2 and [[Ken Stott]] in that role in series 3\u20135.\n\nIn 2009, Rankin donated the short story \"Fieldwork\" to [[Oxfam]]'s ''[[Ox-Tales]]'' project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors.

In 2005 he presented a 30-minute documentary on [[BBC Four]] called ''Rankin on the Staircase'', in which he investigated the relationship between real-life cases and crime fiction.  It was loosely based on the [[Michael Peterson (author and convicted criminal)|Michael Peterson]] murder case, as covered in Jean-Xavier Lestrade's documentary series ''Death on the Staircase''. The same year he collaborated with folk musician [[Jackie Leven]] on the album ''Jackie Leven Said''.\n\nIn 2007, Rankin appeared in programmes for BBC Four exploring the origins of his alter-ego character, [[John Rebus]].

Through postcards, a [[shortwave radio]], various mix-CDs, and other erratic interests, Cayne eventually wins the heart of the narrator. However, a week before [[Valentine's Day]], she goes missing, leaving only a dress on the ice and secret codes to help the narrator and the reader find out where she has gone.\n\n==Overview==\nIn a labyrinth of art, [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], cryptic [[codes]] and young love, the author presents a coming-of-age novel that seems designed to puzzle readers of all ages. Moreover, it is an adolescent's quest to unravel the clues his girlfriend may have left behind after her mysterious disappearance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fiction Book Review: As Simple As Snow|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=December 19, 2014|date=February 7, 2005|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-399-15231-3}}</ref>\n\nThe young narrator goes unnamed throughout the novel. He disparages himself initially as embarrassingly bland and inexperienced. His new girlfriend Anastasia (Anna) Cayne is instead presented as a complicated high school goth girl with a penchant for riddles and affectionate mind games. Anna spends much of her time creating [[obituaries]] for every living person in town and introducing the narrator to a wider landscape of art, music and literature.

Through postcards, a [[shortwave radio]], various mix-CDs, and other erratic interests, Cayne eventually wins the heart of the narrator.

Because of its location in the continent, London experiences large [[seasonal]] contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding [[Great Lakes]]. The summers are usually warm to hot and humid, with a July average of {{convert|20.8|C|1}}, and temperatures above {{cvt|30|C}} occur on average 10 days per year.<ref name=CCN/> In 2016, however, temperatures at or above {{cvt|30|C}} occurred more than 35 times, and in 2018, four heatwave incidents led to [[humidex]] temperatures topping out at {{cvt|46|C}} .  The city is affected by frequent thunderstorms due to hot, humid summer weather, as well as the [[Convergence zone|convergence of breezes]] originating from [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Erie]]. The same convergence zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado.  Spring and autumn in between are not long, and winters are cold but witness frequent thaws. Annual precipitation averages {{convert|1011.5|mm|abbr=on|2}}. Its winter snowfall totals are heavy, averaging about {{cvt|194|cm|abbr=on|0}} per year,<ref name=CCN /> although the localized nature of snow squalls means the total can vary widely from year to year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=B5187FDA-1#t14|title=Environment and Climate Change Canada - Weather and Meteorology - Canada's Top Ten Weather Stories for 2010 - Runner-Up stories|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|last=Canada|website=ec.gc.ca|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118220845/https://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=B5187FDA-1#t14|archivedate=18 November 2017|df=dmy-all|date=16 December 2010}}</ref> The majority of snow accumulation comes from [[lake effect snow]] and [[snow squalls]] originating from Lake Huron, some {{cvt|60|km|abbr=on|0}} to the northwest, which occurs when strong, cold winds blow from that direction.

The city had a population of 383,822 according to the 2016 Canadian census. London is at the confluence of the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames River]], approximately {{convert|200|km|abbr=on}} from both [[Toronto]] and [[Detroit]]; and about {{convert|230|km|abbr=on}} from [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The city of London is a separated municipality, [[List of Ontario separated municipalities|politically separate]] from [[Middlesex County, Ontario|Middlesex County]], though it remains the county seat.\n\nLondon and the [[Thames River (Ontario)|Thames]] were named in 1793 by [[John Graves Simcoe]], who proposed the site for the [[capital city]] of [[Upper Canada]].

Since then, London has grown to be the largest southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada's [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|11th largest metropolitan area]], having annexed many of the smaller communities that surrounded it.\n\nLondon is a regional centre of healthcare and education, being home to the [[University of Western Ontario]] (which brands itself \"Western University\"), [[Fanshawe College]], and several hospitals (including a [[University Hospital (London, Ontario)|University Hospital]]). The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centred on education, medical research, [[insurance]], and [[information technology]]. London's university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and [[Ontario Highway 402|402]], connecting it to Toronto, [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] and [[Sarnia]].
