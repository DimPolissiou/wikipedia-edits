The series follows [[Haru Glory]], a teenager on a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.\n\nThe manga was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from July 21, 1999 through July 10, 2005, and published in thirty-five ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]]. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by [[Tokyopop]] until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode [[anime]] series by [[Studio Deen]]. The anime premiered on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the [[Toonami]] programming block and re-broadcast on [[Syfy]] in 2009.\n\nThe manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the localized anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version which resulted in uninteresting and confusing dialogue, as well as unappealing music.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Rave Master characters}}\nIn 0015, the world is corrupted by Dark Bring, dark stones that bestow powerful magic with different abilities to their owners. The Dark Brings are used by the Raregroove Kingdom, and the Symphonia Kingdom fight against them with their five powerful Rave stones. [[List of Rave Master characters#Shiba Roses|Shiba Roses]], the Rave Master, attempts to destroy Sinclaire, the \"mother\" of all of the Dark Brings, with the Ten Commandments sword. However, the aftermath causes a massive explosion known as Overdrive, destroying one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by his special guardian \"dog\" [[List of Rave Master characters#Plue|Plue]], holds onto the Rave required to power his sword. Plue and the four remaining Raves, however, get scattered around the world.\n\nFifty years later, sixteen-year-old [[List of Rave Master characters#Haru Glory|Haru Glory]] lives on the peaceful Garage Island with his older sister, Cattleya. Shotrly after Haru accidentally fishes Plue up, Shiba arrives wishing to reclaim Plue, but a group of terrorists from the Demon Card organization appear to kill Shiba. Shiba tells Haru that he is the second Rave Master, entrusting the Ten Commandments, Plue, and his Rave to him. Seeking power to defeat Demon Card, Haru and Plue set off on a journey to find the missing Rave stones. Upon arriving at Hip Hop Island, Haru befriends a girl named [[List of Rave Master characters#Elie|Elie]], who has no recollection of her past. During their journey, Haru encounters enemies from Demon Card who eventually become his allies, including [[List of Rave Master characters#Shuda|Shuda]] and [[List of Rave Master characters#Sieg Hart|Sieg Hart]]. Haru later meets a diverse group of allies, including [[List of Rave Master characters#Hamrio Musica|Hamrio Musica]], grandson of a blacksmith; [[List of Rave Master characters#Let Dahaka|Let Dahaka]] and [[List of Rave Master characters#Julia|Julia]], two who appear human but are in fact of the Dragon Race; [[List of Rave Master characters#Griffon Kato|Griffon Kato]], a strange blue creature and Plue's friend; [[List of Rave Master characters#Ruby|Ruby]], a penguin and a casino owner; [[List of Rave Master characters#Belnika|Belnika]], a mage; and [[List of Rave Master characters#Niebel|Niebel]], Sieg's close friend. He also encounters [[List of Rave Master characters#Gale Raregroove|Gale \"King\" Raregroove]], the king of the Raregroove Kingdom and leader of Demon Card. On the Tower of Din, Haru reunites with his absent father [[List of Rave Master characters#Gale Glory|Gale Glory]] to defeat King and end Demon Card. Although they win, Gale sacrifices himself to save his son from Din's destruction.\n\nSome time later, King's son, [[List of Rave Master characters#Lucia Raregroove|Lucia]], appears and revives Demon Card. He wishes to capture Elie to use the magical energy known as Etherion hidden within her body. While facing Lucia and his forces, Haru's group also learn of the mythical creature known as Endless, which threatens mankind by provoking another Overdrive and can only be destroyed with Etherion. Using all Sinclaires, Lucia absorbs Endless. Lucia's objective is to destroy the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his descendant with Etherion after the original was ruined by a plague and his family was cursed as a result. After Haru finds all of the Raves, Elie uses Etherion to combine them. In order to avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest enemies in the Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it even if it means taking his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory's magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, and Haru and Elie return to Garage Island to live together.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Hiro Mashima - Japan Expo 2010 - Day3 - P1460391.jpg|thumb|Manga author Hiro Mashima expressed both joy and difficulty in making the series due its themes.<ref name=\"aboutinter1\"/>]]\nHiro Mashima created ''Rave Master'' with the idea of travelling around the world.<ref name=\"anninter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-08-17/hiro-mashima|title=Interview: Hiro Mashima|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref> Composed of thirty-five ''volumes'', Mashima comments that although it was sometimes difficult to think of how to develop the storyline, he still remembers enjoying the making of ''Rave Master''.

The series follows [[Haru Glory]], a teenager on a quest to find the five pieces of the sacred stone Rave in order to bring peace to the world by defeating the criminal group Demon Card. Mashima created this series with the idea of travelling around the world and was presented with difficulties in its serialization due to its considerable length.\n\nThe manga was serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from July 21, 1999 through July 10, 2005, and published in thirty-five ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes by [[Kodansha]]. The manga series was licensed for an English release in North America by [[Tokyopop]] until Kodansha allowed their contract to expire. It was also adapted into a fifty-one episode [[anime]] series by [[Studio Deen]]. The anime premiered on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] on October 13, 2001 and ran until September 28, 2002. Tokyopop also licensed the anime adaptation which premiered on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States on June 5, 2004 as part of the [[Toonami]] programming block and re-broadcast on [[Syfy]] in 2009.\n\nThe manga series has received generally positive critical response with praise commonly aimed towards the storyline and artwork. On the other hand, the localized anime adaptation has been panned for the multiple edits Tokyopop made to the original version which resulted in uninteresting and confusing dialogue, as well as unappealing music.\n\n==Plot==\n{{see also|List of Rave Master characters}}\nIn 0015, the world is corrupted by Dark Bring, dark stones that bestow powerful magic with different abilities to their owners. The Dark Brings are used by the Raregroove Kingdom, and the Symphonia Kingdom fight against them with their five powerful Rave stones. [[List of Rave Master characters#Shiba Roses|Shiba Roses]], the Rave Master, attempts to destroy Sinclaire, the \"mother\" of all of the Dark Brings, with the Ten Commandments sword. However, the aftermath causes a massive explosion known as Overdrive, destroying one-tenth of the known world. Shiba, protected from the disaster by his special guardian \"dog\" [[List of Rave Master characters#Plue|Plue]], holds onto the Rave required to power his sword. Plue and the four remaining Raves, however, get scattered around the world.\n\nFifty years later, sixteen-year-old [[List of Rave Master characters#Haru Glory|Haru Glory]] lives on the peaceful Garage Island with his older sister, Cattleya. Shotrly after Haru accidentally fishes Plue up, Shiba arrives wishing to reclaim Plue, but a group of terrorists from the Demon Card organization appear to kill Shiba. Shiba tells Haru that he is the second Rave Master, entrusting the Ten Commandments, Plue, and his Rave to him. Seeking power to defeat Demon Card, Haru and Plue set off on a journey to find the missing Rave stones. Upon arriving at Hip Hop Island, Haru befriends a girl named [[List of Rave Master characters#Elie|Elie]], who has no recollection of her past. During their journey, Haru encounters enemies from Demon Card who eventually become his allies, including [[List of Rave Master characters#Shuda|Shuda]] and [[List of Rave Master characters#Sieg Hart|Sieg Hart]]. Haru later meets a diverse group of allies, including [[List of Rave Master characters#Hamrio Musica|Hamrio Musica]], grandson of a blacksmith; [[List of Rave Master characters#Let Dahaka|Let Dahaka]] and [[List of Rave Master characters#Julia|Julia]], two who appear human but are in fact of the Dragon Race; [[List of Rave Master characters#Griffon Kato|Griffon Kato]], a strange blue creature and Plue's friend; [[List of Rave Master characters#Ruby|Ruby]], a penguin and a casino owner; [[List of Rave Master characters#Belnika|Belnika]], a mage; and [[List of Rave Master characters#Niebel|Niebel]], Sieg's close friend. He also encounters [[List of Rave Master characters#Gale Raregroove|Gale \"King\" Raregroove]], the king of the Raregroove Kingdom and leader of Demon Card. On the Tower of Din, Haru reunites with his absent father [[List of Rave Master characters#Gale Glory|Gale Glory]] to defeat King and end Demon Card. Although they win, Gale sacrifices himself to save his son from Din's destruction.\n\nSome time later, King's son, [[List of Rave Master characters#Lucia Raregroove|Lucia]], appears and revives Demon Card. He wishes to capture Elie to use the magical energy known as Etherion hidden within her body. While facing Lucia and his forces, Haru's group also learn of the mythical creature known as Endless, which threatens mankind by provoking another Overdrive and can only be destroyed with Etherion. Using all Sinclaires, Lucia absorbs Endless. Lucia's objective is to destroy the world, which is actually a parallel dimension created by his descendant with Etherion after the original was ruined by a plague and his family was cursed as a result. After Haru finds all of the Raves, Elie uses Etherion to combine them. In order to avoid another Overdrive, Haru and his friends oppose Lucia and his strongest enemies in the Star Memory. Although Haru defeats Lucia, he is absorbed by Endless and convinces Elie to destroy it even if it means taking his life. One year later, Elie has lost her memories of Haru, and she and the others visit his grave. Haru appears alive thanks to the Star Memory's magic and reunites with Elie, who then remembers him. The warriors go their separate ways, and Haru and Elie return to Garage Island to live together.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:Hiro Mashima - Japan Expo 2010 - Day3 - P1460391.jpg|thumb|Manga author Hiro Mashima expressed both joy and difficulty in making the series due its themes.<ref name=\"aboutinter1\"/>]]\nHiro Mashima created ''Rave Master'' with the idea of travelling around the world.<ref name=\"anninter\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2008-08-17/hiro-mashima|title=Interview: Hiro Mashima|author=Santos, Carlo|publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=August 17, 2008 |accessdate=November 7, 2009}}</ref> Composed of thirty-five ''volumes'', Mashima comments that although it was sometimes difficult to think of how to develop the storyline, he still remembers enjoying the making of ''Rave Master''.
