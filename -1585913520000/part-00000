These ideas were expanded by [[Kokugaku]] scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]], and seen in Takenouchi Shikibu's theory of absolute loyalty to the [[Emperor of Japan]] ([[:ja:\u5c0a\u7687\u8ad6|\u5c0a\u7687\u8ad6]] ''sonn\u014dron''), that implied that less loyalty should be given to the ruling Tokugawa shogunate.\n\n[[Mitogaku]] scholar [[Aizawa Seishisai]] introduced the term ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' into modern Japanese in his work ''Shinron'' in 1825, where ''sonn\u014d'' was regarded as the reverence expressed by the Tokugawa Shogunate to the emperor and ''j\u014di'' was the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Japan#Persecution and martyrdom|proscription of Christianity]].\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Mito rebellion samurai under Sonno Joi banner.jpg|thumb|Part of a woodblock print by [[:ja:\u6b4c\u5ddd\u56fd\u8f1d (3\u4ee3\u76ee)|Utagawa Kuniteru III]] depicting [[samurai]] under a ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' banner during the 1864 [[Mito Rebellion]] ]]\nWith the increasing number of incursions of foreign ships into Japanese waters in the late 18th and early 19th century, the ''[[sakoku]]'' (\"national seclusion\") policy came increasingly into question. The ''j\u014di'' \"expel the barbarians\" portion of ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'', changed into a reaction against the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] of 1854, which opened Japan to foreign trade. Under military threat from Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s so-called \"black ships\", the treaty was signed under duress and was vehemently opposed in ''[[samurai]]'' quarters. The fact that the Tokugawa Shogunate was powerless against the foreigners despite the will expressed by the Imperial court was taken as evidence by [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] and other anti-Tokugawa leaders that the ''sonn\u014d'' (revere the Emperor) portion of the philosophy was not working, and that the Shogunate must be replaced by a government more able to show its loyalty to the Emperor by enforcing the Emperor\u2019s will.\n\nThe philosophy was thus adopted as a battle cry of the rebellious regions of [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]] and [[Satsuma Province]]. The Imperial court in [[Kyoto]] sympathized with the movement. [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] personally agreed with such sentiments, and \u2013 breaking with centuries of imperial tradition \u2013 personally began to take an active role in matters of state: as opportunities arose, he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession. His efforts culminated in March 1863 with his \"[[Order to Expel Barbarians]]\" ({{lang|ja|\u6518\u5937\u52c5\u547d}}). Although the Shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, it nevertheless inspired attacks against the Shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan, the most famous incident being the killing of the English trader [[Charles Lennox Richardson]]. Other attacks included the shelling of foreign shipping in [[Shimonoseki]].<ref>Hagiwara, p. 35.</ref> ''[[R\u014dnin]]s'' (masterless samurai) also rallied to the cause, assassinating Shogunate officials and Westerners.\n\nThis turned out to be the zenith of the ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' movement, since the [[European imperialism|European powers]] responded by demanding heavy [[war reparations]], followed by the [[bombardment of Kagoshima|British bombardment of Kagoshima]] when these were not forthcoming. While this incident showed that Japan was no match for Western military powers, it also served to further weaken the Shogunate, permitting the rebel provinces to ally and overthrow it, bringing about the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe slogan itself was never actually a government or rebel policy; for all its rhetoric, Satsuma in particular had close ties with the West, purchasing guns, artillery, ships and other technology.\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the symbolic restoration of [[Emperor Meiji]], the ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' slogan was replaced with ''[[fukoku ky\u014dhei]]'' ([[:ja:\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175|\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175]]), or \"enrich the nation, strengthen the armies\", the rallying call of the [[Meiji period]] and the seed of its actions during [[World War II]].\n\n==See also==\n*This phrase is featured and examined in [[James Clavell]]'s ''[[Gai-Jin (novel)|Gai-Jin: A Novel of Japan]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Akamatsu, Paul.

These ideas were expanded by [[Kokugaku]] scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]], and seen in Takenouchi Shikibu's theory of absolute loyalty to the [[Emperor of Japan]] ([[:ja:\u5c0a\u7687\u8ad6|\u5c0a\u7687\u8ad6]] ''sonn\u014dron''), that implied that less loyalty should be given to the ruling Tokugawa shogunate.\n\n[[Mitogaku]] scholar [[Aizawa Seishisai]] introduced the term ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' into modern Japanese in his work ''Shinron'' in 1825, where ''sonn\u014d'' was regarded as the reverence expressed by the Tokugawa Shogunate to the emperor and ''j\u014di'' was the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Japan#Persecution and martyrdom|proscription of Christianity]].\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:Mito rebellion samurai under Sonno Joi banner.jpg|thumb|Part of a woodblock print by [[:ja:\u6b4c\u5ddd\u56fd\u8f1d (3\u4ee3\u76ee)|Utagawa Kuniteru III]] depicting [[samurai]] under a ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' banner during the 1864 [[Mito Rebellion]] ]]\nWith the increasing number of incursions of foreign ships into Japanese waters in the late 18th and early 19th century, the ''[[sakoku]]'' (\"national seclusion\") policy came increasingly into question. The ''j\u014di'' \"expel the barbarians\" portion of ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'', changed into a reaction against the [[Convention of Kanagawa]] of 1854, which opened Japan to foreign trade. Under military threat from Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]]'s so-called \"black ships\", the treaty was signed under duress and was vehemently opposed in ''[[samurai]]'' quarters. The fact that the Tokugawa Shogunate was powerless against the foreigners despite the will expressed by the Imperial court was taken as evidence by [[Yoshida Sh\u014din]] and other anti-Tokugawa leaders that the ''sonn\u014d'' (revere the Emperor) portion of the philosophy was not working, and that the Shogunate must be replaced by a government more able to show its loyalty to the Emperor by enforcing the Emperor\u2019s will.\n\nThe philosophy was thus adopted as a battle cry of the rebellious regions of [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain]] and [[Satsuma Province]]. The Imperial court in [[Kyoto]] sympathized with the movement. [[Emperor K\u014dmei]] personally agreed with such sentiments, and \u2013 breaking with centuries of imperial tradition \u2013 personally began to take an active role in matters of state: as opportunities arose, he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession. His efforts culminated in March 1863 with his \"[[Order to Expel Barbarians]]\" ({{lang|ja|\u6518\u5937\u52c5\u547d}}). Although the Shogunate had no intention of enforcing the order, it nevertheless inspired attacks against the Shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan, the most famous incident being the killing of the English trader [[Charles Lennox Richardson]]. Other attacks included the shelling of foreign shipping in [[Shimonoseki]].<ref>Hagiwara, p. 35.</ref> ''[[R\u014dnin]]s'' (masterless samurai) also rallied to the cause, assassinating Shogunate officials and Westerners.\n\nThis turned out to be the zenith of the ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' movement, since the [[European Imperialism|European powers]] responded by demanding heavy [[war reparations]], followed by the [[bombardment of Kagoshima|British bombardment of Kagoshima]] when these were not forthcoming. While this incident showed that Japan was no match for Western military powers, it also served to further weaken the Shogunate, permitting the rebel provinces to ally and overthrow it, bringing about the [[Meiji Restoration]].\n\nThe slogan itself was never actually a government or rebel policy; for all its rhetoric, Satsuma in particular had close ties with the West, purchasing guns, artillery, ships and other technology.\n\n==Legacy==\nAfter the symbolic restoration of [[Emperor Meiji]], the ''sonn\u014d j\u014di'' slogan was replaced with ''[[fukoku ky\u014dhei]]'' ([[:ja:\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175|\u5bcc\u56fd\u5f37\u5175]]), or \"enrich the nation, strengthen the armies\", the rallying call of the [[Meiji period]] and the seed of its actions during [[World War II]].\n\n==See also==\n*This phrase is featured and examined in [[James Clavell]]'s ''[[Gai-Jin (novel)|Gai-Jin: A Novel of Japan]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Akamatsu, Paul.

Brendan credited his brother [[Dominic Behan]] for writing it. 2 years later, Dominic released it on an album called Irish Songs. \nThe song was later made famous by [[Luke Kelly]], [[Ronnie Drew]] and [[The Dubliners]] in the late 1960s, and was revived for a new audience by Irish rock band the Pogues on their 1984 album ''Red Roses for Me''.\n\n==Content==\nThe song is used to introduce the play, a story about the occurrences in a prison (in real life [[Mountjoy Prison]] where Behan had once been lodged) the day a convict is set to be executed. The triangle in the title refers to the large metal triangle which was beaten daily in Mountjoy Prison to waken the inmates (\"The Auld Triangle goes Jingle Jangle\"). The triangle still hangs in the prison at the centre where the wings meet on a metal gate. It is no longer used, though the hammer to beat it is mounted beside it.\nIn the original play by Brendan Behan, the song is written as the \"old triangle\" not \"auld triangle\". \n\nThe triangle was rung regularly to signify points in the prison's routine.\n[[File:Mountjoy Jail and Prison Van.jpg|thumb|right|The Quare Fellow takes place in Mountjoy prison during the early 1950's]]\nA second level of meaning is hinted at in the final verse in which the singer imagines himself dwelling in the women's prison.

The bacteria generally enter the body through wounds, inhalation, or ingestion. Person-to-person or animal-to-human transmission is extremely rare.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The infection is constantly present in Southeast Asia particularly in northeast [[Thailand]] and northern Australia.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In developed countries such as Europe and the United States, melioidosis cases are usually imported from countries where melioidosis is more common.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> The signs and symptoms of melioidosis can resemble [[tuberculosis]], and misdiagnosis is common.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> Diagnosis is usually confirmed by the growth of ''B. pseudomallei'' from an infected person's blood or other bodily fluid.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Those with melioidosis are generally treated first with an \"intensive phase\" course of intravenous antibiotics (most commonly [[ceftazidime]]) followed by a several month treatment course of [[co-trimoxazole]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Even if the disease is properly treated, approximately 10% of people with melioidosis die from the disease. If the disease is improperly treated, the death rate could be more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nEfforts to prevent melioidosis include: wearing protective gear while handling contaminated water, practising hand hygiene, drinking boiled water, and avoiding direct contact with soil, water, or heavy rain.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The [[antibiotic]] [[co-trimoxazole]] is used as a preventative only for individuals at high risk for getting the disease after being exposed to the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> There is no approved vaccine for melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nApproximately 165,000 people are infected by melioidosis per year, resulting in about 89,000 deaths.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Diabetes]] is a major risk factor for melioidosis; over half of melioidosis cases are in people with diabetes.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Increased rainfall is associated with increased number of melioidosis cases in [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] areas.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> The disease was first described by Alfred Whitmore in 1912 in present-day [[Myanmar]].<ref name=\"Whitmore 1912\"/>\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n===Acute===\n[[File:Signs of melioidosis.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Schematic depiction of the signs of melioidosis]]\n[[File:Melioidosis PA and lateral X rays.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Chest X-ray showing opacity of the left middle and lower zones of the lung.]]\n[[File:CT and MRI scan of the brain with melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|CT and MRI scans showing lesion of the right frontal lobe of the brain.]]\n[[File:Septic arthritis of left hip joint with melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Septic arthritis of the left hip with joint destruction.]]\nMost people exposed to ''[[Burkholderia pseudomallei|B. pseudomallei]]'' experience no symptoms.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> For those who do experience symptoms, 85% experience acute melioidosis.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\">{{cite book |last1=Bennett |first1=John E |last2=Raphael |first2=Dolin |last3=Martin |first3=J Blaser |last4=Bart |first4=J Currie |title=Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases|chapter=223 |date=2015 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-1-4557-4801-3 |pages=2541\u20132549 |edition=Eighth}}</ref> The mean [[incubation period]] of acute melioidosis is 9 days (range 1&ndash;21 days).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, symptoms of melioidosis can appear in 24 hours for those experienced near drowning in water.<ref name=\"Bennett 2015\"/> Those affected present with symptoms of [[sepsis]] (predominantly fever) with or without [[pneumonia]], or localised [[abscess]] or other focus of infection. The presence of non-specific signs and symptoms has caused melioidosis to be nicknamed \"the great mimicker\".<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nPeople with [[diabetes mellitus]] or regular exposure to the bacteria are at increased risk of developing melioidosis. The disease should be considered in anyone staying in endemic areas who develops fever, pneumonia, or abscesses in their liver, spleen, prostate, or parotid gland.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The clinical manifestation of the disease can range from simple skin changes to severe organ problems.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In northern Australia, 60% of the infected children presented with only skin lesions, while 20% presented with pneumonia.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> The commonest organs affected are: liver, spleen, lungs, prostate, and kidneys. Among the most common clinical signs are [[bacteremia|presence of bacteria in blood]] (in 40 to 60% of cases), pneumonia (50%), and [[septic shock]] (20%).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People with only pneumonia may have a prominent cough with sputum and shortness of breath. However, those with septic shock together with pneumonia may have minimal coughing.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> Results of a chest X-ray can range from diffuse nodular infiltrates in those with septic shock to progressive [[pulmonary consolidation|solidification of the lungs]] in the [[Lung#Anatomy|upper lobes]] for those with pneumonia only. [[Pleural effusion|Excess fluid in the pleural cavity]] and [[empyema|gathering of pus within a cavity]] are more common for melioidosis affecting lower lobes of the lungs. Therefore, melioidosis should be differentiated from [[tuberculosis]] as both conditions show radiogical changes on the upper lobes of the lungs.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> In 10% of cases, people develop secondary pneumonia caused by other bacteria after the primary infection.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\nDepending on the course of infection, other severe manifestations can develop. 1% to 5% of those infected develop [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and brain covering]] or [[brain abscess|collection of pus in the brain]]; 14 to 28% develop [[acute pyelonephritis|bacterial inflammation of the kidneys]], kidney abscess or prostatic abscesses; 0 to 30% develop neck or [[parotid gland|salivary gland]] abscesses; 10 to 33% develop liver, spleen, or paraintestinal abscesses; 4 to 14% develop [[septic arthritis]] and [[osteomyelitis]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  Other rare manifestations include [[lymphadenopathy|lymph node disease]] resembling tuberculosis, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] masses, [[pericardial effusion|collection of fluid in the heart covering]],<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> [[mycotic aneurysm|abnormal dilatation of blood vessels due to infection]],<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> and [[pancreatitis|inflammation of the pancreas]].<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> In Australia, up to 20% of infected males develop prostatic abscess characterized by [[dysuria|pain during urination]], difficulty in passing urine, and [[urinary retention]] requiring [[catheter]]ization.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Rectal examination]] can show inflammation of the [[prostate]].<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> In Thailand, 30% of the infected children develop parotid abscesses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Infections of the eye, such as sub[[conjunctiva]]l abscess and orbital [[cellulitis]] may also occur.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> Encephalomyelitis can occur in healthy people without risk factors. Those with melioidosis encephomyelitis tend to have normal [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans but increased [[T2*-weighted imaging|T2 signal]] by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), extending to the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]]. Clinical signs include: unilateral [[upper motor neuron]] limb weakness, [[focal neurological signs|cerebellar signs]], and cranial nerve palsies ([[Sixth nerve palsy|VI]], [[Facial nerve paralysis|VII]] nerve palsies and [[bulbar palsy]]). Some cases presented with [[flaccid paralysis]] alone.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> In northern Australia, all melioidosis with encephalomyelitis cases had elevated white cells (30 to 775 cells per microlitres) in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF), mostly [[mononuclear cell]]s.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

This has also led to a significant [[population decline]]: Petro\u0219ani is one of the Romanian cities which has experienced the fastest population loss from the 1990s onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-21239641-topul-localitatilor-cea-mai-dramatica-scadere-populatiei.htm|title=Topul localitatilor cu cea mai dramatica scadere a populatiei|website=hotnews.ro|accessdate=26 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023011441/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-21239641-topul-localitatilor-cea-mai-dramatica-scadere-populatiei.htm|archivedate=23 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Valea_Jiului.jpg|thumb|200 px|left|[[Jiu Valley]] on the map of Romania.
