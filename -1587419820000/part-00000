The contract manufacturer will quote the parts based on processes, labor, tooling, and material costs.  Typically a hiring firm will request quotes from multiple CMs. After the bidding process is complete, the hiring firm will select a source, and then, for the agreed-upon price, the CM acts as the hiring firm's factory, producing and shipping units of the design on behalf of the hiring firm.\n\n[[Job production]] is, in essence, manufacturing on a contract basis, and thus it forms a subset of the larger field of contract manufacturing.

They can only suggest strategies to the contract manufacturer; they cannot force them to implement them.\n* Relationships - It is imperative that the company forms a good relationship with its contract manufacturer. The company must keep in mind that the manufacturer has other customers. They cannot force them to produce their product before a competitor\u2019s. Most companies mitigate this risk by working cohesively with the manufacturer and awarding good performance with additional business.\n* [[Quality (business)|Quality]] concerns \u2013 When entering into a contract, companies must make sure that the manufacturer\u2019s standards are congruent with their own. They should evaluate the methods in which they test products to make sure they are of good [[Quality (business)|quality]]. The company has to rely on the contract manufacturer for having good suppliers that also meet these standards.\n* [[Intellectual property]] loss \u2013 When entering into a contract, a company is divulging their formulas or technologies. This is why it is important that a company not give out any of its [[core competency|core competencies]] to contract manufacturers. It is very easy for an employee to download such information from a computer and steal it.\n* [[Outsourcing]] risks \u2013 Although [[outsourcing]] to [[low-cost country sourcing|low-cost]] countries has become very popular, it does bring along risks such as language barriers, cultural differences and long lead times.<ref name=\"Strategic Supply Chain Management\" /> This could make the management of contract manufacturers more difficult, expensive and time-consuming.\n* [[Capacity utilization|Capacity]] constraints \u2013 If a company does not make up a large portion of the contract manufacturer\u2019s business, they may find that they are de-prioritized over other companies during high [[Production (economics)|production]] periods. Thus, they may not obtain the product they need when they need it.\n* Loss of flexibility and responsiveness \u2013 Without direct control over the manufacturing facility, the company will lose some of its ability to respond to disruptions in the supply chain. It may also hurt their ability to respond to demand fluctuations, risking their customer service levels.\n* Pricing \u2013 This addition of a second company and second [[profit margin]] to be achieved, adds in cost to the product. The impact is seen either in a higher selling price to the customer or in a reduced profit margin for the company.\n\n==Protectionism==\nIn an international context, establishing a foreign subsidiary as a contract manufacturer can have favorable tax benefits for the parent company, allowing them to reduce overall tax liabilities and increase profits, depending upon the activities of the contract manufacturer.

Retrieved on 2016-04-02.</ref> Kagwe's professional road racing career began in 1994 and he continued to compete at a high level until 2006. After he turned forty and entered the [[masters athletics|veterans category]], he returned to running, making some appearances in 2011.<ref name=ARRS/> He also won the [[Prague International Marathon]] and the [[San Diego Marathon]].\n\n==Career==\nA small runner at five foot six inches, Kagwe did not take running seriously until he was 18. He was inspired by the feats of [[John Ngugi]] but the strength of athletes in Kenya forced him to try progressively longer distances.<ref name=NY>Litsky, Frank (1997-11-04).

''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved on 2016-04-02.</ref> He competed mainly in the United States and his first race abroad was the [[Gasparilla Distance Classic]] in 1994, later that year he ran at the [[Boston Marathon]] and placed sixteenth with 2:11:52 hours. He was runner-up at the [[Cleveland Marathon]] and month later. He established himself further with a fourth-place finish at the [[Philadelphia Distance Run]] and third at the [[Twin Cities Marathon]] later that year. His first marathon win came in 1995, when he took the [[Pittsburgh Marathon]] title with a personal record of 2:10:24 hours. A win at the [[Atlantic City]] Half Marathon preceded his debut at the New York Marathon in 1995, at which he finished fifth.<ref name=ARRS>[https://more.arrs.run/runner/454/1/date/asc John Kagwe]. [[Association of Road Racing Statisticians]]. Retrieved on 2016-04-02.</ref>\n\nA lifetime best of 61:31 minutes in the [[half marathon]] came in March 1996 in [[Lisbon Half Marathon|Lisbon]]. His only marathon that year was in New York and he came close to his best with 2:10:59 hours. The following year he was victorious at the [[Fifth Third River Bank Run]] as well as the [[Prague International Marathon]] (his first win in Europe). Among his outings in the United States that year was a runner-up finish at the Philadelphia Distance Run.<ref name=ARRS/> He had the breakthrough of his career that November, winning the New York City Marathon race.

In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times.

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority.

David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, ''The United States of Arugula'') noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<ref>Kamp, pg. 55</ref> He compares [[Dione Lucas]]' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<ref>Kamp, pg. 57</ref> Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as ''James Beard'', the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\"<ref>Kamp, pg. 58</ref> He noted that Beard met [[Alice B.

In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority.

It is preserved as a gathering place where the press and general public could appreciate the talents of emerging and established chefs.\n\nIn 1986, the [[James Beard Foundation]] was established in Beard's honor to provide scholarships to aspiring food professionals and champion the American culinary tradition which Beard helped create.<ref name=\"Kamp 294\">Kamp, pg. 294</ref> \"Since its inception in 1991, the James Beard Foundation Scholarship Program has awarded over $4.6&nbsp;million in financial aid to a variety of students\u2014from recent high school graduates, to working culinary professionals, to career changers. Recipients come from many countries, and enhance their knowledge at schools around the world.\"<ref>[http://www.jamesbeard.org/education/scholarships-and-grants James Beard Foundation Scholarships & Grants Information]</ref>\n\nThe annual James Beard Foundation Awards celebrate fine cuisine around Beard's birthday. Held on the first Monday in May, the awards ceremony honors American chefs, restaurants, journalists, cookbook authors, restaurant designers and electronic-media professionals. It culminates in a reception featuring tastings of signature dishes of more than 30 of the foundation's chefs. A quarterly magazine, ''Beard House'', is a compendium of culinary journalism. The foundation also publishes the ''James Beard Foundation Restaurant Directory'', a directory of all chefs who have presented a meal at the Beard House or participated in one of the foundation's outside fundraising events.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe foundation was affected by scandals; in 2004 its head, Leonard Pickell, resigned and was imprisoned for grand [[larceny]] and in 2005 the board of trustees resigned. During this period, chef and writer [[Anthony Bourdain]] called the foundation \"a kind of benevolent [[extortion|shakedown]] operation.\"<ref>As quoted by Mike Weiss, \"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/05/05/DDG0ACJC0K1.DTL Recipe for Scandal]\"  San Francisco Chronicle, 05 May 2005; accessed 02 May 2016</ref> A new board of trustees has instituted an ethics policy and chosen a president, Susan Ungaro, to prevent future problems.\n\n==Works==\n*''Hors d'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'' (1940) M.
