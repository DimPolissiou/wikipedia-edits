During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

This followed the Maharashtra Vidhan sabha elections in October 2019 where the BJP\u2013Shiv-Sena and NCP\u2013Congress alliances remained intact for seat sharing. The BJP and Shiv Sena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP, with 105 seats, was far short of the 145 seats required to form majority and declined to form a minority government. At the same time, Shiv Sena started talks with the NCP and Congress to form government. However, in a dramatic and controversial move, on 23 November 2019, the BJP formed a government with support from NCP, with [[Ajit Pawar]] as Deputy Chief Minister. This government collapsed three days later with Chief Minister [[Devendra Fadnavis]] and Ajit Pawar resigning their respective positions. On 28 November 2019, the governor swore in [[Uddhav Thackeray]], the Shiv Sena chief, as the new chief minister of Maharashtra. Thackeray's governing coalition includes Shiv Sena, NCP, INC, and a number of independent members of legislative assembly.The cabinet includes ministers from NCP in key portfolios.<ref>{{cite news |title=Political drama has gripped the home state of Bollywood |url=https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/11/29/political-drama-has-gripped-the-home-state-of-bollywood |accessdate=30 November 2019 |issue=30 November 2019 |publisher=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Maharashtra: With 169 votes, Uddhav-led govt sails through Assembly floor test, BJP stages walkout |url=https://indianexpress.com/article/india/maharashtra-assembly-floor-test-uddhav-thackeray-fadnavis-bjp-shiv-sena-ncp-congressmaharashtra-uddhav-led-mahavikasaghadi-govt-wins-trust-vote-bjp-stages-walkout-6144236/ |accessdate=30 November 2019 |work=Indian Express |issue=30 November 2019 |publisher=Indian Express newspapers}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Party symbol==\nThe election symbol of NCP is an analogue clock.<ref>http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/OrdersNotifications/Symbols_Sep_2009.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/ElectoralLaws/OrdersNotifications/Symbols_Sep_2009.pdf |title=Symbols |date=2009 |website=eci.nic.in |format=PDF}}</ref>\nThe clock is drawn in blue and has two legs and an alarm button.

This followed the Maharashtra Vidhan sabha elections in October 2019 where the BJP\u2013Shiv-Sena and NCP\u2013Congress alliances remained intact for seat sharing. The BJP and Shiv Sena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP, with 105 seats, was far short of the 145 seats required to form majority and declined to form a minority government. At the same time, Shiv Sena started talks with the NCP and Congress to form government. However, in a dramatic and controversial move, on 23 November 2019, the BJP formed a government with support from NCP, with [[Ajit Pawar]] as Deputy Chief Minister. This government collapsed three days later with Chief Minister [[Devendra Fadnavis]] and Ajit Pawar resigning their respective positions. On 28 November 2019, the governor swore in [[Uddhav Thackeray]], the Shiv Sena chief, as the new chief minister of Maharashtra.

{"title_page": "Observer pattern", "text_new": "The '''observer pattern''' is a [[design pattern (computer science)|software design pattern]] in which an [[Object (computer science)#Objects in object-oriented programming|object]], called the '''subject''', maintains a list of its dependents, called '''observers''', and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their [[Method (computer science)|methods]].\n\nIt is mainly used to implement distributed [[event handling]] systems, in \"event driven\" software. In those systems, the subject is usually called a \"stream of events\" or \"stream source of events\", while the observers are called \"sink of events\". The stream nomenclature simulates or adapts to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events of the subject/stream-source. This pattern then perfectly suits any process where data arrives through I/O, that is, where data is not available to the CPU at startup, but can arrive \"randomly\" (HTTP requests, GPIO data, user input from keyboard/mouse/..., distributed databases and blockchains, ...). Most modern languages have built-in \"event\" constructs which implement the observer pattern components. While not mandatory most 'observers' implementations will use background threads listening for subject events and other support mechanism from the kernel (Linux epoll, ...)\n\n==Overview==\nThe Observer design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known ''[[Design Patterns|\"Gang of Four\" design patterns]]'' that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.<ref name=\"GoF\">{{cite book|author=Erich Gamma|url=https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/293|title=Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software|last2=Richard Helm|last3=Ralph Johnson|last4=John Vlissides|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1994|isbn=0-201-63361-2|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/293 293ff]|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===What problems can the Observer design pattern solve?===\nThe Observer pattern addresses the following problems:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Observer design pattern - Problem, Solution, and Applicability|url=http://w3sdesign.com/?gr=b07&ugr=proble|website=w3sDesign.com|accessdate=2017-08-12}}</ref>\n* A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled. \n* It should be ensured that when one object changes state an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.\n* It should be possible that one object can notify an open-ended number of other objects.\n\nDefining a one-to-many dependency between objects by defining one object (subject) that updates the state of dependent objects directly is inflexible \nbecause it couples the subject to particular dependent objects. Still it can make sense from a performance point of view or if the object implementation is tightly coupled (think of low level kernel structures that execute thousands of times a second).\nTightly coupled objects can be hard to implement in some scenarios, and reuse because they refer to and know about (how to update) many different objects with different interfaces.\nIn other scenarios tightly coupled objects can be a better option since the compiler will be able to detect errors at compile time and optimize the code at CPU instruction level.\n\n===What solution does the Observer design pattern describe?===\n* Define <code>Subject</code> and <code>Observer</code> objects.\n* so that when a subject changes state, all registered observers are notified and updated automatically (and probably asynchronously).\n\nThe sole responsibility of a subject is to maintain a list of observers and to notify them of state changes by calling their <code>update()</code> operation. \n<br>\nThe responsibility of observers is to register (and unregister) themselves on a subject (to get notified of state changes) and to update their state (synchronize their state with subject's state) when they are notified. \n<br>\nThis makes subject and observers loosely coupled.\nSubject and observers have no explicit knowledge of each other.\nObservers can be added and removed independently at run-time.<br>\nThis notification-registration interaction is also known as [[publish-subscribe]].<br>\n\nSee also the UML class and sequence diagram below.\n\n== Strong vs. weak reference ==\n\nThe observer pattern can cause [[memory leak]]s, known as the [[lapsed listener problem]], because in basic implementation it requires both explicit registration and explicit deregistration, as in the [[dispose pattern]], because the subject holds strong references to the observers, keeping them alive. This can be prevented by the subject holding [[weak reference]]s to the observers.\n\n== Coupling and typical pub-sub implementations ==\n \nTypically, the observer pattern is implemented so the \"subject\" being \"observed\" is part of the object for which state changes are being observed (and communicated to the observers). This type of implementation is considered \"[[tightly coupled system|tightly coupled]]\", forcing both the observers and the subject to be aware of each other and have access to their internal parts, creating possible issues of [[scalability]], speed, message recovery and maintenance (also called event or notification loss), the lack of flexibility in conditional dispersion, and possible hindrance to desired security measures. In some ([[polling (computer science)|non-polling]]) implementations of the [[publish-subscribe pattern]] (aka the ''pub-sub'' pattern), this is solved by creating a dedicated \"message queue\" server (and sometimes an extra \"message handler\" object) as an extra stage between the observer and the object being observed, thus decoupling the components. In these cases, the message queue server is accessed by the observers with the observer pattern, \"subscribing to certain messages\" knowing only about the expected message (or not, in some cases), while knowing nothing about the message sender itself; the sender also may know nothing about the observers. Other implementations of the publish-subscribe pattern, which achieve a similar effect of notification and communication to interested parties, do not use the observer pattern at all.<ref>[https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki/Comparison-between-different-Observer-Pattern-implementations Comparison between different observer pattern implementations] Moshe Bindler, 2015 (Github)</ref><ref>[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch09s05.html Differences between pub/sub and observer pattern] The Observer Pattern by Adi Osmani (Safari books online)</ref> \n\nIn early implementations of multi-window operating systems like OS/2 and Windows, the terms \"publish-subscribe pattern\" and \"event driven software development\" were used as a synonym for the observer pattern.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=18wFKrkDdM0C&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230 The Windows Programming Experience] [[Charles Petzold]], Nov 10, 1992, [[PC Magazine]] ([[Google Books]])</ref> \n\nThe observer pattern, as described in the [[Design Patterns | GoF book]], is a very basic concept and does not address removing interest in changes to the observed \"subject\" or special logic to be done by the observed \"subject\" before or after notifying the observers. The pattern also does not deal with recording when change notifications are sent or guaranteeing that they are being received. These concerns are typically handled in message queueing systems of which the observer pattern is only a small part. \n\nRelated patterns: [[Publish\u2013subscribe pattern]], [[mediator pattern|mediator]], [[singleton pattern|singleton]].\n\n===Uncoupled===\nThe observer pattern may be used in the absence of publish-subscribe, as in the case where model status is frequently updated.  Frequent updates may cause the view to become unresponsive (e.g by invoking many [[painter's algorithm|repaint]] calls); such observers should instead use a timer.  Thus instead of being overloaded by change message, the observer will cause the view to represent the approximate state of the model at a regular interval.  This mode of observer is particularly useful for [[progress bar|progress bars]], where the underlying operation's progress changes with several times per second.\n\n==Structure==\n===UML class and sequence diagram===\n\n[[File:w3sDesign Observer Design Pattern UML.jpg|frame|none|A sample UML class and sequence diagram for the Observer design pattern. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Observer design pattern - Structure and Collaboration|url=http://w3sdesign.com/?gr=b07&ugr=struct|website=w3sDesign.com|accessdate=2017-08-12}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the above [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[class diagram]], the <code>Subject</code> class doesn't update the state of dependent objects directly.\nInstead, <code>Subject</code> refers to the <code>Observer</code> interface (<code>update()</code>) for updating state, which makes the <code>Subject</code> independent of how the state of dependent objects is updated.\nThe <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code> classes implement the <code>Observer</code> interface by synchronizing their state with subject's state.\n<br>\n\nThe [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[Sequence diagram|sequence diagram]]\nshows the run-time interactions: The <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code> objects call <code>attach(this)</code> on <code>Subject1</code> to register themselves. Assuming that the state of <code>Subject1</code> changes,\n<code>Subject1</code> calls <code>notify()</code> on itself.\n<br>\n<code>notify()</code> calls <code>update()</code> on\nthe registered  <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code>\nobjects, which request the changed data (<code>getState()</code>) from <code>Subject1</code> to update (synchronize) their state.\n\n===UML class diagram===\n[[File:Observer w update.svg|none|thumb|500x500px|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] class diagram of Observer pattern]]\n\n==Example==\n<!-- Wikipedia is not a list of examples.

In those systems, the subject is usually called a \"stream of events\" or \"stream source of events\", while the observers are called \"sink of events\". The stream nomenclature simulates or adapts to a physical setup where the observers are physically separated and have no control over the emitted events of the subject/stream-source. This pattern then perfectly suits any process where data arrives through I/O, that is, where data is not available to the CPU at startup, but can arrive \"randomly\" (HTTP requests, GPIO data, user input from keyboard/mouse/..., distributed databases and blockchains, ...). Most modern languages have built-in \"event\" constructs which implement the observer pattern components. While not mandatory most 'observers' implementations will use background threads listening for subject events and other support mechanism from the kernel (Linux epoll, ...)\n\n==Overview==\nThe Observer design pattern is one of the twenty-three well-known ''[[Design Patterns|\"Gang of Four\" design patterns]]'' that describe how to solve recurring design problems to design flexible and reusable object-oriented software, that is, objects that are easier to implement, change, test, and reuse.<ref name=\"GoF\">{{cite book|author=Erich Gamma|url=https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/293|title=Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software|last2=Richard Helm|last3=Ralph Johnson|last4=John Vlissides|publisher=Addison Wesley|year=1994|isbn=0-201-63361-2|location=|pages=[https://archive.org/details/designpatternsel00gamm/page/293 293ff]|url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\n===What problems can the Observer design pattern solve?===\nThe Observer pattern addresses the following problems:<ref>{{cite web|title=The Observer design pattern - Problem, Solution, and Applicability|url=http://w3sdesign.com/?gr=b07&ugr=proble|website=w3sDesign.com|accessdate=2017-08-12}}</ref>\n* A one-to-many dependency between objects should be defined without making the objects tightly coupled. \n* It should be ensured that when one object changes state an open-ended number of dependent objects are updated automatically.\n* It should be possible that one object can notify an open-ended number of other objects.\n\nDefining a one-to-many dependency between objects by defining one object (subject) that updates the state of dependent objects directly is inflexible \nbecause it couples the subject to particular dependent objects. Still it can make sense from a performance point of view or if the object implementation is tightly coupled (think of low level kernel structures that execute thousands of times a second).\nTightly coupled objects can be hard to implement in some scenarios, and reuse because they refer to and know about (how to update) many different objects with different interfaces.\nIn other scenarios tightly coupled objects can be a better option since the compiler will be able to detect errors at compile time and optimize the code at CPU instruction level.\n\n===What solution does the Observer design pattern describe?===\n* Define <code>Subject</code> and <code>Observer</code> objects.\n* so that when a subject changes state, all registered observers are notified and updated automatically (and probably asynchronously).\n\nThe sole responsibility of a subject is to maintain a list of observers and to notify them of state changes by calling their <code>update()</code> operation. \n<br>\nThe responsibility of observers is to register (and unregister) themselves on a subject (to get notified of state changes) and to update their state (synchronize their state with subject's state) when they are notified. \n<br>\nThis makes subject and observers loosely coupled.\nSubject and observers have no explicit knowledge of each other.\nObservers can be added and removed independently at run-time.<br>\nThis notification-registration interaction is also known as [[publish-subscribe]].<br>\n\nSee also the UML class and sequence diagram below.\n\n== Strong vs. weak reference ==\n\nThe observer pattern can cause [[memory leak]]s, known as the [[lapsed listener problem]], because in basic implementation it requires both explicit registration and explicit deregistration, as in the [[dispose pattern]], because the subject holds strong references to the observers, keeping them alive. This can be prevented by the subject holding [[weak reference]]s to the observers.\n\n== Coupling and typical pub-sub implementations ==\n \nTypically, the observer pattern is implemented so the \"subject\" being \"observed\" is part of the object for which state changes are being observed (and communicated to the observers). This type of implementation is considered \"[[tightly coupled system|tightly coupled]]\", forcing both the observers and the subject to be aware of each other and have access to their internal parts, creating possible issues of [[scalability]], speed, message recovery and maintenance (also called event or notification loss), the lack of flexibility in conditional dispersion, and possible hindrance to desired security measures. In some ([[polling (computer science)|non-polling]]) implementations of the [[publish-subscribe pattern]] (aka the ''pub-sub'' pattern), this is solved by creating a dedicated \"message queue\" server (and sometimes an extra \"message handler\" object) as an extra stage between the observer and the object being observed, thus decoupling the components. In these cases, the message queue server is accessed by the observers with the observer pattern, \"subscribing to certain messages\" knowing only about the expected message (or not, in some cases), while knowing nothing about the message sender itself; the sender also may know nothing about the observers. Other implementations of the publish-subscribe pattern, which achieve a similar effect of notification and communication to interested parties, do not use the observer pattern at all.<ref>[https://github.com/millermedeiros/js-signals/wiki/Comparison-between-different-Observer-Pattern-implementations Comparison between different observer pattern implementations] Moshe Bindler, 2015 (Github)</ref><ref>[https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-design/9781449334840/ch09s05.html Differences between pub/sub and observer pattern] The Observer Pattern by Adi Osmani (Safari books online)</ref> \n\nIn early implementations of multi-window operating systems like OS/2 and Windows, the terms \"publish-subscribe pattern\" and \"event driven software development\" were used as a synonym for the observer pattern.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=18wFKrkDdM0C&pg=PA230&lpg=PA230 The Windows Programming Experience] [[Charles Petzold]], Nov 10, 1992, [[PC Magazine]] ([[Google Books]])</ref> \n\nThe observer pattern, as described in the [[Design Patterns | GoF book]], is a very basic concept and does not address removing interest in changes to the observed \"subject\" or special logic to be done by the observed \"subject\" before or after notifying the observers. The pattern also does not deal with recording when change notifications are sent or guaranteeing that they are being received. These concerns are typically handled in message queueing systems of which the observer pattern is only a small part. \n\nRelated patterns: [[Publish\u2013subscribe pattern]], [[mediator pattern|mediator]], [[singleton pattern|singleton]].\n\n===Uncoupled===\nThe observer pattern may be used in the absence of publish-subscribe, as in the case where model status is frequently updated.  Frequent updates may cause the view to become unresponsive (e.g by invoking many [[painter's algorithm|repaint]] calls); such observers should instead use a timer.  Thus instead of being overloaded by change message, the observer will cause the view to represent the approximate state of the model at a regular interval.  This mode of observer is particularly useful for [[progress bar|progress bars]], where the underlying operation's progress changes with several times per second.\n\n==Structure==\n===UML class and sequence diagram===\n\n[[File:w3sDesign Observer Design Pattern UML.jpg|frame|none|A sample UML class and sequence diagram for the Observer design pattern. <ref>{{cite web|title=The Observer design pattern - Structure and Collaboration|url=http://w3sdesign.com/?gr=b07&ugr=struct|website=w3sDesign.com|accessdate=2017-08-12}}</ref>]]\n\nIn the above [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[class diagram]], the <code>Subject</code> class doesn't update the state of dependent objects directly.\nInstead, <code>Subject</code> refers to the <code>Observer</code> interface (<code>update()</code>) for updating state, which makes the <code>Subject</code> independent of how the state of dependent objects is updated.\nThe <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code> classes implement the <code>Observer</code> interface by synchronizing their state with subject's state.\n<br>\n\nThe [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] [[Sequence diagram|sequence diagram]]\nshows the run-time interactions: The <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code> objects call <code>attach(this)</code> on <code>Subject1</code> to register themselves. Assuming that the state of <code>Subject1</code> changes,\n<code>Subject1</code> calls <code>notify()</code> on itself.\n<br>\n<code>notify()</code> calls <code>update()</code> on\nthe registered  <code>Observer1</code> and <code>Observer2</code>\nobjects, which request the changed data (<code>getState()</code>) from <code>Subject1</code> to update (synchronize) their state.\n\n===UML class diagram===\n[[File:Observer w update.svg|none|thumb|500x500px|[[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] class diagram of Observer pattern]]\n\n==Example==\n<!-- Wikipedia is not a list of examples.
