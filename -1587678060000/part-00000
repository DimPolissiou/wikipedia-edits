However, it has been suggested that Pruss maintained his belief of sabotage because of guilt or to maintain the credibility of himself and the airship business.<ref name=Untold>''[[Hindenburg: The Untold Story]]'', distributed by [[Channel 4]] International, May 6, 2007.</ref>\n\n==After the ''Hindenburg''==\nPruss returned to Germany around October 1937, where he served as commandant of [[Frankfurt Airport]] as [[World War II]] broke out.  By this time he was already urging the modernization of Germany's remaining Zeppelin fleet, and during a 1940 visit of [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] to Frankfurt Airport this was the subject of an alleged quarrel between Pruss and G\u00f6ring.  In the 1950s Pruss tried to raise money for new Zeppelin construction, citing the comfort and luxury of this mode of transportation.<ref>Waibel, B. (2002): Das Projekt LZ 132.

This portrayal is inaccurate because Pruss is portrayed as ignoring the advice of the 2nd Captain [[Ernst Lehmann]], who only traveled as an observer,<ref name=press /> saying \"I'll do the worrying on this trip\".{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In the docudrama ''[[Hindenburg: The Untold Story]]'' he was portrayed by [[Albert Welling]].

Their major regional center was at [[Cahokia Mounds]], active from 900 to 1500. Due to numerous major [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the \"Mound City\". These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area included the [[Siouan]]-speaking [[Osage people]], whose territory extended west, and the [[Illiniwek]].\n\nEuropean exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] traveled through the Mississippi River valley.  Five years later, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] claimed the region for France as part of ''[[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]].''\n\n[[File:ChouteauMansion.jpg|thumb|left|The home of [[Auguste Chouteau]] in St. Louis. Chouteau and [[Pierre Lacl\u00e8de]] founded St. Louis in 1764.]]\nThe earliest European settlements in the area were built in [[Illinois Country]] (also known as Upper Louisiana) on the east side of the Mississippi River during the 1690s and early 1700s at [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], and [[Fort de Chartres]]. Migrants from the French villages on the opposite side of the [[Mississippi River]] (e.g. Kaskaskia) founded [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] in the 1730s.\n\nIn 1764, after France lost the [[Seven Years' War]], [[Pierre Lacl\u00e8de]] and his stepson [[Auguste Chouteau]] founded what was to become the city of St. Louis.<ref>Hoffhaus.

The Chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from Spain on the fur trade with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. French colonists used [[History of slavery in Missouri|African slaves]] as domestic servants and workers in the city.\n\nFrance, alarmed that Britain would demand French possessions west of the Mississippi and the Missouri River basin after losing New France to them in 1759\u201360, transferred these to Spain as part of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. These areas remained in Spanish possession until 1803. In 1780 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native American allies, in the [[Battle of St. Louis]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010223093542/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/attack.htm ''www.usgennet.org''.] Attack On St. Louis: May 26, 1780.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===City founding (French and Spanish Louisiana period)===\n[[File:Stlouis1780.jpeg|thumb|alt=Drawing of the St. Louis street grid from the 1780s showing the river and a small village|A map of St. Louis, Illinois in 1780.

Maxent invested in a Mississippi River expedition led by Lacl\u00e8de, who searched for a location to base the company's fur trading operations. Though [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] was already established as a trading center, he sought a place less prone to flooding. He found an elevated area overlooking the flood plain of the Mississippi River, not far south from its confluence with the Missouri and Illinois rivers. In addition to having an advantageous natural drainage system, there were nearby forested areas to supply timber and grasslands which could easily converted for agricultural purposes.

The default block size was 240 by 300 feet, with just three long avenues running parallel to the west bank of the Mississippi. He established a public corridor of 300 feet fronting the river, but later this area was released for private development.<ref name=wade3/>\n\n[[File:St-louis-attack.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a mural entitled Indian Attack on the Village of St. Louis, 1780, depicting the Battle of St. Louis.|In 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native American allies, in the [[Battle of St. Louis]].]]\nFor the first few years of St. Louis's existence, the city was not recognized by any of the governments.  Although the settlement was thought to be under the control of the Spanish government, no one asserted any authority over it, and thus St. Louis had no local government. This vacuum led Lacl\u00e8de to assume civil control, and all problems were disposed in public settings, such as communal meetings.  In addition, Lacl\u00e8de granted new settlers lots in town and the surrounding countryside.  In hindsight, many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as \"the golden age of St. Louis\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Ravenswaay |first1=Charles |title=St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865 |date=1991 |publisher=Missouri History Museum |isbn=9780252019159 |pages=26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SaintLouis1790s.jpg|thumb|alt=A map depicting the town of St. Louis in the 1790s|A map depicting the town of St. Louis in the 1790s, then part of [[Spanish Louisiana]]]]\nBy 1765, the city began receiving visits from representatives of the English, French, and Spanish governments.  The Indians in the area expressed dissatisfaction at being under the control of British forces.  One of the great Ottawa chieftains, [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], was angered by the change of power and the potential for the British to come into their lands.  He desired to fight against them but many of the St. Louis inhabitants refused.\n\nSt. Louis was transferred to the [[French First Republic]] in 1800 (although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by Spanish officials), then sold by the French to the U.S. in 1803 as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. St. Louis became the capital of, and gateway to, the new territory. Shortly after [[Three Flags Day|the official transfer of authority]] was made, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The expedition departed from St. Louis in May 1804 along the Missouri River to explore the vast territory. There were hopes of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, but the party had to go overland in the Upper West. They reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River in summer 1805. They returned, reaching St. Louis on September 23, 1806. Both Lewis and Clark lived in St. Louis after the expedition. Many other explorers, settlers, and trappers (such as [[Ashley's Hundred]]) would later take a similar route to the West.\n\n===19th century===\nThe city elected its first municipal legislators (called trustees) in 1808. [[Steamboat]]s first arrived in St. Louis in 1817, improving connections with [[New Orleans]] and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy [[port]] and trade connections.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|[[File:City of Saint Louis and Riverfront, 1874.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|City of St. Louis and Riverfront, 1874]]\n| \n|[[File:St Louis Birdseye Map 1896.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An illustrated map by F. Graf entitled ''St. Louis in 1896'']]\n|}\n</center>\nImmigrants from Ireland and Germany arrived in St. Louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s, and the population of St. Louis grew from less than 20,000 in 1840, to 77,860 in 1850, to more than 160,000 by 1860. By the mid-1800s, St. Louis had a greater population than New Orleans.\n\nSettled by many Southerners in a [[Free and slave states|slave state]], the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1861, 28 civilians were killed in a [[Camp Jackson Affair|clash with Union troops]]. The war hurt St. Louis economically, due to the [[Union blockade]] of river traffic to the south on the Mississippi River. The [[St. Louis Arsenal]] constructed [[ironclad]]s for the [[Union Navy]].\n[[File:St. Louis, Mo. tornado May 27, 1896 south broadway.JPG|left|thumb|upright|South Broadway after a May 27, 1896, tornado]]\n[[History of slavery in Missouri|Slaves]] worked in many jobs on the waterfront as well as on the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the [[Free and slave states|free state]] of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in [[freedom suits]], and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War.\nThe printing press of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] was destroyed for the third time by townsfolk. He was murdered the next year in nearby [[Alton, Illinois]].\n\nAfter the war, St. Louis profited via trade with the West, aided by the 1874 completion of the [[Eads Bridge]], named for its design engineer. Industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge, the second in the Midwest over the Mississippi River after the Hennepin Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis. The bridge connects St. Louis, Missouri to [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. The Eads Bridge became a symbolic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the [[Gateway Arch]] Bridge was constructed. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993. An estimated 8,500 vehicles pass through it daily.\n\nOn August 22, 1876, the city of St. Louis voted to [[urban secession|secede]] from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and become an independent city. Industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century. Major corporations such as the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery and [[Ralston-Purina]] company were established. St. Louis also was home to [[Desloge Consolidated Lead Company]] and several [[brass era]] automobile companies, including the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company]];<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

In 1916, during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Era]], St. Louis passed a residential segregation ordinance<ref>Primm, James. ''Lion of the Valley: St. Louis, Missouri, 1764-1980''.

Kraemer]] case.<ref>\u201cShelley House\". We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil Rights Movement. National Park Service. Retrieved November 10, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, St. Louis was a destination in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans from the rural South seeking better opportunities. During [[World War II]], the [[NAACP]] campaigned to integrate war factories. In 1964, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights activists]] protested at the construction of the Gateway Arch to publicize their effort to gain entry for African Americans into the skilled trade unions, where they were underrepresented. The Department of Justice filed the first suit against the unions under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].\n\nIn the first part of the century, St. Louis had some of the worst [[air pollution in the United States]]. In April 1940, the city banned the use of soft coal mined in nearby states. The city hired inspectors to ensure that only [[anthracite]] was burned. By 1946, the city had reduced air pollution by about three-quarters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Neil|first1=Tim|title=Nov. 28 1939: The day 'Black Tuesday' rolled into St. Louis|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/nov-the-day-black-tuesday-rolled-into-st-louis/article_00c3b6cd-ba69-5a19-b498-fbc29f9630c4.html|accessdate=December 8, 2016|publisher=Post-Dispatch|date=November 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202041856/http://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/nov-the-day-black-tuesday-rolled-into-st-louis/article_00c3b6cd-ba69-5a19-b498-fbc29f9630c4.html|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FromLacledesLanding.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Gateway Arch|Arch]] (completed 1965) from [[Laclede's Landing]], the remaining section of St. Louis's commercial riverfront.]]\n''[[De jure]]'' educational segregation continued into the 1950s, and ''[[de facto]]'' segregation continued into the 1970s, leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement.

The effects of suburbanization were exacerbated by the small geographical size of St. Louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city, and it lost much of its tax base. During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so.\n\nSeveral [[urban renewal]] projects were built in the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing. Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems. One prominent example, [[Pruitt-Igoe]], became a symbol of failure in public housing, and was torn down less than two decades after it was built.\n\nSince the 1980s, several [[Urban renewal|revitalization]] efforts have focused on [[downtown St. Louis]].\n\n===21st century===\nUrban revitalization continued in the new century.

Architectural influences reflected in the area include [[French Colonial]], [[Architecture of Germany|German]], [[Architecture of the United States|early American]], and [[Modern architecture|modern architectural]] styles.\n\nSome notable post-modern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the [[One US Bank Plaza]] (1976), the [[AT&T Center (St. Louis)|AT&T Center]] (1986), and [[One Metropolitan Square]] (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis. One US Bank Plaza, the local headquarters for [[US Bancorp]], was constructed for the Mercantile Bancorporation in the [[Structural expressionist]] style, emphasizing the steel structure of the building.\n\nDuring the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the [[Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse]] (completed in 2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: the Park East Tower in the Central West End and the Roberts Tower located downtown.\n\nSeveral examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France]] ( referred to as the ''Old Cathedral''). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and [[Christ Church Cathedral (St. Louis, Missouri)|Christ Church Cathedral]] (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style.\n\nA few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old St. Louis County Courthouse]] (known as the ''Old Courthouse'') was completed in 1864 and was notable for having a [[cast iron]] dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the [[United States Customhouse and Post Office (St. Louis, Missouri)|U.S. Customhouse and Post Office]].\n\nBecause much of the city's commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called [[Laclede's Landing]]. Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the [[Anheuser\u2013Busch#St. Louis headquarters and brewery|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]], which date to the 1860s.\n\nSt. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], designed by [[Thomas P. Barnett]] and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the [[Neo-Byzantine]] style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus Kostka]], which is an example of the [[Polish Cathedral style]]. Among the other major designs of the period were [[St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, St. Louis|St. Alphonsus Liguori]] (known as ''The Rock Church'') (1867) in the Gothic Revival and [[Second Presbyterian Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis]] (1900) in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]].\n\nBy the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]], St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a [[world's fair]] at [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] called the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the [[Saint Louis Art Museum|St. Louis Art Museum]] designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the [[St. Louis Zoo]].

Much of the area is a fertile and gently rolling prairie that features low hills and broad, shallow valleys. Both the Mississippi River and the Missouri River have cut large valleys with wide flood plains.\n\n[[Limestone]] and [[Dolomite (rock)|dolomite]] of the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] [[geologic time scale|epoch]] underlie the area, and parts of the city are [[karst]] in nature. This is particularly true of the area south of downtown, which has numerous sinkholes and caves. Most of the caves in the city have been sealed, but many springs are visible along the riverfront. Coal, brick [[clay]], and [[millerite]] ore were once mined in the city. The predominant surface rock, known as ''St. Louis limestone'', is used as [[dimension stone]] and rubble for construction.\n\nNear the southern boundary of the city of St. Louis (separating it from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]) is the [[River des Peres]], practically the only river or stream within the city limits that is not entirely underground.<ref>[http://www.rftstl.com/2000-12-06/news/a-sewer-runs-through-it/ St. Louis \u2013 News \u2013 A Sewer Runs Through It<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311021411/http://www.rftstl.com/2000-12-06/news/a-sewer-runs-through-it/ |date=March 11, 2007 }}.</ref> Most of River des Peres was confined to a channel or put underground in the 1920s and early 1930s. The lower section of the river was the site of some of the worst flooding of the [[Great Flood of 1993]].\n\nThe city's eastern boundary is the Mississippi River, which separates Missouri from Illinois.

Severe flooding, such as the [[Great Flood of 1993]], may occur in spring and summer; the (often rapid) melting of thick snow cover upstream on the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers can contribute to springtime flooding.\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;\">{{St. Louis weatherbox}}</div>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:Tower Grove Park Scene 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tower Grove Park]] in spring]]\n[[File:Missouri_Botanical_Garden_-_Seiwa-en.JPG|thumb|The [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]]]\n\nBefore the founding of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[hickory]], similar to the forests of the nearby [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]]; common understory trees include [[eastern redbud]], [[serviceberry]], and [[flowering dogwood]]. [[Riparian]] areas are forested with mainly [[American sycamore]].\n\nMost of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees. The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is [[Japanese honeysuckle]], which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks.\n\nLarge mammals found in the city include urbanized [[coyote]]s and [[white-tailed deer]]. [[Eastern gray squirrel]], [[cottontail rabbit]], and other rodents are abundant, as well as the nocturnal [[Virginia opossum]]. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include [[Canada goose]], [[mallard duck]], as well as [[shorebird]]s, including the [[great egret]] and [[great blue heron]]. [[Gull]]s are common along the Mississippi River; these species follow [[barge]] traffic.\n\nWinter populations of [[bald eagle]]s are found along the Mississippi River around the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge]]. The city is on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern US. The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]], an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including [[Tower Grove Park]].\n\nFrogs are found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the [[American toad]] and species of chorus frogs called [[spring peeper]]s, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of [[cicada]]s or [[ladybug]]s. Mosquitoes, [[no-see-ums]], and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are almost always fitted with screens. Invasive populations of [[Western honey bee|honeybees]] have declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and [[armadillos]] are seen throughout the St. Louis area.<ref>[http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html \"Warmer weather attracting Armadillos\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131030095930/http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html |date=October 30, 2013 }}, accessed October 28, 2013</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 1600\n|1830= 4977\n|1840= 16469\n|1850= 77860\n|1860= 160773\n|1870= 310864\n|1880= 350518\n|1890= 451770\n|1900= 575238\n|1910= 687029\n|1920= 772897\n|1930= 821960\n|1940= 816048\n|1950= 856796\n|1960= 750026\n|1970= 622236\n|1980= 453805\n|1990= 396685\n|2000= 348189\n|2010= 319294\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=302838\n|estref=<ref name=2017est />\n|align-fn=center\n|reference=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_2018_PEPANNRSIP.US12A&prodType=table}}\n[[File:Race and ethnicity 2010 St. Louis.png|thumb|left|Map of racial distribution in St. Louis, 2010 U.S. Census.

Their major regional center was at [[Cahokia Mounds]], active from 900 to 1500. Due to numerous major [[earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]] within St. Louis boundaries, the city was nicknamed as the \"Mound City\". These mounds were mostly demolished during the city's development. Historic Native American tribes in the area included the [[Siouan]]-speaking [[Osage people]], whose territory extended west, and the [[Illiniwek]].\n\nEuropean exploration of the area was first recorded in 1673, when French explorers [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]] traveled through the Mississippi River valley.  Five years later, [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|La Salle]] claimed the region for France as part of ''[[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]].''\n\n[[File:ChouteauMansion.jpg|thumb|left|The home of [[Auguste Chouteau]] in St. Louis. Chouteau and [[Pierre Lacl\u00e8de]] founded St. Louis in 1764.]]\nThe earliest European settlements in the area were built in [[Illinois Country]] (also known as Upper Louisiana) on the east side of the Mississippi River during the 1690s and early 1700s at [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], [[Kaskaskia, Illinois|Kaskaskia]], and [[Fort de Chartres]]. Migrants from the French villages on the opposite side of the [[Mississippi River]] (e.g. Kaskaskia) founded [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] in the 1730s.\n\nIn 1764, after France lost the [[Seven Years' War]], [[Pierre Lacl\u00e8de]] and his stepson [[Auguste Chouteau]] founded what was to become the city of St. Louis.<ref>Hoffhaus.

The Chouteau brothers gained a monopoly from Spain on the fur trade with [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. French colonists used [[History of slavery in Missouri|African slaves]] as domestic servants and workers in the city.\n\nFrance, alarmed that Britain would demand French possessions west of the Mississippi and the Missouri River basin after losing New France to them in 1759\u201360, transferred these to Spain as part of the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. These areas remained in Spanish possession until 1803. In 1780 during the [[American Revolutionary War]], St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native American allies, in the [[Battle of St. Louis]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010223093542/http://www.usgennet.org/usa/mo/county/stlouis/attack.htm ''www.usgennet.org''.] Attack On St. Louis: May 26, 1780.</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===City founding (French and Spanish Louisiana period)===\n[[File:Stlouis1780.jpeg|thumb|alt=Drawing of the St. Louis street grid from the 1780s showing the river and a small village|A map of St. Louis, Illinois in 1780.

Maxent invested in a Mississippi River expedition led by Lacl\u00e8de, who searched for a location to base the company's fur trading operations. Though [[Ste. Genevieve, Missouri|Ste. Genevieve]] was already established as a trading center, he sought a place less prone to flooding. He found an elevated area overlooking the flood plain of the Mississippi River, not far south from its confluence with the Missouri and Illinois rivers. In addition to having an advantageous natural drainage system, there were nearby forested areas to supply timber and grasslands which could easily converted for agricultural purposes. This place, declared Lacl\u00e8de, \u201cmight become, hereafter, one of the finest cities in America.\u201d He dispatched his 14-year-old stepson, [[Auguste Chouteau]], to the site, with the support of 30 settlers in February 1764.<ref name=wade3>{{cite book |last1=Wade |first1=Richard C.|title=The Urban Frontier: The Rise of Western Cities, 1790\u20131830 |date=1959 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-252-06422-4 |pages=3\u20134|edition=1996 Illini Books}}</ref>\n\nLacl\u00e8de arrived at the future town site two months later and produced a plan for St. Louis based on the New Orleans street plan. The default block size was 240 by 300 feet, with just three long avenues running parallel to the west bank of the Mississippi. He established a public corridor of 300 feet fronting the river, but later this area was released for private development.<ref name=wade3/>\n\n[[File:St-louis-attack.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of a mural entitled Indian Attack on the Village of St. Louis, 1780, depicting the Battle of St. Louis.|In 1780 during the American Revolutionary War, St. Louis was attacked by British forces, mostly Native American allies, in the [[Battle of St. Louis]].]]\nFor the first few years of St. Louis's existence, the city was not recognized by any of the governments.  Although the settlement was thought to be under the control of the Spanish government, no one asserted any authority over it, and thus St. Louis had no local government. This vacuum led Lacl\u00e8de to assume civil control, and all problems were disposed in public settings, such as communal meetings.  In addition, Lacl\u00e8de granted new settlers lots in town and the surrounding countryside.  In hindsight, many of these original settlers thought of these first few years as \"the golden age of St. Louis\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Van Ravenswaay |first1=Charles |title=St. Louis: An Informal History of the City and Its People, 1764-1865 |date=1991 |publisher=Missouri History Museum |isbn=9780252019159 |pages=26}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SaintLouis1790s.jpg|thumb|alt=A map depicting the town of St. Louis in the 1790s|A map depicting the town of St. Louis in the 1790s, then part of [[Spanish Louisiana]]]]\nBy 1765, the city began receiving visits from representatives of the English, French, and Spanish governments.  The Indians in the area expressed dissatisfaction at being under the control of British forces.  One of the great Ottawa chieftains, [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], was angered by the change of power and the potential for the British to come into their lands.  He desired to fight against them but many of the St. Louis inhabitants refused.\n\nSt. Louis was transferred to the [[French First Republic]] in 1800 (although all of the colonial lands continued to be administered by Spanish officials), then sold by the French to the U.S. in 1803 as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. St. Louis became the capital of, and gateway to, the new territory. Shortly after [[Three Flags Day|the official transfer of authority]] was made, the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] was commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson. The expedition departed from St. Louis in May 1804 along the Missouri River to explore the vast territory. There were hopes of finding a water route to the Pacific Ocean, but the party had to go overland in the Upper West. They reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River in summer 1805. They returned, reaching St. Louis on September 23, 1806. Both Lewis and Clark lived in St. Louis after the expedition. Many other explorers, settlers, and trappers (such as [[Ashley's Hundred]]) would later take a similar route to the West.\n\n===19th century===\nThe city elected its first municipal legislators (called trustees) in 1808. [[Steamboat]]s first arrived in St. Louis in 1817, improving connections with [[New Orleans]] and eastern markets. Missouri was admitted as a state in 1821. St. Louis was incorporated as a city in 1822, and continued to develop largely due to its busy [[port]] and trade connections.\n\n<center>\n{|\n|[[File:City of Saint Louis and Riverfront, 1874.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|City of St. Louis and Riverfront, 1874]]\n| \n|[[File:St Louis Birdseye Map 1896.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|An illustrated map by F. Graf entitled ''St. Louis in 1896'']]\n|}\n</center>\nImmigrants from Ireland and Germany arrived in St. Louis in significant numbers starting in the 1840s, and the population of St. Louis grew from less than 20,000 in 1840, to 77,860 in 1850, to more than 160,000 by 1860. By the mid-1800s, St. Louis had a greater population than New Orleans.\n\nSettled by many Southerners in a [[Free and slave states|slave state]], the city was split in political sympathies and became polarized during the [[American Civil War]]. In 1861, 28 civilians were killed in a [[Camp Jackson Affair|clash with Union troops]]. The war hurt St. Louis economically, due to the [[Union blockade]] of river traffic to the south on the Mississippi River. The [[St. Louis Arsenal]] constructed [[ironclad]]s for the [[Union Navy]].\n[[File:St. Louis, Mo. tornado May 27, 1896 south broadway.JPG|left|thumb|upright|South Broadway after a May 27, 1896, tornado]]\n[[History of slavery in Missouri|Slaves]] worked in many jobs on the waterfront as well as on the riverboats. Given the city's location close to the [[Free and slave states|free state]] of Illinois and others, some slaves escaped to freedom. Others, especially women with children, sued in court in [[freedom suits]], and several prominent local attorneys aided slaves in these suits. About half the slaves achieved freedom in hundreds of suits before the American Civil War.\nThe printing press of abolitionist [[Elijah Parish Lovejoy]] was destroyed for the third time by townsfolk. He was murdered the next year in nearby [[Alton, Illinois]].\n\nAfter the war, St. Louis profited via trade with the West, aided by the 1874 completion of the [[Eads Bridge]], named for its design engineer. Industrial developments on both banks of the river were linked by the bridge, the second in the Midwest over the Mississippi River after the Hennepin Avenue Bridge in Minneapolis. The bridge connects St. Louis, Missouri to [[East St. Louis, Illinois]]. The Eads Bridge became a symbolic image of the city of St. Louis, from the time of its erection until 1965 when the [[Gateway Arch]] Bridge was constructed. The bridge crosses the St. Louis riverfront between Laclede's Landing, to the north, and the grounds of the Gateway Arch, to the south. Today the road deck has been restored, allowing vehicular and pedestrian traffic to cross the river. The St. Louis MetroLink light rail system has used the rail deck since 1993. An estimated 8,500 vehicles pass through it daily.\n\nOn August 22, 1876, the city of St. Louis voted to [[urban secession|secede]] from [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] and become an independent city. Industrial production continued to increase during the late 19th century. Major corporations such as the [[Anheuser-Busch]] brewery and [[Ralston-Purina]] company were established. St. Louis also was home to [[Desloge Consolidated Lead Company]] and several [[brass era]] automobile companies, including the [[Success Automobile Manufacturing Company]];<ref>Clymer, Floyd.

In 1916, during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow Era]], St. Louis passed a residential segregation ordinance<ref>Primm, James. ''Lion of the Valley: St. Louis, Missouri, 1764-1980''.

Kraemer]] case.<ref>\u201cShelley House\". We Shall Overcome: Historic Places of the Civil Rights Movement. National Park Service.

During World War II, the [[NAACP]] campaigned to integrate war factories. In 1964, civil rights activists protested at the construction of the Gateway Arch to publicize their effort to gain entry for African Americans into the skilled trade unions, where they were underrepresented. The Department of Justice filed the first suit against the unions under the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].\n\nIn the first part of the century, St. Louis had some of the worst [[air pollution in the United States]]. In April 1940, the city banned the use of soft coal mined in nearby states. The city hired inspectors to ensure that only [[anthracite]] was burned. By 1946, the city had reduced air pollution by about three-quarters.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Neil|first1=Tim|title=Nov. 28 1939: The day 'Black Tuesday' rolled into St. Louis|url=https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/nov-the-day-black-tuesday-rolled-into-st-louis/article_00c3b6cd-ba69-5a19-b498-fbc29f9630c4.html|accessdate=December 8, 2016|publisher=Post-Dispatch|date=November 28, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202041856/http://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/nov-the-day-black-tuesday-rolled-into-st-louis/article_00c3b6cd-ba69-5a19-b498-fbc29f9630c4.html|archive-date=December 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:FromLacledesLanding.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Gateway Arch|Arch]] (completed 1965) from [[Laclede's Landing]], the remaining section of St. Louis's commercial riverfront.]]\n''[[De jure]]'' educational segregation continued into the 1950s, and ''[[de facto]]'' segregation continued into the 1970s, leading to a court challenge and interdistrict desegregation agreement.

The effects of suburbanization were exacerbated by the small geographical size of St. Louis due to its earlier decision to become an independent city, and it lost much of its tax base. During the 19th and 20th century, most major cities aggressively annexed surrounding areas as residential development occurred away from the central city; however, St. Louis was unable to do so.\n\nSeveral [[urban renewal]] projects were built in the 1950s, as the city worked to replace old and substandard housing. Some of these were poorly designed and resulted in problems. One prominent example, [[Pruitt-Igoe]], became a symbol of failure in public housing, and was torn down less than two decades after it was built.\n\nSince the 1980s, several [[Urban renewal|revitalization]] efforts have focused on [[downtown St. Louis]].\n\n===21st century===\nUrban revitalization continued in the new century.

Architectural influences reflected in the area include [[French Colonial]], [[Architecture of Germany|German]], [[Architecture of the United States|early American]], and [[Modern architecture|modern architectural]] styles.\n\nSome notable post-modern commercial skyscrapers were built downtown in the 1970s and 1980s, including the [[One US Bank Plaza]] (1976), the [[AT&T Center (St. Louis)|AT&T Center]] (1986), and [[One Metropolitan Square]] (1989), which is the tallest building in St. Louis. One US Bank Plaza, the local headquarters for [[US Bancorp]], was constructed for the Mercantile Bancorporation in the [[Structural expressionist]] style, emphasizing the steel structure of the building.\n\nDuring the 1990s, St. Louis saw the construction of the largest United States courthouse by area, the [[Thomas F. Eagleton United States Courthouse]] (completed in 2000). The Eagleton Courthouse is home to the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]]. The most recent high-rise buildings in St. Louis include two residential towers: the Park East Tower in the Central West End and the Roberts Tower located downtown.\n\nSeveral examples of religious structures are extant from the pre-Civil War period, and most reflect the common residential styles of the time. Among the earliest is the [[Basilica of St. Louis, King of France]] ( referred to as the ''Old Cathedral''). The Basilica was built between 1831 and 1834 in the Federal style. Other religious buildings from the period include SS. Cyril and Methodius Church (1857) in the Romanesque Revival style and [[Christ Church Cathedral (St. Louis, Missouri)|Christ Church Cathedral]] (completed in 1867, designed in 1859) in the Gothic Revival style.\n\nA few civic buildings were constructed during the early 19th century. The original St. Louis courthouse was built in 1826 and featured a Federal style stone facade with a rounded portico. However, this courthouse was replaced during renovation and expansion of the building in the 1850s. The [[Old Courthouse (St. Louis, Missouri)|Old St. Louis County Courthouse]] (known as the ''Old Courthouse'') was completed in 1864 and was notable for having a [[cast iron]] dome and for being the tallest structure in Missouri until 1894. Finally, a customs house was constructed in the Greek Revival style in 1852, but was demolished and replaced in 1873 by the [[United States Customhouse and Post Office (St. Louis, Missouri)|U.S. Customhouse and Post Office]].\n\nBecause much of the city's commercial and industrial development was centered along the riverfront, many pre-Civil War buildings were demolished during construction of the Gateway Arch. The city's remaining architectural heritage of the era includes a multi-block district of cobblestone streets and brick and cast-iron warehouses called [[Laclede's Landing]]. Now popular for its restaurants and nightclubs, the district is located north of Gateway Arch along the riverfront. Other industrial buildings from the era include some portions of the [[Anheuser\u2013Busch#St. Louis headquarters and brewery|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]], which date to the 1860s.\n\nSt. Louis saw a vast expansion in variety and number of religious buildings during the late 19th century and early 20th century. The largest and most ornate of these is the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], designed by [[Thomas P. Barnett]] and constructed between 1907 and 1914 in the [[Neo-Byzantine]] style. The St. Louis Cathedral, as it is known, has one of the largest mosaic collections in the world. Another landmark in religious architecture of St. Louis is the [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|St. Stanislaus Kostka]], which is an example of the [[Polish Cathedral style]]. Among the other major designs of the period were [[St. Alphonsus Catholic Church, St. Louis|St. Alphonsus Liguori]] (known as ''The Rock Church'') (1867) in the Gothic Revival and [[Second Presbyterian Church (St. Louis, Missouri)|Second Presbyterian Church of St. Louis]] (1900) in [[Richardsonian Romanesque]].\n\nBy the [[United States Census, 1900|1900 census]], St. Louis was the fourth largest city in the country. In 1904, the city hosted a [[world's fair]] at [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]] called the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]. Its architectural legacy is somewhat scattered. Among the fair-related cultural institutions in the park are the [[Saint Louis Art Museum|St. Louis Art Museum]] designed by [[Cass Gilbert]], part of the remaining lagoon at the foot of Art Hill, and the Flight Cage at the [[St. Louis Zoo]]. The [[Missouri History Museum]] was built afterward, with the profit from the fair. But 1904 left other assets to the city, like [[Theodore Link]]'s 1894 [[St. Louis Union Station]], and an improved Forest Park.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Further|Neighborhoods of St. Louis}}\n[[File:LafayetteSquareHouses.jpg|thumb|French style houses in [[Lafayette Square, St. Louis|Lafayette Square]]]]\n[[File:Blueberry_Hill_patio.jpg|thumb|The [[Delmar Loop]] is a neighborhood close to [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], on the border of the city and [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]]|alt=]]\n\nThe city is divided into 79 government-designated neighborhoods.<ref>[http://www.stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/neighborhoods/index.cfm Neighborhoods of the City of St. Louis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512222340/http://stlouis-mo.gov/government/departments/public-safety/neighborhood-stabilization-office/neighborhoods/index.cfm |date=May 12, 2012 }}, StLouis-mo.gov</ref> The neighborhood divisions have no legal standing, although some neighborhood associations administer grants or hold veto power over historic-district development.\n\nSeveral neighborhoods are lumped together in categories such as \"North City\", \"South City\", and \"The Central West End\".\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:St Louis Rivers.png|thumb|left|Rivers in the St. Louis area.]]\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], St. Louis has a total area of {{convert|66|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|62|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|4.1|sqmi}} (6.2%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=November 20, 2014|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021170230/http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/counties_list_29.txt|archivedate=October 21, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The city is built on [[Hill|bluffs]] and terraces that rise 100\u2013200 feet above the western banks of the Mississippi River, in the [[Midwestern United States]] just south of the [[Missouri River|Missouri]]-Mississippi [[confluence]].

Severe flooding, such as the [[Great Flood of 1993]], may occur in spring and summer; the (often rapid) melting of thick snow cover upstream on the Missouri or Mississippi Rivers can contribute to springtime flooding.\n\n<div style=\"width:100%;\">{{St. Louis weatherbox}}</div>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:Tower Grove Park Scene 1.jpg|thumb|[[Tower Grove Park]] in spring]]\n[[File:Missouri_Botanical_Garden_-_Seiwa-en.JPG|thumb|The [[Missouri Botanical Garden]]]]\n\nBefore the founding of the city, the area was mostly prairie and open forest. Native Americans maintained this environment, good for hunting, by burning underbrush. Trees are mainly [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[hickory]], similar to the forests of the nearby [[The Ozarks|Ozarks]]; common understory trees include [[eastern redbud]], [[serviceberry]], and [[flowering dogwood]]. [[Riparian]] areas are forested with mainly [[American sycamore]].\n\nMost of the residential areas of the city are planted with large native shade trees. The largest native forest area is found in Forest Park. In autumn, the changing color of the trees is notable. Most species here are typical of the eastern woodland, although numerous decorative non-native species are found. The most notable invasive species is [[Japanese honeysuckle]], which officials are trying to manage because of its damage to native trees. It is removed from some parks.\n\nLarge mammals found in the city include urbanized [[coyote]]s and [[white-tailed deer]]. [[Eastern gray squirrel]], [[cottontail rabbit]], and other rodents are abundant, as well as the nocturnal [[Virginia opossum]]. Large bird species are abundant in parks and include [[Canada goose]], [[mallard duck]], as well as [[shorebird]]s, including the [[great egret]] and [[great blue heron]]. [[Gull]]s are common along the Mississippi River; these species follow [[barge]] traffic.\n\nWinter populations of [[bald eagle]]s are found along the Mississippi River around the [[Chain of Rocks Bridge]]. The city is on the [[Mississippi Flyway]], used by migrating birds, and has a large variety of small bird species, common to the eastern US. The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]], an introduced species, is limited in North America to the counties surrounding St. Louis. The city has special sites for birdwatching of migratory species, including [[Tower Grove Park]].\n\nFrogs are found in the springtime, especially after extensive wet periods. Common species include the [[American toad]] and species of chorus frogs called [[spring peeper]]s, which are found in nearly every pond. Some years have outbreaks of [[cicada]]s or [[ladybug]]s. Mosquitoes, [[no-see-ums]], and houseflies are common insect nuisances, especially in July and August; because of this, windows are almost always fitted with screens. Invasive populations of [[Western honey bee|honeybees]] have declined in recent years. Numerous native species of pollinator insects have recovered to fill their ecological niche, and [[armadillos]] are seen throughout the St. Louis area.<ref>[http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html \"Warmer weather attracting Armadillos\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20131030095930/http://herald-review.com/news/local/armadillos-finding-st-louis-and-surrounding-area-nice-place-to/article_3b52d19c-433c-53f0-a823-3da7776924ab.html |date=October 30, 2013 }}, accessed October 28, 2013</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 1600\n|1830= 4977\n|1840= 16469\n|1850= 77860\n|1860= 160773\n|1870= 310864\n|1880= 350518\n|1890= 451770\n|1900= 575238\n|1910= 687029\n|1920= 772897\n|1930= 821960\n|1940= 816048\n|1950= 856796\n|1960= 750026\n|1970= 622236\n|1980= 453805\n|1990= 396685\n|2000= 348189\n|2010= 319294\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=302838\n|estref=<ref name=2017est />\n|align-fn=center\n|reference=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_2018_PEPANNRSIP.US12A&prodType=table}}\n[[File:Race and ethnicity 2010 St. Louis.png|thumb|left|Map of racial distribution in St. Louis, 2010 U.S. Census.

Mid-19th century immigrants included many Irish and Germans; later there were immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. In the early 20th century, African American and white migrants came from the South; the former as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] out of rural areas of the Deep South. Many came from Mississippi and Arkansas.\n\nAfter years of immigration, migration, and expansion, the city reached its peak population in 1950.

[[Detroit]], Michigan, and [[Youngstown, Ohio]], are the only other cities that have had population declines of at least 60% in the same time frame. The population of the city of St. Louis has been in decline since the 1950 census; during this period the population of the St. Louis Metropolitan Area, which includes more than one county, has grown every year and continues to do so.

{"title_page": "DNA synthesis", "text_new": "[[File:DNA molecular structure, showing individual nucleotides and bonds.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|Structure of double-stranded DNA, the product of DNA synthesis, showing individual nucleotide units and bonds.]]\n'''DNA synthesis''' is the natural or artificial creation of [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) molecules. DNA is a [[macromolecule]] made up of [[nucleotide]] units, which are linked by covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds, in a repeating structure. DNA synthesis occurs when these nucelotide units are joined together to form  DNA; this can occur artificially (''in vitro'') or naturally (''in vivo''). Nucleotide units are made up of a nitrogenous base (cytosine, guanine, adenine or thymine), pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate group. Each unit is joined when a covalent bond forms between its phosphate group and the pentose sugar of the next nucleotide, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA is a complementary, double stranded structure as specific base pairing (adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine) occurs naturally when hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide bases. \n\nThere are several different definitions for DNA synthesis: it can refer to [[DNA_replication|DNA replication]] - DNA biosynthesis (''in vivo'' DNA amplification), [[polymerase chain reaction]] - enzymatic DNA synthesis (''in vitro'' DNA amplification) or [[gene synthesis]] - physically creating [[synthetic DNA|artificial gene sequences]]. Though each type of synthesis is very different, they do share some features.\nNucleotides that have been joined to form [[polynucleotide|polynucleotides]] can act as a DNA template for one form of DNA synthesis - PCR - to occur. DNA replication also works by using a DNA template, the DNA double helix unwinds during replication, exposing unpaired bases for new nucleotides to hydrogen bond to. Gene synthesis, however, does not require a DNA template and genes are assembled ''de novo''. \n\nDNA synthesis occurs in all [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]], as well as some [[virus|viruses]]. The accurate synthesis of DNA is important in order to avoid mutations to DNA. In humans, mutations could lead to diseases such as cancer so DNA synthesis, and the machinery involved ''in vivo'', has been studied extensively throughout the decades. In the future these studies may be used to develop technologies involving DNA synthesis, to be used in data storage.\n==DNA replication==\n[[File:DNA replication en.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|DNA replication, and the various enzymes involved]]\nIn nature, DNA molecules are synthesised by all living cells through the process of DNA replication. This typically occurs as a part of cell division. DNA replication occurs so, during cell division, each daughter cell contains an accurate copy of the genetic material of the cell. ''In vivo'' DNA synthesis (DNA replication) is dependent on a complex set of enzymes which have evolved to act during the [[S_phase|S phase]] of the cell cycle, in a concerted fashion. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, DNA replication occurs when specific topoisomerases, helicases and gyrases (replication initiator proteins) [[Helicase|uncoil]] the double-stranded DNA, exposing the nitrogenous bases <ref name=\"Pelt-Verkuil\">{{cite book |last1=Pelt-Verkuil |first1=Evan |title=A Brief Comparison Between In Vivo DNA Replication and In Vitro PCR Amplification |date=2008 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Rotterdam |pages=9-15 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6241-4_2.pdf}}</ref>. These enzymes, along with accessory proteins, form a macromolecular machine which ensures accurate duplication of DNA sequences. Complementary base pairing takes place, forming a new double-stranded DNA molecule. This is known as '''semi-conservative''' replication since one strand of the new DNA molecule is from the 'parent' strand.\n\nContinuously, eukaryotic enzymes encounter DNA damage which can perturb DNA replication. This damage is in the form of DNA lesions that arise spontaneously or due to DNA damaging agents. DNA replication machinery is therefore highly controlled in order to prevent collapse when encountering damage<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Darshil R. |last2=Weiss |first2=Robert S. |title=A tough row to hoe: when replication forks encounter DNA damage |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |date=2018 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1643-1651 |doi=10.1042/BST20180308 |pmid=30514768}}</ref>. Control of the DNA replication system ensures that the genome is replicated only once per cycle; over-replication induces DNA damage. Deregulation of DNA replication is a key factor in genomic instability during cancer development<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reusswig |first1=Karl-Uwe |last2=Pfander |first2=Boris |title=Control of Eukaryotic DNA replication Initiation - Mechanisms to Ensure Smooth Transitions |journal=Genes (Basel) |date=2019 |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=99 |doi=10.3390/genes10020099 |pmid=30700044}}</ref>. \n\nThis highlights the specificity of DNA synthesis machinery ''in vivo''. Various means exist to artificially stimulate the replication of naturally occurring DNA, or to create artificial gene sequences. However, DNA synthesis ''in vitro'' can be a very error-prone process.\n\n==Reverse Transcription==\nReverse transcription is part of the replication cycle of particular virus families, including [[retrovirus|retroviruses]]. It involves copying RNA into double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), using [[reverse transcriptase]] enzymes. In retroviruses, viral RNA is inserted into a host cell nucleus. There, a viral reverse transcriptase enzyme adds DNA nucleotides onto the RNA sequence, generating cDNA that is inserted into the host cell genome by the enzyme [[integrase]], encoding viral proteins<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Stephen H |title=Reverse Transcription of Retroviruses and LTR Retrotransposons |journal=Microbiology spectrum |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=2 |doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.MDNA3-0027-2014 |pmid=26104704}}</ref>.\n\n==Polymerase chain reaction==\n[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right]]\nA [[polymerase chain reaction]] is a form of enzymatic DNA synthesis in the laboratory, using cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for [[DNA melting]] and enzymatic replication of the DNA.\n\nDNA synthesis during PCR is very similar to living cells but has very specific reagents and conditions. During PCR, DNA is chemically extracted from host chaperone proteins then heated, causing thermal dissociation of the DNA strands. Two new cDNA strands are built from the original strand, these strands can be split again to act as the template for further PCR products. The original DNA is multiplied through many rounds of PCR <ref name=Pelt-Verkuil/>.  More than a billion copies of the original DNA strand can be made.\n\n===Random mutagenesis===\nFor many experiments, such as structural and evolutionary studies, scientists need to produce a large library of variants of a particular DNA sequence. Random mutagenesis takes place in vitro, when mutagenic replication with a low fidelity DNA polymerase is combined with selective PCR amplification to produce many copies of mutant DNA<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Forloni |first1=M |title=Random Mutagenesis Using Error-prone DNA Polymerases. |journal=Cold Spring Harb Protoc |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1101/pdb.prot097741}}</ref>. \n\n===RT-PCR===\nRT-PCR differs from conventional PCR as it synthesizes cDNA from mRNA, rather than template DNA. The technique couples a reverse transcription reaction with PCR-based amplification, as an RNA sequence acts as a template for the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR is often used to test gene expression in particular tissue or cell types at various developmental stages or to test for genetic disorders<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bachman |first1=Julia |title=Chapter Two - Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) |journal=Methods in Enzymology |date=2013 |volume=530 |pages=67-74 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-420037-1.00002-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124200371000026}}</ref>. \n\n==Gene synthesis==\n[[Artificial gene synthesis]] is the process of synthesizing a [[gene]] ''[[in vitro]]'' without the need for initial template DNA samples.\nIn 2010 [[J. Craig Venter]] and his team were the first to use entirely synthesized DNA to create a self-replicating microbe, dubbed [[Mycoplasma laboratorium]].<ref name = \"Fikes\" />\n\n===Oligonucleotide synthesis===\n[[Oligonucleotide synthesis]] is the chemical synthesis of sequences of nucleic acids. The majority of biological research and bioengineering involves synthetic DNA, which can include [[oligonucleotide|oligonucleotides]], synthetic genes, or even [[chromosome|chromosomes]]. Today, all synthetic DNA is custom-built using the phosphoramidite method by [[Marvin H. Caruthers|Marvin Caruthers]]. Oligos are synthesized from building blocks which replicate natural bases. The process has been automated since the late 1970s and can be used to form desired genetic sequences as well as for other uses in medicine and molecular biology. However, creating sequences chemically is impractical beyond 200-300 bases, and is an environmentally hazardous process. These oligos, of around 200 bases, can be connected using DNA assembly methods, creating larger DNA molecules <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Palluk |first1=Sebastian |last2=Arlow |first2=Daniel H |display-authors=et al <!--Sebastian Palluk, Daniel H Arlow, Tristan de Rond, Sebastian Barthel, Justine S Kang, Rathin Bector, Hratch M Baghdassarian, Alisa N Truong, Peter W Kim, Anup K Singh, Nathan J Hillson & Jay D Keasling -->|title=De novo DNA synthesis using polymerase-nucleotide conjugates |journal=Nature Biotechnology |date=2018 |volume=36 |pages=645-650 |doi=10.1038/nbt.4173}}</ref>.\n\nSome studies have explored the possibility of enzymatic synthesis using [[Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase]] (TdT), a DNA polymerase that requires no template. However, this method is not yet as effective as chemical synthesis, and is not commercially available<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perkel |first1=Jeffrey M. |title=The race for enzymatic DNA synthesis heats up |journal=Nature |date=2019 |volume=566 |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00682-0 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00682-0}}</ref>.\n\nWith advances in artificial DNA synthesis, the possibility of DNA data storage is being explored. With its ultrahigh storage density and long-term stability, synthetic DNA is an interesting option to store large amounts of data. Although information can be retrieved very quickly from DNA through next generation sequencing technologies, de novo synthesis of DNA is a major bottleneck in the process.

DNA is a [[macromolecule]] made up of [[nucleotide]] units, which are linked by covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds, in a repeating structure. DNA synthesis occurs when these nucelotide units are joined together to form  DNA; this can occur artificially (''in vitro'') or naturally (''in vivo''). Nucleotide units are made up of a nitrogenous base (cytosine, guanine, adenine or thymine), pentose sugar (deoxyribose) and phosphate group. Each unit is joined when a covalent bond forms between its phosphate group and the pentose sugar of the next nucleotide, forming a sugar-phosphate backbone. DNA is a complementary, double stranded structure as specific base pairing (adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine) occurs naturally when hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide bases. \n\nThere are several different definitions for DNA synthesis: it can refer to [[DNA_replication|DNA replication]] - DNA biosynthesis (''in vivo'' DNA amplification), [[polymerase chain reaction]] - enzymatic DNA synthesis (''in vitro'' DNA amplification) or [[gene synthesis]] - physically creating [[synthetic DNA|artificial gene sequences]]. Though each type of synthesis is very different, they do share some features.\nNucleotides that have been joined to form [[polynucleotide|polynucleotides]] can act as a DNA template for one form of DNA synthesis - PCR - to occur. DNA replication also works by using a DNA template, the DNA double helix unwinds during replication, exposing unpaired bases for new nucleotides to hydrogen bond to. Gene synthesis, however, does not require a DNA template and genes are assembled ''de novo''. \n\nDNA synthesis occurs in all [[eukaryote|eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]], as well as some [[virus|viruses]]. The accurate synthesis of DNA is important in order to avoid mutations to DNA. In humans, mutations could lead to diseases such as cancer so DNA synthesis, and the machinery involved ''in vivo'', has been studied extensively throughout the decades. In the future these studies may be used to develop technologies involving DNA synthesis, to be used in data storage.\n==DNA replication==\n[[File:DNA replication en.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right|DNA replication, and the various enzymes involved]]\nIn nature, DNA molecules are synthesised by all living cells through the process of DNA replication. This typically occurs as a part of cell division. DNA replication occurs so, during cell division, each daughter cell contains an accurate copy of the genetic material of the cell. ''In vivo'' DNA synthesis (DNA replication) is dependent on a complex set of enzymes which have evolved to act during the [[S_phase|S phase]] of the cell cycle, in a concerted fashion. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, DNA replication occurs when specific topoisomerases, helicases and gyrases (replication initiator proteins) [[Helicase|uncoil]] the double-stranded DNA, exposing the nitrogenous bases <ref name=\"Pelt-Verkuil\">{{cite book |last1=Pelt-Verkuil |first1=Evan |title=A Brief Comparison Between In Vivo DNA Replication and In Vitro PCR Amplification |date=2008 |publisher=Springer Netherlands |location=Rotterdam |pages=9-15 |url=https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6241-4_2.pdf}}</ref>. These enzymes, along with accessory proteins, form a macromolecular machine which ensures accurate duplication of DNA sequences. Complementary base pairing takes place, forming a new double-stranded DNA molecule. This is known as '''semi-conservative''' replication since one strand of the new DNA molecule is from the 'parent' strand.\n\nContinuously, eukaryotic enzymes encounter DNA damage which can perturb DNA replication. This damage is in the form of DNA lesions that arise spontaneously or due to DNA damaging agents. DNA replication machinery is therefore highly controlled in order to prevent collapse when encountering damage<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patel |first1=Darshil R. |last2=Weiss |first2=Robert S. |title=A tough row to hoe: when replication forks encounter DNA damage |journal=Biochem Soc Trans |date=2018 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1643-1651 |doi=10.1042/BST20180308 |pmid=30514768}}</ref>. Control of the DNA replication system ensures that the genome is replicated only once per cycle; over-replication induces DNA damage. Deregulation of DNA replication is a key factor in genomic instability during cancer development<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Reusswig |first1=Karl-Uwe |last2=Pfander |first2=Boris |title=Control of Eukaryotic DNA replication Initiation - Mechanisms to Ensure Smooth Transitions |journal=Genes (Basel) |date=2019 |volume=10 |issue=2 |page=99 |doi=10.3390/genes10020099 |pmid=30700044}}</ref>. \n\nThis highlights the specificity of DNA synthesis machinery ''in vivo''. Various means exist to artificially stimulate the replication of naturally occurring DNA, or to create artificial gene sequences. However, DNA synthesis ''in vitro'' can be a very error-prone process.\n\n==Reverse Transcription==\nReverse transcription is part of the replication cycle of particular virus families, including [[retrovirus|retroviruses]]. It involves copying RNA into double-stranded complementary DNA (cDNA), using [[reverse transcriptase]] enzymes. In retroviruses, viral RNA is inserted into a host cell nucleus. There, a viral reverse transcriptase enzyme adds DNA nucleotides onto the RNA sequence, generating cDNA that is inserted into the host cell genome by the enzyme [[integrase]], encoding viral proteins<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Stephen H |title=Reverse Transcription of Retroviruses and LTR Retrotransposons |journal=Microbiology spectrum |date=2015 |volume=3 |issue=2 |doi=10.1128/microbiolspec.MDNA3-0027-2014 |pmid=26104704}}</ref>.\n\n==Polymerase chain reaction==\n[[File:Polymerase chain reaction.svg|upright=1.25|thumb|right]]\nA [[polymerase chain reaction]] is a form of enzymatic DNA synthesis in the laboratory, using cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for [[DNA melting]] and enzymatic replication of the DNA.\n\nDNA synthesis during PCR is very similar to living cells but has very specific reagents and conditions. During PCR, DNA is chemically extracted from host chaperone proteins then heated, causing thermal dissociation of the DNA strands. Two new cDNA strands are built from the original strand, these strands can be split again to act as the template for further PCR products. The original DNA is multiplied through many rounds of PCR <ref name=Pelt-Verkuil/>.  More than a billion copies of the original DNA strand can be made.\n\n===Random mutagenesis===\nFor many experiments, such as structural and evolutionary studies, scientists need to produce a large library of variants of a particular DNA sequence. Random mutagenesis takes place in vitro, when mutagenic replication with a low fidelity DNA polymerase is combined with selective PCR amplification to produce many copies of mutant DNA<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Forloni |first1=M |title=Random Mutagenesis Using Error-prone DNA Polymerases. |journal=Cold Spring Harb Protoc |date=2018 |volume=3 |doi=10.1101/pdb.prot097741}}</ref>. \n\n===RT-PCR===\nRT-PCR differs from conventional PCR as it synthesizes cDNA from mRNA, rather than template DNA. The technique couples a reverse transcription reaction with PCR-based amplification, as an RNA sequence acts as a template for the enzyme, reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR is often used to test gene expression in particular tissue or cell types at various developmental stages or to test for genetic disorders<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bachman |first1=Julia |title=Chapter Two - Reverse-Transcription PCR (RT-PCR) |journal=Methods in Enzymology |date=2013 |volume=530 |pages=67-74 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-420037-1.00002-6 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780124200371000026}}</ref>. \n\n==Gene synthesis==\n[[Artificial gene synthesis]] is the process of synthesizing a [[gene]] ''[[in vitro]]'' without the need for initial template DNA samples.\nIn 2010 [[J. Craig Venter]] and his team were the first to use entirely synthesized DNA to create a self-replicating microbe, dubbed [[Mycoplasma laboratorium]].<ref name = \"Fikes\" />\n\n===Oligonucleotide synthesis===\n[[Oligonucleotide synthesis]] is the chemical synthesis of sequences of nucleic acids. The majority of biological research and bioenjineering involves synthetic DNA, which can include [[oligonucleotide|oligonucleotides]], synthetic genes, or even [[chromosome|chromosomes]]. Today, all synthetic DNA is custom-built using the phosphoramidite method by [[Marvin H. Caruthers|Marvin Caruthers]]. Oligos are synthesized from building blocks which replicate natural bases. The process has been automated since the late 1970s and can be used to form desired genetic sequences as well as for other uses in medicine and molecular biology. However, creating sequences chemically is impractical beyond 200-300 bases, and is an environmentally hazardous process. These oligos, of around 200 bases, can be connected using DNA assembly methods, creating larger DNA molecules <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Palluk |first1=Sebastian |last2=Arlow |first2=Daniel H |display-authors=et al <!--Sebastian Palluk, Daniel H Arlow, Tristan de Rond, Sebastian Barthel, Justine S Kang, Rathin Bector, Hratch M Baghdassarian, Alisa N Truong, Peter W Kim, Anup K Singh, Nathan J Hillson & Jay D Keasling -->|title=De novo DNA synthesis using polymerase-nucleotide conjugates |journal=Nature Biotechnology |date=2018 |volume=36 |pages=645-650 |doi=10.1038/nbt.4173}}</ref>.\n\nSome studies have explored the possibility of enzymatic synthesis using [[Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase]] (TdT), a DNA polymerase that requires no template. However, this method is not yet as effective as chemical synthesis, and is not commercially available<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perkel |first1=Jeffrey M. |title=The race for enzymatic DNA synthesis heats up |journal=Nature |date=2019 |volume=566 |doi=10.1038/d41586-019-00682-0 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00682-0}}</ref>.\n\nWith advances in artificial DNA synthesis, the possibility of DNA data storage is being explored. With its ultrahigh storage density and long-term stability, synthetic DNA is an interesting option to store large amounts of data. Although information can be retrieved very quickly from DNA through next generation sequencing technologies, de novo synthesis of DNA is a major bottleneck in the process. Only one nucleotide can be added per cycle, with each cycle taking seconds, so the overall synthesis is very time consuming, as well as very error prone. However, if biotechnology improves, synthetic DNA could one day be used in data storage <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tabatabaei |first1=S.
