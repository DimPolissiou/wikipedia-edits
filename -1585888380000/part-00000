Gribble. The Gribble family moved to New York City before June 1925. James Gribble worked as a machinist in Detroit, and as car salesman in New York. Another daughter, Agnes, was born in 1923.

Chaplin and his long-time studio manager, Alf Reeves, both insisted that Barry not make it public that she was under contract to Chaplin Studios. / Barry and Chaplin consummated their relationship sometime after her signing the contract and their relationship, though not a public one, was blossoming. Chaplin helped Barry get an apartment, as she was staying at the Ambassador Hotel at the time, and he paid the first two months rent. / Though Chaplin and Barry\u2019s relationship grew during the summer of 1941, Chaplin relayed in his My Autobiography that, \u201c\u2026something [was] queer and not quite normal [about his and Barry\u2019s time together.] Without telephoning she would suddenly show up late at night at my house. This was somewhat disturbing. Then for a week I would not hear from her\u2026however, when she did show up she was disarmingly pleasant, so my doubts and apprehension were allayed\u201d ([p.] 414). / Barry was indeed a complicated personality. By this time, not only had she gone under nearly a half dozen aliases, but in the FBI records on Chaplin, which number almost 2,000 typed pages, mostly declassified to the public in the early 1980s, Barry was described in many accounts as aloof and somewhat strange acting. Chaplin\u2019s studio manager, Alf Reeves, expressed that he noticed Barry was \u201cerratic, emotional, hard to talk to, and could easily effect a vacant stare in her eyes\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1237). The stenographer for the FBI relates several times of the unbalance in Barry\u2019s behavior, once stating, \u201cIt is to be noted that she [Barry] is a girl who becomes very emotional upon occasion\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1442). / It seems at times, however, that Barry could also be quite pleasant, as she was generally liked by Chaplin\u2019s butler, Edward Chaney, and well regarded by Stephen Seck, Barry\u2019s son from a subsequent marriage, who remembers his mother as \u201cvery gifted, a talented singer who worked hard to support us (he and his brother, Russell, and half-sister, Carol Ann). We were never neglected in any way\u201d (Seck Interview). / During the fall of 1941, Barry was planning a trip home to New York and came under suspicion that she might be pregnant. Yet, she was perplexed by this in that Chaplin had told her that he was unable to have children, though he had two adolescent sons from his marriage to his second wife Lita Grey Chaplin (1908-1995), Charlie Jr. (1925-1968) and Sydney (1926-2009). When Barry told Chaplin of the pregnancy, he told her he would pay for her to have an operation in New York, though Barry later ending up having the abortion under the supervision of a Los Angeles doctor, a Dr. A. M. Tweedie. / After the first abortion, Barry was fitted with a diaphragm. Chaplin, however, did not want to use it during intercourse. By December, 1941, Barry felt she might be pregnant again. Chaplin, who took the news as a joke, insisted she get another abortion. Barry reluctantly agreed and had a second abortion under the supervision of Dr. Tweedie. Upon completion, she spent four to five days recuperating at Chaplin\u2019s home on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills. This second abortion took a much higher toll on Barry\u2019s health and longer for her to recover, though she did mention to the FBI that Chaplin was quite good to her and did what he could to help during her stay at his home. / On the business end, Chaplin had not done a film project at this point since The Great Dictator (1940), and was working primarily on a soundtrack for The Gold Rush (1925). The idea for his next film came during a luncheon with Sir Cedric Hardwicke and author Sinclair Lewis, who, during conversation mentioned the play Shadow and Substance by Paul Vincent Carroll. Lewis referred to the character of Bridget, the lead role in the play, as a modern day Joan of Arc. Chaplin was intrigued and requested a copy of the play to read. / In talking about the play over dinner one night, Barry mentioned she would like to play the role of Bridget.

Chaplin and his long-time studio manager, Alf Reeves, both insisted that Barry not make it public that she was under contract to Chaplin Studios. / Barry and Chaplin consummated their relationship sometime after her signing the contract and their relationship, though not a public one, was blossoming. Chaplin helped Barry get an apartment, as she was staying at the Ambassador Hotel at the time, and he paid the first two months rent. / Though Chaplin and Barry\u2019s relationship grew during the summer of 1941, Chaplin relayed in his My Autobiography that, \u201c\u2026something [was] queer and not quite normal [about his and Barry\u2019s time together.] Without telephoning she would suddenly show up late at night at my house. This was somewhat disturbing. Then for a week I would not hear from her\u2026however, when she did show up she was disarmingly pleasant, so my doubts and apprehension were allayed\u201d ([p.] 414). / Barry was indeed a complicated personality. By this time, not only had she gone under nearly a half dozen aliases, but in the FBI records on Chaplin, which number almost 2,000 typed pages, mostly declassified to the public in the early 1980s, Barry was described in many accounts as aloof and somewhat strange acting. Chaplin\u2019s studio manager, Alf Reeves, expressed that he noticed Barry was \u201cerratic, emotional, hard to talk to, and could easily effect a vacant stare in her eyes\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1237). The stenographer for the FBI relates several times of the unbalance in Barry\u2019s behavior, once stating, \u201cIt is to be noted that she [Barry] is a girl who becomes very emotional upon occasion\u201d (Chaplin FBI File 1442). / It seems at times, however, that Barry could also be quite pleasant, as she was generally liked by Chaplin\u2019s butler, Edward Chaney, and well regarded by Stephen Seck, Barry\u2019s son from a subsequent marriage, who remembers his mother as \u201cvery gifted, a talented singer who worked hard to support us (he and his brother, Russell, and half-sister, Carol Ann). We were never neglected in any way\u201d (Seck Interview). / During the fall of 1941, Barry was planning a trip home to New York and came under suspicion that she might be pregnant. Yet, she was perplexed by this in that Chaplin had told her that he was unable to have children, though he had two adolescent sons from his marriage to his second wife Lita Grey Chaplin (1908-1995), Charlie Jr. (1925-1968) and Sydney (1926-2009). When Barry told Chaplin of the pregnancy, he told her he would pay for her to have an operation in New York, though Barry later ending up having the abortion under the supervision of a Los Angeles doctor, a Dr. A. M. Tweedie. / After the first abortion, Barry was fitted with a diaphragm. Chaplin, however, did not want to use it during intercourse. By December, 1941, Barry felt she might be pregnant again. Chaplin, who took the news as a joke, insisted she get another abortion. Barry reluctantly agreed and had a second abortion under the supervision of Dr. Tweedie. Upon completion, she spent four to five days recuperating at Chaplin\u2019s home on Summit Drive in Beverly Hills. This second abortion took a much higher toll on Barry\u2019s health and longer for her to recover, though she did mention to the FBI that Chaplin was quite good to her and did what he could to help during her stay at his home. / On the business end, Chaplin had not done a film project at this point since The Great Dictator (1940), and was working primarily on a soundtrack for The Gold Rush (1925). The idea for his next film came during a luncheon with Sir Cedric Hardwicke and author Sinclair Lewis, who, during conversation mentioned the play Shadow and Substance by Paul Vincent Carroll. Lewis referred to the character of Bridget, the lead role in the play, as a modern day Joan of Arc. Chaplin was intrigued and requested a copy of the play to read. / In talking about the play over dinner one night, Barry mentioned she would like to play the role of Bridget. Chaplin didn\u2019t take her very seriously at first, but after she performed an excellent private reading, he gave her a screen test. Her screen test took place on Jan. 26, 1942, and it was deemed that she was photogenic and could work for the part. In his autobiography, Chaplin states that at this time \u201c\u2026all my qualms about her oddities vanished\u201d ([p.] 414). / Over the next few months, Barry was in strong preparation for her starring role in Shadow and Substance, for which Chaplin had by now purchased the film rights.
