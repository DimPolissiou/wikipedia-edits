The plant has [[rhizome]]s of different shapes and sizes. Leaves are up to {{cvt|40|\u00d7|24.8|cm|in}} and sprout from the rhizome. They are dark green above and light green beneath. They are triangular-ovate, sub-rounded and mucronate at the apex, with the tip of the basal lobes rounded or sub-rounded. The [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] is {{cvt|0.8|-|1.2|m|ft}} high. The path can be up to {{cvt|25|cm}} long. The [[Spadix (botany)|spadix]] is about three fifths as long as the [[spathe]], with flowering parts up to {{cvt|8|mm}} in diameter. The female portion is at the fertile ovaries intermixed with sterile white ones. Neuters grow above the females, and are rhomboid or irregular orium lobed, with six or eight cells. The appendage is shorter than the male portion.<gallery>\nFile:Elephant Ear Flower One.jpg|Flower\nFile:2006-10-22Colocasia01.jpg|Leaves\nFile:Coloc escul 140521-0017 tdp.JPG|Corms\nFile:Taro root and crossection of taro root.jpg|Corm (cross section)\n</gallery>\n\n=== Distribution and habitat ===\n''Colocasia esculenta'' is thought to be native to [[Southern India]] and [[Southeast Asia]], but is widely [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalised]].<ref>Kolchaar, K. 2006 ''Economic Botany in the Tropics'', Macmillan India</ref><ref name=\"GRIN\">{{GRIN|''Colocasia esculenta''|11177|accessdate=19 February 2015}}</ref> ''Colocasia'' is thought to have originated in the [[Indomalaya ecozone]], perhaps in [[East India]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bangladesh]].

Taro can be grown in [[paddy field]]s where water is abundant or in upland situations where water is supplied by rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Taro is one of the few crops (along with [[rice]] and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]) that can be grown under flooded conditions. This is due to air spaces in the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. For a maximum dissolved [[oxygen]] supply, the water should be cool and flowing. Warm, stagnant water causes basal rotting. For maximum yields, the water level should be controlled so that the base of the plant is always under water.\n\nFlooded cultivation has some advantages over dry-land cultivation: higher yields (about double), out-of-season production (which may result in higher prices), and weed control (which flooding facilitates). On the other hand, in flooded production systems taro requires a longer maturation period, investment in infrastructure, and higher operational costs, and [[monoculture]] is likely.\n\nLike most [[List of root vegetables|root crops]], taro and [[eddoe]]s do well in deep, moist or even swampy soils where the annual rainfall exceeds {{cvt|2,500|mm}}. Eddoes are more resistant to drought and cold. The crop attains maturity within six to twelve months after planting in dry-land cultivation and after twelve to fifteen months in wetland cultivation. The crop is harvested when the plant height decreases and the leaves turn yellow. These signals are usually less distinct in flooded taro cultivation.\n\nHarvesting is usually done by hand tools, even in mechanized production systems. First, the soil around the corm is loosened, and then, the corm is pulled up by grabbing the base of the petioles. The global average yield is 6.2 tonnes/hectare but varies according to the region. In Asia, average yields reach 12.6 tonnes/hectare.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf |title=FAO: Taro cultivation in Asia and the Pacific, 1999 |access-date=2018-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807122927/http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top taro producers of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Crops|website=faostat.fao.org|accessdate = 6 December 2019}}</ref><br />(million [[tonne]]s)\n!Country\n!Production\n|-\n|{{NGA}}|| align=\"right\" | 3.3\n|-\n|{{CHN}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.9\n|-\n|{{CMR}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.8\n|-\n|{{GHA}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.2\n|-\n|{{PNG}}|| align=\"right\" | 0.3\n|-\n|'''World total'''|| align=\"right\" |'''10.2'''\n|}\n\n== Uses ==\n\n===Culinary===\n[[File:Peeled taro corms.jpg|thumb|left|Peeled taro corms]]\n{{nutritional value | name=Taro, cooked, without salt\n| kJ=594\n| protein=0.52 g\n| fat=0.11 g\n| carbs=34.6 g\n| fiber=5.1 g\n| sugars=0.49\n| calcium_mg=18\n| iron_mg=0.72\n| magnesium_mg=30\n| phosphorus_mg=76\n| potassium_mg=484\n| zinc_mg=0.27\n| manganese_mg=0.449\n| vitC_mg=5\n| thiamin_mg=0.107\n| riboflavin_mg=0.028\n| niacin_mg=0.51\n| pantothenic_mg=0.336\n| vitB6_mg=0.331\n| folate_ug=19\n| vitE_mg=2.93\n| vitD_mg=\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11519&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n|vitD_ug=1.2|vitD_iu=}}It is a food staple in [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[South Asia]]n cultures.<ref name=\"new-agri.co\" />{{nutritional value | name=Taro leaves, raw\n| kJ=177\n| protein=5 g\n| fat=0.74 g\n| carbs=6.7 g\n| fiber=3.7 g\n| sugars=3 g\n| calcium_mg=107\n| iron_mg=2.25\n| magnesium_mg=45\n| phosphorus_mg=60\n| potassium_mg=648\n| zinc_mg=0.41\n| manganese_mg=0.714\n| vitC_mg=52\n| thiamin_mg=0.209\n| riboflavin_mg=0.456\n| niacin_mg=1.513\n| vitB6_mg=0.146\n| folate_ug=126\n| vitA_ug=241\n| betacarotene_ug=2895\n| lutein_ug=1932\n| vitE_mg=2.02\n| vitK_ug=108.6\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11520&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n}}\nPeople usually consume its edible corm and leaves.

The prominence of the crop there has led it to be a staple of the population's diet. Taro is grown across the country, but the method of cultivation depends on the nature of the island it is grown on. Taro also plays an important role in the country's export trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac450e/ac450e08.htm|title=Taro Cultivation in Asia and the Pacific|last1=FAO|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref> The root is eaten boiled, as is standard across [[Polynesia]]. Taro leaves are also eaten as a delicacy, cooked with coconut milk, onion, and meat or fish.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n=====Fiji=====\n[[File:Lovo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fijian lovo]] of cooked staples: taro and [[cassava]] (white)]]\nTaro (''dalo'' in [[Fijian language|Fijian]]) has been a staple of the Fijian diet for centuries, and its cultural importance is celebrated on [[Taro Day]]. Its growth as an export crop began in 1993 when [[taro leaf blight]]<ref name=\"TaroLeafBlight\">[http://www2.ctahr.hawaii.edu/adap2/ascc_landgrant/Dr_Brooks/ColorPlates.pdf Taro leaf blight caused by ''Phytophthora colocasiae''], College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa]], Honolulu, Hawai'i, p. 2.</ref> decimated the taro industry in neighboring [[Samoa]]. Fiji filled the void and was soon supplying taro internationally. Almost 80% of Fiji's exported taro comes from the island of [[Taveuni]] where the taro beetle species ''Papuana uninodis'' is absent. The Fijian taro industry on the main islands of [[Viti Levu]] and [[Vanua Levu]] faces constant damage from the beetles. The Fiji Ministry of Agriculture and the Land Resources Division of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) are researching pest control and instigating quarantine restrictions to prevent the spread of the pest. Taveuni now exports pest-damage-free crops.\n\n=====Hawaii=====\n''Kalo'' is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] name for the taro plant. The local crop plays an important role in Hawaiian culture, [[Hawaiian religion|mythology]], and cuisine. Kalo is a traditional [[staple food|staple]] of the [[native cuisine of Hawaii]]. Some of the uses for taro include [[poi (food)|poi]], table taro (steamed and served like a potato), taro chips, and [[luau]] leaf (to make [[laulau]]). In Hawaii, kalo is farmed under either dryland or wetland conditions. Taro farming in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] is challenging because of the difficulties of accessing fresh water. Kalo is usually grown in \"pond fields\" known as ''lo\u02bbi''. Typical dryland or \"upland\" varieties (varieties grown in watered but not flooded fields) in Hawaii are ''lehua maoli'' and ''bun long'', the latter widely known as \"Chinese taro\". ''Bun long'' is used for making taro chips. ''Dasheen'' (also called \"eddo\") is another dryland variety of ''C. esculenta'' grown for its edible corms or as an ornamental plant. A contemporary Hawaiian diet consists of many tuberous plants, particularly [[sweet potato]] and kalo.\n\nThe Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service determined the 10-year median production of kalo in Hawaii to be about 6.1 million pounds (2,800 t).<ref name=\"Viotti\">Viotti, 2004</ref> However, 2003 taro production in Hawaii was only 5 million pounds (2,300 t), an all-time low since record-keeping began in 1946. The previous low of 1997 was 5.5 million pounds (2,500 t). Despite generally growing demand, production was even lower in 2005\u2014only 4 million pounds, with ''kalo'' for processing into ''poi'' accounting for 97.5%.<ref name=\"Hao\">Hao, 2006</ref> Urbanization is one cause driving down harvests from the high of 14.1 million pounds (6,400 t) in 1948, but more recently, the decline has resulted from pests and diseases. A non-native [[Ampullariidae|apple snail]] (''Pomacea canaliculata'') is a major culprit along with a plant rot disease traced to a newly identified species of [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Phytophthora]]'' that now affects kalo crops throughout Hawaii. Although [[pesticides]] could control both problems to some extent, pesticide use in the ''lo\u02bbi'' is banned because of the opportunity for chemicals to migrate quickly into streams, and then eventually the sea.<ref name=\"Viotti\" /><ref name=\"Hao\" />\n\n; Social roles\n[[File:Cleaning the kalo, Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins.jpg|thumb|Cleaning the ''kalo'', Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins]]\nImportant aspects of [[Hawaiian culture]] revolve around ''kalo'' cultivation and consumption. For example, the newer name for a traditional Hawaiian feast ([[luau]]) comes from the ''kalo''. Young ''kalo'' tops baked with [[coconut milk]] and chicken meat or [[octopus]] arms are frequently served at ''luaus''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy ancient Hawaiian custom, fighting is not allowed when a bowl of ''poi'' is \"open\". Similarly, it is also considered disrespectful to fight in front of an elder and one should not raise their voice, speak angrily, or make rude comments or gestures.\n\n;''Lo\u02bbi''\n[[File:Kalo Loi Harvest.jpg|thumb|left|Several small ''lo\u02bbi'' (pondfields) in which ''kalo'' (taro) is being grown in the [[Maunawili, Hawaii|Maunawili Valley]] on [[Oahu|O\u02bbahu]], Hawai\u02bbi. The ditch on the left in the picture is called an ''\u02bbauwai'' and supplies diverted stream water to the ''lo\u02bbi''.]]\nA ''lo\u02bbi'' is a patch of wetland dedicated to growing ''kalo'' (taro).  Hawaiians have traditionally used water [[irrigation]] systems to produce kalo. Wetland fields produce ten to fifteen times more kalo per acre than dry fields.<ref>Lilikala Kame\u02bbeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 57.</ref>  Wetland-grown kalo need a constant flow of water, and to get this water, fields are usually positioned between the ''mauka'' (mountains) and ''makai'' (sea). A ''lo'i'' specifically denotes wetland kalo growing, not dry land.\n\nThe ''lo\u02bbi'' is part of an ''ahupua\u02bba'', a division of land from the mountain to the sea. Ahupua\u02bba means \"pig altar\", and was named for stone altars with pig head carvings that marked the boundaries of each Hawaiian land division. Ideally, an ahupua\u02bba has all the necessities within its borders. From the mountains, materials such as wood are provided for thatching roofs and twining rope. The uplands produce crops like sugar cane and sweet potatoes, while the lowlands provide taro and fish. This system typically satisfies the large populations in each ''ahupua\u02bba''.<ref>Lilikala Kame\u02bbeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 56.</ref>\n\nWhen kalo was brought to Hawai\u02bbi, there were about 300 varieties (about 100 remain). The kalo plant takes seven months to grow until harvest, so ''lo`i'' fields are used in rotation and the soil can be replenished while the ''lo\u02bbi'' in use has sufficient water. The stems are typically replanted in the ''lo`i'' for future kalo harvests. Once harvested, kalo is incorporated into many foods. The leaves are used to make [[laulau]], from the corm poi or ''pa\u02bbi\u02bbai''.\n\n; History\nOne mythological version of Hawaiian ancestry cites the taro plant as an ancestor to Hawaiians. Legend joins the two siblings of high and divine rank: [[Papah\u0101naumoku]] (\"Papa from whom lands are born\", or Earth mother) and [[W\u0101kea]] (Sky father). Together they create the islands of Hawaii and a beautiful woman, Ho\u02bbohokukalani (The Heavenly one who made the stars).<ref>Beckwith, Martha Warren. \"Papa and Wakea.\" ''Hawaiian Mythology''. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1976). 94.</ref>\n\nThe story of kalo begins when Wakea and Papa conceived their daughter, Ho\u02bbohokukalani. Daughter and father then conceived a child together named H\u0101loanakalaukapalili (Long stalk trembling), but it was [[stillborn]]. After the father and daughter buried the child near their house, a kalo plant grew over the grave:<ref>\"A Brief History of Taro in Hawai`i .\" Hawaiian kalo. Bishop Museum, n.d.

Taro from some regions has developed particularly good reputations with (for instance) [[Lae]] taro being highly prized.\n\nAmong the [[Urapmin people]] of Papua New Guinea, taro (known in [[Urap language|Urap]] as ''ima'') is the main source of sustenance along with the [[sweet potato]] (Urap: ''wan''). In fact, the word for \"food\" in Urap is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of these two words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Joel|year=1995|title=Dispossessing the Spirits: Christian Transformations of Desire and Ecology among the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea quick view|journal=Ethnology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=212\u2013213|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/3773824|jstor=3773824}}</ref>\n\n===== Polynesia =====\nConsidered the staple starch of traditional [[Polynesia]]n cuisine, taro is both a common and prestigious food item that was first introduced to the Polynesian islands by prehistoric seafarers of Southeast Asian derivation. The tuber itself is prepared in various ways, including baking, steaming in [[earth oven]]s (''umu'' or ''imu''), boiling, and frying. The famous Hawaiian staple [[poi (food)|poi]] is made by mashing steamed taro roots with water. Taro also features in traditional desserts such as Samoan ''fa'ausi'', which consists of grated, cooked taro mixed with coconut milk and brown sugar. The leaves of the taro plant also feature prominently in Polynesian cooking, especially as edible wrappings for dishes such as Hawaiian ''[[laulau]]'', Fijian and Samoan ''palusami'' (wrapped around onions and coconut milk), and Tongan ''lupulu'' (wrapped corned beef). Ceremonial presentations on occasion of chiefly rites or communal events (weddings, funerals, etc.) traditionally included the ritual presentation of raw and cooked taro roots/plants.\n\nThe Hawaiian ''laulau'' traditionally contains pork, fish, and ''lu'au'' (cooked taro leaf). The wrapping is inedible ''ti'' leaves (Hawaiian: ''lau ki'').  Cooked taro leaf has the consistency of cooked spinach and is therefore unsuitable for use as a wrapping.\n\n===== Samoa =====\n[[File:Pig on the Samoan Umu.jpg|thumb|Taro corms cooked with pig on the Samoan [[Earth oven|umu]]]]\nIn Samoa, the baby talo leaves and coconut milk are wrapped into parcels and cooked, along with other food, in an earth oven . The parcels are called ''palusami'' or ''lu'au''. The resulting taste is smoky, sweet, savory and has a unique creamy texture. The root is also baked (''Talo tao'') in the [[Earth oven|''umu'']] or boiled with coconut cream (''Fa\u00e1lifu Talo''). It has a slightly bland and starchy flavor. It is sometimes called the Polynesian potato.\n\n===== Tonga =====\n''L\u016b'' is the Tongan word for the edible leaves of the taro plant (called ''talo'' in Tonga), as well as the traditional dish made using them. This meal is still prepared for special occasions and especially on Sunday. The dish consists of chopped meat, onions, and coconut milk wrapped in a number of taro leaves (''l\u016b talo''). This is then wrapped traditionally in a banana leaf (nowadays, aluminum foil is often used) and put in the [[Earth oven|''\u02bbumu'']] to cook. It has a number of named varieties, dependent on the filling:\n* ''L\u016b pulu'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with beef, commonly using imported [[corned beef]] (''kapapulu'')\n* ''L\u016b sipi'' \u2013  ''l\u016b'' with lamb\n* ''L\u016b moa'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with chicken\n* ''L\u016b hoosi'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with horse meat\n\n'''Oceanian Atolls'''\n\nThe islands situated along the border of the three main parts of [[Oceania]] ([[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]]) are more prone to being atolls rather than volcanic islands (most prominently [[Tuvalu]], [[Tokelau]], and [[Kiribati]]). As a result of this, Taro was not a part of the traditional diet due to the infertile soil and have only become a staple today through importation from other islands (Taro and [[Cassava]] cultivars are usually imported from [[Fiji]] or [[Samoa]]). The traditional staple however is the [[Cyrtosperma merkusii|Swamp Taro]] known as [[Pulaka]] or Babai, a distant relative of the Taro but with a very long growing phase (3-5 years), larger and denser corms and coarser leaves. It is grown in a patch of land dug out to give rise to the freshwater lense beneath the soil. The lengthy growing time of this crop usually confines it  as a food during festivities much like Pork although it can be preserved by drying out in the sun and storing it somewhere cool and dry to be enjoyed out of harvesting season. \n\n====Asia====\n\n=====East Asia=====\n\n======China======\nTaro ({{zh|t=\u828b\u982d|s=\u828b\u5934|p=y\u00f9tou|cy=wuht\u00e1u}}) is commonly used as a main course as steamed taro with or without [[sugar]], as a substitute for other [[cereal]]s, in [[Chinese cuisine]] in a variety of styles and provinces steamed, boiled or stir-fried as a main dish and as a flavor-enhancing ingredient. In Northern China, it is often boiled or steamed then peeled and eaten with or without sugar much like a potato. It is commonly braised with [[pork]] or [[beef]]. It is used in the [[dim sum]] cuisine of southern China to make a small plated dish called [[taro dumpling]] as well as a pan-fried dish called [[taro cake]]. It can also be shredded into long strips which are woven together to form a [[seafood birdsnest]].\n\nTaro cake is a delicacy traditionally eaten during [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations. As a dessert, it can be mashed into a [[Taro pur\u00e9e|pur\u00e9e]] or used as a flavoring in ''[[tong sui]]'', [[ice cream]], and other desserts such as Sweet Taro Pie. McDonald's sells taro-flavored [[pie]]s in China.\n\nTaro is mashed in the dessert known as [[taro pur\u00e9e]].\n\n====== Chaoshan, China ======\n[[File:Teochew_Sweet_Yam_Paste_-_After_Stirring.jpg|thumb|Taro paste, also known as \"Or Nee\", is a famous traditional [[Chaoshan]] dessert from China]]\nTaro paste, a traditional Cantonese cuisine, which originated from the [[Chaoshan]] region in the eastern part of China's [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] is a dessert made primarily from taro. The taro is steamed and then mashed into a thick paste, which forms the base of the dessert. Lard or fried onion oil is then added for fragrance. The dessert is traditionally sweetened with water chestnut syrup, and served with ginkgo nuts. Modern versions of the dessert include the addition of coconut cream and sweet corn. The dessert is commonly served at traditional Teochew wedding banquet dinners as the last course, marking the end of the banquet.\n\n======Japan======\n[[File:Excavated satoimo (1)-(5).jpg|thumb|Excavated Japanese ''satoimo'' root (stems are cut before the plant is dug up): (1) Remaining stem from parent or seed satoimo, (2) Parent or seed satoimo, (3) Remaining stem from child satoimo, (4) Child satoimo, (5) Grandchild satoimo]]\n[[File:Item 938358.jpg|thumb|Colocasia esculenta from the Japanse agricultural encyclopedia Seikei Zusetsu]]\nA similar plant in Japan is called {{nihongo||\u91cc\u828b\u3001[[:ja:\u30b5\u30c8\u30a4\u30e2|\u30b5\u30c8\u30a4\u30e2]]|satoimo|literally \"village potato\"}}.

The tuber, ''satoimo'', is often prepared through simmering in fish stock (''[[dashi]]'') and soy sauce.  The stalk, {{ill|zuiki|lt=''zuiki''|ja|\u828b\u830e}}, can also be prepared a number of ways, depending on the variety.<ref>The Japan Times Online</ref>\n\n======Korea======\n[[File:Toran-guk.jpg|thumb|left|''Toran-[[guk]]'' (taro soup)]]\nIn Korea, taro is called ''toran'' ({{lang-ko|\ud1a0\ub780}}: \"earth egg\"), and the corm is stewed and the leaf stem is stir-fried. Taro roots can be used for medicinal purposes, particularly for treating insect bites. It is made into the Korean traditional soup ''toranguk'' (\ud1a0\ub780\uad6d). Taro stems are often used as an ingredient in [[yukgaejang]] (\uc721\uac1c\uc7a5).\n\n======Taiwan======\n[[File:\u828b\u6ce5 \u00e0 Taipei.jpg|thumb|left|Small ball of mashed taro paste served on a banana leaf in a restaurant of the Daan district (Taipei)]]\nIn [[Taiwan]], taro\u2014 ''y\u00f9t\u00f3u'' ({{lang|zh|\u828b\u982d}}) in Mandarin, and ''\u014d\u0358-\u00e1'' ({{lang|zh|\u828b\u4ed4}}) in [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]]\u2014is well-adapted to Taiwanese climate and can grow almost anywhere in the country with minimal maintenance. Before the [[Taiwan Miracle]] made rice affordable to everyone, taro was one of the main staples in Taiwan. Nowadays taro is used more often in desserts. [[Supermarket]] varieties range from about the size and shape of a [[brussels sprout]] to longer, larger varieties the size of a [[football]]. Taro chips are often used as a potato-chip-like snack. Compared to [[potato chips]], taro chips are harder and have a [[nut (fruit)|nuttier]] flavor. Another popular traditional Taiwanese snack is [[taro ball]], served on ice or deep-fried. It is common to see taro as a flavor in desserts and drinks, such as [[bubble tea]].\n\n=====Southeast Asia=====\n\n======Indonesia======\nin [[Indonesia]] taro widely use for snacks, cakes, cracker even macaroon; can be easily find everywhere; some variety are special cultivated according to social geographical purposes.

Its adaptability to marshland and swamps make it one of the most common vegetables in the Philippines. The leaves, stems, and corms are all consumed and form part of the local cuisine. A popular recipe for taro is ''[[laing (food)|laing]]'' from the [[Bicol Region]]; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish ''[[bagoong]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dpinpin/2303024507/in/set-72157604019353752/|title=Laing, gabi|work=Flickr|date=March 2008}}</ref> It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called ''[[siling labuyo]]''. Another dish in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, ''[[sinigang]]'', although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, [[Averrhoa bilimbi|''kamias'']], etc.) with the addition of peeled and diced corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ''[[ginataan]]'', a coconut milk and taro dessert.\n\n======Thailand======\nIn [[Thai cuisine]], taro {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01}} (''pheuak'') is used in a variety of ways depending on the region. Boiled taro is readily available in the market packaged in small cellophane bags, already peeled and diced, and eaten as a snack.

One is called ''khoai m\u00f4n,'' which is used as a filling in [[spring roll]]s, cakes, puddings and [[Ch\u00e8|sweet soup desserts]], smoothies and other desserts. Taro is used in the [[T\u1ebft]] dessert ''ch\u00e8 khoai m\u00f4n'', which is sticky rice pudding with taro roots. The stems are also used in soups such as ''[[canh chua]]''. One is called ''khoai s\u1ecd'', which is smaller in size and more delicious than ''Khoai m\u00f4n'', and of course, more expensive than ''khoai m\u00f4n''. Another common taro plant grows roots in shallow waters and grows stems and leaves above the surface of the water. This taro plant has [[saponin]]-like substances that cause a hot, itchy feeling in the mouth and throat. Northern farmers used to plant them to cook the stems and leaves to feed their hogs. They re-grew quickly from their roots. After cooking, the [[saponin]] in the soup of taro stems and leaves is reduced to a level the hogs can eat. Today this practice is no longer popular in Vietnam agriculture. These taro plants are commonly called ''khoai ng\u1ee9a'', which literally means \"itchy potato\".\n\n=====South Asia=====\n\n======Bangladesh======\n[[File:Food-Kochu-Bata.jpg|thumb|left|Kochu bata]]\nIn [[Bangladesh]] taro is a very popular vegetable known as ''kochu'' (\u0995\u099a\u09c1) or ''mukhi'' (\u09ae\u09c1\u0996\u09bf). Within the [[Sylheti]] dialect of the Bangla language, it is called ''mukhi''. It is usually cooked with small [[prawn]]s or the [[ilish]] fish into a [[curry]], but some dishes are cooked with [[dried fish]]. Its green leaves, ''kochu pata'' (\u0995\u099a\u09c1 \u09aa\u09be\u09a4\u09be), and stem, ''kochu'' (\u0995\u099a\u09c1), are also eaten as a favorite dish and usually ground to a paste or finely chopped to make ''shak'' \u2014 but it must be boiled well beforehand. Taro stolons or stems, ''kochur loti'' (\u0995\u099a\u09c1\u09b0 \u09b2\u09a4\u09bf), are also favored by Bangladeshis and cooked with [[shrimp]], dried fish or the head of the ilish fish.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/lifestyle/deshi-mix/kochu-you-can-say-again-1259194|title=Kochu!

It is called \u0915\u091a\u0941(''kachu'') in Sanskrit.<ref>''The Cross Name Index to Medicinal Plants'', Four-Volume Set By Anthony R. Torkelson. Page Number 1694.</ref>\n\nIn [[Mizoram]], it is called ''b\u00e4l''; the leaves, stalks and tubers are eaten as ''dawl bai''. The leaves and stalks are often traditionally preserved to be eaten in dry season as \"''dawl r\u00ebp bai''\".<ref name=\"dawlbai\">{{cite web|url=http://www.misual.com/2008/11/09/ei-leh-in-lam-bawk-aw/|title=Ei leh in lam bawk aw! - mi(sual).com|website=www.misual.com}}</ref><ref name=\"ndtv\">{{cite web|url=http://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/humayunpur-a-mini-north-eastern-food-hub-in-safdarjung-1724305|title=Humayunpur: A Mini North-Eastern Food Hub In Safdarjung|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Assam]], a north-eastern state of India, taro is known as \"kosu\" (\u0995\u099a\u09c1). Various parts of different types of such plants are eaten by making different dishes. The leaf buds called \"Kosu loti\" (\u0995\u099a\u09c1 \u09b2\u09a4\u09bf) are cooked with sour dried fruits called ''Thekera'' (\u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7\u09f0\u09be) or sometimes with Tamarind or Elephant apple alone or with a small amount of pulses and sometimes, fish. Similar dishes are prepared from the long root-like structures called ''Kosu thuri''. A fried dish with sour objects is also made from its flower (''Kosu kala''). Soupy dishes are made from solid roots which are sometimes also boiled and eaten sometimes with salt as snacks or home-made fast food.\n\nIn [[Manipur]], another north-eastern Indian state, taro is known as ''pan''. The kuki tribes called it ''bal''. Boiled ''bal'' is a snack at lunch along with chutney or hot chili-flakes besides being cooked as a main dish along with smoked or dried meat, beans, and mustard leaves. They also sun-dry the leaves and keep them for future use as broth and hodge-podge. It is widely available and is eaten in many forms, either baked, boiled, or cooked into a curry with Hilsa fish or with fermented soybeans called ''Hawai-zaar''. The leaves are also used in a special traditional dish called ''utti'', cooked with peas.\n\nIn [[Himachal Pradesh]], a northern state in India, the taro root is known as ''ghandyali'', and the plant is known as ''Kachalu'' in [[Kangra & Mandi district]]. The dish called ''patrodu'' is made using taro leaves rolled with corn or gram flour and boiled in water. Another dish, ''pujji'' is made with mashed leaves and the trunk of the plant and ''ghandyali'' or taro roots are prepared as a separate dish. Also in the capital [[Shimla]], a pancake-style dish, called ''[[Patra (dish)|patra]]'' or ''patid'', is made using gram flour.\n\nA tall-growing variety of taro is extensively used on the western coast of India to make ''[[patrode]]'', ''patrade'', or ''patrada'', literally a \"leaf-pancake\". In the [[Dakshin Kannada]] district in the state of [[Karnataka]], it is used as a morning breakfast dish, either made like fritters or steamed. In the state of [[Maharashtra]], the leaves, called ''alu che paana'', are de-veined, rolled with a paste of gram flour, tamarind paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander, [[asafoetida]], and salt, and then steamed. These can be eaten whole or cut into pieces, or shallow fried and eaten as a snack known as ''alu chi wadi''. ''Alu chya panan chi patal bhaji'' a lentil and colocasia leaves curry, is also popular. In [[Goan cuisine]] as well as the [[Konkani cuisine]] Taro leaves are very popular.\n\nIn the Indian states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]], the leaves of the plant are used to make [[Patra (dish)|''patra'']] a dish with gram flour, tamarind and other spices.\n\nSindhis call it ''kachaloo''; they fry it, compress it, and re-fry it to make a dish called ''tuk'' which complements [[Sindhi cuisine|Sindhi curry]].\n\nIn [[Kerala]], a state in southern [[India]], taro corms are known as \u0d1a\u0d47\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d4d \u0d15\u0d3f\u0d34\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d4d ''chembu-kizhangu''. Taro is used as a [[staple food]], as a side dish, or as an ingredient in various side dishes like [[Sambar (dish)|''sambar'']]. As a staple food, it is steamed and eaten with a spicy [[chutney]] of green chilies, tamarind, and shallots. The leaves and stems of certain varieties of taro are used as a vegetable in Kerala.\n\nIn other Indian states, [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], taro corms are known as ''sivapan-kizhangu'' (''seppankilangu'' or ''cheppankilangu''), ''chamagadda'', or in coastal Andhra districts as ''chaama dumpa'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. It can be cooked in many ways, such as deep-fried in oil for a side item with rice, or cooked in a tangy tamarind sauce with spices, onion, and tomato.\n\nIn the East Indian state of [[West Bengal]], taro roots are thinly sliced and fried to make chips called ''kochu bhaja''. The stem is used to cook a very tasty ''Kochur saag'' with fried hilsha fish head or boiled chhola (chickpea), often eaten as a starter with hot rice. The roots are also made into a paste with spices and eaten with rice. The most popular dish is a spicy [[curry]] made with prawn and taro roots. Gathi kochu (Taro root) is very popular in this Indian state and it is used to make a thick curry called gathi kochur dal. Here kochur loti (Taro stolon) dry curry<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.favcounter.com/bengali-style-kochur-loti-recipe/|title=Bengali style kochur loti dish, Taro stolon curry|date=2019-05-02|website=FavCounter|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-05}}</ref> is a popular dish which is normally prepared with poppy seeds & mustard seeds paste. Leaves & roots of shola kochu & maan kochu are also used to make some popular traditional dishes.\n\nIn the [[Mithilanchal]] region of [[Bihar]], taro root is known as  \u0905\u0921\u0941\u0906 and its leaves are called \u0905\u0921\u093c\u093f\u0915\u0902\u091a \u0915\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0924.  A curry of taro leaves is made with mustard paste and \u0906\u092e\u093f\u0932 (sun-dried mango pulp used for a sour taste in daal, curry and sour gravy).\n\nIn the eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], taro root is known as ''saru''. Dishes made of taro include ''saru besara'' (taro in mustard and garlic paste). It is also an indispensable ingredient in preparing the heart of [[Odia people|Odia]] cuisine, the ''dalma'', where vegetables are cooked with [[dal]]. Sliced taro roots, deep fried in oil and mixed with red chili powder and salt, are known as ''saru chips''.\n\nIn the north Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] and neighboring [[Nepal]], taro is considered a healthy food cooked in a variety of ways. The delicate''Gaderi'' taro of Kumaun, especially from the Lobanj region is much sought after. Most commonly it is boiled in tamarind water until tender, then it is diced into cubes which are stir-fried in mustard oil with methi (fenugreek) leaves. Boiling it in salty water in iron cooking pots until it becomes like porridge, is another technique. The young leaves called ''gaaba'', are steamed, then sun-dried and stored for later use. For another use, the taro leaves and stems are used raw as an ingredient for pickles. Crushed leaves and stems are mixed with de-husked urad dal \u2013 black lentils<!--black lentils or urad dal?--> and then dried as small balls called ''badi''. The stems may also be sun-dried and stored for later use. On one special day, women worship ''saptarshi'' (\"seven sages\") and eat only rice with taro leaf vegetable.\n\n====Maldives====\n''Ala'' was widely grown in the southern atolls of [[Addu Atoll]], [[Fuvahmulah]], [[Huvadhu Atoll]], and [[Laamu Atoll]] and is considered a [[staple food|staple]] even after rice was introduced. ''Ala'' and ''olhu ala'' are still widely eaten all over the Maldives, cooked or steamed with salt to taste, and eaten with grated coconut along with chili paste and fish soup. It is also prepared as a curry. The roots are sliced and fried to make chips and are also used to prepare varieties of sweets.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Romero-Frias|first=Xavier|title=Eating on the Islands|journal=[[Himal Southasian|HIM\u0100L Southasian]]|volume=26|pages=69\u201391|number=2}}</ref>\n\n====Nepal====\n[[File:Arikanchan.jpg|thumb|Arikanchan is prepared from taro leaves, black lentils paste and spices in mostly the Eastern Terai of Nepal, is traditional and indigenous food.]]\nTaro is grown in the [[Terai]] and the [[Geography of nepal#The Hill Region|hilly regions]] of [[Nepal]]. The root (corm) of taro is known as ''pindalu'' (\u092a\u093f\u0901\u0921\u093e\u0932\u0941) and petioles with leaves are known as ''karkalo'' (\u0915\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0932\u094b) and also as ''Gava'' (\u0917\u093e\u092d\u093e). Almost all parts are eaten in different dishes.  Boiled corm of Taro is commonly served with salt, spices, and chilies. Taro is a popular dish in the hilly region. Chopped leaves and petioles are mixed with ''Urad'' bean flour to make dried balls called ''maseura'' (\u092e\u0938\u094d\u092f\u094c\u0930\u093e). Large taro leaves are used as an alternative to an umbrella when unexpected rain occurs. Popular attachment to taro since ancient times is reflected in popular culture, such as in songs and textbooks. ''Jivan hamro karkala ko pani jastai ho'' (\u091c\u0940\u0935\u0928 \u0939\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0930\u094b \u0915\u0930\u094d\u0915\u0932\u093e\u0915\u094b \u092a\u093e\u0928\u0940 \u091c\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0948 \u0939\u094b) means, \"Our life is as vulnerable as water stuck in the leaf of taro\".\n\nTaro is cultivated and eaten by the [[Tharu people]] in the [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|Inner Terai]] as well.  Roots are mixed with dried fish and turmeric, then dried in cakes called ''sidhara'' which are curried with radish, chili, garlic and other spices to accompany rice.  The Tharu prepare the leaves in a fried vegetable side-dish that also shows up in [[Maithil]]i cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mithilacuisine.blogspot.com/|title=Mithila Cuisine|work=mithilacuisine.blogspot.com}}</ref>\n\n====Pakistan====\n[[File:Arvi Gosht.jpg|thumb|left|Arvi gosht]]\nIn Pakistan, taro or ''eddoe'' or ''arvi'' is a very common dish served with or without gravy; a popular dish is ''arvi gosht'', which includes beef, lamb or mutton. The leaves are rolled along with gram flour batter and then fried or steamed to make a dish called ''Pakora'', which is finished by tempering with red chilies and carrom ([[ajwain]]) seeds. Taro or ''arvi'' is also cooked with chopped spinach. The dish called ''Arvi Palak'' is the second most renowned dish made of Taro.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nMany varieties are recorded in Sri Lanka, several being edible, others being toxic to humans and therefore not cultivated. Edible varieties (''kiri ala'', ''kolakana ala'', ''gahala'', and ''sevel ala'') are cultivated for their corms and leaves. Sri Lankans eat corms after boiling them or making them into a curry with coconut milk. The leaves of only two variety, ''kolakana ala'' and '' kalu alakola'' are eaten.\n\n====Middle East and Europe====\nTaro was consumed by the early Romans in much the same way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable ''colocasia''. The Roman cookbook ''[[Apicius]]'' mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. When the Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Recently{{When|date=April 2011}} there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.\n\n====Cyprus====\nIn [[Cyprus]], taro has been in use since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Today it is known as ''kolokas'' in Turkish or ''kolokasi'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9) in Greek, which comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] name \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (''kolokasion'') for [[lotus root]]. It is usually sauteed with [[celery]] and [[onion]] with pork, [[chicken]] or lamb, in a [[tomato sauce]] \u2013 a vegetarian version is also available. The cormlets are called ''poulles'' (sing. ''poulla''), and they are prepared by first being sauteed, followed by decaramelising the vessel with [[dry wine|dry]] [[red wine]] and [[coriander seed]]s, and finally served with freshly squeezed [[lemon]].\n\n====Egypt====\nIn Egypt, taro is known as ''qolqas'' ({{lang-arz|\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633}}, {{IPA-arz|\u0294ol\u02c8\u0294\u00e6\u02d0s|IPA}}). The corms are larger than what would be found in [[North America]]n supermarkets. After being peeled completely, it is cooked in one of two ways: cut into small cubes and cooked in broth with fresh [[coriander]] and [[chard]] and served as an accompaniment to meat [[stew]], or sliced and cooked with [[Ground meat|minced meat]] and tomato sauce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com/vegetables/colcasia-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3.html|title=Colcasia \u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633|website=egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com|accessdate=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nYouth who perform [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] in Egypt are exposed to the dreaded \"black dish\" ({{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u062e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627}} ''al-\u1e6dabkha al-sawda'') which is a combination of boiled [[eggplant]]s and taro halves, often unpeeled.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Greece====\nIn Greece, taro grows on [[Icaria]]. Icarians credit taro for saving them from famine during [[World War II]]. They boil it until tender and serve it as a [[salad]].\n\n=====Lebanon=====\nIn Lebanon, taro is known as ''kilkass'' and is grown mainly along the Mediterranean coast. The leaves and stems are not consumed in Lebanon and the variety grown produces round to slightly oblong tubers that vary in size from a tennis ball to a small cantaloupe. ''Kilkass'' is a very popular winter dish in Lebanon and is prepared in two ways: ''kilkass'' with lentils is a stew flavored with crushed garlic and lemon juice and ''\u2019il\u2019as'' ([[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese pronunciation]] of {{linktext|\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633|lang=ar}}) ''bi-[[tahini]]''. Another common method of preparing taro is to boil, peel then slice it into {{cvt|1|cm}} thick slices, before frying and marinating in edible \"red\" [[sumac]].\nIn northern Lebanon, it is known as a potato with the name ''borshoushi'' (''el-orse borshushi''). It is also prepared as part of a lentil soup with crushed garlic and lemon juice. Also in the north, it is known by the name ''bouzmet'', mainly around [[Miniyeh|Menieh]], where it is first peeled, and left to dry in the sun for a couple of days. After that, it is stir-fried in lots of vegetable oil in a casserole until golden brown, then a large amount of wedged, melted onions are added, in addition to water, chickpeas and some seasoning. These are all left to simmer for a few hours, and the result is a stew-like dish. It is considered a hard-to-make delicacy, not only because of the tedious preparation but the consistency and flavour that the taro must reach. The smaller variety of taro is more popular in the north due to its tenderness.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn the [[Azores]] taro is known as ''inhame'' or ''inhame-coco'' and is commonly steamed with potatoes, [[vegetable]]s and [[meat]]s or [[fish]]. The leaves are sometimes cooked into soups and stews. It is also consumed as a [[dessert]] after first being steamed and peeled, then fried in [[vegetable oil]] or [[lard]], and finally sprinkled with [[sugar]], [[cinnamon]] and [[nutmeg]]. Taro grows abundantly in the fertile land of the Azores, as well as in creeks that are fed by mineral springs. Through migration to other countries, the ''inhame'' is found in the Azorean diaspora.\n\n=====Spain=====\nTaro root is consumed in the south of Spain. Taro has remained popular in the [[Canary Islands]]. In the Canary Islands it is known as ''\u00f1ame'' and is often used in thick vegetable stews, like ''potaje de berros'' (cress [[potage]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.culturatradicionalgc.org/Gastronomia-Tradicional/Primer-Plato/Potaje-de-Berros.html |title=Potaje de Berros  |website=culturatradicionalgc.org |access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>  Taro is called ''\u00f1ame'' (which normally designates [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]) in [[Spanish language|Canarian Spanish]] and is a common crop in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands (Canary Islands, Spain).\n\n=====Turkey=====\nTaro ({{lang-tr|g\u00f6levez}}) is grown in the south coast of [[Turkey]], especially in [[Mersin]], [[Bozyaz\u0131]], [[Anamur]] and [[Antalya]]. It is boiled in a [[tomato sauce]] or cooked with meat, beans and [[chickpea]]s. It is often used as a substitute for [[potato]].\n\n====Africa====\n\n=====East Africa=====\n[[File:Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix.JPG|thumb|Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix]]\nIn [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]], taro is commonly known as ''arrow root'', ''ggobe'', or ''nduma'' and ''madhumbe'' in some local [[Bantu languages]]. It is usually boiled and eaten with [[tea]] or other beverages, or as the main [[starch]] of a meal. It is also cultivated in [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n=====South Africa=====\nIt is known as ''amadumbe'' (plural) or ''idumbe'' (singular) in the Zulu language of Southern Africa.\n\n=====West Africa=====\n[[File:Pileuse de taro.jpg|thumb|left|Preparing taro in Cameroon]]\nTaro is consumed as a [[staple crop]] in [[West Africa]], particularly in [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].  It is called ''cocoyam'' in Nigeria, Ghana and Anglophone Cameroon, ''[[macabo]]'' in [[Francophone Cameroon]], and ''ede'' in [[Igbo language]]. ''Cocoyam'' is often boiled, fried, or roasted and eaten with a sauce. In Ghana, it substitutes for [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] in making ''[[fufu]]'' when plantains are out of season. It is also cut into small pieces to make a soupy baby food and appetizer called ''mpotompoto''. It is also common in Ghana to find ''cocoyam chips'' (deep-fried slices, about {{cvt|1|mm}} thick). ''Cocoyam'' leaves, locally called ''kontomire'' in Ghana, are a popular vegetable for local sauces such as [[palaver sauce]] and [[egusi]]/agushi stew.<ref>ghanaian cuisine</ref> It is also commonly consumed in Guinea and parts of Senegal, as a leaf sauce or as a vegetable side, and is referred to as ''jaabere'' in the local [[Pulaar]] dialect.\n\n====Americas====\n\n=====Brazil=====\nIn [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Lusophone countries]], ''inhame'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|\u0129&thinsp;\u02c8&thinsp;\u0237\u0303\u0250\u0303mi|}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02c8&thinsp;\u0237\u0303\u0250\u0303mi|}} or {{IPA-pt|\u0129\u02d1\u02c8\u0272\u0250\u0303mi|}}, literally \"[[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]\") and ''car\u00e1'' are the common names for various plants with edible parts of the genera ''[[Alocasia]]'', ''[[Colocasia]]'' (family [[Araceae]]) and ''[[Dioscorea]]'' (family [[Dioscoreaceae]]), and its respective starchy edible parts, generally [[tuber]]s, with the exception of ''[[Dioscorea bulbifera]]'', called ''car\u00e1-moela'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|k\u0250\u02c8\u027ea mu\u02c8\u025bl\u0250|}}, literally, \"[[gizzard]] yam\"), in Brazil and never deemed to be an ''inhame''. Definitions of what constitutes an ''inhame'' and a ''car\u00e1'' vary regionally, but the common understanding in [[Brazil]] is that ''car\u00e1s'' are potato-like in shape, while ''inhames'' are more oblong.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] of the hotter and drier [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern region]], both ''inhames'' and ''car\u00e1s'' are called ''batata'' (literally, \"potato\"). For differentiation, potatoes are called ''batata-inglesa'' (literally, \"English potato\"), a name used in other regions and [[sociolect]]s to differentiate it from the ''batata-doce'', \"[[sweet potato]]\", ironic names since both were first cultivated by the indigenous peoples of [[South America]], their native continent, and only later [[Columbian Exchange|introduced in Europe]] by the colonizers.\n\nTaros are often prepared like potatoes, eaten boiled, stewed or mashed, generally with salt and sometimes [[garlic]] as a condiment, as part of a meal (most often lunch or dinner).\n\n=====Central America=====\nIn [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], taro is eaten in [[soup]]s, as a replacement for potatoes, and as chips. It is known locally as ''malanga'' (also ''malanga coco'') and ''dasheen'' in Belize and Costa Rica, ''quiquizque'' in Nicaragua, and as ''otoe'' in Panama.\n\n=====Haiti=====\nIn [[Haiti]], it is usually called ''malanga'', or ''taro''. The corm is grated into a paste and deep-fried to make a fritter called ''Acra''. ''Acra'' is a very popular street food in Haiti.\n\n=====Jamaica=====\nIn [[Jamaica]], taro is known as ''coco'', ''[[cocoyam]]'' and ''dasheen''. Corms with flesh which is white throughout are referred to as ''minty-coco''. The leaves are also used to make Pepper Pot Soup which may include [[callaloo]].\n\n=====Suriname=====\nIn [[Suriname]] it is called ''tayer'', ''taya'', ''pomtayer'' or ''pongtaya''. The taro root is called ''aroei'' by the native Indians and is commonly known as \"Chinese ''tayer''\". The variety known as ''eddoe'' is also called Chinese ''tayer''. It is a popular cultivar among the maroon population in the interior, also because it is not adversely affected by high water levels. The ''dasheen'' variety, commonly planted in swamps, is rare, although appreciated for its taste. The closely related ''Xanthosoma'' species is the base for the popular Surinamese dish, [[Pom (dish)|pom]].\n\n=====Trinidad and Tobago=====\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], it is called ''dasheen''. The leaves of the taro plant are used to make the Trinidadian variant of the Caribbean dish known as [[callaloo]] (which is made with okra, ''dasheen''/taro leaves, coconut milk or creme and aromatic herbs) and it is also prepared similarly to steamed spinach. The root of the taro plant is often served boiled, accompanied by stewed fish or meat, curried, often with peas and eaten with roti, or in soups.\n\n=====United States=====\n[[File:Taro sticks for sale.jpg|thumb|Taro leaf-stems ([[Petiole (botany)|petioless]]) for sale at a market in California, 2009]]\nIn American [[Chinatown]]s, people often use taro in [[Chinese cuisine]], though it is not as popular as in [[Asia]]n and [[Oceania|Pacific nations]]. Since the late 20th century, taro chips have been available in many supermarkets and natural food stores. In the 1920s, ''dasheen''{{refn|group=nb|The word ''dasheen'' originated in [[Trinidad]] and is said to be a corruption of ''de la Chine'' or ''da Chine'', i.e. ''taro de la Chine''.<ref name=\"Young\">Robert A.

It was used in place of potatoes and dried to make flour. ''Dasheen'' flour was said to make excellent pancakes when mixed with wheat flour.\n\n=====Venezuela=====\n[[File:Sopa de Gallina.JPG|thumb|left|Chopped taro for preparing [[sopa de gallina]]]]\nIn Venezuela, taro is called ''ocumo chino'' or ''chino'' and used in soups and ''[[sancocho]]s''. Soups contain large chunks of several kinds of tubers, including ''ocumo chino'', especially in the eastern part of the country, where West Indian influence is present. It is also used to accompany meats in ''parrillas'' (barbecue) or fried cured fish where [[Cassava|yuca]] is not available. ''Ocumo'' is an indigenous name; ''chino'' means \"Chinese\", an adjective for produce that is considered exotic. ''Ocumo'' without the Chinese denomination is a tuber from the same family, but without taro's inside purplish color. ''Ocumo'' is the Venezuelan name for [[Xanthosoma|malanga]], so ''ocumo chino'' means \"Chinese malanga\". Taro is always prepared boiled. No porridge form is known in the local cuisine.\n\n=====West Indies=====\nTaro is called ''dasheen'',<ref name=\"Young\" /> in contrast to the smaller variety of corms called ''[[Eddoe|eddo]]'', or ''tanya'' in the English speaking countries of the [[West Indies]], and is cultivated and consumed as a staple crop in the region. There are differences among the roots mentioned above: taro or ''dasheen'' is mostly blue when cooked, ''tanya'' is white and very dry, and ''eddoes'' are small and very slimy.\n\nIn the Spanish-speaking countries of the [[Spanish West Indies]] taro is called ''\u00f1ame'', the Portuguese variant of which (''inhame'') is used in former Portuguese colonies where taro is still cultivated, including the [[Azores]] and [[Brazil]].  In [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]], and the Dominican Republic it is sometimes called ''malanga'' or ''yautia''.  In some countries, such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Dominica]], the leaves and stem of the ''dasheen'', or taro, are most often cooked and pureed into a thick liquid called [[callaloo]], which is served as a side dish similar to creamed spinach. ''Callaloo'' is sometimes prepared with [[crab]] legs, coconut milk, pumpkin, and okra. It is usually served alongside rice or made into a soup along with various other roots.\n\n=== Ornamental ===\nIt is also sold as an ornamental [[aquatic plant]].\n\n=== Laboratory ===\nIt is also used for [[anthocyanin]] study experiments especially with reference to abaxial and adaxial anthocyanic concentration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Nicole M|last2=Carpenter|first2=Kaylyn L|last3=Keidel|first3=Timothy S|last4=Miller|first4=Charlene N|last5=Waters|first5=Matthew N|last6=Smith|first6=William K|year=2014|title=Photosynthetic costs and benefits of abaxial versus adaxial anthocyanins in Colocasia esculenta 'Mojito'|journal=Planta|volume=240|issue=5|pages=971\u2013981|doi=10.1007/s00425-014-2090-6|pmid=24903360}}</ref> A recent study has revealed a honeycomb like micro-structures on the taro leaf, which makes the leaf superhydrophobic.

Taro can be grown in [[paddy field]]s where water is abundant or in upland situations where water is supplied by rainfall or supplemental irrigation. Taro is one of the few crops (along with [[rice]] and [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]]) that can be grown under flooded conditions. This is due to air spaces in the [[petiole (botany)|petiole]], which permit underwater gaseous exchange with the atmosphere. For a maximum dissolved [[oxygen]] supply, the water should be cool and flowing. Warm, stagnant water causes basal rotting. For maximum yields, the water level should be controlled so that the base of the plant is always under water.\n\nFlooded cultivation has some advantages over dry-land cultivation: higher yields (about double), out-of-season production (which may result in higher prices), and weed control (which flooding facilitates). On the other hand, in flooded production systems taro requires a longer maturation period, investment in infrastructure, and higher operational costs, and [[monoculture]] is likely.\n\nLike most [[List of root vegetables|root crops]], taro and [[eddoe]]s do well in deep, moist or even swampy soils where the annual rainfall exceeds {{cvt|2,500|mm}}. Eddoes are more resistant to drought and cold. The crop attains maturity within six to twelve months after planting in dry-land cultivation and after twelve to fifteen months in wetland cultivation. The crop is harvested when the plant height decreases and the leaves turn yellow. These signals are usually less distinct in flooded taro cultivation.\n\nHarvesting is usually done by hand tools, even in mechanized production systems. First, the soil around the corm is loosened, and then, the corm is pulled up by grabbing the base of the petioles. The global average yield is 6.2 tonnes/hectare but varies according to the region. In Asia, average yields reach 12.6 tonnes/hectare.<ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf |title=FAO: Taro cultivation in Asia and the Pacific, 1999 |access-date=2018-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807122927/http://www.tistr.or.th/rap/publication/1999/1999_16_high.pdf |archive-date=2011-08-07 |url-status=dead }} \n</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Top taro producers of 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=Crops|website=faostat.fao.org|accessdate = 6 December 2019}}</ref><br />(million [[tonne]]s)\n!Country\n!Production\n|-\n|{{NGA}}|| align=\"right\" | 3.3\n|-\n|{{CHN}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.9\n|-\n|{{CMR}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.8\n|-\n|{{GHA}}|| align=\"right\" | 1.2\n|-\n|{{PNG}}|| align=\"right\" | 0.3\n|-\n|'''World total'''|| align=\"right\" |'''10.2'''\n|}\n\n== Uses ==\n\n===Culinary===\n[[File:Peeled taro corms.jpg|thumb|left|Peeled taro corms]]\n{{nutritional value | name=Taro, cooked, without salt\n| kJ=594\n| protein=0.52 g\n| fat=0.11 g\n| carbs=34.6 g\n| fiber=5.1 g\n| sugars=0.49\n| calcium_mg=18\n| iron_mg=0.72\n| magnesium_mg=30\n| phosphorus_mg=76\n| potassium_mg=484\n| zinc_mg=0.27\n| manganese_mg=0.449\n| vitC_mg=5\n| thiamin_mg=0.107\n| riboflavin_mg=0.028\n| niacin_mg=0.51\n| pantothenic_mg=0.336\n| vitB6_mg=0.331\n| folate_ug=19\n| vitE_mg=2.93\n| vitD_mg=\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11519&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n|vitD_ug=1.2|vitD_iu=}}It is a food staple in [[Culture of Africa|African]], [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[South Asia]]n cultures.<ref name=\"new-agri.co\" />{{nutritional value | name=Taro leaves, raw\n| kJ=177\n| protein=5 g\n| fat=0.74 g\n| carbs=6.7 g\n| fiber=3.7 g\n| sugars=3 g\n| calcium_mg=107\n| iron_mg=2.25\n| magnesium_mg=45\n| phosphorus_mg=60\n| potassium_mg=648\n| zinc_mg=0.41\n| manganese_mg=0.714\n| vitC_mg=52\n| thiamin_mg=0.209\n| riboflavin_mg=0.456\n| niacin_mg=1.513\n| vitB6_mg=0.146\n| folate_ug=126\n| vitA_ug=241\n| betacarotene_ug=2895\n| lutein_ug=1932\n| vitE_mg=2.02\n| vitK_ug=108.6\n| source_usda = 1\n| note=[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=11520&format=Full Link to USDA Database entry]\n}}\nPeople usually consume its edible corm and leaves.

The prominence of the crop there has led it to be a staple of the population's diet. Taro is grown across the country, but the method of cultivation depends on the nature of the island it is grown on. Taro also plays an important role in the country's export trade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/ac450e/ac450e08.htm|title=Taro Cultivation in Asia and the Pacific|last1=FAO|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref> The root is eaten boiled, as is standard across [[Polynesia]].

Its growth as an export crop began in 1993 when [[taro leaf blight]]<ref name=\"TaroLeafBlight\">[http://www2.ctahr.hawaii.edu/adap2/ascc_landgrant/Dr_Brooks/ColorPlates.pdf Taro leaf blight caused by ''Phytophthora colocasiae''], College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (CTAHR), [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa]], Honolulu, Hawai'i, p. 2.</ref> decimated the taro industry in neighboring [[Samoa]]. Fiji filled the void and was soon supplying taro internationally. Almost 80% of Fiji's exported taro comes from the island of [[Taveuni]] where the taro beetle species ''Papuana uninodis'' is absent. The Fijian taro industry on the main islands of [[Viti Levu]] and [[Vanua Levu]] faces constant damage from the beetles. The Fiji Ministry of Agriculture and the Land Resources Division of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) are researching pest control and instigating quarantine restrictions to prevent the spread of the pest. Taveuni now exports pest-damage-free crops.\n\n=====Hawaii=====\n''Kalo'' is the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] name for the taro plant. The local crop plays an important role in Hawaiian culture, [[Hawaiian religion|mythology]], and cuisine. Kalo is a traditional [[staple food|staple]] of the [[native cuisine of Hawaii]]. Some of the uses for taro include [[poi (food)|poi]], table taro (steamed and served like a potato), taro chips, and [[luau]] leaf (to make [[laulau]]). In Hawaii, kalo is farmed under either dryland or wetland conditions. Taro farming in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] is challenging because of the difficulties of accessing fresh water. Kalo is usually grown in \"pond fields\" known as ''lo\u02bbi''. Typical dryland or \"upland\" varieties (varieties grown in watered but not flooded fields) in Hawaii are ''lehua maoli'' and ''bun long'', the latter widely known as \"Chinese taro\". ''Bun long'' is used for making taro chips. ''Dasheen'' (also called \"eddo\") is another dryland variety of ''C. esculenta'' grown for its edible corms or as an ornamental plant. A contemporary Hawaiian diet consists of many tuberous plants, particularly [[sweet potato]] and kalo.\n\nThe Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service determined the 10-year median production of kalo in Hawaii to be about 6.1 million pounds (2,800 t).<ref name=\"Viotti\">Viotti, 2004</ref> However, 2003 taro production in Hawaii was only 5 million pounds (2,300 t), an all-time low since record-keeping began in 1946. The previous low of 1997 was 5.5 million pounds (2,500 t). Despite generally growing demand, production was even lower in 2005\u2014only 4 million pounds, with ''kalo'' for processing into ''poi'' accounting for 97.5%.<ref name=\"Hao\">Hao, 2006</ref> Urbanization is one cause driving down harvests from the high of 14.1 million pounds (6,400 t) in 1948, but more recently, the decline has resulted from pests and diseases. A non-native [[Ampullariidae|apple snail]] (''Pomacea canaliculata'') is a major culprit along with a plant rot disease traced to a newly identified species of [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Phytophthora]]'' that now affects kalo crops throughout Hawaii. Although [[pesticides]] could control both problems to some extent, pesticide use in the ''lo\u02bbi'' is banned because of the opportunity for chemicals to migrate quickly into streams, and then eventually the sea.<ref name=\"Viotti\" /><ref name=\"Hao\" />\n\n; Social roles\n[[File:Cleaning the kalo, Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins.jpg|thumb|Cleaning the ''kalo'', Sandwich Islands, 1852, watercolour by James Gay Sawkins]]\nImportant aspects of [[Hawaiian culture]] revolve around ''kalo'' cultivation and consumption. For example, the newer name for a traditional Hawaiian feast ([[luau]]) comes from the ''kalo''. Young ''kalo'' tops baked with [[coconut milk]] and chicken meat or [[octopus]] arms are frequently served at ''luaus''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}\n\nBy ancient Hawaiian custom, fighting is not allowed when a bowl of ''poi'' is \"open\". Similarly, it is also considered disrespectful to fight in front of an elder and one should not raise their voice, speak angrily, or make rude comments or gestures.\n\n;''Lo\u02bbi''\n[[File:Kalo Loi Harvest.jpg|thumb|left|Several small ''lo\u02bbi'' (pondfields) in which ''kalo'' (taro) is being grown in the [[Maunawili, Hawaii|Maunawili Valley]] on [[Oahu|O\u02bbahu]], Hawai\u02bbi. The ditch on the left in the picture is called an ''\u02bbauwai'' and supplies diverted stream water to the ''lo\u02bbi''.]]\nA ''lo\u02bbi'' is a patch of wetland dedicated to growing ''kalo'' (taro).  Hawaiians have traditionally used water [[irrigation]] systems to produce kalo. Wetland fields produce ten to fifteen times more kalo per acre than dry fields.<ref>Lilikala Kame\u02bbeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 57.</ref>  Wetland-grown kalo need a constant flow of water, and to get this water, fields are usually positioned between the ''mauka'' (mountains) and ''makai'' (sea). A ''lo'i'' specifically denotes wetland kalo growing, not dry land.\n\nThe ''lo\u02bbi'' is part of an ''ahupua\u02bba'', a division of land from the mountain to the sea. Ahupua\u02bba means \"pig altar\", and was named for stone altars with pig head carvings that marked the boundaries of each Hawaiian land division. Ideally, an ahupua\u02bba has all the necessities within its borders. From the mountains, materials such as wood are provided for thatching roofs and twining rope. The uplands produce crops like sugar cane and sweet potatoes, while the lowlands provide taro and fish. This system typically satisfies the large populations in each ''ahupua\u02bba''.<ref>Lilikala Kame\u02bbeleihiwa, ''Hawaii: Center of the Pacific'' (Acton, MA: Copley Custom Textbooks, 2008), 56.</ref>\n\nWhen kalo was brought to Hawai\u02bbi, there were about 300 varieties (about 100 remain). The kalo plant takes seven months to grow until harvest, so ''lo`i'' fields are used in rotation and the soil can be replenished while the ''lo\u02bbi'' in use has sufficient water. The stems are typically replanted in the ''lo`i'' for future kalo harvests. Once harvested, kalo is incorporated into many foods. The leaves are used to make [[laulau]], from the corm poi or ''pa\u02bbi\u02bbai''.\n\n; History\nOne mythological version of Hawaiian ancestry cites the taro plant as an ancestor to Hawaiians. Legend joins the two siblings of high and divine rank: [[Papah\u0101naumoku]] (\"Papa from whom lands are born\", or Earth mother) and [[W\u0101kea]] (Sky father). Together they create the islands of Hawaii and a beautiful woman, Ho\u02bbohokukalani (The Heavenly one who made the stars).<ref>Beckwith, Martha Warren. \"Papa and Wakea.\" ''Hawaiian Mythology''. (Honolulu: University of Hawaii, 1976). 94.</ref>\n\nThe story of kalo begins when Wakea and Papa conceived their daughter, Ho\u02bbohokukalani. Daughter and father then conceived a child together named H\u0101loanakalaukapalili (Long stalk trembling), but it was [[stillborn]]. After the father and daughter buried the child near their house, a kalo plant grew over the grave:<ref>\"A Brief History of Taro in Hawai`i .\" Hawaiian kalo. Bishop Museum, n.d.

Taro from some regions has developed particularly good reputations with (for instance) [[Lae]] taro being highly prized.\n\nAmong the [[Urapmin people]] of Papua New Guinea, taro (known in [[Urap language|Urap]] as ''ima'') is the main source of sustenance along with the [[sweet potato]] (Urap: ''wan''). In fact, the word for \"food\" in Urap is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of these two words.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Joel|year=1995|title=Dispossessing the Spirits: Christian Transformations of Desire and Ecology among the Urapmin of Papua New Guinea quick view|journal=Ethnology|volume=34|issue=3|pages=212\u2013213|ref=harv|doi=10.2307/3773824|jstor=3773824}}</ref>\n\n===== Polynesia =====\nConsidered the staple starch of traditional [[Polynesia]]n cuisine, taro is both a common and prestigious food item that was first introduced to the Polynesian islands by prehistoric seafarers of Southeast Asian derivation. The tuber itself is prepared in various ways, including baking, steaming in [[earth oven]]s (''umu'' or ''imu''), boiling, and frying. The famous Hawaiian staple [[poi (food)|poi]] is made by mashing steamed taro roots with water. Taro also features in traditional desserts such as Samoan ''fa'ausi'', which consists of grated, cooked taro mixed with coconut milk and brown sugar. The leaves of the taro plant also feature prominently in Polynesian cooking, especially as edible wrappings for dishes such as Hawaiian ''[[laulau]]'', Fijian and Samoan ''palusami'' (wrapped around onions and coconut milk), and Tongan ''lupulu'' (wrapped corned beef). Ceremonial presentations on occasion of chiefly rites or communal events (weddings, funerals, etc.) traditionally included the ritual presentation of raw and cooked taro roots/plants.\n\nThe Hawaiian ''laulau'' traditionally contains pork, fish, and ''lu'au'' (cooked taro leaf). The wrapping is inedible ''ti'' leaves (Hawaiian: ''lau ki'').  Cooked taro leaf has the consistency of cooked spinach and is therefore unsuitable for use as a wrapping.\n\n===== Samoa =====\n[[File:Pig on the Samoan Umu.jpg|thumb|Taro corms cooked with pig on the Samoan [[Earth oven|umu]]]]\nIn Samoa, the baby talo leaves and coconut milk are wrapped into parcels and cooked, along with other food, in an earth oven . The parcels are called ''palusami'' or ''lu'au''. The resulting taste is smoky, sweet, savory and has a unique creamy texture. The root is also baked (''Talo tao'') in the [[Earth oven|''umu'']] or boiled with coconut cream (''Fa\u00e1lifu Talo''). It has a slightly bland and starchy flavor. It is sometimes called the Polynesian potato.\n\n===== Tonga =====\n''L\u016b'' is the Tongan word for the edible leaves of the taro plant (called ''talo'' in Tonga), as well as the traditional dish made using them. This meal is still prepared for special occasions and especially on Sunday. The dish consists of chopped meat, onions, and coconut milk wrapped in a number of taro leaves (''l\u016b talo''). This is then wrapped traditionally in a banana leaf (nowadays, aluminum foil is often used) and put in the [[Earth oven|''\u02bbumu'']] to cook. It has a number of named varieties, dependent on the filling:\n* ''L\u016b pulu'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with beef, commonly using imported [[corned beef]] (''kapapulu'')\n* ''L\u016b sipi'' \u2013  ''l\u016b'' with lamb\n* ''L\u016b moa'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with chicken\n* ''L\u016b hoosi'' \u2013 ''l\u016b'' with horse meat\n\n'''Oceanian Atolls'''\n\nThe islands situated along the border of the three main parts of [[Oceania]] ([[Polynesia]], [[Micronesia]] and [[Melanesia]]) are more prone to being atolls rather than volcanic islands (most prominently [[Tuvalu]], [[Tokelau]], and [[Kiribati]]). As a result of this, Taro was not a part of the traditional diet due to the infertile soil and have only become a staple today through importation from other islands (Taro and [[Cassava]] cultivars are usually imported from [[Fiji]] or [[Samoa]]). The traditional staple however is the [[Cyrtosperma merkusii|Swamp Taro]] known as [[Pulaka]] or Babai, a distant relative of the Taro but with a very long growing phase (3-5 years), larger and denser corms and coarser leaves. It is grown in a patch of land dug out to give rise to the freshwater lense beneath the soil. The lengthy growing time of this crop usually confines it  as a food during festivities much like Pork although it can be preserved by drying out in the sun and storing it somewhere cool and dry to be enjoyed out of harvesting season. \n\n====Asia====\n\n=====East Asia=====\n\n======China======\nTaro ({{zh|t=\u828b\u982d|s=\u828b\u5934|p=y\u00f9tou|cy=wuht\u00e1u}}) is commonly used as a main course as steamed taro with or without [[sugar]], as a substitute for other [[cereal]]s, in [[Chinese cuisine]] in a variety of styles and provinces steamed, boiled or stir-fried as a main dish and as a flavor-enhancing ingredient. In Northern China, it is often boiled or steamed then peeled and eaten with or without sugar much like a potato. It is commonly braised with [[pork]] or [[beef]]. It is used in the [[dim sum]] cuisine of southern China to make a small plated dish called [[taro dumpling]] as well as a pan-fried dish called [[taro cake]]. It can also be shredded into long strips which are woven together to form a [[seafood birdsnest]].\n\nTaro cake is a delicacy traditionally eaten during [[Chinese New Year]] celebrations. As a dessert, it can be mashed into a [[Taro pur\u00e9e|pur\u00e9e]] or used as a flavoring in ''[[tong sui]]'', [[ice cream]], and other desserts such as Sweet Taro Pie. McDonald's sells taro-flavored [[pie]]s in China.\n\nTaro is mashed in the dessert known as [[taro pur\u00e9e]].\n\n====== Chaoshan, China ======\n[[File:Teochew_Sweet_Yam_Paste_-_After_Stirring.jpg|thumb|Taro paste, also known as \"Or Nee\", is a famous traditional [[Chaoshan]] dessert from China]]\nTaro paste, a traditional Cantonese cuisine, which originated from the [[Chaoshan]] region in the eastern part of China's [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]] is a dessert made primarily from taro. The taro is steamed and then mashed into a thick paste, which forms the base of the dessert. Lard or fried onion oil is then added for fragrance. The dessert is traditionally sweetened with water chestnut syrup, and served with ginkgo nuts. Modern versions of the dessert include the addition of coconut cream and sweet corn. The dessert is commonly served at traditional Teochew wedding banquet dinners as the last course, marking the end of the banquet.\n\n======Japan======\n[[File:Excavated satoimo (1)-(5).jpg|thumb|Excavated Japanese ''satoimo'' root (stems are cut before the plant is dug up): (1) Remaining stem from parent or seed satoimo, (2) Parent or seed satoimo, (3) Remaining stem from child satoimo, (4) Child satoimo, (5) Grandchild satoimo]]\n[[File:Item 938358.jpg|thumb|Colocasia esculenta from the Japanse agricultural encyclopedia Seikei Zusetsu]]\nA similar plant in Japan is called {{nihongo||\u91cc\u828b\u3001[[:ja:\u30b5\u30c8\u30a4\u30e2|\u30b5\u30c8\u30a4\u30e2]]|satoimo|literally \"village potato\"}}.

Before the [[Taiwan Miracle]] made rice affordable to everyone, taro was one of the main staples in Taiwan. Nowadays taro is used more often in desserts. [[Supermarket]] varieties range from about the size and shape of a [[brussels sprout]] to longer, larger varieties the size of a [[football]]. Taro chips are often used as a potato-chip-like snack. Compared to [[potato chips]], taro chips are harder and have a [[nut (fruit)|nuttier]] flavor. Another popular traditional Taiwanese snack is [[taro ball]], served on ice or deep-fried. It is common to see taro as a flavor in desserts and drinks, such as [[bubble tea]].\n\n=====Southeast Asia=====\n\n======Indonesia======\nin [[Indonesia]] taro widely use for snacks, cakes, cracker even macaroon; can be easily find everywhere; some variety are special cultivated according to social geographical purposes.

Its adaptability to marshland and swamps make it one of the most common vegetables in the Philippines. The leaves, stems, and corms are all consumed and form part of the local cuisine. A popular recipe for taro is ''[[laing (food)|laing]]'' from the [[Bicol Region]]; the dish's main ingredients are taro leaves (at times including stems) cooked in coconut milk, and salted with fermented shrimp or fish ''[[bagoong]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dpinpin/2303024507/in/set-72157604019353752/|title=Laing, gabi|work=Flickr|date=March 2008}}</ref> It is sometimes heavily spiced with red hot chilies called ''[[siling labuyo]]''. Another dish in which taro is commonly used is the Philippine national stew, ''[[sinigang]]'', although radish can be used if taro is not available. This stew is made with pork and beef, shrimp, or fish, a souring agent (tamarind fruit, [[Averrhoa bilimbi|''kamias'']], etc.) with the addition of peeled and diced corms as thickener. The corm is also prepared as a basic ingredient for ''[[ginataan]]'', a coconut milk and taro dessert.\n\n======Thailand======\nIn [[Thai cuisine]], taro {{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e1c\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e01}} (''pheuak'') is used in a variety of ways depending on the region.

One is called ''khoai m\u00f4n,'' which is used as a filling in [[spring roll]]s, cakes, puddings and [[Ch\u00e8|sweet soup desserts]], smoothies and other desserts. Taro is used in the [[T\u1ebft]] dessert ''ch\u00e8 khoai m\u00f4n'', which is sticky rice pudding with taro roots. The stems are also used in soups such as ''[[canh chua]]''. One is called ''khoai s\u1ecd'', which is smaller in size and more delicious than ''Khoai m\u00f4n'', and of course, more expensive than ''khoai m\u00f4n''. Another common taro plant grows roots in shallow waters and grows stems and leaves above the surface of the water. This taro plant has [[saponin]]-like substances that cause a hot, itchy feeling in the mouth and throat. Northern farmers used to plant them to cook the stems and leaves to feed their hogs. They re-grew quickly from their roots. After cooking, the [[saponin]] in the soup of taro stems and leaves is reduced to a level the hogs can eat. Today this practice is no longer popular in Vietnam agriculture. These taro plants are commonly called ''khoai ng\u1ee9a'', which literally means \"itchy potato\".\n\n=====South Asia=====\n\n======Bangladesh======\n[[File:Food-Kochu-Bata.jpg|thumb|left|Kochu bata]]\nIn [[Bangladesh]] taro is a very popular vegetable known as ''kochu'' (\u0995\u099a\u09c1) or ''mukhi'' (\u09ae\u09c1\u0996\u09bf).

Various parts of different types of such plants are eaten by making different dishes. The leaf buds called \"Kosu loti\" (\u0995\u099a\u09c1 \u09b2\u09a4\u09bf) are cooked with sour dried fruits called ''Thekera'' (\u09a5\u09c7\u0995\u09c7\u09f0\u09be) or sometimes with Tamarind or Elephant apple alone or with a small amount of pulses and sometimes, fish. Similar dishes are prepared from the long root-like structures called ''Kosu thuri''. A fried dish with sour objects is also made from its flower (''Kosu kala''). Soupy dishes are made from solid roots which are sometimes also boiled and eaten sometimes with salt as snacks or home-made fast food.\n\nIn [[Manipur]], another north-eastern Indian state, taro is known as ''pan''. The kuki tribes called it ''bal''. Boiled ''bal'' is a snack at lunch along with chutney or hot chili-flakes besides being cooked as a main dish along with smoked or dried meat, beans, and mustard leaves. They also sun-dry the leaves and keep them for future use as broth and hodge-podge.

The leaves are also used in a special traditional dish called ''utti'', cooked with peas.\n\nIn [[Himachal Pradesh]], a northern state in India, the taro root is known as ''ghandyali'', and the plant is known as ''Kachalu'' in [[Kangra & Mandi district]]. The dish called ''patrodu'' is made using taro leaves rolled with corn or gram flour and boiled in water. Another dish, ''pujji'' is made with mashed leaves and the trunk of the plant and ''ghandyali'' or taro roots are prepared as a separate dish. Also in the capital [[Shimla]], a pancake-style dish, called ''[[Patra (dish)|patra]]'' or ''patid'', is made using gram flour.\n\nA tall-growing variety of taro is extensively used on the western coast of India to make ''[[patrode]]'', ''patrade'', or ''patrada'', literally a \"leaf-pancake\". In the [[Dakshin Kannada]] district in the state of [[Karnataka]], it is used as a morning breakfast dish, either made like fritters or steamed. In the state of [[Maharashtra]], the leaves, called ''alu che paana'', are de-veined, rolled with a paste of gram flour, tamarind paste, red chili powder, turmeric, coriander, [[asafoetida]], and salt, and then steamed. These can be eaten whole or cut into pieces, or shallow fried and eaten as a snack known as ''alu chi wadi''. ''Alu chya panan chi patal bhaji'' a lentil and colocasia leaves curry, is also popular. In [[Goan cuisine]] as well as the [[Konkani cuisine]] Taro leaves are very popular.\n\nIn the Indian states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Maharashtra]], the leaves of the plant are used to make [[Patra (dish)|''patra'']] a dish with gram flour, tamarind and other spices.\n\nSindhis call it ''kachaloo''; they fry it, compress it, and re-fry it to make a dish called ''tuk'' which complements [[Sindhi cuisine|Sindhi curry]].\n\nIn [[Kerala]], a state in southern [[India]], taro corms are known as \u0d1a\u0d47\u0d2e\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d4d \u0d15\u0d3f\u0d34\u0d19\u0d4d\u0d19\u0d4d ''chembu-kizhangu''. Taro is used as a [[staple food]], as a side dish, or as an ingredient in various side dishes like [[Sambar (dish)|''sambar'']]. As a staple food, it is steamed and eaten with a spicy [[chutney]] of green chilies, tamarind, and shallots. The leaves and stems of certain varieties of taro are used as a vegetable in Kerala.\n\nIn other Indian states, [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]], taro corms are known as ''sivapan-kizhangu'' (''seppankilangu'' or ''cheppankilangu''), ''chamagadda'', or in coastal Andhra districts as ''chaama dumpa'' in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. It can be cooked in many ways, such as deep-fried in oil for a side item with rice, or cooked in a tangy tamarind sauce with spices, onion, and tomato.\n\nIn the East Indian state of [[West Bengal]], taro roots are thinly sliced and fried to make chips called ''kochu bhaja''. The stem is used to cook a very tasty ''Kochur saag'' with fried hilsha fish head or boiled chhola (chickpea), often eaten as a starter with hot rice. The roots are also made into a paste with spices and eaten with rice. The most popular dish is a spicy [[curry]] made with prawn and taro roots.

Dishes made of taro include ''saru besara'' (taro in mustard and garlic paste). It is also an indispensable ingredient in preparing the heart of [[Odia people|Odia]] cuisine, the ''dalma'', where vegetables are cooked with [[dal]]. Sliced taro roots, deep fried in oil and mixed with red chili powder and salt, are known as ''saru chips''.\n\nIn the north Indian state of [[Uttarakhand]] and neighboring [[Nepal]], taro is considered a healthy food cooked in a variety of ways. The delicate''Gaderi'' taro of Kumaun, especially from the Lobanj region is much sought after. Most commonly it is boiled in tamarind water until tender, then it is diced into cubes which are stir-fried in mustard oil with methi (fenugreek) leaves. Boiling it in salty water in iron cooking pots until it becomes like porridge, is another technique. The young leaves called ''gaaba'', are steamed, then sun-dried and stored for later use. For another use, the taro leaves and stems are used raw as an ingredient for pickles. Crushed leaves and stems are mixed with de-husked urad dal \u2013 black lentils<!--black lentils or urad dal?--> and then dried as small balls called ''badi''. The stems may also be sun-dried and stored for later use. On one special day, women worship ''saptarshi'' (\"seven sages\") and eat only rice with taro leaf vegetable.\n\n====Maldives====\n''Ala'' was widely grown in the southern atolls of [[Addu Atoll]], [[Fuvahmulah]], [[Huvadhu Atoll]], and [[Laamu Atoll]] and is considered a [[staple food|staple]] even after rice was introduced. ''Ala'' and ''olhu ala'' are still widely eaten all over the Maldives, cooked or steamed with salt to taste, and eaten with grated coconut along with chili paste and fish soup.

Taro or ''arvi'' is also cooked with chopped spinach. The dish called ''Arvi Palak'' is the second most renowned dish made of Taro.\n\n====Sri Lanka====\nMany varieties are recorded in Sri Lanka, several being edible, others being toxic to humans and therefore not cultivated. Edible varieties (''kiri ala'', ''kolakana ala'', ''gahala'', and ''sevel ala'') are cultivated for their corms and leaves. Sri Lankans eat corms after boiling them or making them into a curry with coconut milk. The leaves of only two variety, ''kolakana ala'' and '' kalu alakola'' are eaten.\n\n====Middle East and Europe====\nTaro was consumed by the early Romans in much the same way the potato is today. They called this root vegetable ''colocasia''. The Roman cookbook ''[[Apicius]]'' mentions several methods for preparing taro, including boiling, preparing with sauces, and cooking with meat or fowl. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the use of taro dwindled in Europe. This was largely due to the decline of trade and commerce with Egypt, previously controlled by Rome. When the Spanish and Portuguese sailed to the new world, they brought taro along with them. Recently{{When|date=April 2011}} there has been renewed interest in exotic foods and consumption is increasing.\n\n====Cyprus====\nIn [[Cyprus]], taro has been in use since the time of the [[Roman Empire]]. Today it is known as ''kolokas'' in Turkish or ''kolokasi'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9) in Greek, which comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] name \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd (''kolokasion'') for [[lotus root]]. It is usually sauteed with [[celery]] and [[onion]] with pork, [[chicken]] or lamb, in a [[tomato sauce]] \u2013 a vegetarian version is also available. The cormlets are called ''poulles'' (sing. ''poulla''), and they are prepared by first being sauteed, followed by decaramelising the vessel with [[dry wine|dry]] [[red wine]] and [[coriander seed]]s, and finally served with freshly squeezed [[lemon]].\n\n====Egypt====\nIn Egypt, taro is known as ''qolqas'' ({{lang-arz|\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633}}, {{IPA-arz|\u0294ol\u02c8\u0294\u00e6\u02d0s|IPA}}). The corms are larger than what would be found in [[North America]]n supermarkets. After being peeled completely, it is cooked in one of two ways: cut into small cubes and cooked in broth with fresh [[coriander]] and [[chard]] and served as an accompaniment to meat [[stew]], or sliced and cooked with [[Ground meat|minced meat]] and tomato sauce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com/vegetables/colcasia-%D9%82%D9%84%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%B3.html|title=Colcasia \u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633|website=egyptian-cuisine-recipes.com|accessdate=2018-10-19}}</ref>\n\nYouth who perform [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] in Egypt are exposed to the dreaded \"black dish\" ({{lang|arz|\u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u062e\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u062f\u0627}} ''al-\u1e6dabkha al-sawda'') which is a combination of boiled [[eggplant]]s and taro halves, often unpeeled.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Greece====\nIn Greece, taro grows on [[Icaria]]. Icarians credit taro for saving them from famine during [[World War II]]. They boil it until tender and serve it as a [[salad]].\n\n=====Lebanon=====\nIn Lebanon, taro is known as ''kilkass'' and is grown mainly along the Mediterranean coast. The leaves and stems are not consumed in Lebanon and the variety grown produces round to slightly oblong tubers that vary in size from a tennis ball to a small cantaloupe. ''Kilkass'' is a very popular winter dish in Lebanon and is prepared in two ways: ''kilkass'' with lentils is a stew flavored with crushed garlic and lemon juice and ''\u2019il\u2019as'' ([[Lebanese Arabic|Lebanese pronunciation]] of {{linktext|\u0642\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0633|lang=ar}}) ''bi-[[tahini]]''. Another common method of preparing taro is to boil, peel then slice it into {{cvt|1|cm}} thick slices, before frying and marinating in edible \"red\" [[sumac]].\nIn northern Lebanon, it is known as a potato with the name ''borshoushi'' (''el-orse borshushi''). It is also prepared as part of a lentil soup with crushed garlic and lemon juice. Also in the north, it is known by the name ''bouzmet'', mainly around [[Miniyeh|Menieh]], where it is first peeled, and left to dry in the sun for a couple of days. After that, it is stir-fried in lots of vegetable oil in a casserole until golden brown, then a large amount of wedged, melted onions are added, in addition to water, chickpeas and some seasoning. These are all left to simmer for a few hours, and the result is a stew-like dish. It is considered a hard-to-make delicacy, not only because of the tedious preparation but the consistency and flavour that the taro must reach. The smaller variety of taro is more popular in the north due to its tenderness.\n\n=====Portugal=====\nIn the [[Azores]] taro is known as ''inhame'' or ''inhame-coco'' and is commonly steamed with potatoes, [[vegetable]]s and [[meat]]s or [[fish]]. The leaves are sometimes cooked into soups and stews. It is also consumed as a [[dessert]] after first being steamed and peeled, then fried in [[vegetable oil]] or [[lard]], and finally sprinkled with [[sugar]], [[cinnamon]] and [[nutmeg]]. Taro grows abundantly in the fertile land of the Azores, as well as in creeks that are fed by mineral springs. Through migration to other countries, the ''inhame'' is found in the Azorean diaspora.\n\n=====Spain=====\nTaro root is consumed in the south of Spain. Taro has remained popular in the [[Canary Islands]]. In the Canary Islands it is known as ''\u00f1ame'' and is often used in thick vegetable stews, like ''potaje de berros'' (cress [[potage]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.culturatradicionalgc.org/Gastronomia-Tradicional/Primer-Plato/Potaje-de-Berros.html |title=Potaje de Berros  |website=culturatradicionalgc.org |access-date=2018-10-19}}</ref>  Taro is called ''\u00f1ame'' (which normally designates [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]]) in [[Spanish language|Canarian Spanish]] and is a common crop in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands (Canary Islands, Spain).\n\n=====Turkey=====\nTaro ({{lang-tr|g\u00f6levez}}) is grown in the south coast of [[Turkey]], especially in [[Mersin]], [[Bozyaz\u0131]], [[Anamur]] and [[Antalya]]. It is boiled in a [[tomato sauce]] or cooked with meat, beans and [[chickpea]]s. It is often used as a substitute for [[potato]].\n\n====Africa====\n\n=====East Africa=====\n[[File:Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix.JPG|thumb|Njahi, Nduma, Chapati, Kachumbari, chicken - an average Kikuyu party mix]]\nIn [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanzania]], taro is commonly known as ''arrow root'', ''ggobe'', or ''nduma'' and ''madhumbe'' in some local [[Bantu languages]]. It is usually boiled and eaten with [[tea]] or other beverages, or as the main [[starch]] of a meal. It is also cultivated in [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Zimbabwe]].\n\n=====South Africa=====\nIt is known as ''amadumbe'' (plural) or ''idumbe'' (singular) in the Zulu language of Southern Africa.\n\n=====West Africa=====\n[[File:Pileuse de taro.jpg|thumb|left|Preparing taro in Cameroon]]\nTaro is consumed as a [[staple crop]] in [[West Africa]], particularly in [[Ghana]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Cameroon]].  It is called ''cocoyam'' in Nigeria, Ghana and Anglophone Cameroon, ''[[macabo]]'' in [[Francophone Cameroon]], and ''ede'' in [[Igbo language]]. ''Cocoyam'' is often boiled, fried, or roasted and eaten with a sauce. In Ghana, it substitutes for [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] in making ''[[fufu]]'' when plantains are out of season. It is also cut into small pieces to make a soupy baby food and appetizer called ''mpotompoto''. It is also common in Ghana to find ''cocoyam chips'' (deep-fried slices, about {{cvt|1|mm}} thick). ''Cocoyam'' leaves, locally called ''kontomire'' in Ghana, are a popular vegetable for local sauces such as [[palaver sauce]] and [[egusi]]/agushi stew.<ref>ghanaian cuisine</ref> It is also commonly consumed in Guinea and parts of Senegal, as a leaf sauce or as a vegetable side, and is referred to as ''jaabere'' in the local [[Pulaar]] dialect.\n\n====Americas====\n\n=====Brazil=====\nIn [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|Lusophone countries]], ''inhame'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|\u0129&thinsp;\u02c8&thinsp;\u0237\u0303\u0250\u0303mi|}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02c8&thinsp;\u0237\u0303\u0250\u0303mi|}} or {{IPA-pt|\u0129\u02d1\u02c8\u0272\u0250\u0303mi|}}, literally \"[[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]\") and ''car\u00e1'' are the common names for various plants with edible parts of the genera ''[[Alocasia]]'', ''[[Colocasia]]'' (family [[Araceae]]) and ''[[Dioscorea]]'' (family [[Dioscoreaceae]]), and its respective starchy edible parts, generally [[tuber]]s, with the exception of ''[[Dioscorea bulbifera]]'', called ''car\u00e1-moela'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|k\u0250\u02c8\u027ea mu\u02c8\u025bl\u0250|}}, literally, \"[[gizzard]] yam\"), in Brazil and never deemed to be an ''inhame''. Definitions of what constitutes an ''inhame'' and a ''car\u00e1'' vary regionally, but the common understanding in [[Brazil]] is that ''car\u00e1s'' are potato-like in shape, while ''inhames'' are more oblong.\n\nIn the [[Brazilian Portuguese]] of the hotter and drier [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern region]], both ''inhames'' and ''car\u00e1s'' are called ''batata'' (literally, \"potato\"). For differentiation, potatoes are called ''batata-inglesa'' (literally, \"English potato\"), a name used in other regions and [[sociolect]]s to differentiate it from the ''batata-doce'', \"[[sweet potato]]\", ironic names since both were first cultivated by the indigenous peoples of [[South America]], their native continent, and only later [[Columbian Exchange|introduced in Europe]] by the colonizers.\n\nTaros are often prepared like potatoes, eaten boiled, stewed or mashed, generally with salt and sometimes [[garlic]] as a condiment, as part of a meal (most often lunch or dinner).\n\n=====Central America=====\nIn [[Belize]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Panama]], taro is eaten in [[soup]]s, as a replacement for potatoes, and as chips. It is known locally as ''malanga'' (also ''malanga coco'') and ''dasheen'' in Belize and Costa Rica, ''quiquizque'' in Nicaragua, and as ''otoe'' in Panama.\n\n=====Haiti=====\nIn [[Haiti]], it is usually called ''malanga'', or ''taro''. The corm is grated into a paste and deep-fried to make a fritter called ''Acra''. ''Acra'' is a very popular street food in Haiti.\n\n=====Jamaica=====\nIn [[Jamaica]], taro is known as ''coco'', ''[[cocoyam]]'' and ''dasheen''. Corms with flesh which is white throughout are referred to as ''minty-coco''. The leaves are also used to make Pepper Pot Soup which may include [[callaloo]].\n\n=====Suriname=====\nIn [[Suriname]] it is called ''tayer'', ''taya'', ''pomtayer'' or ''pongtaya''. The taro root is called ''aroei'' by the native Indians and is commonly known as \"Chinese ''tayer''\". The variety known as ''eddoe'' is also called Chinese ''tayer''. It is a popular cultivar among the maroon population in the interior, also because it is not adversely affected by high water levels. The ''dasheen'' variety, commonly planted in swamps, is rare, although appreciated for its taste. The closely related ''Xanthosoma'' species is the base for the popular Surinamese dish, [[Pom (dish)|pom]].\n\n=====Trinidad and Tobago=====\nIn [[Trinidad and Tobago]], it is called ''dasheen''. The leaves of the taro plant are used to make the Trinidadian variant of the Caribbean dish known as [[callaloo]] (which is made with okra, ''dasheen''/taro leaves, coconut milk or creme and aromatic herbs) and it is also prepared similarly to steamed spinach. The root of the taro plant is often served boiled, accompanied by stewed fish or meat, curried, often with peas and eaten with roti, or in soups.\n\n=====United States=====\n[[File:Taro sticks for sale.jpg|thumb|Taro leaf-stems ([[Petiole (botany)|petioless]]) for sale at a market in California, 2009]]\nIn American [[Chinatown]]s, people often use taro in [[Chinese cuisine]], though it is not as popular as in [[Asia]]n and [[Oceania|Pacific nations]]. Since the late 20th century, taro chips have been available in many supermarkets and natural food stores. In the 1920s, ''dasheen''{{refn|group=nb|The word ''dasheen'' originated in [[Trinidad]] and is said to be a corruption of ''de la Chine'' or ''da Chine'', i.e. ''taro de la Chine''.<ref name=\"Young\">Robert A.

It was used in place of potatoes and dried to make flour. ''Dasheen'' flour was said to make excellent pancakes when mixed with wheat flour.\n\n=====Venezuela=====\n[[File:Sopa de Gallina.JPG|thumb|left|Chopped taro for preparing [[sopa de gallina]]]]\nIn Venezuela, taro is called ''ocumo chino'' or ''chino'' and used in soups and ''[[sancocho]]s''. Soups contain large chunks of several kinds of tubers, including ''ocumo chino'', especially in the eastern part of the country, where West Indian influence is present. It is also used to accompany meats in ''parrillas'' (barbecue) or fried cured fish where [[Cassava|yuca]] is not available. ''Ocumo'' is an indigenous name; ''chino'' means \"Chinese\", an adjective for produce that is considered exotic. ''Ocumo'' without the Chinese denomination is a tuber from the same family, but without taro's inside purplish color. ''Ocumo'' is the Venezuelan name for [[Xanthosoma|malanga]], so ''ocumo chino'' means \"Chinese malanga\". Taro is always prepared boiled. No porridge form is known in the local cuisine.\n\n=====West Indies=====\nTaro is called ''dasheen'',<ref name=\"Young\" /> in contrast to the smaller variety of corms called ''[[Eddoe|eddo]]'', or ''tanya'' in the English speaking countries of the [[West Indies]], and is cultivated and consumed as a staple crop in the region. There are differences among the roots mentioned above: taro or ''dasheen'' is mostly blue when cooked, ''tanya'' is white and very dry, and ''eddoes'' are small and very slimy.\n\nIn the Spanish-speaking countries of the [[Spanish West Indies]] taro is called ''\u00f1ame'', the Portuguese variant of which (''inhame'') is used in former Portuguese colonies where taro is still cultivated, including the [[Azores]] and [[Brazil]].  In [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]], and the Dominican Republic it is sometimes called ''malanga'' or ''yautia''.  In some countries, such as [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], and [[Dominica]], the leaves and stem of the ''dasheen'', or taro, are most often cooked and pureed into a thick liquid called [[callaloo]], which is served as a side dish similar to creamed spinach. ''Callaloo'' is sometimes prepared with [[crab]] legs, coconut milk, pumpkin, and okra. It is usually served alongside rice or made into a soup along with various other roots.\n\n=== Ornamental ===\nIt is also sold as an ornamental [[aquatic plant]].\n\n=== Laboratory ===\nIt is also used for [[anthocyanin]] study experiments especially with reference to abaxial and adaxial anthocyanic concentration.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Nicole M|last2=Carpenter|first2=Kaylyn L|last3=Keidel|first3=Timothy S|last4=Miller|first4=Charlene N|last5=Waters|first5=Matthew N|last6=Smith|first6=William K|year=2014|title=Photosynthetic costs and benefits of abaxial versus adaxial anthocyanins in Colocasia esculenta 'Mojito'|journal=Planta|volume=240|issue=5|pages=971\u2013981|doi=10.1007/s00425-014-2090-6|pmid=24903360}}</ref> A recent study has revealed a honeycomb like micro-structures on the taro leaf, which makes the leaf superhydrophobic.

The main change was the engine; the 4/44 used a pre BMC Morris XPA unit and after the [[MG T-type#TF and TF 1500|MG TF]] stopped production it was the only car still fitted with it.  To rationalise production the 15/50 was launched with the BMC B-series engine fitted.  Much of the design was shared with the [[MG Magnette]], although some of the panels of the MG Magnette ZA/ZB (e.g. the [[boot]] and rear wings) are not interchangeable with those of the Wolseley 15/50, as stated in [[Practical Classics]].\n\nUnlike the MG, the 15/50 engine had only a single [[SU carburettor]] so the power output was slightly less at {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm.<ref name=Motor1957/> Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a \"Manumatic\" two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require [[double declutching]], difficult.<ref name=Motor1957/>\n\nThe construction was [[monocoque]] with independent suspension at the front by coil springs and a live rear axle with semi elliptic leaf springs. The steering was rack and pinion and Lockheed brakes were fitted with {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}} drums all round<ref name=Motor1957/>\n\nIn keeping with the up-market positioning of the Wolseley brand the car had upmarket trim with polished walnut dashboard and door cappings and leather seats and a traditional Wolseley radiator grille with illuminated badge. The individual front seats were placed very closely together to allow the car to be used as a six-seater albeit marginal but it was usually sold as a four seater. The handbrake lever was under the dash.

The main change was the engine; the 4/44 used a pre BMC Morris XPA unit and after the [[MG T-type#TF and TF 1500|MG TF]] stopped production it was the only car still fitted with it.  To rationalise production the 15/50 was launched with the BMC B-series engine fitted.  Much of the design was shared with the [[MG Magnette]], although some of the panels of the MG Magnette ZA/ZB (e.g. the [[boot]] and rear wings) are not interchangeable with those of the Wolseley 15/50, as stated in [[Practical Classics]].\n\nUnlike the MG, the 15/50 engine had only a single [[SU carburettor]] so the power output was slightly less at {{convert|55|bhp|abbr=on}} at 4400 rpm.<ref name=Motor1957/> Unlike the 4/44, the 15/50 had a floor gear change. From 1956 a \"Manumatic\" two pedal (centrifugal clutch) transmission was an option. This was controlled by a micro switch hidden in the gear lever operating a vacuum servo. Having no synchromesh on bottom gear could make changes into the lowest ratio, which would normally require [[double declutching]], difficult.<ref name=Motor1957/>\n\nThe construction was [[monocoque]] with independent suspension at the front by coil springs and a live rear axle with semi elliptic leaf springs. The steering was rack and pinion and Lockheed brakes were fitted with {{convert|9|in|mm|abbr=on}} drums all round<ref name=Motor1957/>\n\nIn keeping with the up-market positioning of the Wolseley brand the car had upmarket trim with polished walnut dashboard and door cappings and leather seats and a traditional Wolseley radiator grille with illuminated badge. The individual front seats were placed very closely together to allow the car to be used as a six seater albeit marginal but it was usually sold as a four seater. The handbrake lever was under the dash. A heater was fitted as standard.\n\n==Performance==\nAn example with Manumatic transmission tested by the British ''The Motor'' magazine in 1957 had a top speed of {{convert|77.9|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in 26.7 seconds.

The line halved the travel time between Paris and Strasbourg and provides fast services between Paris and the principal cities of eastern France as well as [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], and [[Switzerland]]. The LGV Est is a segment of the [[Main line for Europe]] project to connect Paris with Budapest with high-speed rail service.\n\nThe line was built in two phases. Construction on the {{convert|300|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} from [[Vaires-sur-Marne]] to [[Baudrecourt, Moselle|Baudrecourt]] (near [[Metz]] and [[Nancy, France|Nancy]]) began in 2004; the first phase entered into service in June 2007. Construction on the {{convert|106|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} second phase from Baudrecourt to Vendenheim began in June 2010; the second phase opened to commercial service on 3 July 2016. Opening of the second phase was delayed after a train [[Eckwersheim derailment|derailed near Eckwersheim]] during commissioning trials, resulting in 11 deaths.\n\n[[Project V150 (High Speed Train) - France|A specially modified train]] performed a series of high-speed tests on the first phase of the LGV Est prior to its opening. In April 2007, [[Eric Pieczak|it reached]] a top speed of 574.8&nbsp;km/h (159.6&nbsp;m/s, 357.2&nbsp;mph), becoming the [[Land speed record for rail vehicles|fastest conventional train]] and fastest train on a national rail system (as opposed to dedicated test track).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Matsuda|first1=Kiyotaka|title=World\u2019s Fastest Train Records Speed of 375 Miles Per Hour|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-21/world-s-fastest-train-records-speed-of-603-kilometers-per-hour|accessdate=2 July 2016|work=Bloomberg|date=20 April 2015|quote=The speed record for a train running on a national railway system, rather than a test track, remains in the hands of conventional rail, with a modified version of an Alstom SA TGV model reaching 575 kmph in France in 2007.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fastest train on a national rail system|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/fastest-train-on-a-national-rail-system|publisher=Guinness World Records|accessdate=2 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Route==\nThe line passes through the French regions of [[\u00cele-de-France]] and [[Grand Est]].

In 1982, recognizing German reluctance to extend the line into Germany, SNCF president Andr\u00e9 Chadeau announced that the company would not build the LGV Est without government subsidies.<ref name=\"Felten\"/>{{Rp|58}} The following year, [[Saverne]] engineer Charles Maetz convinced [[National Assembly (France)|MPs]] [[Adrien Zeller]] and Fran\u00e7ois Grussenmeyer to establish the ''East European TGV Association'' ({{lang-fr|l'Association TGV Est-Europ\u00e9en}}), which managed to bring together local authorities to support the project.<ref name=\"Schontz\"/>\n\nThe LGV Est is a direct result of a project begun in 1985 with the establishment of a working group chaired by Claude Rattier and later by Philippe Essig.

This route, further north than previous proposals, served Reims and Strasbourg. In order to avoid offending the cities of Nancy and Metz, which share an ancient rivalry, and avoid problems encountered during the construction of the A4 autoroute twenty years earlier, this route traveled directly to Strasbourg and passed midway between Nancy and Metz, where [[Gare de Lorraine TGV|a single station]] would be built to serve both towns and improve relations between them.{{citation needed|reason=Translated from the French Wikipedia, which has no inline citation for the content of this paragraph|date=July 2016}}\n\nFinancing of this proposal called for contributions from local governments\u2014a first in France for construction of a high-speed line\u2014and the [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]]. This was a favorable financial arrangement for SNCF due to low ridership projections and because the population of the towns served were below a threshold for building a high-speed line. The complexity of financing resulted in the long delay of the project. Under the government of [[Pierre Beregovoy]] (French Prime Minister from 1992-1993), the government refused to contribute more than 25&nbsp;billion [[French franc|francs]] to the project, and limited the route to Baudrecourt, to which the Alsace region threatened to withdraw its financial contribution to the project.

The contractors took three years to complete the earthworks and some 327 pieces of structural work as well as re-establishing communications for people and wildlife. Tracklaying and building the new stations started in 2004.\n\nAs the first infrastructure project of its kind to be [[D\u00e9claration d'utilit\u00e9 publique|declared a public utility]] by the Ministry of the Environment, the LGV Est is also the first railway to be financed largely by the French regions and the [[European Union]] (EU). The main contractor for the project is RFF ([[R\u00e9seau ferr\u00e9 de France]]), the state-owned company responsible for managing the French rail infrastructure.\n\nCivil engineering works were distributed in eight contracts which were awarded after bidding by five companies: [[SNCF]], [[Ing\u00e9rop|ISL]], [[Tractebel Engineering|Tractebel]], [[Egis Group|Sc\u00e9tauroute]] and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes techniques et \u00e9conomiques|Setec]]. This is the first time there has been competition for the construction of a [[TGV]] line since reform of the rail system in 1997 and the involvement of RFF. [[SNCF]] Engineering, in partnership with [[EEG Simecsol]] succeeded in obtaining four of the contracts (including one for the second phase), this being 50% of the civil engineering project. Moreover, it directed the entire superstructure works project (track, [[railway signalling|signals]] and electrification) under the responsibility of [[R\u00e9seau Ferr\u00e9 de France]].\n\n[[File:LGV Est-en with legend.svg|thumb|Illustration of the alignment of the second phase of the LGV Est.]]\nOn 9 June 2007, the TGV Est made its inaugural voyage, leaving from the Gare de l'Est at 7:36am. Notable passengers included: [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]], the French Prime Minister, [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]], the Minister of Sustainable Development, and the Argentinian Ambassador to France. The Prime Minister hailed this event as \"a beautiful symbol of the capacity of our country to innovate when it is united, a symbol of European [[France]], of the knowledge of French businesses, and a symbol that gives confidence in the future.\" He hailed this achievement as \"a union by train between [[France]] and its [[Germany|German]], [[Luxembourgish]], and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] partners, between the [[Europe]]an institutions and the [French] capital.\"\n\n====Phase two====\nOn 2 September 2009, infrastructure manager RFF announced the tendering for the second phase.

All passengers should change at this small station into a substitute IC arrived from Frankfurt; its passengers, on the other hand, should transfer to the turning ICE. As a result of several faulty ICE units, some intermittent ICE journeys completely failed or were replaced by TGV trains in the same week; On June 13, 2008, the DB then restricted the continuous traffic on the POS Northast for the time being from five to three connections. The remaining rides were broken: TGV operated Paris-Saarbr\u00fccken and back; IC Saarbr\u00fccken-Frankfurt and back. Only two of the six existing ICE trainsets were needed. From 19 June 2008, the trains went through again, but some courses were still served by TGV. These can not turn in Mannheim and must drive over K\u00e4fertal, which leads to small delays.\n*On the afternoon of 8 July 2008, ICE 9555 Paris-Frankfurt collided in the area of the Kennelgarten station near Kaiserslautern with a truck that had been stuck in the gravel while turning in a construction site. The approximately 400 passengers of the ICE remained unhurt, but six of the eight cars of the ICE were damaged. The train could later continue with its own strength to Kaiserslautern, where the passengers had to change to a replacement train.\n*In July 2008, there were again numerous ICE failures; from July 21 to August 23, 2008, TGV units regularly helped with one full-round journey. Nevertheless, passengers often had to change trains in or from Saarbr\u00fccken, Homburg / Saar or Forbach (F) to or from TGV trains, or in some cases were not carried as a result of a lack of vehicles.

This was a favorable financial arrangement for SNCF due to low ridership projections and because the population of the towns served were below a threshold for building a high-speed line. The complexity of financing resulted in the long delay of the project. Under the government of [[Pierre Beregovoy]] (French Prime Minister from 1992-1993), the government refused to contribute more than 25&nbsp;billion [[French franc|francs]] to the project, and limited the route to Baudrecourt, to which the Alsace region threatened to withdraw its financial contribution to the project.

The contractors took three years to complete the earthworks and some 327 pieces of structural work as well as re-establishing communications for people and wildlife. Tracklaying and building the new stations started in 2004.\n\nAs the first infrastructure project of its kind to be [[D\u00e9claration d'utilit\u00e9 publique|declared a public utility]] by the Ministry of the Environment, the LGV Est is also the first railway to be financed largely by the French regions and the [[European Union]] (EU). The main contractor for the project is RFF ([[R\u00e9seau ferr\u00e9 de France]]), the state-owned company responsible for managing the French rail infrastructure.\n\nCivil engineering works were distributed in eight contracts which were awarded after bidding by five companies: [[SNCF]], [[Ing\u00e9rop|ISL]], [[Tractebel Engineering|Tractebel]], [[Egis Group|Sc\u00e9tauroute]] and [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9tudes techniques et \u00e9conomiques|Setec]]. This is the first time there has been competition for the construction of a [[TGV]] line since reform of the rail system in 1997 and the involvement of RFF. [[SNCF]] Engineering, in partnership with [[EEG Simecsol]] succeeded in obtaining four of the contracts (including one for the second phase), this being 50% of the civil engineering project. Moreover, it directed the entire superstructure works project (track, [[railway signalling|signals]] and electrification) under the responsibility of [[R\u00e9seau Ferr\u00e9 de France]].\n\n[[File:LGV Est-en with legend.svg|thumb|Illustration of the alignment of the second phase of the LGV Est.]]\nOn 9 June 2007, the TGV Est made its inaugural voyage, leaving from the Gare de l'Est at 7:36am. Notable passengers included: [[Fran\u00e7ois Fillon]], the French Prime Minister, [[Alain Jupp\u00e9]], the Minister of Sustainable Development, and the Argentinian Ambassador to France. The Prime Minister hailed this event as \"a beautiful symbol of the capacity of our country to innovate when it is united, a symbol of European [[France]], of the knowledge of French businesses, and a symbol that gives confidence in the future.\" He hailed this achievement as \"a union by train between [[France]] and its [[Germany|German]], [[Luxembourgish]], and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] partners, between the [[Europe]]an institutions and the [French] capital.\"\n\n====Phase two====\nOn 2 September 2009, infrastructure manager RFF announced the tendering for the second phase.

All passengers should change at this small station into a substitute IC arrived from Frankfurt; its passengers, on the other hand, should transfer to the turning ICE. As a result of several faulty ICE units, some intermittent ICE journeys completely failed or were replaced by TGV trains in the same week; On June 13, 2008, the DB then restricted the continuous traffic on the POS Northast for the time being from five to three connections. The remaining rides were broken: TGV operated Paris-Saarbr\u00fccken and back; IC Saarbr\u00fccken-Frankfurt and back. Only two of the six existing ICE trainsets were needed. From 19 June 2008, the trains went through again, but some courses were still served by TGV. These can not turn in Mannheim and must drive over K\u00e4fertal, which leads to small delays.\n*On the afternoon of 8 July 2008, ICE 9555 Paris-Frankfurt collided in the area of the Kennelgarten station near Kaiserslautern with a truck that had been stuck in the gravel while turning in a construction site. The approximately 400 passengers of the ICE remained unhurt, but six of the eight cars of the ICE were damaged. The train could later continue with its own strength to Kaiserslautern, where the passengers had to change to a replacement train.\n*In July 2008, there were again numerous ICE failures; from July 21 to August 23, 2008, TGV units regularly helped with one full-round journey. Nevertheless, passengers often had to change trains in or from Saarbr\u00fccken, Homburg / Saar or Forbach (F) to or from TGV trains, or in some cases were not carried as a result of a lack of vehicles. Also in the course of autumn and in the winter of 2008/2009 the ICE disturbances continued; there were always TGV replacement services and / or breaking the connection in Saarbr\u00fccken Hbf.\n*On November 14, 2015, the [[Eckwersheim derailment|TGV accident in Eckwersheim]] caused the most severe accident with a TGV. During a test drive a train derailed due to excessive speed in a curve and partially crashed into the Rhine-Marne Canal. 11 people died, 42 others were injured, 12 of them seriously.\n\n==See also==\n* [[TGV]]\n* [[High-speed rail in France]]\n* [[Intercity Express]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|LGV Est europ\u00e9enne|LGV Est}}\n*[http://www.lgv-est.com/presentation.php?pg=341 LGV Est : key project steps & construction progress]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928071912/http://www.tgvesteuropeen.com/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=77 LGV Est webpage]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070318074508/http://www.essaisrff.com/ LGV Est Tests and preparations]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.pleinsfeuxsurlalgv.com Site for the grand opening on 15 March]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://intermodalite.com/news/renovtgv/ Interior design proposal, Christian Lacroix's having been adopted]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://en.locotrain.com/events/tgvest/ Special search engine]\n*[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/lgv_est/ LGV Est Information and Pictures]\n*{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.accident-tgv.com/ A website for the 11 victims of the LGV Est derailment, detailed information about the investigations]\n\n{{TGV navbox}}\n{{High-speed railway lines}}\n{{Magistrale for Europe}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lgv Est}}\n[[Category:High-speed railway lines in France|Est]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 2007]]\n[[Category:Railway lines in Grand Est]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: north-south \u2192 north\u2013south, 1970-71 \u2192 1970\u201371 (2)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGV_Est"}

Fried eggs are traditionally eaten for [[breakfast]] in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.\n\n== Regional adaptations and specialities ==\n\n=== Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ===\n[[File:pecena jaja1.jpg|thumb|right|Fried eggs served with [[Vegeta (food)|Vegeta spice]] in [[Croatia]]]]\n\nFried eggs (''{{lang|de|Spiegeleier}}'') are a crucial part of such traditional German dishes as ''{{lang|de|[[Strammer Max]]}}'' (the egg is fried on one side with an unbroken yolk, and served \"sunny side up\" atop an open ham sandwich) or ''{{lang|de|Hamburger Schnitzel}}'' / ''{{lang|de|Holsteiner Schnitzel}}'' / ''Fernfahrerschnitzel'' (\"trucker's schnitzel\") \u2013 a similarly prepared fried egg served on a ''{{lang|de|[[Wiener Schnitzel]]}}''.\n\nFried eggs over (or side-by-side with) pan-fried potatoes is another common dish, sometimes served with spinach as a third component of the meal. Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the [[Egg white|white]] during the frying.\n\nAll of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or [[scrambled eggs]]) are a common part of a German breakfast.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nFried egg prepared sunny side up is known as \"''volsk\u00e9 oko''\" or \"''buli\u010d\u00ed oko''\" (bull's eye) in [[Czech cuisine]] and they are served either alone as part of breakfast, or for lunch with side of spinach and boiled potatoes.\n\n=== Egypt ===\nIn [[Egypt]], fried eggs are a common breakfast food. They are fried in fat such as [[vegetable oil]], [[butter]] or [[ghee]] and served either plain or with other foodstuffs such as [[tomato]]es, cheese, sausage or [[Ground meat|minced meat]] with onions and spices; they may also be served with [[ful medames]] (slow-cooked [[fava bean]]s).\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], fried eggs are commonly served alone or as an accompaniment to bread. It may also occasionally be served with [[dosa]], [[paratha]], or [[roti]]. During or after the frying stage, they are sometimes sprinkled lightly with condiments such as [[black pepper]], [[chili powder]], [[Chili pepper|green chili]], and salt.\n\nA fried egg is commonly referred to as a \"poached egg\" in Indian English. In central and northern India's English-speaking middle classes and mid-level restaurants, \"single-fried\" refers to sunny side up (also known as a \"bullseye\") and \"double-fried\" to over hard. Street food parlance uses \"half-fry\" as a base term with \"half fry bina palti\" (un-flipped) meaning sunny side up and \"half fry palti maarke\" or \"alti palti\" (flipped) meaning over easy/medium/hard where the customer oversees the flip and says when.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 1.JPG|thumb|''[[Mi Goreng]]'' noodle served with fried egg and vegetables.]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], fried eggs are served either as ''telur ceplok'' or ''telur mata sapi'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for \"bull's eye egg\") which refer to sunny side up eggs, as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]) or as ''telur orak-arik'' (scrambled eggs). The fried eggs are either ''setengah matang'' which is half cooked with still runny yolk or ''matang'' which is well done. Fried eggs, especially as bull's eye egg, is a popular toppings for Indonesian fried rice (''[[nasi goreng]]'') and fried noodle (''[[mie goreng]]''), either freshly prepared noodle or cooked from [[instant noodle]] [[Indomie Mi goreng]]. A simple dish of fried sunny side up egg, served on top of steamed rice drizzled with ''[[kecap manis]]'' sweet soy sauce, is a favourite dish among Indonesian children.

A common way of preparing both types is to have multiple eggs cracked into a saucepan or frying pan and cooked without flipping. The whites flow together and individual portions are divided up after the whole pan-full has cooked.\n\n=== Southeast Asia ===\n[[File:Yam khai dao.JPG|thumb|right|''Yam khai dao'': A spicy and sour [[Thai salad]] made with crispy fried eggs]]\n[[File:Spam Meal.jpg|thumb|right|Fried [[Spam (food)|Spam]] with rice and eggs is a common meal in the Philippines]]\n[[Nasi goreng]], one of the most popular dishes in [[Cuisine of Brunei|Brunei]], [[Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]], and [[Cuisine of Singapore|Singapore]] is often served with a fried egg.\n\nIn the [[Cuisine of the Philippines|Philippines]], fried eggs are often cooked like a sunny-side egg but the yolk is half cooked - referred to as malasado (from the Spanish, meaning undercooked) - by sprinkling it with salt and oil while being fried, giving it a distinctive pink-colored membrane. It is served in the morning with garlic rice and a choice of breakfast meat such as beef [[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|''tapa'']], [[Longaniza#Philippines|longaniza]], fried milkfish, dried fish, ''[[tocino]]'' (caramelised pork), [[Spam (food)|Spam]], or [[corned beef]], such as in [[tapsilog]] and its variants.  In addition, fried eggs are eaten in a dish called [[Arroz a la cubana]], which is seasoned ground beef with raisins, cubed potatoes, tomato sauce, and olives, along with white rice and fried ripe plantains. Fried eggs are also a main ingredient in the noodle dish Pancit Batil Patong, where a fried egg is topped over stir-fried noodles.\n\nIn [[Thai cuisine]], when the words ''{{lang|th-Latn|khai dao}}'' (lit. \"star egg\") are placed after the name of a dish, it means that one wants that dish accompanied by a fried egg.

Fried eggs are also sometimes used in a [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]] [[Banh Mi|breakfast roll]].\n=== United States ===\n[[File:Ham and eggs over easy.jpg|thumb|[[Ham and eggs]] served with fried eggs prepared \"sunny side up\"]]\nAmericans use different terms to describe the degree and method to which fried eggs are cooked, including:\n\n; over easy ''or'' over light \n: Cooked on both sides; the yolk is runny and the egg white is fully cooked.\n; over medium\n: Cooked on both sides; the yolk is cooked through but soft and near liquid at the center. The egg white is thoroughly cooked.\n; over hard ''or'' over well\n: Cooked on both sides all the way through, with the yolk intact.\n; sunny side up\n: Cooked on one side only, until the egg white is set, but the yolk remains liquid. This is often known simply as ''eggs up''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Gently splashing the hot cooking oil or fat over the sunny side uncooked white (i.e., [[Basting (cooking)|basting]]) may be done to thoroughly cook the white. Covering the frying pan with a lid during cooking (optionally adding a cover and half-teaspoon of water just before finishing) allows for a less \"runny\" egg, and is an alternative method to flipping for cooking an egg over easy (this is occasionally called ''sunny side down'' or ''basted''). Sunny side up eggs are also commonly referred to as ''dippy eggs'' or ''dip eggs'' by [[Maryland]]ers, by [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] people living in central [[Pennsylvania]], in parts of [[Ohio]], and in [[Pittsburgh]] mainly due to the practice of dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also occasionally used in Canada.\n\n== Egg in the basket ==\n[[File:Making eggs in basket.jpg|thumb|right|Eggs in the basket]]\n<!-- This section can be clarified as \"a description of the 'egg in a basket' organized around how it is made.\" -->\n{{Main|Egg in the basket}}\n\nThis dish is usually made by cutting a circle or other shape out of a slice of bread, often using a drinking glass or biscuit cutter.  The bread is fried until brown on one side and then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with [[edible salt|salt]] and [[black pepper|pepper]], and sometimes [[herb]]s. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set.  The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well, and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n*[[Egg sandwich]]\n*[[List of egg dishes]]\n*''[[Green Eggs and Ham]]''\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Cookbook-inline|Fried Eggs}}\n* {{Commons category-inline|Fried eggs}}\n\n{{Eggs}}\n\n[[Category:Egg dishes]]\n[[Category:Fried foods]]\n", "name_user": "Caseywilliams891", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_egg"}
