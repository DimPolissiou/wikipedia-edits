PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America.{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concering colonial representaion in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of [[Boston Tea Party|tea in Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] led to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n                                           \nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by Washington and [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis's army]], and he surrendered in October 1781.\n                                           \n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America (although Britain continued to war against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean, and India). On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n            \n=== Taxation disputes ===\nParliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and to recoup costs of the war itself. The colonists resented being forced to pay for a war in which they had sacrificed many lives. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their own jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the British Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, and paper\u2014items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain\u2014and this established the precedent that Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended\u2014all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The British seized the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling, and this triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England. Tensions rose after the murder of 11 year-old [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770, and escalated into further outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Many of the colonists suspected that the incident was intentionally provoked and used as a pretext by royal officials to crush the rebellion by force.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p.23</ref> In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but Massachusetts Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor\u2014so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".<ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], p. 155\u2013156</ref>\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.<ref>[[#yale'mga|Avalon Project, 2008, Massachusetts Government Act]]</ref><ref>[[#christie|Christie, 1976]], p. 188</ref> [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Further measures]] allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the British Empire if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally.

Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies{{efn|Georgia did not attend.}}<ref>[[#ferling2003|Ferling, 2003]], p. 112</ref> convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal by [[Joseph Galloway]] to create an [[Galloway's Plan of Union|American parliament]] to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed [[Continental Association|a compact]] declaring a [[Economic sanctions|trade boycott]] against Britain.<ref name=\"Kramnick21\">[[#kramnick82|Kramnick (Ed.), Paine, 1982]], p. 21</ref><ref name=greene338>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], pp. 338\u2013339</ref>{{efn|\"The plan was considered very attractive to most of the members, as it proposed a popularly elected Grand Council which would represent the interests of the colonies as a whole, and would be a continental equivalent to the English Parliament.

The boycott was effective, as imports from Britain dropped by 97% in 1775 compared to 1774.<ref name=\"Kramnick21\"/>\n\nParliament refused to yield.

Morgan then defeated the renown [[British Legion (American Revolution)|British Legion]], considered to be the cream of the British army, under Tarleton, on January 17, 1781, at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. Cornwallis was criticized for having detached a substantial part of his army without adequate support,<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Clinton, H.; The American Rebellion; 1783</ref> but he advanced into North Carolina despite the setbacks, gambling that he would receive substantial Loyalist support there.

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them militarily. The war grew into a global conflict for the British.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref><ref>David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was somewhat offset by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in winter quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics, and strategy, and he wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref> \nWhen the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 294\u2013295</ref>\n\n[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]\n\nWhen the war began, the Thirteen Colonies lacked a professional army or navy, and each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare, but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war.

Washington was unanimously confirmed by the Continental Congress on June 16,<ref>[[#taylor2016|Taylor, 2016]], pp. 141\u2013142</ref><ref>[[#burk75|Davis, 1975]], pp. 11\u201313</ref> and he officially assumed command in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 3.<ref name=gardner3>[[#bell2005|Bell, 2005]], pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nWashington assumed five main roles during the war.<ref>[[#higginbotham|Higginbotham, 1987]], pp. 69, 99, Chap, et al</ref> First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers and navy it had sent, which assisted him greatly in defeating Cornwallis during the surrender of Yorktown in 1781.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost more battles than he won, but never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2007]], pp. 258-261</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged with selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>[[#harwell2011|Freeman & Harwell (ed.)]], p. 42</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>[[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham, 1971]], Chap.3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to better train them in the ways of troop maneuvers in the field, transforming Washington's army into a more disciplined and effective force overall.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>[[#carp1990|Carp, 1990]], p. 220</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>[[#lengel2007|Lengel, 2007]], pp.  365\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Intelligence and espionage ====\n{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War&nbsp;|&nbsp;Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\nAt the onset of the war, the [[Second Continental Congress]] realized that they would need foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering capability to defeat a world power like Britain. To this end, they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] which operated from 1775\u20131776 for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\". Through secret correspondence, the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France and England and within America.

Washington anticipated that they would soon attack New York City, so he departed Boston on April 4 with his army and headed for Manhattan, where he began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. He realized that he needed advance information to deal with the British, so he promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel on August 12, 1776 with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers; this came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17 at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref> Among the Rangers was [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City on Manhattan Island.{{efn|The city only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan in 1776.}} Washington knew that a British attack on the city was imminent, and he was desperate to learn when and where it would occur. He asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn, but no one came forward except for Nathan Hale\u2014and he was only able to provide nominal intelligence to Washington. The British attack occurred on September 15, and Hale was eventually recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper. The British captured him and found sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and Howe ordered that he be summarily hanged without trial the next day (September 22).<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York, he realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British.

Stewart 2005 p. 103\" /><ref name=\"Ellis 2013\" /> Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory.  After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\" /><ref name=\"auto\" /><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1891 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War.

Henry Clinton, Cornwallis's superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''.

In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, December 15, 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, July 19 and August 29, 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve.

On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control.

They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.

PLEASE DISCUSS IF YOU WISH TO CHANGE IT-->\nThe '''American Revolutionary War''' (1775{{ndash}}1783), also known as the '''American War of Independence''', was fought primarily between the Kingdom of Great Britain and her [[Thirteen Colonies]] in America, resulting in the overthrow of British rule in the colonies and the establishment of the United States of America.{{efn|This article primarily refers to the inhabitants of the thirteen colonies who supported the American Revolution as \"Americans\", with occasional references to \"Patriots\" or \"Revolutionaries\". Colonists who supported the British and opposed the Revolution are referred to as \"Loyalists\" or \"Tories\". The geographical area of the thirteen colonies is often referred to simply as \"America\".}}\n\nAfter 1765, growing political differences concering colonial representaion in Parliament strained the relationship between Great Britain and its American colonies and fueled the resentment that led to the [[American Revolution]]. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriot]] protests against [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]] followed the [[Stamp Act 1765|Stamp Act]] and escalated into boycotts, which culminated in 1773 with the [[Sons of Liberty]] destroying a shipment of [[Boston Tea Party|tea in Boston Harbor]]. Britain responded by closing the harbor and passing a series of [[Intolerable Acts|punitive measures]] against [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. Massachusetts colonists responded with the [[Suffolk Resolves]], and they established a shadow government which wrested control of the countryside from the Crown. Twelve colonies formed a [[Continental Congress]]{{efn|[[Province of Georgia|The colony of Georgia]] joined the Continental Congress later.}} to coordinate their resistance, establishing committees and conventions that effectively seized power.\n\nBritish attempts to disarm the Massachusetts militia in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]] led to [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|open combat]] and a British defeat on April 19, 1775. Militia forces then [[Siege of Boston|besieged Boston]], forcing a British evacuation in March 1776, and Congress unanimously appointed [[George Washington]] to command the [[Continental Army]]. Concurrently, the Americans [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|failed decisively]] in an attempt to [[Invasion of Quebec (1775)|invade Quebec]] and raise insurrection against the British. On July 2, 1776, the [[Second Continental Congress]] voted for independence, issuing its [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaration]] on July&nbsp;4. [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Sir William Howe]] launched a [[New York and New Jersey campaign|British counter-offensive]], capturing New York City and leaving American morale at a low ebb. However, victories at [[Battle of Trenton|Trenton]] and [[Battle of Princeton|Princeton]] restored American confidence. In 1777, the British launched an [[Saratoga Campaign|invasion from Quebec]] under [[John Burgoyne]], intending to isolate the [[New England Colonies]]. Instead of assisting this effort, Howe took his army on a separate [[Philadelphia campaign|campaign against Philadelphia]], and Burgoyne was decisively defeated at [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] in October 1777.\n                                           \nBurgoyne's defeat had dramatic consequences. France formally [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|allied with the Americans]] and entered the war in 1778, and Spain joined the war the following year as an [[Pacte de Famille|ally of France]]; by the end of September 1779, Spanish troops had cleared all British forts and settlers located in the entire region along the Mississippi.<!--<ref>[[#nessy|O'Shaughnessy, 2013]], p. 179</ref>--> The British mounted a \"[[Southern theater of the American Revolutionary War|Southern strategy]]\" led by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]] which hinged upon a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] uprising, but too few came forward. Cornwallis suffered reversals at [[Battle of Kings Mountain|King's Mountain]] and [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]]. He retreated to [[Yorktown, Virginia]], intending an evacuation, but a decisive [[Battle of the Chesapeake|French naval victory]] deprived him of an escape. A Franco-American army led by Washington and [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Comte de Rochambeau]] then [[Siege of Yorktown|besieged Cornwallis's army]], and he surrendered in October 1781.\n                                           \n[[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in Britain had long opposed the pro-war [[Tory|Tories]] in Parliament, and the surrender gave them the upper hand. In early 1782, Parliament voted to end all offensive operations in America (although Britain continued to war against France and Spain in Europe, the Caribbean, and India). On September 3, 1783, the belligerent parties signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in which Great Britain agreed to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and formally end the war.\n{{toclimit|5}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Main|American Revolution}}\n            \n=== Taxation disputes ===\nParliament passed the Stamp Act in 1765 to pay for British military troops stationed in the American colonies after the [[French and Indian War]] and to recoup costs of the war itself. The colonists resented being forced to pay for a war in which they had sacrificed many lives. Parliament had previously passed legislation to regulate trade, but the Stamp Act introduced a new principle of a direct internal tax. Americans began to question the extent of Parliament's power in America, and the colonial legislatures argued that they had exclusive right to impose taxes within their own jurisdictions.<ref>[[#bonwick|Bonwick, 1991]], pp. 71\u201372</ref> Colonists condemned the tax because their [[Rights of Englishmen|rights as Englishmen]] protected them from being taxed by a Parliament in which they had [[no taxation without representation|no elected representatives]].<ref>[[#gladney|Gladney, 2014]], p. 5</ref> Parliament argued that the colonies were \"[[Virtual representation|represented virtually]]\", an idea that was criticized throughout the British Empire.<ref name=\"google1\">[[#dickinson1977|Dickinson, 1977]], p. 218</ref> Parliament did repeal the act in 1766, but it also [[Declaratory Act|affirmed its right]] to pass laws that were binding on the colonies.<ref>[[#McIlwain|McIlwain, 2005&nbsp;&nbsp;[1938] ]], p. 51</ref> From 1767, Parliament began passing the [[Townshend Acts]] to raise revenue for the salaries of civil officials, imposing taxes on imported goods such as tea, lead, glass, and paper\u2014items required by law to be purchased exclusively from Britain\u2014and this established the precedent that Parliament had the right to tax the colonies. A [[Board of Customs]] was also created in Boston to enforce the Acts, while the New York Assembly was suspended\u2014all of which fueled increasing resentment and widespread opposition among the colonists.<ref>[[#boyer|Boyer, 2014]], p. 142</ref><ref>[[#ferling2002|Ferling, 2002]], pp. 72\u201373</ref>\n\n[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|alt=Two ships in a harbor, one in the distance.

A few people wave their hats from windows in a nearby building.|1846 lithograph by [[Nathaniel Currier]] entitled \"The Destruction of Tea at Boston Harbor\"; the phrase \"[[Boston Tea Party]]\" had not yet become standard. Contrary to Currier's depiction, few of the men dumping the tea were actually disguised as Indians.<ref>[[#young|Young, 1999]], pp. 183\u201385</ref>]]\n\nEnforcing the acts proved difficult. The British seized the sloop ''[[HMS Liberty (1768)|Liberty]]'' in 1768 on suspicions of smuggling, and this triggered a riot. In response, British troops occupied Boston, and Parliament threatened to [[Treason Act 1543|extradite colonists]] to face trial in England. Tensions rose after the murder of 11 year-old [[Christopher Seider]] by a customs official in 1770, and escalated into further outrage after British troops fired on civilians in the [[Boston Massacre]]. Many of the colonists suspected that the incident was intentionally provoked and used as a pretext by royal officials to crush the rebellion by force.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], p.23</ref> In 1772, colonists in [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations|Rhode Island]] boarded and burned a [[Gaspee Affair|customs schooner]]. Parliament then repealed all taxes except the one on tea, passing the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, attempting to force colonists to buy [[East India Company]] tea on which the Townshend duties were paid, thus implicitly agreeing to Parliamentary supremacy. The landing of the tea was resisted in all colonies, but Massachusetts Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] permitted British tea ships to remain in Boston Harbor\u2014so the Sons of Liberty destroyed the tea chests in what became known as the \"Boston Tea Party\".<ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], p. 155\u2013156</ref>\n\nParliament then passed punitive legislation. It [[Boston Port Act|closed Boston Harbor]] until the tea was paid for and [[Massachusetts Government Act|revoked]] the [[Massachusetts Charter]], taking upon themselves the right to directly appoint the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council]]. Additionally, the royal governor was granted powers to undermine local democracy.<ref>[[#yale'mga|Avalon Project, 2008, Massachusetts Government Act]]</ref><ref>[[#christie|Christie, 1976]], p. 188</ref> [[Administration of Justice Act 1774|Further measures]] allowed the extradition of officials for trial elsewhere in the British Empire if the governor felt that a fair trial could not be secured locally. The act's vague reimbursement policy for travel expenses left few with the ability to testify, and colonists argued that it would allow officials to harass them with impunity. [[Quartering Act|Further laws]] allowed the governor to billet troops in private homes without the owner's permission.<ref name=ammerman9>[[#ammerman|Ammerman, 1974]], p. 9</ref>{{efn|Ammerman points out that the act only permitted soldiers to be quartered in unoccupied buildings\u2014although they were still private property.

Meanwhile, representatives from twelve colonies{{efn|Georgia did not attend.}}<ref>[[#ferling2003|Ferling, 2003]], p. 112</ref> convened the [[First Continental Congress]] to respond to the crisis. The Congress narrowly rejected a proposal by [[Joseph Galloway]] to create an [[Galloway's Plan of Union|American parliament]] to act in concert with the British Parliament; instead, they passed [[Continental Association|a compact]] declaring a [[Economic sanctions|trade boycott]] against Britain.<ref name=\"Kramnick21\">[[#kramnick82|Kramnick (Ed.), Paine, 1982]], p. 21</ref><ref name=greene338>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008]], pp. 338\u2013339</ref>{{efn|\"The plan was considered very attractive to most of the members, as it proposed a popularly elected Grand Council which would represent the interests of the colonies as a whole, and would be a continental equivalent to the English Parliament.

The British, however, defeated Patriot militia at [[Battle of Brier Creek|Brier Creek]] on March 3,<ref>[[#morrill|Morrill, 1993]], pp.48\u201350</ref> and then launched an [[Battle of Stono Ferry|abortive assault]] on [[Charleston, South Carolina]].

Far fewer Loyalists joined him than expected. In the interim, the war was carried on by Patriot militias who effectively suppressed Loyalists by winning victories in [[Battle of Mobley's Meeting House|Fairfield County]], [[Battle of Ramsour's Mill|Lincolnton]], [[Huck's Defeat]],  [[Battle of Colson's Mill|Stanly County]], and [[Battle of Hanging Rock|Lancaster County]].\n\nThe British launched a surprise offensive in Virginia in January 1781, with [[Benedict Arnold]] [[Raid of Richmond|invading Richmond, Virginia]], to little resistance.

Morgan then defeated the renown [[British Legion (American Revolution)|British Legion]], considered to be the cream of the British army, under Tarleton, on January 17, 1781, at [[Battle of Cowpens|Cowpens]].

They had no national government, no national army or navy, no financial system, no banks, no established credit, and no functioning government departments. The Congress tried to handle administrative affairs through legislative committees, which proved inefficient. The state governments were themselves brand new and officials had no administrative experience. In peacetime, the colonies relied heavily on ocean travel and shipping, but that was now shut down by the British blockade, and the Americans had to rely on slow overland travel.\n\nHowever, the Americans had multiple advantages that outweighed the initial disadvantages which they faced. The Americans had a large prosperous population that depended on local production of food and most supplies rather than on imports, while British supplies were mostly shipped from across the ocean. The British faced a vast territory far larger than Britain or France, located at a far distance from home ports. Most of the Americans lived on farms distant from the seaports; the British could capture any port, but that did not give them control over the inland areas. They were on their home ground, had a smoothly functioning, well organized system of local and state governments, newspapers and printers, and internal lines of communication. They had a long-established system of local militia, previously used to combat the French and Indians, with companies and an officer corps that could form the basis of local militias and provide a training ground for the national army.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], ch. 36\u201339</ref> Motivation was also a major asset. The Patriots had much more popular support than the Loyalists, and more than 200,000 Americans fought in the war; 25,000 died. The British expected the Loyalists to do much of the fighting, but they did much less than expected. The British also hired German auxiliaries to do much of their fighting.<ref name=\"Lanning195\u201396\"/>\n\nAt the onset of the war, the Americans had no major international allies. Battles such as the [[Battle of Bennington]], the [[Battles of Saratoga]], and even defeats such as the [[Battle of Germantown]]<ref name=\"Trevelyan, p. 249\">Trevelyan, p. 249.</ref> proved decisive in gaining the attention and support of powerful European nations such as France and Spain, who moved from covertly supplying the Americans with weapons and supplies to overtly supporting them militarily. The war grew into a global conflict for the British.<ref name=\"K405_48\">[[#ketchum97|Ketchum (1997)]], pp. 405\u201348.</ref><ref>David Allison, ''The American Revolution: A World War'' (2018)</ref>\n\nThe new Continental Army suffered significantly from a lack of an effective training program and from largely inexperienced officers and sergeants. The inexperience of its officers was somewhat offset by a few senior officers. The Americans solved their training dilemma during their stint in winter quarters at Valley Forge, where they were relentlessly drilled and trained by General [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the famed Prussian General Staff. He taught the Continental Army the essentials of military discipline, drills, tactics, and strategy, and he wrote the [[Revolutionary War Drill Manual]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref> \nWhen the Army emerged from Valley Forge, it proved its ability to equally match the British troops in battle when they fought a successful strategic action at the [[Battle of Monmouth]].<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 294\u2013295</ref>\n\n[[File:Population Density in the American Colonies 1775.gif|thumb|Population density in the [[American Colonies]] in 1775]]\n\nWhen the war began, the Thirteen Colonies lacked a professional army or navy, and each colony sponsored local militia. Militiamen were lightly armed, had little training, and usually did not have uniforms. Their units served for only a few weeks or months at a time, were reluctant to travel far from home, were unavailable for extended operations, and lacked the training and discipline of soldiers with more experience. If properly used, however, their numbers could help the Continental armies overwhelm smaller British forces, as at the battles of [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|Concord]], [[Battle of Bennington|Bennington]], and [[Saratoga campaign|Saratoga]] and the [[siege of Boston]]. Both sides used partisan warfare, but the Americans effectively suppressed Loyalist activity when British regulars were not in the area.<ref name=\"Black 2001 p. 59\" />\n\nThe [[First Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] established a regular army on June 14, 1775, and appointed [[George Washington]] as commander-in-chief. The development of the Continental Army was always a work in progress, and Washington used both his regulars and state militia throughout the war. Three branches of the United States Military forces trace their institutional roots to the American Revolutionary War; the Army comes from the [[Continental Army]]; the Navy recognizes October 13, 1775, as the date of its official establishment when the Continental Congress created the [[Continental Navy]];<ref name=Establish>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq59-13.htm|title=Establishment of the Navy, 13&nbsp;October 1775|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}</ref> and the Marine Corps links to the [[Continental Marines]] of the war, formed by a resolution of Congress on November 10, 1775.\n\n==== George Washington's roles ====\n{{Main|George Washington in the American Revolution }}\n\n[[File:George Washington, 1776.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|<center>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General Washington<br />Commander of the [[Continental Army]]<br>by [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1776)</center>|alt=Formal painting of General George Washington, standing in uniform, as commander of the Continental Army]]\n\nRecognizing George Washington's skill and experience as an officer, and his ability to unite the colonies \"... better than any other person in the Union\", [[John Adams]] nominated Washington on June 14, 1775, to be the commander of the Continental Army. Washington was unanimously confirmed by the Continental Congress on June 16,<ref>[[#taylor2016|Taylor, 2016]], pp. 141\u2013142</ref><ref>[[#burk75|Davis, 1975]], pp. 11\u201313</ref> and he officially assumed command in the field at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on July 3.<ref name=gardner3>[[#bell2005|Bell, 2005]], pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\nWashington assumed five main roles during the war.<ref>[[#higginbotham|Higginbotham, 1987]], pp. 69, 99, Chap, et al</ref> First, he designed the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress. The goal was always independence.  When France entered the war, he worked closely with the soldiers and navy it had sent, which assisted him greatly in defeating Cornwallis during the surrender of Yorktown in 1781.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], pp. 203, 303, 391</ref>\n\nSecond, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775\u201377 and again in 1781. He lost more battles than he won, but never surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2007]], pp. 258-261</ref>\n\nThird, he was charged with selecting and guiding the generals. In June 1776, Congress made its first attempt at running the war effort with the committee known as \"Board of War and Ordnance\", succeeded by the Board of War in July 1777, a committee which eventually included members of the military.<ref name=gardner3/><ref>[[#harwell2011|Freeman & Harwell (ed.)]], p. 42</ref> The command structure of the armed forces was a hodgepodge of Congressional appointees (and Congress sometimes made those appointments without Washington's input) with state-appointments filling the lower ranks. The results of his general staff were mixed, as some of his favorites never mastered the art of command, such as [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]]. Eventually, he found capable officers such as [[Nathanael Greene]], [[Daniel Morgan]], [[Henry Knox]] (chief of artillery), and [[Alexander Hamilton]] (chief of staff). The American officers never equaled their opponents in tactics and maneuver, and they lost most of the pitched battles. The great successes at Boston (1776), [[Battles of Saratoga|Saratoga]] (1777), and [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] (1781) came from trapping the British far from base with much larger numbers of troops.<ref>[[#higginbotham1987|Higginbotham, 1971]], Chap.3</ref> Owing to the precarious nature of the committee process, Congress created the post of Secretary of War which replaced the Board of War and appointed Major General [[Benjamin Lincoln]] as its first secretary in February, 1781. Washington worked closely with Lincoln in organizing the relationship between civilian and military authorities.<ref name=gardner3/>\n\nFourth he took charge of training the army and providing supplies, from food to gunpowder to tents. He recruited regulars and assigned Baron [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben]], a veteran of the Prussian general staff, to better train them in the ways of troop maneuvers in the field, transforming Washington's army into a more disciplined and effective force overall.<ref>[[#ferling2007|Ferling, 2007]], pp. 286\u2013287</ref>   The war effort and getting supplies to the troops were under the purview of Congress, but Washington pressured the Congress to provide the essentials. There was never nearly enough.<ref>[[#carp1990|Carp, 1990]], p. 220</ref>\n\nWashington's fifth and most important role in the war effort was the embodiment of armed resistance to the Crown, serving as the representative man of the Revolution. His long-term strategy was to maintain an army in the field at all times, and eventually this strategy worked. His enormous personal and political stature and his political skills kept Congress, the army, the French, the militias, and the states all pointed toward a common goal. Furthermore, he permanently established the principle of civilian supremacy in military affairs by voluntarily resigning his commission and disbanding his army when the war was won, rather than declaring himself monarch. He also helped to overcome the distrust of a standing army by his constant reiteration that well-disciplined professional soldiers counted for twice as much as poorly trained and led militias.<ref>[[#lengel2007|Lengel, 2007]], pp.  365\u201371.</ref>\n\n==== Intelligence and espionage ====\n{{Main|Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War&nbsp;|&nbsp;Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War}}\n\nAt the onset of the war, the [[Second Continental Congress]] realized that they would need foreign alliances and intelligence-gathering capability to defeat a world power like Britain. To this end, they formed the [[Committee of Secret Correspondence]] which operated from 1775\u20131776 for \"the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Britain and other parts of the world\". Through secret correspondence, the Committee forged alliances and shared information with persons in France and England and within America. The Committee employed secret agents in Europe to gather foreign intelligence, conduct undercover operations, analyze foreign publications, and initiate American propaganda campaigns to gain patriot support.<ref name=cia2011>[[#cia|CIA, 2011, Historical Document]]</ref> Some notable members of the committee included [[Thomas Paine]], the Committee's secretary, and [[Silas Deane]] who was sent undercover to France and was instrumental in securing her aid.<ref>[[#alexrose|Rose, 2014&nbsp;&nbsp;[2006] ]], p. 43</ref>\n\n[[File:Culper Ring code.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Page from Culper Ring's code book, with names adjacent to their code numbers]]\n\nThe British were driven out of Boston during the [[Siege of Boston]] and redeployed in Nova Scotia. Washington anticipated that they would soon attack New York City, so he departed Boston on April 4 with his army and headed for Manhattan, where he began constructing fortifications [[Heights of Guan|about the harbor]]. He realized that he needed advance information to deal with the British, so he promoted [[Thomas Knowlton]] to lieutenant colonel on August 12, 1776 with orders to select an elite group of 130 men and 20 officers; this came to be known as [[Knowlton's Rangers]], the Army's first intelligence unit. Their purpose was to conduct reconnaissance and other secret missions that were considered too dangerous for regular troops. Knowlton was killed in action on September 17 at the [[Battle of Harlem Heights]] while on a mission observing British troop activity.<ref>[[#johnston1897|Johnston, 1897]], p. 61</ref> Among the Rangers was [[Nathan Hale]].<ref name=cia2011/><ref>[[#kilmeade|Kilmeade & Yaeger, 2013]], pp. 20\u201322</ref>\n\nOn August 27, 1776, the British landed on Long Island with overwhelming force during the [[Battle of Long Island]] and forced Washington to retreat across the East River to New York City on Manhattan Island.{{efn|The city only occupied the southern tip of Manhattan in 1776.}} Washington knew that a British attack on the city was imminent, and he was desperate to learn when and where it would occur. He asked for a volunteer among the Rangers to spy on activity behind enemy lines in Brooklyn, but no one came forward except for Nathan Hale\u2014and he was only able to provide nominal intelligence to Washington. The British attack occurred on September 15, and Hale was eventually recognized in a tavern by a Loyalist shop keeper. The British captured him and found sketches of British fortifications and troop positions in his pockets, and Howe ordered that he be summarily hanged without trial the next day, on September 22.<ref>[[#burke75|Burke, 1975]], p. 134</ref> After Washington was driven out of New York, he realized that he would need more than military might and amateur spies to defeat the British.

Stewart 2005 p. 103\" /><ref name=\"Ellis 2013\" /> Throughout the New York and Philadelphia campaigns, Howe made several strategic errors which cost the British opportunities for a complete victory.  After securing control of New York, Howe dispatched Henry Clinton to capture Newport, a measure which Clinton was opposed to, on the grounds the troops assigned to his command could have been put to better use in pursuing Washington's retreating army.<ref name=\"Ridpath 1915\" /><ref name=\"auto\" /><ref name=\"Stedman, Charles 1794 p. 221\" /> Despite the bleak outlook for the revolutionary cause<ref name=\"Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142\">Fischer, pp. 138\u2013142</ref> and the surge of Loyalist activity in the wake of Washington's defeats,<ref name=\"American History 1982 p. 130\" /> Howe made no attempt to mount an attack upon Washington while the Americans settled down into winter quarters, much to their surprise.<ref name=\"Lecky, William 1891 p. 57\" />\n\nDuring planning for the Saratoga campaign, Howe was left with the choice of committing his army to support Burgoyne, or capture Philadelphia, the revolutionary capital. Howe decided upon the latter, determining that Washington was of a greater threat. When Howe launched his campaign, he took his army upon a time-consuming route through the Chesapeake Bay, rather than the more sensible choices of overland through New Jersey, or by sea through the Delaware Bay. The move left him unable to assist Burgoyne even if it was required of him. The decision so angered Parliament, that Howe was accused by Tories on both sides of the Atlantic of treason.<ref name=\"Campaign of 1777\" />\n\nDuring the Philadelphia campaign, Howe failed to pursue and destroy the defeated Americans on two occasions; once after the [[Battle of Brandywine]],<ref name=\"Higginbotham pp. 181\" /><ref name=\"Adams, Charles Francis p. 43\" /> and again after the [[Battle of Germantown]]. At the [[Battle of White Marsh]], Howe failed to even attempt to exploit the vulnerable American rear,<ref name=\"auto1\" /> and then inexplicably ordered a retreat to Philadelphia after only minor skirmishes, astonishing both sides.<ref name=\"McGuire, p. 254\" /> While the Americans wintered only twenty miles away, Howe made no effort to attack their camp, which critics argue could have ended the war.<ref name=\"Noel Fairchild Busch 1974\" /><ref name=\"A Concluding Commentary\" /><ref name=\"history.army.mil\" /> Following the conclusion of the campaign, Howe resigned his commission, and was replaced by Henry Clinton on May 24, 1778.<ref name=\"Frances H.

This decision dangerously exposed the individual forces to defeat in detail, as the distance between them was such that they could not mutually support each other. This strategic failure allowed the Americans to achieve victory at the [[Battle of Trenton]], and the concurrent [[Battle of Princeton]].<ref>Correspondence of George III with Lord North, Volume II, p. 57</ref> While a major strategic error to divide an army in such a manner, the quantity of available food supplies in New York was so low that Howe had been compelled to take such a decision.

After an encouraging success at [[Battle of Camden|Camden]], Cornwallis was poised to invade North Carolina. However, any significant Loyalist support had been effectively destroyed at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]], and the British Legion, the cream of his army, had been decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Cowpens]]. Following both defeats, Cornwallis was fiercely criticized for detaching a significant portion of his army without adequate mutual support.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Despite the defeats, Cornwallis chose to proceed into North Carolina, gambling his success upon a large Loyalist uprising which never materialized.<ref name=\"Lumpkin 2000\">[[#lumpkin|Lumpkin, 2000]], p. 60</ref> As a result, subsequent engagements cost Cornwallis valuable troops he could not replace, as at the [[Battle of Guilford Courthouse]],<ref name=\"MtVernon\" /> and the Americans steadily wore his army down in an exhaustive [[war of attrition]]. Cornwallis had thus left the Carolinas ripe for reconquest. The Americans had largely achieved this aim by the end of 1781, effectively confining the British to the coast, and undoing all the progress they had made in the previous year.<ref>Pancake, John (1985). This Destructive War. University of Alabama Press. p. 221</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\nIn a last-ditch attempt to win the war in the South, Cornwallis resolved to invade Virginia, in order to cut off the American's supply base to the Carolinas. Henry Clinton, Cornwallis's superior, strongly opposed the plan, believing the decisive confrontations would take place with Washington in the North.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> London had approved Cornwallis plan, however they had failed to include Clinton in the decision-making, despite his seniority over Cornwallis, leading to a muddled strategic direction.<ref name=\"Public Record Office\" /> Cornwallis then decided to invade Virginia without informing Clinton of his intentions.<ref>Clinton, H.; ''The American Rebellion''. Note: This lack of notification was one of Clinton's main arguments in his own defense in the controversy that followed the surrender at Yorktown.</ref> Clinton, however, had wholly failed to construct a coherent strategy for British campaigning that year,<ref name=\"auto3\" /> owing to his fractious relationship that he shared with Mariot Arbuthnot, his naval counterpart.<ref name=\"Billias 1969\" />\n\nAs the Franco-American army approached Cornwallis at Yorktown, he made no attempt to [[sally (military)|sally out]] and engage before siege lines could be erected,  despite the repeated urging of his subordinate officers.<ref name=\"Ketchum, p. 205\" /> Expecting [[relief (military)|relief]] to soon arrive from Clinton, Cornwallis prematurely abandoned all of his outer defences, which were then promptly occupied by the besiegers, serving to hasten the British defeat.<ref>[[#lengel2007|Lengel, 2007]], p. 337</ref> These factors contributed to the eventual surrender of Cornwallis's entire army, and the end of major operations in North America.<ref>Fleming, Thomas (1970). The Perils of Peace. New York: The Dial Press. {{ISBN|9780061139116}}, p. 16</ref>\n\nLike Howe before him, Clinton's efforts to campaign suffered from chronic supply issues. In 1778, Clinton wrote to Germain complaining of the lack of supplies, even after the arrival of a convoy from Ireland.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:96, Clinton to Germain, September 15, 1778</ref> That winter, the supply issue had deteriorated so badly, that Clinton expressed considerable anxiety over how the troops were going to be properly fed.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:97, Clinton to Germain, December 15, 1778</ref> Clinton was largely inactive in the North throughout 1779, launching few major campaigns. This inactivity was partially due to the shortage of food.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:98, Haldimand to Clinton, July 19 and August 29, 1779</ref> By 1780, the situation had not improved. Clinton wrote a frustrated correspondence to Germain, voicing concern that a \"fatal consequence will ensue\" if matters did not improve. By October that year, Clinton again wrote to Germain, angered that the troops in New York had not received \"an ounce\" of that year's allotted stores from Britain.<ref>Colonial Office Papers, 5:100, Clinton to Germain, October 31, 1780</ref>\n\n==== Campaign issues ====\n\nSuppressing a rebellion in America presented the British with major problems. The key issue was distance; it could take up to three months to cross the Atlantic, and orders from London were often outdated by the time that they arrived.<ref>Black (2001), p. 39</ref><ref>[[#greene|Greene & Pole, 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;[2000] ]], pp. 298, 306</ref> The colonies had never been formally united prior to the conflict and there was no centralized area of ultimate strategic importance.

On April 19, 1782, the Dutch formally recognized the United States as a sovereign power, enhancing American leverage at the negotiations. Spain initially impeded the negotiations, refusing to enter into peace talks until Gibraltar had been captured. The Comte de Vergennes proposed that American territory be confined to the east of the Appalachians; Britain would have sovereignty over the [[Northwest Territory|area north of the Ohio River]], below which an [[Indian barrier state]] would be established under Spanish control.

They negotiated directly with Shelburne, who hoped to make Britain a valuable trading partner of America at the expense of France.

Running rigging varies between vessels that are rigged fore and aft and those that are square-rigged.\n\n== History of materials ==\n\nIn centuries past, a ship's rigging was typically fashioned from [[rope]]. In the 19th century this was commonly referred to as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was not coated with [[tar]] and therefore of a lighter color than the [[standing rigging]] which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, running rigging is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the standing rigging is most often fashioned from stainless steel \"[[wire rope]]\". Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene  ([[UHMWPE]]) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), [[Vectran]], and [[Technora]].<ref name=HowardDoane>\n{{cite book\n | last = Howard\n | first = Jim\n | last2 = Doane\n | first2 = Charles J.\n | title = Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising\n | publisher = Sheridan House, Inc.\n | date = 2000\n | pages = 468\n | language =\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&pg=PA63\n | isbn = 9781574090932 }}</ref>\n\n==Fore-and-aft rigged vessels==\nFore-and-aft rigged vessels have rigging that supports, shapes, and adjusts the sails to optimize their performance in the wind.\n\n===Supporting===\n* [[Halyard]]s (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension.

This is one of the main controls for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning block at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full.

Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.<ref name = HomeEvans/>\n* [[Downhaul]]s, which lower a sail or a yard, and can be used to adjust the tension on the luff of a sail.<ref name=HowardDoane/>\n* [[Outhaul]]s, which control the foot tension of a boom-footed sail. This is one of the main controls for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning bock at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.<ref name=HowardDoane/>\n\n===Adjusting angle to the wind===\n* [[guy (sailing)|Guy]]s, which control spar angle with respect to the apparent wind.\n*[[Preventer]], is cordage attached to the end of the boom and fixed to (or running through a block) on the rail athwart or forward of the mast.  Its most common purpose is to prevent potentially dangerous movement of the spar in an accidental gybe.<ref name=HowardDoane/>\n* [[Sheet (sailing)|Sheet]]s, which control foot tension of loose-footed sails, angle of attack with respect to the apparent wind and/or the amount of leech \"twist\" near the head of the sail. Central sheeting refers to main sheets that attach to the centre of the boom.  Sheets are made from thin low stretch cordage in racing yachts.<ref name=HowardDoane/>\n\n===Stability===\n* [[Trapeze (sailing)|Trapeze]] wires, which are narrow gauge flexible stainless steel wire, running from about the cross trees on the mast to the harness worn by a crew member and sometimes skipper on a high speed racing skiff. The lower section often has a system of small blocks which are used by the crew to alter the length of the trapeze wire as the crew moves aft on a broad reach. When the boat changes tack the crew unclips the hook, the wire is automatically sprung into the gunwale by an elastic tail.<ref name = HomeEvans>\n{{cite book\n | last = Holmes\n | first = Rupert\n | last2 = Evans\n | first2 = Jeremy\n | title = The Dinghy Bible: The Complete Guide for Novices and Experts\n | publisher = A&C Black\n | date = 2014\n | location =\n | pages = 192\n | language =\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc6EAAAAQBAJ&pg=PT61\n | isbn = 9781408188002 }}</ref>\n\n==Square-rigged vessels==\n[[File:Running Rigging-Square-rigged ship--Biddlecombe.jpg|thumb|300px|Diagram of running rigging on a square-rigged ship.<ref name = Biddlecombe />]]\n[[File:Square rigged sail parts and running rigging.jpg|thumb|300px|Square sail edges and corners (top).

Her family migrated to [[Australia]] as free settlers when she was nine years old. Twelve years later in September 1867 she married Edmund Kay Wolstenholme, a timber merchant. The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, [[Harry Wolstenholme]], was a [[lawyer]] and keen amateur [[ornithologist]]. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called  'Maybanke' in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the ''[[Divorce Amendment and Extension Act]]'' in 1892 before she could [[divorce]] Edmund on the grounds of ''\"three years of desertion.\"'' The divorce was finalised in 1893.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book |title= Maybanke Anderson: SEX, suffrage and social reform|last= Roberts|first=Jan |year= 1993|publisher= Hale & Iremonger|location= Sydney|isbn= 0868064955}} p.37</ref> After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer [[Norman Selfe]], with whom she would later campaign for education reform.{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=54}}\n\nIn 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the [[University of Sydney]] entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.<ref>Nugent, A. 2001.

She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend [[Rose Scott]]. Many of the society's members would go on to form the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] (WSL) on 6 May 1891.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/politics.html |title=Federation Political Groups\u2014to 1901 and beyond | accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas.\n\nIn 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper ''Woman's Voice''. The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in [[Australia]] at [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2656479.htm |title=Gardens for children and workshops for classrooms: Maybanke Anderson, Norman Selfe and the New Education - Hindsight, Radio National 16 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-26|date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in [[Adelaide]]. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from [[South Australia|South]] and [[Western Australia]] who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the [[Federation of Australia|pro-federation movement]]. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902.\n\nMaybanke was inducted onto the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2001 in recognition of her achievements.\n\n==Marriage and travel==\nIn 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, [[Francis Anderson (philosopher)|Sir Francis Anderson]]. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]]. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government.

Her family migrated to [[Australia]] as free settlers when she was nine years old. Twelve years later in September 1867 she married Edmund Kay Wolstenholme, a timber merchant. The couple had seven children between 1868 and 1879, four of them died from a heart condition before the age of five. Her son, [[Harry Wolstenholme]], was a [[lawyer]] and keen amateur [[ornithologist]]. The Wolstenholmes built a large house called  'Maybanke' in [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]]. The later years of the marriage were unhappy; Edmund had a number of business failures and became an alcoholic, leaving the family in 1884. Maybanke had to wait for the passage of the ''[[Divorce Amendment and Extension Act]]'' in 1892 before she could [[divorce]] Edmund on the grounds of ''\"three years of desertion.\"'' The divorce was finalised in 1893.<ref name=\"Roberts\">{{cite book |title= Maybanke Anderson: SEX, suffrage and social reform|last= Roberts|first=Jan |year= 1993|publisher= Hale & Iremonger|location= Sydney|isbn= 0868064955}} p.37</ref> After the divorce, she was supported financially by her brother, the renowned engineer [[Norman Selfe]], with whom she would later campaign for education reform.{{sfn|Roberts|1993|p=54}}\n\nIn 1885 Maybanke opened Maybanke School, a girls' school that she operated in her home preparing girls for the [[University of Sydney]] entrance examination. Operating for 10 years, the school was later known as Maybanke College.<ref>Nugent, A. 2001.

She became active in the women's suffrage movement; she believed that the vote was 'the kernel for all reform'. She was vice president of the Women's Literary Society started by her friend [[Rose Scott]]. Many of the society's members would go on to form the [[Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales]] (WSL) on 6 May 1891.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nla.gov.au/guides/federation/politics.html |title=Federation Political Groups\u2014to 1901 and beyond | accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> In 1893 she was elected to the WSL presidency, and founded the Australasian Home Reading Union in the same year. The Union was a program to promote induction by organising small study groups in rural areas.\n\nIn 1894, she began publishing the fortnightly newspaper ''Woman's Voice''. The paper ran for 18 months, drawing women's attention to suffrage issues at the national and international level. In 1895 she established the first free kindergarten in [[Australia]] at [[Woolloomooloo, New South Wales|Woolloomooloo]] as the president of the Kindergarten Union, helping the children of working mothers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2009/2656479.htm |title=Gardens for children and workshops for classrooms: Maybanke Anderson, Norman Selfe and the New Education - Hindsight, Radio National 16 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-26|date=14 August 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe WSL's attempts to have suffrage implemented by the New South Wales government were not fruitful; however, in 1897, Maybanke decided to petition the 1897 Federal Convention in [[Adelaide]]. She reasoned that this would have the women's vote written into the Federal agenda. Thus, the women from [[South Australia|South]] and [[Western Australia]] who already had the vote could not have it taken from them, and if there was suffrage at the federal level, it would flow down to the states. At this time, she also became involved in the [[Federation of Australia|pro-federation movement]]. Maybanke resigned from the WSL in 1897. Suffrage was extended to the women of New South Wales in 1902.\n\nMaybanke was inducted onto the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2001 in recognition of her achievements.\n\n==Marriage and travel==\nIn 1899 Maybanke married her second husband, [[Francis Anderson (philosopher)|Sir Francis Anderson]]. Anderson was the first Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]]. They travelled and worked together on voluntary projects, including campaigning to have women stand for local government. She was active with the National Council of Women of New South Wales, and worked closely with the University Women's Society.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/people/466159 | title=Anderson, Maybanke (1845-1927) - Trove, National Library of Australia |accessdate=2011-02-26}}</ref> Maybanke died in St Germain-en-Laye, Paris on 15 April 1927.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/anderson-maybanke-susannah-5018/text8347 Anderson, Maybanke Susannah (1845\u20131927)] in ''Australian Dictionary of Biography''\n* [http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/anderson_maybanke Anderson, Maybanke] in ''Dictionary of Sydney''\n* [http://www.womenaustralia.info/leaders/biogs/WLE0601b.htm Anderson, Maybanke Susannah (1845 - 1927)] in ''The Encyclopedia of Women and Leadership in the Twentieth Century''\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Roberts, Jan (1993).
