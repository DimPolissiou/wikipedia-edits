It was founded in 1932 as ''[[The Indian Express]]'', under the ownership of Chennai-based [[P. Varadarajulu Naidu]]. In 1991, following the death of owner [[Ramnath Goenka]], his family split the group into two companies. Initially, the two groups shared the ''Indian Express'' title, as well as editorial and other resources. But on 13 August 1999, the northern editions, headquartered in [[Mumbai]], retained the ''Indian Express'' moniker, while the southern editions became ''The New Indian Express''. Today, the two newspapers and companies are separate entities. Express Publications (Madurai) Private Limited publishes ''The New Indian Express'' from 32 centres in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Telangana]], [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Kerala]] and [[Odisha]].\n\n==History==\n''Indian Express'' was first published on September 5, 1932 in [[Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]) by an [[ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] doctor and [[Indian National Congress]] member P Varadarajulu Naidu, publishing from the same [[Publisher|press]] where he ran the ''Tamil Nadu'' Tamil weekly. But soon, on account of financial difficulties, he sold it to [[S. Sadanand]], founder of ''[[The Free Press Journal]]'', another English newspaper.\n\nIn 1933, ''The Indian Express'' opened its second office in [[Madurai]] and launched the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] daily ''[[Dinamani]]'' on September 11, 1934. Sadanand introduced several innovations and reduced the price, but later sold part of his stake in the form of convertible [[debentures]] to Ramnath Goenka due to financial difficulties. When ''The Free Press Journal'' further went into financial decline in 1935, Sadanand lost ownership of ''Indian Express'' after a long controversial court battle with Goenka, where blows were exchanged. Finally, a year later, Goenka bought the rest of the 26 per cent stake from Sadanand, and the paper came under his control, who took the already anti-establishment tone of the paper to greater heights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} At that time it had to face stiff competition from the well-established ''[[The Hindu]]'' and the ''Mail'', besides other prominent newspapers. In the late 1930s, the circulation was no more than 2,000{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.\n\nIn 1939 Goenka bought out ''[[Andhra Prabha]]'', a prominent [[Telugu language|Telugu]] daily. It gained the name [[Three Musketeers]] for the three dailies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In 1940 the whole premises were gutted by fire. ''The Hindu'', its rival, helped considerably in re-launching the paper, by getting it printed temporarily at one of its Swadesimithran's press and later offering its recently vacated premises in Madras at 2, Mount Road later to become the landmark [[Express Estates]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This relocation helped the ''Express'' obtain better high-speed printing machines.\n\nIn later years, [[Ramnath Goenka|Goenka]]  started the [[Mumbai]] edition with the landmark [[Express Towers]] as his office when the ''Morning Standard'' was bought by him in 1944. Two years later it became the Mumbai edition of ''The Indian Express''. Later on, editions were started in  cities like [[Madurai]] (1957), [[Bangalore]] (1965) and [[Ahmedabad]] (1968). The ''[[The Financial Express (India)|Financial Express]]'' was launched in 1961 from Mumbai, a Bangalore edition of ''Andhra Prabha'' was launched in 1965, and [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] dailies ''Lok Satta'' and ''Jansatta'' in 1952, from Ahmedabad and Baroda.\n\nThe [[Delhi]] edition started was when the Tej group's ''Indian News Chronicle'' was acquired in 1951, which from 1953 became the Delhi edition of ''Indian Express''. In 1990 it bought the Sterling group of magazines and, along with it, the ''Gentleman'' magazine.\n\nAfter Goenka's demise in 1991, two of the family members split the group into ''Indian Express'' Mumbai with all the north Indian editions, while the southern editions were grouped as Express Publications (Madurai) Limited with [[Chennai]] as headquarters.\n\n==Editions==\n''The New Indian Express'' is now published from all 22 major cities in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Telangana]], [[Karnataka]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Kerala]] and [[Odisha]].\n\n==Circulation==\n[[Image:The New Indian Express Masthead.png|thumb|right|270px|Masthead from 1999 till 2008]]\n\n''The New Indian Express'' has a net paid circulation of 495,618 copies.<ref>Source: ABC J-D, 2010</ref> ''NIE'' achieves its biggest penetration (paid sales per head of population) in the state of Kerala.

''The New Sunday Express'' (the Sunday edition of the NIE) is arguably the flagship publication, with magazine supplements incorporating national and international themes and sections on developmental issues, society, politics, literature, arts, cinema, travel, lifestyle, sports, new-age living, self-development and entertainment.\n\n==Recent changes==\n{{Redirect|Indulge|for the extended play by Jones|Indulge (EP)}}\n[[File:City Express Bengaluru.jpg|thumb|220px|''City Express'' (Bengaluru) front page design as of September 2016]]\n[[File:The New Sunday Express front page design as of April 2011.jpg|thumb|right|220px|''The New Sunday Express'' front page design as of April 2011]]\n\nDuring late 2007/early 2008, there was a big shakeout of editorial staff, with many old hands leaving to make way for new.

In September 2010, the lifestyle pullout began a Bangalore edition.\n\nIt renamed all the city supplements, calling them ''City Express'' and focusing more on the respective city's culture and lifestyle, rather than hard news. Its other supplements, which appear on a weekly or fortnightly basis, are on career and education. The 24-page education supplement, called edex, was launched in early 2010. \"Indulge\" is another lifestyle supplement weekly published from major cities in South India on Fridays.\n\n\"The Sunday Standard\" is another publication, released as a weekly newspaper with 16 pages published from New Delhi, which comes with its weekly \"Sunday Standard Magazine\" of 12 pages.\n\nAt present, ''The New Indian Express'' is the only national daily which publishes news of the far-flung [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] every day.

The terminus at [[Tokyo Station]] is located underground, some distance to the south of the main station complex approximately halfway to [[Y\u016brakuch\u014d Station]]. This means transfer between other lines at Tokyo Station can take between 15 and 20 minutes.

This original plan would also allow through service with the [[Tokaido Main Line]], allowing freight trains from central and western Japan to reach Chiba and points east.\n\nHowever, in the 1990s, as the artificial island of [[Odaiba]] began developing as a commercial and tourist area in the middle of the Rinkai Line route, the Rinkai Line was re-purposed for use as a passenger line. While there is a through connection between the Rinkai Line and the Keiyo Line, it is only used by passenger trains in charter service, usually carrying groups to the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]].\n\n===Timeline===\n\n* 3 March 1986: First stage opened between {{STN|Minami-Funabashi}} and {{STN|Chibaminato}}.<ref name=\"railfan652\">{{cite magazine|last = Kubo |first =Satoshi |script-title=ja: \u6771\u4eac\u99c5\u958b\u696d100\u5468\u5e74-5 \u4eac\u8449\u7dda\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb|trans-title= Tokyo Station 100th Anniversary (5) Keiyo Line Terminal|magazine=[[Japan Railfan Magazine]] |volume = 55|issue = 652 |page =105 |publisher = Koyusha Co., Ltd. |location = Japan |language = Japanese |date = August 2015}}</ref>\n* 1 December 1988: Second stage opened between {{STN|Shin-Kiba}} and Minami-Funabashi, and between {{STN|Ichikawa-Shiohama||Ichikawashiohama}} and {{STN|Nishi-Funabashi}}.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 10 March 1990: Third stage opened between {{STN|Tokyo}} & Shin-Kiba;<ref name=\"railfan652\"/> and the new Keiyo Line train, the [[205 series]], was also introduced to the public.\n* 16 March 1991: ''[[Sazanami (train)|Sazanami]]'' and ''[[Wakashio]]'' limited express services are rerouted via the Keiyo Line.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 2 July 1993: [[255 series]] EMUs are introduced on ''View Sazanami'' and ''View Wakashio'' limited express services.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 16 October 2004: [[E257-500 series]] EMUs are introduced on ''Sazanami'' and ''Wakashio'' limited express services.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n\n==References==\nThis article incorporates material from the corresponding article in the Japanese Wikipedia.\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.jreast.co.jp/estation/result.aspx?mode=2&rosen=25=1=%E4%BA%AC%E8%91%89%E7%B7%9A Stations of the Keiy\u014d Line] (JR East) {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Tokyo transit}}\n{{East Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keiyo Line}}\n[[Category:Lines of East Japan Railway Company]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Chiba Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1975]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|text=the [[Kei\u014d Line]]}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2011}}\n{{Infobox rail line\n| box_width   =\n| name        = Keiy\u014d Line\n| native_name = \u4eac\u8449\u7dda\n| native_name_lang = ja\n| color       = DC143C <!-- Crimson -->\n| logo        = {{JRLS|JE|size=25}}\n| logo_width  = \n| image       = E233kei 5000bandai.JPG\n| image_width = 300px\n| caption     = A Keiy\u014d Line [[E233 series#E233-5000 series|E233-5000 series]] EMU in July 2010\n| type        = [[Commuter rail]]\n| system      =\n| status      = Operational\n| locale      = [[Tokyo]], [[Chiba Prefecture]]\n| start       = {{STN|Tokyo}}\n| end         = {{STN|Soga}}\n| stations    = 18\n| routes      =\n| daily_ridership = 714,053 (Daily 2015)<ref name =ridership>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mlit.go.jp/common/001179760.pdf|title=\u5e73\u621027\u5e74 \u5927\u90fd\u5e02\u4ea4\u901a\u30bb\u30f3\u30b5\u30b9 \u9996\u90fd\u5708\u5831\u544a\u66f8 |last=|first=|date=|website=P.92|publisher=\u56fd\u571f\u4ea4\u901a\u7701|access-date=}}</ref>\n| open        = 1975\n| close       =\n| owner       = [[JR East]]\n| operator    =\n| character   = Underground, at-grade, elevated\n| depot       = Narashino\n| stock       = [[E233-5000 series]], [[209-500 series]]\n| linelength  = {{convert|43|km|mi|abbr=on}}\n| tracklength =\n| tracks      =\n| gauge       = {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}}\n| electrification = 1,500 V DC [[overhead catenary]]\n| speed       = {{convert|100|km/h|mph|abbr=on|round=5}}\n| elevation   =\n| map         = [[File:JR Keiyo Line linemap.svg|250px]]\n| map_state   = collapsed\n}}\n\nThe {{nihongo|'''Keiy\u014d Line'''|\u4eac\u8449\u7dda|Keiy\u014d-sen}} is a railway line connecting [[Tokyo]] and [[Chiba (city)|Chiba]] in Japan, paralleling the edge of [[Tokyo Bay]].

This original plan would also allow through service with the [[Tokaido Main Line]], allowing freight trains from central and western Japan to reach Chiba and points east.\n\nHowever, in the 1990s, as the artificial island of [[Odaiba]] began developing as a commercial and tourist area in the middle of the Rinkai Line route, the Rinkai Line was re-purposed for use as a passenger line. While there is a through connection between the Rinkai Line and the Keiyo Line, it is only used by passenger trains in charter service, usually carrying groups to the [[Tokyo Disney Resort]].\n\n===Timeline===\n\n* 3 March 1986: First stage opened between {{STN|Minami-Funabashi}} and {{STN|Chibaminato}}.<ref name=\"railfan652\">{{cite magazine|last = Kubo |first =Satoshi |script-title=ja: \u6771\u4eac\u99c5\u958b\u696d100\u5468\u5e74-5 \u4eac\u8449\u7dda\u30bf\u30fc\u30df\u30ca\u30eb|trans-title= Tokyo Station 100th Anniversary (5) Keiyo Line Terminal|magazine=[[Japan Railfan Magazine]] |volume = 55|issue = 652 |page =105 |publisher = Koyusha Co., Ltd. |location = Japan |language = Japanese |date = August 2015}}</ref>\n* 1 December 1988: Second stage opened between {{STN|Shin-Kiba}} and Minami-Funabashi, and between {{STN|Ichikawa-Shiohama||Ichikawashiohama}} and {{STN|Nishi-Funabashi}}.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 10 March 1990: Third stage opened between {{STN|Tokyo}} & Shin-Kiba;<ref name=\"railfan652\"/> and the new Keiyo Line train, the [[205 series]], was also introduced to the public.\n* 16 March 1991: ''[[Sazanami (train)|Sazanami]]'' and ''[[Wakashio]]'' limited express services are rerouted via the Keiyo Line.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 2 July 1993: [[255 series]] EMUs are introduced on ''View Sazanami'' and ''View Wakashio'' limited express services.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n* 16 October 2004: [[E257-500 series]] EMUs are introduced on ''Sazanami'' and ''Wakashio'' limited express services.<ref name=\"railfan652\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [http://www.jreast.co.jp/estation/result.aspx?mode=2&rosen=25=1=%E4%BA%AC%E8%91%89%E7%B7%9A Stations of the Keiy\u014d Line] (JR East) {{in lang|ja}}\n\n{{Tokyo transit}}\n{{East Japan Railway Company Lines}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keiyo Line}}\n[[Category:Lines of East Japan Railway Company]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Chiba Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Rail transport in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:1067 mm gauge railways in Japan]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1975]]\n", "name_user": "Ellis678", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:added ref", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiy%C5%8D_Line"}
