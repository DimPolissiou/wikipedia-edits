Additionally he was the host of a Dutch television programme (''Zomergasten'') and appeared in theater with the Dutch writer [[Ronald Giphart]].\nBesides his work as a writer and columnist, he also frequently appeared on Dutch national television, in the program ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnnvara.nl/dewerelddraaitdoor/|title=De Wereld Draait Door - BNNVARA|website=De Wereld Draait Door}}</ref>  broadcast by [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bnnvara.nl/|title=BNNVARA - BNNVARA is een onafhankelijke, maatschappelijk betrokken en vooruitstrevende publieke omroep.|website=BNNVARA}}</ref> where he often held mini-lectures on art-related topics. As an amateur art lover himself, Zwagerman enjoyed transmitting his love for art to a wider audience.\n\nAs a writer Zwagerman was connected to two universities; in 1998 [[Rijksuniversiteit Groningen]] and 2003 [[Universiteit Leiden]]. He also lectured at the [[Radboud Universiteit Nijmegen]] during the Frans Kellendonk Lecture in 2006.\nIn January 2008, Zwagerman was awarded the [[Gouden Ganzenveer]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goudenganzenveer.nl/goudenganzenveer2008.html |title=Laureaat 2008: Joost Zwagerman |website=goudenganzenveer.nl |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628014206/http://www.goudenganzenveer.nl/goudenganzenveer2008.html |archivedate=28 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for his extraordinary contribution to the Dutch written culture.\n\nUntil his divorce, Joost Zwagerman lived with his wife and three children in [[Amsterdam]].

He feels akin to Lucebert, and he abhors the paper verse of introverted hermetics and meek-hearted dreamers (\"stumble, stiff romantic, mumble on\"). Poetry should have life, and preferably, in [[Lucebert]]\u2019s words, \"life in full\".\n\n[[File:Nacht van de Po\u00ebzie 2015 - Ilja Leonard Pfeijffer-1.jpg|thumb|Pfeijffer (2015)]]\n[[File:Ilja Pfeijffer signing Grand Hotel Europa Eindhoven 1.jpg|thumb|Pfeijffer at the signing of Grand Hotel Europa (2019)]]\n\nThus Pfeijffer, the \"gleaner of contrivances,\" quotes not only [[Pindar]] and [[Ezra Pound]], [[Horace]] and Lucebert, [[Sophocles]], [[Derek Walcott]], [[Herman Gorter]], Hans Faverey, [[Martinus Nijhoff]] and [[Gerard Reve]], but comic book characters as well. He not only writes about the political martyr [[Ken Saro Wiwa]], but also about [[C&A]] sweaters and [[Fiat]] Croma, [[barcode]]s, canned beer, butt-tight and [[garamond]] ten-point italic. The poet neither lacks humor or [[self-mockery]], nor seriousness for that matter, witness his hotly tender love poems: \"and though I sang and gave over my loins / and you failed to scorch my senses / I should be useless white on white.\"\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* [[C.
