To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore. Ruth enters the vacant hotel room and steals part of the $8 million Marty is supposed to launder. Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago. Agent Roy Petty decides to follow Marty to the Ozarks, convinced he is somehow involved.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration. During sex, Marty intentionally reminds her of an encounter with Sugarwood, causing her discovery of the video Marty's private investigator made. Charlotte works at the Blue Cat and declines Wyatt's \"anti-tourists\" party invitation to go with Zach, a tourist from Chicago.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead. After returning home, Charlotte goes for a night swim. Ignoring Marty's advice to stay near the shore, she swims far into the lake.

Marty expects Wendy will be opposed, but to his surprise, she approves. Bruce and Marty commit to work for Del, and Del has his previous financial advisor Louis killed in front of them. Not only was Louis skimming, which Del suspected and Marty confirmed when analyzing the ledgers, he was also informing to Roy at the FBI.

Eugenia dies in an accident, and Sam wants access to her savings to pay for her elaborate funeral. Instead, Marty and Wendy volunteer to pay, and end up buying the funeral home. Roy reveals to Russ that their relationship is a ploy, and he recorded Russ's admission of trying to kill Marty. This forces Russ to turn informant against Ruth, who Roy intends to turn informant on Marty. Instead, Russ and his brother Boyd plan to rob and kill Marty to finance a life on the run.

Roy makes Ruth look like an informant, and Helen asks the Byrdes whether she can be trusted. Marty hesitates before saying yes, then races to the Langmores to warn Ruth. Ruth admits she tried to kill Marty, but says she will not try again because circumstances have changed, so he vouches for her to Helen, but Helen's associates subject Ruth to [[waterboarding]] interrogation.

Roy interrogates Wilkes, who offers to inform on Marty in exchange for Wendy's protection, but she refuses to leave Marty. Ruth agrees to help her father with his illegal activities, deciding that working with Marty will not produce the long term benefits she hoped for.

To save his own life, Marty uses a promotional flier Bruce showed him as the inspiration for a spur-of-the-moment claim that the Ozarks are a good potential location for laundering, and that if allowed to live, he will wash $500 million in five years. Partly persuaded, Del gives Marty a few days to replace the $8 million Bruce stole, which he does by liquidating all his personal assets and closing all the company accounts. Del then tells Marty to move his family to the Ozarks and prove his claim by laundering the $8 million in three months. Marty's wife Wendy is having an affair with Gary \"Sugarwood\" Silverberg.

Charlotte and Jonah disregard their parents' instructions to guard the hotel room, with Charlotte falling for a ruse planned by cousins Ruth and Wyatt Langmore.

Marty risks his life to recover the cash from Ruth, Wyatt and other Langmores, but it is clear they will continue to be trouble. The FBI discovers the remains of Bruce and the others who were killed with him, which makes them suspicious of Marty's sudden move from Chicago.

Marty appears likely to meet the three-month deadline for laundering the cartel's $8 million, and he and Wendy temporarily reconcile in celebration.

Understanding Marty's claims of philanthropy and temporary construction delays are false, Mason burns down the building's framework. Charlotte and Jonah start school, and Charlotte is depressed about the family's changed circumstances. After she skips classes to take a bus to Chicago, Ruth and Wendy catch up in St. Louis and bring her back. Roy convinces Russ to try starting a bait and tackle shop and get Marty to invest. Roy also convinces Russ to say that he will not be involved in any more attempts to kill Marty. Cade tells Ruth not to visit him in prison again unless Marty is dead.

The CSA developed from a [[Baptists|Baptist]] congregation called the '''Zarephath-Horeb Community Church''', founded in 1971 in the small community of [[Elijah, Missouri|Elijah]] in southern [[Missouri]]. Over time, Zarephath-Horeb evolved into an extremist paramilitary organization and was rechristened CSA. The group operated a large compound in northern [[Arkansas]] called \"the Farm\". In April 1985, law enforcement officers investigating the group for weapons violations and terrorist acts carried out a siege against the compound. After a peaceful resolution, officers arrested and later convicted CSA's top leaders, and the organization dissolved.\n\n==Leadership==\n\nThe founder of the CSA was [[James Ellison (polygamist)|James Ellison]], who was jailed in federal prison along with his \"high priest\" Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar became one of Ellison's spiritual advisers, and was also the founder of [[Elohim City]]. Ellison was also mentored by [[Richard Girnt Butler]], founder of the [[Aryan Nations]] and [[Robert E. Miles]], founder of the Mountain Church in [[Cohoctah, Michigan]]. Both extreme right-wing leaders taught and practiced the theology of Christian Identity, a belief system that the FBI includes on its watch list as an extremist religion. Ellison had close ties to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the Aryan Nations, based in [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]], and led by [[Richard Girnt Butler]], who was described as \"the glue of the Aryan Nations movement in the Northwest, if not the country\" by the supervisor of the Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force.<ref>Associated Press in Los Angeles Times/August 28 ????</ref> Miles had a prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to the violent white Aryan groups, of which there are many, most notably, the [[Aryan Brotherhood]]. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter.\n\nThe entire Council of Elders in the CSA community were deeply influenced and mentored by many outside sources. This nine-man council deliberated on both the spiritual meaning and the direction of CSA activities. Jim Ellison, Kerry Noble, and William Wade were the only known members of the council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boadd2Ecug8C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=four+individuals+indicted+in+seattle+csa+members&source=bl&ots=amcTeYltyn&sig=iZ_hzxZXk2Gg1MmvsrIE510iBdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM1rXxza_fAhVJG6wKHT7dDbEQ6AEwAnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=four+individuals+indicted+in+seattle+csa+members&f=false|title=Terrorism in America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams|first=Brent L.|last=Smith|date=January 1, 1994|publisher=SUNY Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/sociology/research-centers/terrorism.../piita.docx{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nIn June 1982, the CSA had an estimated 90 to 120 members, consisting of men, women, and children.

There they trained their members in [[paramilitary]] operations. The group believed in [[white supremacy]] and was [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]. Like other prominent anti-Semitic groups that believed in [[antisemitic canard]]s, they referred to the United States Government as ''ZOG'', short for [[Zionist Occupied Government]].  The military leader, who used the name Randall Rader during his stay at the CSA compound, left the group in a rift with Ellison and joined the newly forming group [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] in Idaho. The CSA initially professed the belief that the United States government would dissolve due to its corruption, whereas The Order advocated revolution. However, in July 1983, The CSA published a manifesto called '''A.T.T.A.C.K. (Aryan Tactical Treaty for the Advancement of Christ\u2019s Kingdom)''' which declared a war against the government. This was seen by followers as the [[Second American Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/1227830/Criminal-Justice-Reference-214217|title=Criminal Justice Reference: 214217 &#124; Crimes &#124; Crime & Justice|website=Scribd}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nCSA assassins monitored the homes of their targets, practiced mock assassinations of these targets with scoped rifles, and practiced attacks in a mock residential training facility known as '''Silhouette City'''. The perimeter of the CSA compound had 100, 200, and {{convert|300|yd|sing=on}} indicator plates nailed to trees to allow the defenders to adjust their sights accordingly to engage attackers. The central rallying point in the event of an attack was a concrete bunkhouse that housed the communications radios next to the {{convert|95|ft|m|sing=on}} tower, which was constructed for defense. The perimeter of the compound had built-in bunkers for one to three men, and each was numbered as a post and assigned to individuals as an area of responsibility. \n\nThe line infantryman carried a [[Ruger Mini-14]] [[.223 Remington]] rifle. As in the early days of the [[United States Marine Corps]], the squads were set up in four-man fire teams. One man in the fire team carried a [[Heckler and Koch]] Model 91 rifle in .308 caliber. These had been modified via a technique that the organization sold to \"brother groups,\" converting the rifles to an illegal [[selective fire]] weapon (capable of firing either single shots or fully automatic). The Elite \"A\" Team had black clothing and some fairly sophisticated weapons, such as the .22 caliber Ruger target pistol fitted with an integral silencer, and several [[MAC-10]] submachineguns in both 9&nbsp; mm and .45 ACP, also with attached suppressors. These men trained in the covert aspects of military action and were to be the core of the defense initiative.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF) later determined that the CSA had obtained 155 [[Krugerrand]]s, one live light antitank rocket, 94 long arms, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns, and machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and a quantity of C-4 explosives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/covenant_the_sword_the_arm_of_the_lord/covenant_the_sword_the_arm_of_the_lord_part02.pdf|format=PDF|title= FOIA release of FBI documents on CSAL dated 7 October 1987|website=foaia.fbi.gov}}</ref>\n\nWithin \"Silhouette City\", the CSA also ran a [[Training camp|boot camp]]-style program known as the ''End Time Overcomer Survival Training School'' - which was conducted by [[The Order (white supremacist group)|Order]] member, [[Randall Rader (white supremacist)|Randall Rader]]. Here, the group trained an estimated 1,500 of like-minded Christian Identity adherents in combat techniques and paramilitary exercises. Upon completing this training, a newly-trained militant would leave to join or start other similar militia groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGFLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&source=bl&ots=BFGQL-SZWB&sig=cDxJCTgLDLxPZAo1I7aReJZiHZ4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVqLTFpK3fAhUNQq0KHWRcCmQQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&f=false|title=Faces of Right Wing Extremism|first=Kathy|last=Marks|date=August 13, 1996|publisher=Branden Books|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HslmCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT80&lpg=PT80&dq=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&source=bl&ots=4tgAxP2-yc&sig=ny3zzPZcOHAltB5KMG9EPz3ZCB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVqLTFpK3fAhUNQq0KHWRcCmQQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&f=false|title=Understanding Apocalyptic Terrorism: Countering the Radical Mindset|first=Frances L.|last=Flannery|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe CSA and its paramilitary arm taught basic pistol and rifle use as well as personal home defense, rural and urban warfare, weapons proficiency, general military fieldcraft, Christian martial arts, and natural wilderness survival.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1983, CSA member [[William Thomas (criminal)|William Thomas]] accompanying [[Richard Wayne Snell]] and Steven Scott attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline which crossed the Red River on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago. This event ran as part of the group's A.T.T.A.C.K. operations. According to Kerry Noble, the group predicted this to result in riots (due to it being in winter). However, the trio was unsuccessful in carrying out the act of terror.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n\nThe CSA had links with other radical organizations, including the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the Mountain Church, and [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], which were all dangerous white supremacist organizations which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government. Many of their members were seen traveling in and out of the compound, and after a search of the compound, several stolen vehicles including one belonging to The Order were recovered.\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the [[California Department of Justice]], The [[Pagans Motorcycle Club]] provided the CSA with training in [[booby trap]] devices and survival techniques in return for weapons and ammunition.<ref>https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147691NCJRS.pdf</ref>\n\nThings began to go downhill for the organization after Snell, an alleged member, was arrested for killing an [[African-American]] police officer. Snell was later tied to the killing of a gun store owner in 1981, obtaining and using the same gun, the serial number of which had been removed by the CSA armorer, Kent Yates. Yates was arrested on Friday, July 13, 1984, on an outstanding warrant out of [[New Mexico]] for firearms violations in [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]]. He was later also charged and convicted of weapons manufacture and modification for the CSA.\n\nAfter the incident with Snell, the FBI began to seek ways to infiltrate the CSA compound and stop the organization which was deemed dangerous. Its agents obtained warrants under Arkansas state law to arrest Ellison, the leader of the CSA, for multiple firearms violations. (The FBI later claimed that at all times it had an \"inside man\" in the CSA.)\n\n==Siege==\nOn 16 April 1985, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the CSA compound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation documents, Subject: The Covenant, the Sword, the Arm of the Lord, File: 100-HQ-487200\", Memo from 20 May 1985|website= FBI Vault|accessdate= 31 January 2016|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20Part%201%20of%202/at_download/file}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on 19 April 1985, the FBI and the ATF, led by the FBI's [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT), positioned around 300 federal agents in Elijah. It was necessary to keep the operation a secret, but this was not easy in the small community. However, the FBI and ATF agents took advantage of Elijah being a common destination for anglers by pretending to be fishermen and registering at different motels near the various fishing destinations.<ref>{{cite video | people=Wiecha, Joe (Director) | date=2004 | title=The FBI Files: Brotherhood of Hate  | medium=television documentary | location=USA | publisher=New Dominion Pictures}}</ref> On the morning of 19 April, they moved in and surrounded the CSA compound, putting some of their agents in fishing boats to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers and walked towards a sniper hold-out until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound, with which the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents and reported to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later. FBI agents had expected that he would not go down without a firefight, but the FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose if they had one. They convinced him that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI instructed him to call in every 30 minutes to report on how negotiations were going.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation documents, Subject: The Covenant, the Sword, the Arm of the Lord, File: 100-HQ-487200\", Memo from 20 May 1985|website= FBI Vault|accessdate= 31 January 2016 |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20Part%201%20of%202/at_download/file}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Attorney [[Asa Hutchinson]], who later successfully prosecuted Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound to join the negotiations, leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed stand-off. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Arkansas State Police entered the compound and escorted out the remaining members without further bloodshed. Women and children had earlier been evacuated to nearby motels.\n\n==Charges==\nEllison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession and racketeering. In September 1985, Ellison, Kerry Noble, and four other CSA members (Gary Stone, Timothy Russell, Rudy Loewen, and David Giles) were sentenced to lengthy federal prison terms. A seventh CSA member, Stephen Scott, pleaded guilty in an Arkansas federal court to charges he dynamited a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas in 1983, and was also sent to prison. Ex-CSA member Kent Yates also pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to make and transfer automatic weapons silencers.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/CovenantSwordArmOfTheLordJamesEllisonKansasCity100A16708 The Covenant, Sword, Arm Of The Lord - James Ellison - Kansas City 100A-16708].</ref>\n\nEllison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after he was convicted on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|federal racketeering]] and weapons charges. However, Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the [[Aryan Nations]]. All seven men were arrested and indicted on charges of [[sedition]]. The jury found all the defendants not guilty on all charges. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to [[Elohim City]].\n\n[[Richard Wayne Snell]], the man who shot and killed the police officer and a pawn shop owner, was sentenced to death by lethal injection, which was carried out on 19 April 1995, the same day as the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\n==Possible ties to the Oklahoma City bombing==\nThere are several claims that the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]] on the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] was tied to the \"New Day\" teachings of Elohim City. No proof, however, has been established. Elohim City was assembled to gather \"prophets of the New Day\". Leader Robert G. Millar envisioned himself to be the \"Shepherd of Shepherds\" traveling to numerous alternative societies, many of which were and are still communes. His ambition was to unite these underground organizations. He appeared several times at the [[Padanaram Settlement]], in southern [[Indiana]], but contrary to reports, members of the Padanaram Settlement did not concur with the radical callings of either Millar or Ellison, who made two appearances there. \"The Valley\" was and still is known more for being a cultural hub for artists and philosophers, and until roughly 2003 it operated a sawmill.<ref name=AT>{{cite book |last1=Michel |first1=Lou |last2=Herbeck |first2=Dan |title=American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh & the Tragedy at Oklahoma City |publisher=Harper |year=2002 |isbn=978-0061065187}}</ref>\n\n[[Timothy McVeigh]], who was convicted and executed for perpetrating the Oklahoma City bombing, had no association with the CSA and had just enlisted in the U.S Army when the CSA compound was besieged and broken up. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred exactly on the 10th anniversary of the start of the siege of the CSA compound in 1985. The most plausible link is the fact that Richard Wayne Snell, who was executed on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, had planned a similar attack on the Murrah building in 1983 after becoming upset with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Additionally, Snell was heard taunting jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. However, McVeigh has stated that he chose the date of 19 April to coincide with the violent end of the [[Waco siege]] exactly two years prior. McVeigh had traveled and visited Waco during the 51-day siege and cited it and 1992 [[Ruby Ridge]] events as his primary motivation for carrying out the bombing.\n\nThe single incident in which the CSA was involved, the robbery of a pawn shop in [[Springfield, Missouri]], was in fact, foiled by a CSA member on the orders of Jim Ellison, unknown to Wayne Snell, who headed up the plan. It was regarding this event in which Ellison saw a \"sign from God\" which he interpreted to mean that they should not carry out the attempt; not the attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building.<ref name=AT/>\n\nThe death knell of the CSA was its attempt to kill FBI special agent [[Jack Knox]], the lead agent assigned to investigate the group; Asa Hutchinson, the federal prosecutor; and the federal judge who presided over the affair that brought about the eventual action against [[Gordon Kahl]], a tax protester and a member of the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]], by federal agents at CSA member, [[Leonard Ginter]]'s home (called 'The Bunker', due to its construction from concrete covered with earth). Ellison revered Kahl as a hero. Like McVeigh, Kahl was a decorated American soldier; Kahl earned a Silver Star in the [[Korean War]], and McVeigh earned a Bronze Star in the first [[Gulf War]] \u2013 Desert Storm.<ref name=AT/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Media==\nIn 2013, Kerry Noble appeared on the [[Investigation Discovery]] show ''Dangerous Persuasions'' talking about his time with the group. He was also interviewed for an episode of ''Brainwashed'' on the [[Slice Network]] in Canada and discussed his time with the CSA.\n\nThe [[Discovery Channel]] crime series ''[[The FBI Files]]''' [[List of The FBI Files episodes#Season 6 .281998.E8.80.9399.29|sixth season]] featured an episode whose topic was the CSA.

The CSA developed from a [[Baptists|Baptist]] congregation called the '''Zarephath-Horeb Community Church''', founded in 1971 in the small community of [[Elijah, Missouri|Elijah]] in southern [[Missouri]]. Over time, Zarephath-Horeb evolved into an extremist paramilitary organization and was rechristened CSA. The group operated a large compound in northern [[Arkansas]] called \"the Farm\". In April 1985, law enforcement officers investigating the group for weapons violations and terrorist acts carried out a siege against the compound. After a peaceful resolution, officers arrested and later convicted CSA's top leaders, and the organization dissolved.\n\n==Leadership==\n\nThe founder of the CSA was [[James Ellison (polygamist)|James Ellison]], who was jailed in federal prison along with his \"high priest\" Kerry Noble. Robert G. Millar became one of Ellison's spiritual advisers, and was also the founder of [[Elohim City]]. Ellison was also mentored by [[Richard Girnt Butler]], founder of the [[Aryan Nations]] and [[Robert E. Miles]], founder of the Mountain Church in [[Cohoctah, Michigan]]. Both extreme right-wing leaders taught and practiced the theology of Christian Identity, a belief system that the FBI includes on its watch list as an extremist religion. Ellison had close ties to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the Aryan Nations, based in [[Hayden Lake, Idaho]], and led by [[Richard Girnt Butler]], who was described as \"the glue of the Aryan Nations movement in the Northwest, if not the country\" by the supervisor of the Inland Northwest Joint Terrorism Task Force.<ref>Associated Press in Los Angeles Times/August 28 ????</ref> Miles had a prison ministry and newsletter, relating mostly to the violent white Aryan groups, of which there are many, most notably, the [[Aryan Brotherhood]]. After Ellison was released from prison, he moved to Elohim City, where he married Millar's granddaughter.\n\nThe entire Council of Elders in the CSA community were deeply influenced and mentored by many outside sources. This nine-man council deliberated on both the spiritual meaning and the direction of CSA activities. Jim Ellison, Kerry Noble, and William Wade were the only known members of the council.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=boadd2Ecug8C&pg=PA45&lpg=PA45&dq=four+individuals+indicted+in+seattle+csa+members&source=bl&ots=amcTeYltyn&sig=iZ_hzxZXk2Gg1MmvsrIE510iBdA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjM1rXxza_fAhVJG6wKHT7dDbEQ6AEwAnoECAsQAQ#v=onepage&q=four+individuals+indicted+in+seattle+csa+members&f=false|title=Terrorism in America: Pipe Bombs and Pipe Dreams|first=Brent L.|last=Smith|date=January 1, 1994|publisher=SUNY Press|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">https://fulbright.uark.edu/departments/sociology/research-centers/terrorism.../piita.docx{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Members==\nIn June 1982, the CSA had an estimated 90 to 120 members, consisting of men, women, and children.

There they trained their members in [[paramilitary]] operations. The group believed in [[white supremacy]] and was [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]. Like other prominent anti-Semitic groups that believed in [[antisemitic canard]]s, they referred to the United States Government as ''ZOG'', short for [[Zionist Occupied Government]].  The military leader, who used the name Randall Rader during his stay at the CSA compound, left the group in a rift with Ellison and joined the newly forming group [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]] in Idaho. The CSA initially professed the belief that the United States government would dissolve due to its corruption, whereas The Order advocated revolution. However, in July 1983, The CSA published a manifesto called '''A.T.T.A.C.K. (Aryan Tactical Treaty for the Advancement of Christ\u2019s Kingdom)''' which declared a war against the government. This was seen by followers as the [[Second American Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/1227830/Criminal-Justice-Reference-214217|title=Criminal Justice Reference: 214217 &#124; Crimes &#124; Crime & Justice|website=Scribd}}</ref>\n\n==Operations==\nCSA assassins monitored the homes of their targets, practiced mock assassinations of these targets with scoped rifles, and practiced attacks in a mock residential training facility known as '''Silhouette City'''. The perimeter of the CSA compound had 100, 200, and {{convert|300|yd|sing=on}} indicator plates nailed to trees to allow the defenders to adjust their sights accordingly to engage attackers. The central rallying point in the event of an attack was a concrete bunkhouse that housed the communications radios next to the {{convert|95|ft|m|sing=on}} tower, which was constructed for defense. The perimeter of the compound had built-in bunkers for one to three men, and each was numbered as a post and assigned to individuals as an area of responsibility. \n\nThe line infantryman carried a [[Ruger Mini-14]] [[.223 Remington]] rifle. As in the early days of the [[United States Marine Corps]], the squads were set up in four-man fire teams. One man in the fire team carried a [[Heckler and Koch]] Model 91 rifle in .308 caliber. These had been modified via a technique that the organization sold to \"brother groups,\" converting the rifles to an illegal [[selective fire]] weapon (capable of firing either single shots or fully automatic). The Elite \"A\" Team had black clothing and some fairly sophisticated weapons, such as the .22 caliber Ruger target pistol fitted with an integral silencer, and several [[MAC-10]] submachineguns in both 9&nbsp; mm and .45 ACP, also with attached suppressors. These men trained in the covert aspects of military action and were to be the core of the defense initiative.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms]] (ATF) later determined that the CSA had obtained 155 [[Krugerrand]]s, one live light antitank rocket, 94 long arms, 30 handguns, 35 sawed-off shotguns, and machine guns, one heavy machine gun, and a quantity of C-4 explosives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://foia.fbi.gov/covenant_the_sword_the_arm_of_the_lord/covenant_the_sword_the_arm_of_the_lord_part02.pdf|format=PDF|title= FOIA release of FBI documents on CSAL dated 7 October 1987|website=foaia.fbi.gov}}</ref>\n\nWithin \"Silhouette City\", the CSA also ran a [[Training camp|boot camp]]-style program known as the ''End Time Overcomer Survival Training School'' - which was conducted by [[The Order (white supremacist group)|Order]] member, [[Randall Rader (white supremacist)|Randall Rader]]. Here, the group trained an estimated 1,500 of like-minded Christian Identity adherents in combat techniques and paramilitary exercises. Upon completing this training, a newly-trained militant would leave to join or start other similar militia groups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SGFLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA148&lpg=PA148&dq=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&source=bl&ots=BFGQL-SZWB&sig=cDxJCTgLDLxPZAo1I7aReJZiHZ4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVqLTFpK3fAhUNQq0KHWRcCmQQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&f=false|title=Faces of Right Wing Extremism|first=Kathy|last=Marks|date=August 13, 1996|publisher=Branden Books|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HslmCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT80&lpg=PT80&dq=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&source=bl&ots=4tgAxP2-yc&sig=ny3zzPZcOHAltB5KMG9EPz3ZCB8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiVqLTFpK3fAhUNQq0KHWRcCmQQ6AEwAnoECAMQAQ#v=onepage&q=end+time+overcomer+survival+training+school&f=false|title=Understanding Apocalyptic Terrorism: Countering the Radical Mindset|first=Frances L.|last=Flannery|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=Routledge|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe CSA and its paramilitary arm taught basic pistol and rifle use as well as personal home defense, rural and urban warfare, weapons proficiency, general military fieldcraft, Christian martial arts, and natural wilderness survival.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nIn 1983, CSA member [[William Thomas (criminal)|William Thomas]] accompanying [[Richard Wayne Snell]] and Steven Scott attempted to dynamite a natural gas pipeline which crossed the Red River on its way from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago. This event ran as part of the group's A.T.T.A.C.K. operations. According to Kerry Noble, the group predicted this to result in riots (due to it being in winter). However, the trio was unsuccessful in carrying out the act of terror.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n\nThe CSA had links with other radical organizations, including the [[Aryan Brotherhood]], the Mountain Church, and [[The Order (white supremacist group)|The Order]], which were all dangerous white supremacist organizations which advocated the violent overthrow of the United States Government. Many of their members were seen traveling in and out of the compound, and after a search of the compound, several stolen vehicles including one belonging to The Order were recovered.\n\nAccording to a report conducted by the [[California Department of Justice]], The [[Pagans Motorcycle Club]] provided the CSA with training in [[booby trap]] devices and survival techniques in return for weapons and ammunition.<ref>https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/147691NCJRS.pdf</ref>\n\nThings began to go downhill for the organization after Snell, an alleged member, was arrested for killing an [[African-American]] police officer. Snell was later tied to the killing of a gun store owner in 1981, obtaining and using the same gun, the serial number of which had been removed by the CSA armorer, Kent Yates. Yates was arrested on Friday, July 13, 1984, on an outstanding warrant out of [[New Mexico]] for firearms violations in [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]]. He was later also charged and convicted of weapons manufacture and modification for the CSA.\n\nAfter the incident with Snell, the FBI began to seek ways to infiltrate the CSA compound and stop the organization which was deemed dangerous. Its agents obtained warrants under Arkansas state law to arrest Ellison, the leader of the CSA, for multiple firearms violations. (The FBI later claimed that at all times it had an \"inside man\" in the CSA.)\n\n==Siege==\nOn 16 April 1985, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the CSA compound.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation documents, Subject: The Covenant, the Sword, the Arm of the Lord, File: 100-HQ-487200\", Memo from 20 May 1985|website= FBI Vault|accessdate= 31 January 2016|url=https://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20Part%201%20of%202/at_download/file}}</ref>\n\nBeginning on 19 April 1985, the FBI and the ATF, led by the FBI's [[Hostage Rescue Team]] (HRT), positioned around 300 federal agents in Elijah.

However, the FBI and ATF agents took advantage of Elijah being a common destination for anglers by pretending to be fishermen and registering at different motels near the various fishing destinations.<ref>{{cite video | people=Wiecha, Joe (Director) | date=2004 | title=The FBI Files: Brotherhood of Hate  | medium=television documentary | location=USA | publisher=New Dominion Pictures}}</ref> On the morning of 19 April, they moved in and surrounded the CSA compound, putting some of their agents in fishing boats to seal off the lakeside area of the compound. There they waited, until a few hours later when two guards emerged from the compound. They appeared to be unaware of the presence of the officers and walked towards a sniper hold-out until an officer yelled commands to return to the compound, with which the guards complied. Later, an unnamed individual emerged from the compound and talked with the federal agents and reported to Ellison that the FBI agents were outside and willing to negotiate his surrender and the emptying of the compound. Ellison emerged later. FBI agents had expected that he would not go down without a firefight, but the FBI negotiators convinced him that the CSA would certainly lose if they had one. They convinced him that they wanted peaceful cooperation, and he asked that his spiritual adviser, assumed to be Millar, come to the compound to instruct him. The individual was flown to the area and seemed eager to convince Ellison to stand down. They allowed the individual into the compound, and the FBI instructed him to call in every 30 minutes to report on how negotiations were going.<ref>{{cite web|title=Federal Bureau of Investigation documents, Subject: The Covenant, the Sword, the Arm of the Lord, File: 100-HQ-487200\", Memo from 20 May 1985|website= FBI Vault|accessdate= 31 January 2016 |url=https://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20/The%20Covenant%20The%20Sword%20The%20Arm%20of%20the%20Lord%20Part%201%20of%202/at_download/file}}</ref>\n\nU.S. Attorney [[Asa Hutchinson]], who later successfully prosecuted Ellison and other leaders of the CSA, put on an FBI flak jacket and entered the compound to join the negotiations, leading to a peaceful conclusion to the armed stand-off. After several calls requesting more time, early on the morning of the fourth day of the siege, Arkansas State Police entered the compound and escorted out the remaining members without further bloodshed. Women and children had earlier been evacuated to nearby motels.\n\n==Charges==\nEllison and most of his leadership were charged in federal court with illegal weapons possession and racketeering. In September 1985, Ellison, Kerry Noble, and four other CSA members (Gary Stone, Timothy Russell, Rudy Loewen, and David Giles) were sentenced to lengthy federal prison terms. A seventh CSA member, Stephen Scott, pleaded guilty in an Arkansas federal court to charges he dynamited a natural gas pipeline near Fulton, Arkansas in 1983, and was also sent to prison. Ex-CSA member Kent Yates also pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to make and transfer automatic weapons silencers.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/CovenantSwordArmOfTheLordJamesEllisonKansasCity100A16708 The Covenant, Sword, Arm Of The Lord - James Ellison - Kansas City 100A-16708].</ref>\n\nEllison faced the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison after he was convicted on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|federal racketeering]] and weapons charges. However, Ellison was released in 1987 after agreeing to testify against the leader and six senior members of the [[Aryan Nations]]. All seven men were arrested and indicted on charges of [[sedition]]. The jury found all the defendants not guilty on all charges. Upon his release from federal prison, Ellison moved to [[Elohim City]].\n\n[[Richard Wayne Snell]], the man who shot and killed the police officer and a pawn shop owner, was sentenced to death by lethal injection, which was carried out on 19 April 1995, the same day as the Oklahoma City bombing.\n\n==Possible ties to the Oklahoma City bombing==\nThere are several claims that the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]] on the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] was tied to the \"New Day\" teachings of Elohim City. No proof, however, has been established. Elohim City was assembled to gather \"prophets of the New Day\". Leader Robert G. Millar envisioned himself to be the \"Shepherd of Shepherds\" traveling to numerous alternative societies, many of which were and are still communes. His ambition was to unite these underground organizations. He appeared several times at the [[Padanaram Settlement]], in southern [[Indiana]], but contrary to reports, members of the Padanaram Settlement did not concur with the radical callings of either Millar or Ellison, who made two appearances there. \"The Valley\" was and still is known more for being a cultural hub for artists and philosophers, and until roughly 2003 it operated a sawmill.<ref name=AT>{{cite book |last1=Michel |first1=Lou |last2=Herbeck |first2=Dan |title=American Terrorist: Timothy McVeigh & the Tragedy at Oklahoma City |publisher=Harper |year=2002 |isbn=978-0061065187}}</ref>\n\n[[Timothy McVeigh]], who was convicted and executed for perpetuating the Oklahoma City bombing, had no association with the CSA and had just enlisted in the U.S Army when the CSA compound was besieged and broken up. The Oklahoma City bombing occurred exactly on the 10th anniversary of the start of the siege of the CSA compound in 1985. The most plausible link is the fact that Richard Wayne Snell, who was executed on the day of the Oklahoma City bombing, had planned a similar attack on the Murrah building in 1983 after becoming upset with the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. Additionally, Snell was heard taunting jailers that something drastic would happen on the day of his execution. However, McVeigh has stated that he chose the date of 19 April to coincide with the violent end of the [[Waco siege]] exactly two years prior. McVeigh had traveled and visited Waco during the 51-day siege and cited it and 1992 [[Ruby Ridge]] events as his primary motivation for carrying out the bombing.\n\nThe single incident in which the CSA was involved, the robbery of a pawn shop in [[Springfield, Missouri]], was in fact, foiled by a CSA member on the orders of Jim Ellison, unknown to Wayne Snell, who headed up the plan. It was regarding this event in which Ellison saw a \"sign from God\" which he interpreted to mean that they should not carry out the attempt; not the attack on the Oklahoma City Federal Building.<ref name=AT/>\n\nThe death knell of the CSA was its attempt to kill FBI special agent [[Jack Knox]], the lead agent assigned to investigate the group; Asa Hutchinson, the federal prosecutor; and the federal judge who presided over the affair that brought about the eventual action against [[Gordon Kahl]], a tax protester and a member of the [[Posse Comitatus (organization)|Posse Comitatus]], by federal agents at CSA member, [[Leonard Ginter]]'s home (called 'The Bunker', due to its construction from concrete covered with earth). Ellison revered Kahl as a hero. Like McVeigh, Kahl was a decorated American soldier; Kahl earned a Silver Star in the [[Korean War]], and McVeigh earned a Bronze Star in the first [[Gulf War]] \u2013 Desert Storm.<ref name=AT/><ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Media==\nIn 2013, Kerry Noble appeared on the [[Investigation Discovery]] show ''Dangerous Persuasions'' talking about his time with the group. He was also interviewed for an episode of ''Brainwashed'' on the [[Slice Network]] in Canada and discussed his time with the CSA.\n\nThe [[Discovery Channel]] crime series ''[[The FBI Files]]''' [[List of The FBI Files episodes#Season 6 .281998.E8.80.9399.29|sixth season]] featured an episode whose topic was the CSA. The episode reveals the details of the federal investigation into the group, the 1985 siege, and the aftermath.

Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Per\u00f3n envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples.<ref>Rathkolb 2004, p. 220.</ref> The first airframe ('''No. 01''') reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.<ref name=\"Paul p. 145\">Paul 1960, p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe first of the \"flying\" IAe 33 prototypes, ('''No. 02''') built in 1950, {{#tag:ref|Due to the recurrent modifications and difficulties encountered in flight testing, Tank reverted to employing the standard prototype testing regime before committing to further prototypes or production aircraft.<ref name=\"Green\"/>|group=N}}completed its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls.<ref name=\"Paul p. 145\"/> On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over {{convert|700|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and returned to the airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the \"tricky\" landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater \"throw\". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33.<ref name=\"Green\"/> More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from [[stall (flight)|tip stall]]\u2014 in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable \"rolling moment\"\u2014 leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues.

Meanwhile, plans for an alternative replacement of the hundred aging Meteor F4s obtained in the late 1940s that constituted the backbone of the Air Force continued, initially centered on the acquisition of 36 [[Canadair Sabre|Canadair CL-13B Mk 6 Sabres]], an idea which was dropped in 1956 because the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] was unable to provide the necessary foreign exchange.<ref name=\"Paul p. 179\">Paul 1960, p. 179.</ref>\n\nWith the Canadair Sabre no longer a viable option, the ''F\u00e1brica Militar de Aviones'' seriously considered having the Pulqui II enter series production.<ref name=\"Paul p. 179\"/> A new prototype was ordered in 1957, despite the United States having offered 100 combat-proven F-86 Sabre fighters with Orenda engines that were available immediately.

Due to the lack of modern machinery, the all-metal fabrication relied heavily on handcrafting, and fabricating the prototypes was a labor-intensive procedure. President Per\u00f3n envisioned that a benefit of setting up an aviation factory in Argentina would be to introduce production standards comparable to world-class manufacturing facilities. However, Tank realized that production tools and jigs were not feasible at this stage and relied instead on essentially hand-built examples.<ref>Rathkolb 2004, p. 220.</ref> The first airframe ('''No. 01''') reserved for static testing, was subsequently destroyed during the tests.<ref name=\"Paul p. 145\">Paul 1960, p. 145.</ref>\n\nThe first of the \"flying\" IAe 33 prototypes, ('''No. 02''') built in 1950, {{#tag:ref|Due to the recurrent modifications and difficulties encountered in flight testing, Tank reverted to employing the standard prototype testing regime before committing to further prototypes or production aircraft.<ref name=\"Green\"/>|group=N}}completed its maiden flight on 27 June of that year, with Captain Edmundo Weiss at the controls.<ref name=\"Paul p. 145\"/> On the second flight, ex-Focke-Wulf test pilot Otto Behrens encountered severe lateral stability problems at speeds over {{convert|700|km/h|0|abbr=on}} and returned to the airfield as a precaution. Landing at very high speed, the aircraft bounced with sufficient force to cause the right main undercarriage strut to fail. During repairs to the aircraft, in order to rectify the \"tricky\" landing characteristics, the front undercarriage strut was increased in length, which served to alter the angle of incidence of the aircraft, while the shock absorbers were adjusted to have a greater \"throw\". Although never considered docile, the modifications improved the takeoff, landing and low-speed characteristics of the IAe 33.<ref name=\"Green\"/> More serious aerodynamic problems persisted, stemming from [[stall (flight)|tip stall]]\u2014 in which the wingtip stalled before the wingroot resulting in an unpredictable \"rolling moment\"\u2014 leading to a change in the wing leading edge near the wingroot, while the rudder was modified in an attempt to resolve the interminable lateral instability issues.

After struggling with the [[Martin-Baker]] Mk I [[ejection seat]], Mannuwal ejected at low altitude while the aircraft was inverted. His parachute did not fully deploy, however, and he was killed.<ref name=\"Calcaterra\"/> The defect in the Pulqui II was traced to faulty workmanship related to welding the joint pin that fastened the wing to the fuselage.
