It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the Real IRA went on ceasefire, but resumed operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997. The Real IRA has also been involved in [[vigilantism in Northern Ireland|vigilantism]], mainly against drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it has been accused of extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA.

It formed in 1997 following a split in the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] by dissident members, who rejected the IRA's [[ceasefire]] that year. Like the Provisional IRA before it, the Real IRA sees itself as the only rightful successor to the original [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u20131922)|Irish Republican Army]] and styles itself as simply \"the Irish Republican Army\" in English or ''[[\u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann]]'' in Irish. It is an illegal organisation in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and designated as a proscribed terrorist organisation in the [[Terrorism Act 2000#Proscribed groups|United Kingdom]] and the [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|United States]].\n\nSince its formation, the Real IRA has [[Timeline of Real Irish Republican Army actions|waged a campaign]] in [[Northern Ireland]] against the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI)\u2014formerly the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC)\u2014and the [[British Army]]. It is the largest and most active of the \"[[dissident republican]]\" paramilitary groups [[Dissident Irish Republican campaign|operating against]] the British [[security forces]]. It has targeted the security forces in gun attacks and bombings, and with grenades, [[Barrack buster|mortars]] and [[Rocket-propelled grenade|rockets]]. The organisation has also been responsible for bombings in Northern Ireland and England with the goal of causing economic harm and disruption. The most notable of these was the 1998 [[Omagh bombing]], which killed 29 people. After that bombing the Real IRA went on ceasefire, but resumed operations again in 2000. In March 2009 it claimed responsibility for an [[2009 Massereene Barracks shooting|attack on Massereene Barracks]] which killed two British soldiers, the first to be killed in Northern Ireland since 1997. The Real IRA has also been involved in [[vigilantism in Northern Ireland|vigilantism]], mainly against drug dealers and organised crime gangs. In Dublin in particular it has been accused of extortion and engaging in feuds with these gangs.\n\nIn July 2012 it was reported that [[Republican Action Against Drugs]] (RAAD) and other small republican militant groups were merging with the Real IRA.

It includes a cemetery, constructed in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] parallel to the nave of the church. The interior of the church has an extensive set of azulejo tiles in the [[rococo]] style. The historian [[Carlos Ott]] dated them to the late 18th century, and stated that they appear to be the work of the Juncal workshop in Portugal. The stonework of the church is in lioz stone, imported from Lisbon at great expense.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/><ref name=\"t\"/>\n\nThe church closed in 1994 after heavy rains caused the collapse of a wall of the church; additionally, the [[cemetery]] was used by residents for waste disposal. A restoration project began in 2011, which included the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar reopened in 2015.<ref name=\"hpip\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>\n\n==Location==\n[[Image:Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar Nave 2018-0227.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of nave and chancel.]]\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is located in the Com\u00e9rcio district, in the historic lower city (''cidade baixa'') of Salvador. It was constructed at the base of a large slope below the Carmo district of the higher city. Its location at the base of the slope, which is largely unstabilized, has continually put the church at risk of damage caused by landslides.<ref name=\"co1\"/><ref name=\"t\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe Brotherhood of Our Lady of Pilar (''Irmandade do Pilar'') was established in Salvador in 1718. Construction of its church began in 1756 on an undeveloped slope of land beyond the lower city, or ''cidade baixa'', or Salvador. The cemetery was completed in 1799 on a higher level of terrain than the church building in the Neoclassical style. The church, its internal patio with a fountain, and cemetery at a higher level formed an architectural complex unique to the city of Salvador.<ref name=\"ipac\"/>\n\nSalvador was geographically divided into ten parishes, or ''freguesias,'' in the 19th century, uniting the functions of the state and church. The Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar became the focal point of the  ''freguesia'' of Sant\u00edssimo Sacramento do Pilar; residents were baptized, married, elected local officials, and were buried at the church. Pilar, as one of the commercial areas of the lower city, was home to both wealthy Portuguese merchants and enslaved and freed Afro-Brazilians; the latter worked in domestic labor, as fisherman, and as street vendors.<ref name=\"w\"/>\n\nA fire occurred in December of 1829 that damaged the dressing room (''camirim'') of the chancel and a tribune of the church. It also damaged many sculptures of saints, including the Lord of the Good Way (''Senhor do Bom Caminho'') and the statue of Our Lady of Pilar, the patron saint of the church. The fire also damage or completely melted sacred treasures of the church, including lamps, silver candlesticks, and the tabernacle. These were the work of [[Joaquim Alberto da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o e Matos]]. A landslide off the slope occurred on July 9, 1843. The consistory of the church was built above the cemetery, and was carried away in the landslide killing Father Jo\u00e3o Nepomuceno Moreira de Pinho, resident of the consistory.\n\n==Structure==\n[[Image:Igreja de Nossa Senhora do Pilar Cemetery 2018-0132.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of cemetery.]]\n\nThe fa\u00e7ade of Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar, other than its monumental pediment, doors, and windows, are in ''lioz'' limestone imported from Lisbon. The monument pediment in the Rococo style was added later. The church interior consists of a [[nave]], altar, [[sacristy]], [[tribunes]] that open to the inner courtyard, a former sacristy, and other smaller rooms. The painting on the ceiling of the nave is the work of [[Jos\u00e9 Te\u00f3filo de Jesus]], completed in 1837. The master woodcarver [[Joaquim Francisco de Matos]] completed ''talha'' work on four altars of the nave, six tribunes, two pulpits, the carvings of the choir, and carvings of the baptismal font. The works were contracted in 1838 and completed in the following year; they were ultimately gilded in 1848.<ref name=\"ba\"/><ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/>\n\nThe church is home to numerous works of art, including statues, painting, and metalwork. The statue of the Lord of the Good Way (''Senhor do Bom Caminho'') is the work of Manuel In\u00e1cio da Costa.<ref name=\"t\"/>\n\n===Sacristy===\n\nThe sacristy of the Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar is richly furnished and decorated. A large sacristy cabinet spans the length of the north wall of the room. Six richly painted panels are above the cabinet; they are the work of [[Jos\u00e9 Joaquim da Rocha]] (1737-1807) and completed in 1796. An ornate stone [[lavabo]] is on the south wall. The sacristy has [[azulejo]] tiles similar to those of the nave and halls.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"peq\"/>\n\n==Fountain==\n\nA fountain dedicated to Saint Lucia is located in the interior churchyard at the base of the slope. The fountain is believed to have healing powers, especially for ocular problems. An annual festival dedicated to [[Saint Lucia]] takes place in September, and includes a Mass followed by a procession of the image of Saint Lucia throughout the Comercio district.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>\n\n==Cemetery==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was the first Catholic church in Salvador to build an annexed cemetery. The large [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] structure, designed by Jos\u00e9 de Anchieta Mesquita, was constructed in 1799. An exterior cemetery was an innovation of the period; burials within the church proper caused both sanitary problems and the spread of infectious diseases to parishioners. Other churches in Salvador followed the practice of the construction of an external cemetery in the 19th century.<ref name=\"t\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>\n\nResidents on the slope between the church and the upper Carmo district used the [[cemetery]] for waste disposal as early as the 19th century. The quantity of garbage caused the collapse of interior walls of the cemetery and cut off access to graves by the 20th century. The restoration project of 2011 saw the removal of 2,500 tons of garbage from the cemetery and restored access to the tombs and interior altar.<ref name=\"ipac-ba\"/><ref name=\"tarde2011\"/>\n\n==Protected status==\n\nThe Parish Church of Our Lady of Pilar was listed as a historic structure by the [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage]] in 1938.

The solar panels, power subsystem, attitude control subsystem, and the computer kept the spacecraft operating properly during the flight. The navigational system, including the hydrazine rocket, would keep ''Mariner 10'' on track to Venus and Mercury. Several scientific instruments would collect data at the two planets. Finally, the antennas would transmit this data to the [[Deep Space Network]] back on Earth, as well as receive commands from Mission Control.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight.

The temporary orbit took the spacecraft one-third of the distance around Earth: this maneuver was needed to reach the correct spot for a second burn by the Centaur engines, which set ''Mariner 10'' on a path towards Venus. The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision. Never before had a planetary mission depended upon two separate rocket burns during the launch, and even with ''Mariner 10'', scientists initially viewed the maneuver as too risky.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowles|first=Mark D.|authorlink=\n|title=Taming Liquid Hydrogen: The Centaur Upper Stage Rocket 1958-2002|publisher=Government Printing Office|series=|volume=|edition=|date=2004|location=Washington D.C.|pages=131\u2013133|language= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSxO3zHjCuAC&pg=PA131|doi=|id=|isbn=9780160877391|mr=|zbl=|jfm=}}</ref><ref>Dunne and Burgess 1977, pp. 45-46</ref>\n\nDuring its first week of flight, the ''Mariner 10'' camera system was tested by taking five [[Panoramic photography|photographic mosaics]] of the [[Earth]] and six of the [[Moon]].

Immediately afterward, the star-tracker locked onto a bright flake of paint which had come off the spacecraft and lost tracking on the guide star [[Canopus]]. An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems. Periodic problems with the high-gain antenna also occurred during the cruise. On 8 January 1974, a malfunction thought to be caused by a short-circuited diode occurred in the power subsystem.<ref name=\"Paul\"/> As a result, the main booster regulator and inverter failed, leaving the spacecraft dependent on the redundant regulator.

Due to Mercury's proximity to the Sun, ''Mariner 10'' would have to endure 4.5 times more [[solar radiation]] than when it departed Earth; compared to previous Mariner missions, spacecraft parts needed extra shielding against the heat. Thermal blankets and a sunshade were installed on the main body. After evaluating different choices for the sunshade cloth material, mission planners chose [[beta cloth]], a combination of aluminized [[Kapton]] and glass-fiber sheets treated with [[Teflon]].<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 32\u201333</ref> However, solar shielding was unfeasible for some of ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s other components. ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s two solar panels needed to be kept under 115 \u00b0C. Covering the panels would defeat their purpose of producing electricity. The solution was to add an adjustable tilt to the panels, so the angle at which they faced the sun could be changed. Engineers considered folding the panels toward each other, making a V-shape with the main body, but tests found this approach had the potential to overheat the rest of the spacecraft. The alternative chosen was to mount the solar panels in a line and tilt them along that axis, which had the added benefit of increasing the efficiency of the spacecraft's nitrogen jet thrusters, which could now be placed on the panel tips. The panels could be rotated a maximum of 76\u00b0.<ref name=\"Strom16\">Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 16</ref><ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, p. 21</ref> Additionally, ''Mariner 10''{{'}}s hydrazine rocket nozzle had to face the Sun to function properly, but scientists rejected covering the nozzle with a thermal door as an undependable solution. Instead, a special paint was applied to exposed parts on the rocket so as to reduce heat flow from the nozzle to the delicate instruments on the spacecraft.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, pp. 30\u201332</ref>\n\nAccurately performing the gravity assist at Venus posed another hurdle.<ref>Reeves 1994, p. 242</ref> If ''Mariner 10'' was to maintain a course to Mercury, its trajectory could deviate no more than {{convert|200|km}} from a critical point in the vicinity of Venus.<ref>Dunne and Burgess 1978, p. 56</ref> To ensure that the necessary course corrections could be made, mission planners tripled the amount of [[hydrazine]] fuel Mariner 10 would carry, and also equipped the spacecraft with more nitrogen gas for the thrusters than the previous Mariner mission had held. These upgrades proved crucial in enabling the second and third Mercury flybys.<ref name=\"MB25\">Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nThe mission still lacked the ultimate safeguard: a sister spacecraft. It was common for probes to be launched in pairs, with complete redundancy to guard against the failure of one or the other.<ref>Strom and Sprague 2003, p. 14</ref> The budget constraint ruled this option out. Even though mission planners stayed sufficiently under budget to divert some funding for constructing a backup spacecraft, the budget did not permit both to be launched at the same time. In the event that Mariner 10 failed, NASA would only allow the backup to be launched if the fatal error was diagnosed and fixed; this would have to be completed in the two-and-a-half weeks between the scheduled launch on 3 November 1973 and the last possible launch date of 21 November 1973.<ref name=\"MB25\"/><ref name=\"MB38\"/> (The unused backup was sent to the Smithsonian museum)\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[Image:Mariner10.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration showing the instruments of ''Mariner 10''.]]\n\n''Mariner 10'' conducted seven experiments at Venus and Mercury.

To avoid the Sun's damaging heat, the cameras were deliberately placed on the spacecraft side facing away from the Sun. Consequently, the heaters were needed to prevent the cameras from losing heat and become so cold that they would become damaged. JPL engineers found that the vidicons could generate enough heat through normal operation to stay just above the critical temperature of -40 \u00b0C; therefore they advised against turning off the cameras during the flight. Test photos of the Earth and Moon showed that image quality had not been significantly affected.<ref>Murray and Burgess 1977, pp. 43\u201348</ref> The mission team was pleasantly surprised when the camera heaters started working on 17 January 1974, two months after launch.<ref>{{cite journal|editor-last=Clark|editor-first=Pamela|authorlink=|title=Mariner 10: A Retrospective|journal=Mercury Messenger|volume=|issue=10|pages= |publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|location=|date=December 2003|language=|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/newsletters/mercmessenger/issue10.pdf|jstor=|issn=|doi=|id=|mr=|zbl=|jfm= |accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"No. 14\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Bulletin No. 14: TCM-2 Performance Superb TV Heaters Have Come On|website=|publisher=Mariner Venus/Mercury 1973 Project Office|date=23 January 1974|url=http://ser.sese.asu.edu/M10/BULLETINS/bul-14.pdf|format=|doi=|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Later investigation concluded that a short circuit in a different location on the probe had prevented the heater from turning on.

The probe then separated from the rocket; subsequently, the Centaur stage diverted away to avoid the possibility of a future collision.

An automated safety protocol recovered Canopus, but the problem of flaking paint recurred throughout the mission. The on-board computer also experienced unscheduled resets occasionally, which necessitated reconfiguring the clock sequence and subsystems.
