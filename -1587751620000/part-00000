No Egyptian is ever far from his river and, except for the [[Alexandria|Alexandrines]] whose personality is split by looking outward toward the Mediterranean, the Egyptians are a hinterland people with little appetite for travel, even inside their own country. They glorify their national dishes, including the [[Ful Medames|variety of concoctions surrounding the simple bean]]. Most of all, they have a sense of all-encompassing familiarity at home and a sense of alienation when abroad ... There is something particularly excruciating about Egyptian nostalgia for Egypt: it is sometimes outlandish, but the attachment flows through all Egyptians, as the Nile through Egypt.<ref>Wakin, Edward.

Political, demographic and economic pressures led to the first wave of emigration after 1952.

Political repression and human rights violations by Egypt's ruling r\u00e9gime are other contributing factors (see {{format link|Egypt#Human rights}}). Egyptians have also been impacted by the wars between Egypt and [[Israel]], particularly after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when migration rates began to rise.

During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs.\n\nEgypt fell under [[Hyksos]] rule in the Middle [[Bronze Age]]. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the [[Late Bronze Age]], thereby initiating the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It remained a super-regional power throughout the [[Amarna Period]] as well as during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse]] that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. The [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to Egyptians. 4,000 [[Celts|Celtic]] mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'\u00e9tat around the year 270 BC.\n\nThroughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]), [[divine kingship]] was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<ref>Grimal, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe role of the king was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice, and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]]. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.\n\nThe attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian society]]. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the [[Great Pyramids]]. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''{{transl|egy|pr n\u1e25\u1e25}}'' means '[[House of Eternity' (Ancient Egypt)|House of Eternity]]'. The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<ref>Watterson, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File: Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|300px|A boat scene, the tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]\nAnother important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners\u2014those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rm\u1e6f'' or \"the people\" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]].\n\nThe Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat\u2014a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], Persians and Greeks\u2014their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.\n\nThe importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation was the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, \"the gift of the river.\"\n\n===Graeco-Roman period===\n{{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian mummy from the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 \u2212 AD 150]]\n\nWhen Alexander died, a story began to circulate that [[Nectanebo II]] was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<ref>Watterson, p. 192</ref> The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11</ref> The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<ref>Watterson, p. 215</ref> The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 28</ref>\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period.<ref>Kamil, p. 12</ref> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.<ref>Watterson, p. 214</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraiture]] flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and [[Jews]] occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.<ref>Watterson, p. 237</ref>\n\nThe Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying \"genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.\"<ref>qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC \u2212 AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.</ref> This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<ref>Jankowski, p. 29</ref> The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.<ref>Kamil, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].<ref>Kamil, p. 21</ref>\n\nConsequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt\" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''.\n\n[[File:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|A Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249\u201350. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]\nSt. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\">Jankowski, p. 32</ref>\n\nThis event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\"/>\n\nThe Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]].\n\nAt the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<ref>Kamil, p. 35</ref>\n\nOne of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As [[Coptologist]] Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians \"paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. [[Coptic art]] developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.\"<ref>Kamil, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Islamic period from Late antiquity to Middle Ages===\n<!-- [[File:Abdelbaset.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Abdul Basit 'Abd us-Samad|Qari Abdul Baset]], renowned Egyptian [[Quran]] reciter.]] -->\n[[File:Dhulnun tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Egyptian saint [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (AD 796\u2013859) in Cairo's [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|City of the Dead]].]]\n[[File:Invitation-d'un-marriage-arab.jpg|thumb|right|En Route to an [[Arab Wedding]] or Katb el-Kit\u0101b in Cairo, Egypt]]\nBefore the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim the country after a brief [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|Persian invasion]] in AD 616, and subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.<ref>Kamil, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe new Muslim rulers moved the capital to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax, in addition to a [[kharaj|land tax]] that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\">Watterson, p. 268</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\"/> The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids\u2014a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen \"within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq.\"<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165</ref>\n\nThe form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 140</ref> Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26</ref>\n\nDhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 164</ref> He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.<ref>El-Daly, p. 112</ref>\n\n[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]] founded in AD 970 by the Fatimids]]\n[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple.

In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshids]] were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.\n\nEgyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.\n\n[[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper\n\nThe [[Mamluks of Egypt]] (AD 1258\u20131517)  as a whole were,  some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts.<ref>[http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/world_history/A_Short_History_of_Egypt.pdf A Short History of Egypt \u2013 to about 1970 from University of Standford]\n</ref> Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors.

Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:{{quote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.<ref>''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47</ref>}}\n\n===Ottoman period===\nEgyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.\n\n{{quote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor...

The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country.\n\nThe French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.\n\nWhen Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.\n\nThe withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system\u2014the results of which are felt to this day.<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\">Jankowskil, p. 74</ref>\n\nIn order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\"/> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.\n\n====Nationalism====\n[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], 1801\u20131873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]\nThe period between 1860\u20131940 was characterized by an Egyptian ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\">Vatikiotis, p. 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]]. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. In them he introduces his students to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\"/>\n\nTahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.<ref>El-Daly, p. 29</ref> Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Silk weavers.JPG|thumb|Egyptian silk weavers during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]], 1880.]]\nAmong Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country.<ref>Jankowski, p. 83</ref> Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIsmail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 135</ref>\n\nWhen the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Mohammed Ali family]] ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.\n\n====Liberal age====\n{{Main|Liberalism in Egypt}}\n[[File:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1874\u22121908), an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one\".]]\nEgyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 189</ref>\n\nSheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.\"\n\nEgyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: \"El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.\"<ref>qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227</ref>\n\nBoth the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<ref>Jankowski, p. 112</ref>\n\nThe Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the radical [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]]. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as \"an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only\",<ref>qtd. in Jankowski p. 123</ref> which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.\n\n[[File:Farouk family official.jpg|thumb|[[King Farouk I]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida]] and their first-born daughter [[Princess Farial of Egypt|Princess Ferial]] c. 1940.]]\nUnder the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<ref>Jankowski, p. 130</ref> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.\n\nWhen Egyptian novelist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon \u00c9gypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:\n\n{{quote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation ... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile ... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died ... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death ... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.<ref>Salmawy, Mohamed.

The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new regime.<ref>Jankowski, p. 137</ref>\n\nNasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and began a [[nationalization]] process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society.

Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.\n\nEgyptians fought one last time in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai.

It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Classical Arabic]] is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.\n\nWhile the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been influenced by many other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the old [[Egyptian language]]. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language among the [[Arab world]]. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread. As a result, most Arabic countries have grown up listening to the dialect and therefore have no trouble understanding it, even though they actually speak their own.\n\nOriginally the Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics. At first the meaning of the hieroglyphics was unknown; until one day in the year 1799 Napole\u00f3n Bonaparte's soldiers dug up the Rosetta stone. The Rosetta Stone was found broken and incomplete. It features 14 lines of hieroglyphic script, 32 lines in Demotic and 53 lines of Ancient Greek.\n\n==Identity==\n{{Life in Egypt}}\n{{further|Pan-Arabism|Pharaonism|Coptic identity|Islamism}}\n[[File:The-irrepressible-donkey-boys-at-Cairo.jpg|thumb|300px|Egyptian donkey herders at the start of the British occupation of Egypt, circa 1860s.]]\n\nThe degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt's history in articulating a sense of collective identity can vary and was hugely influenced by Islamization and Arabization, same as almost all [[List of countries where Arabic is an official language|Arabic-speaking countries]].  \n\n===Ancient Egypt===\nThe categorization of people as ''Egyptians'', ''Asiatics'', ''Libyans'' and ''Nubians'' occurred in Egyptian documents of state ideology and were contingent on [[Sociocultural system|Social]] and [[Culture|Cultural]] factors among the ancient populations themselves.<ref name=JournalofEgyptianHistory>{{Cite Web| url=https://brill.com/view/journals/jeh/11/1-2/article-p243_10.xml?lang=en |title=Ethnic Identities in Ancient Egypt and the Identity of Egyptology: Towards a \"Trans-Egyptology\" |author=Thomas Schneider }}</ref>\n\n===Egypt and Africa===\nEven though Egypt is mostly located in North Africa, Egypt and the Egyptian people do not generally have an [[Culture of Africa|African identity]].<ref name=Egypt,Africa>{{Cite Web |quote=Many Egyptians do not consider themselves Africans.

The Egyptians were discriminated against in the military where they weren't allowed to hold any important positions. That contributed to forming an early sense of a collective imagined community among Arab soldiers as opposed to Turks, Kurds, and Albanians. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, all Arabic speakers, especially Muslims, were viewed as Arabs. As a consequence, being \"Arab\" was equivalent to being Egyptian in modern day. In an attempt to prove to his soldiers that he is one of them, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of Mohammed Ali Pasha, who was an [[Albanians|Albanian]], told one of his soldiers after criticizing Turks: \"I am not a Turk, I came to Egypt when I was a child, and since that time, its sun has changed my blood, and I became fully Arab\".<ref>All the Pasha's Men, Arabic Version, P 337</ref>\n\n===British Rule===\nBeginning 1860, the state started making efforts to shape a collective Egyptian Identity, and the word \"Misreyeen\" started slowly replacing the word \"Evlad Arab\".

The Orabi movement in the 1870s and 1880s was the first major Egyptian nationalist movement that demanded an end to the alleged despotism of the Muhammad Ali family and demanded curbing the growth of European influence in Egypt, it campaigned under the nationalist slogan of \"''Egypt for Egyptians''\".{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=138}}\n\nAs a result of the increasing European influence, western ideas started becoming prevalent among the upper classes in Egypt {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}. Especially after the British occupation of Egypt which brought a westernized style of education with it. Among the western ideas, the French Enlightenment notion of reviving Pre-Christian civilizations and cultures found a special place among Egyptian Nationalists {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, who sought to revive the Pharaonic culture as the main Pre-Islamic civilization of Egypt. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as \"Pharaonism\"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular [[Arab nationalism]] as well as [[Islamism]].\n\n\"Pharaonism\" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the [[Arab world]]. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean civilization]]. This ideology largely developed out of the country's lengthy pre-Islamic pre-Arab history, the relative isolation of the [[Nile Valley]] and the mostly homogeneous indigenous non-Arab genetic ancestry/ethnicity of the inhabitants,<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch\">Hinnesbusch, p. 93.</ref> regardless of current religious identity.

According to Dawisha, the terms \"Arab\", \"Arabism\" and \"Arab unity\", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.<ref>Dawisha, pp. 264\u201365, 267</ref> (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.<ref name=\"Barakat4\"/>\n\nDuring this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict]] opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author [[Louis Awad]] was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported.<ref name=\"Barakat5\"/> Egyptian scholar [[Gamal Hamdan]] stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and \"cultural hub\" of the Arab world, arguing that \"Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt.\" Hamdan further contended \"We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland.\"<ref name=\"Barakat4\">Barakat, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMany Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: \"in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?\"<ref>Barakat, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being \"an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ...

Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the [[Near East]] and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture.

Chech arab.jpg|thumb|An Egyptian elder, 1860s]] \nToday, Egyptians carry names that have Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, Greek and Western meanings (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a [[surname]] is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.\n[[File:Charmeur des serpents 1860s.jpg|thumb|A serpent charmer in Egypt, 1860s]]\n\nSome Egyptians tend to have Surnames based on their cities, like ''Monoufi'' (from [[Monufia]]), ''Banhawy'' (from [[Benha]]), ''Aswany'' (from [[Aswan]]), ''Tahtawy'' (from [[Tahta]]), ''Fayoumi'' (from [[Fayoum]]), ''Sakandary / Eskandrani'' (from [[Alexandria]]) and so on. \n\nAs a result of the Long Islamic history of Egypt, and as a result of several mass migration waves into Egypt such as the [[Banu Hilal]] Exodus. Some Egyptian muslims carry historical Arabic last names. For example the surname \"Al Sharif\" (The Noble) from the Ashraf tribes \"Al Juhaini\", from Juhainah, \"Al Qarmouti\" from Al Qaramita, \"Al Hawary\" from Hawara.\n\nOther people have their family names based on their traditional crafts, like ''El Nagar'' ([[Carpenter]]), ''El Fawal'' (the one who sells [[Ful medames|Foul]]), ''El Hadad'' ([[Blacksmith]]), ''El Khayat'' ([[Tailor]]) and so on. \n\nThe Majority of people, however, have surnames that used to be their great grand parents first names, this habit is especially dominant among the fellahin, where Surnames isn't really strong tradition. For example, if a person named Khaled Mohamed Ali has a son named Ashraf, his son's full name may become Ashraf Khaled Mohamed. Thus, a son may have a different last name than his father.\n\nHowever,It is not entirely unusual for families to have Ancient Egyptian based names (especially Coptic ones) and have their first names or surnames beginning with the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] masculine possessive [[pronoun]] ''pa'' (generally ''ba'' in Arabic, which lost the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the course of developing from [[Proto-Semitic]]). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) \"of Fayyoum\", Fayyoum meaning \"of the big water (yom)\", Basyouni (of [[Aswan]]), Bashandi, Bakhoum (\"the eagle\"), Bekhit, Bahur (\"of [[Horus]]\") and Banoub (\"of [[Anubis]]\").\n\nThe name Shenouda, which is very common among [[Copt]], means \"child of God\". Hence, names and many [[toponym]]s may end with ''-nouda'', ''-noudi'' or ''-nuti'', which means ''Of God'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are [[Qozman]] and [[Habib]].\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.\n\nNames starting with the [[Ancient Egyptian]] affix ''pu'' (\"of the place of\") were sometimes Arabized to ''abu'' (\"father of\"); for example, Busiri (\"of the place of [[Osiris]]\") occasionally became [[Abusir]] and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy (\"the Levantine\") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (\"the Egyptian\") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.\n\nWith [[French people|French]] influence, names like [[Mounier]], [[Pierre]], and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.\n\n==Genetic history==\n{{main article|DNA history of Egypt}}\n{{see also|Population history of Egypt}}\nBeginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.<ref>Batrawi A (1945).

[the] [[Badari|Badarian people]], who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.\"<ref>Frank Yurco, \"An Egyptological Review\" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. p. 62-100</ref></blockquote>\n\nA 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[ancient Egyptians]] by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:\n<blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced [[dentition]]s that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a\u2013c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing [[phenetic]] distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD \u00bc 0.050), 11\u201312th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th\u201330th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... [[Gebel Ramlah]] [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from [[Badari]] based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<ref>Irish pp. 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nA study published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from Abusir. The study was able to measure the mitochondrial DNA of 90 individuals, and it showed that [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]] had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern ([[Arabs]], [[Levant|Levantine]] and [[Anatolia|Anatolian]]) and [[North Africa|North African]] populations and had significantly more affinity with south-eastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Genome-wide data could only be successfully extracted from three of these individuals. Of these three, the Y-chromosome haplogroups of two individuals could be assigned to the Middle-Eastern haplogroup J, and one to haplogroup E1b1b1 common in North Africa. The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African ancestry in these three individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is slightly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in Egyptians from Abusir, who range from 14 to 21%. The study's authors cautioned that the Mummies may be unrepresentative of the whole Ancient Egyptian population, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt and that the Southern part might have more Sub-Saharan component being closer to [[Nubia]].<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|bibcode=2017NatCo...815694S}}</ref> and that they only dated from the late New Kingdom to the Roman Period.

During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs.\n\nEgypt fell under [[Hyksos]] rule in the Middle [[Bronze Age]]. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the [[Late Bronze Age]], thereby initiating the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It remained a super-regional power throughout the [[Amarna Period]] as well as during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early [[Iron Age]].\n\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse]] that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. The [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]].\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to Egyptians. 4,000 [[Celts|Celtic]] mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'\u00e9tat around the year 270 BC.\n\nThroughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]), [[divine kingship]] was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.<ref>Grimal, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe role of the king was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice, and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]]. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.\n\nThe attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian society]]. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the [[Great Pyramids]]. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''{{transl|egy|pr n\u1e25\u1e25}}'' means '[[House of Eternity' (Ancient Egypt)|House of Eternity]]'. The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.<ref>Watterson, p. 15</ref>\n\n[[File: Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|300px|A boat scene, the tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]\nAnother important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners\u2014those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rm\u1e6f'' or \"the people\" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]].\n\nThe Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat\u2014a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], Persians and Greeks\u2014their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.\n\nThe ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.\n\nThe importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation was the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, \"the gift of the river.\"\n\n===Graeco-Roman period===\n{{Main|Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egypt (Roman province)}}\n[[File:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian mummy from the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 \u2212 AD 150]]\n\nWhen Alexander died, a story began to circulate that [[Nectanebo II]] was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.<ref>Watterson, p. 192</ref> The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks.<ref>Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11</ref> The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.<ref>Watterson, p. 215</ref> The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.<ref>Jankowski, p. 28</ref>\n\nThe Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period.<ref>Kamil, p. 12</ref> A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.<ref>Watterson, p. 214</ref>\n\nWhen the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraiture]] flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and [[Jews]] occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.<ref>Watterson, p. 237</ref>\n\nThe Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying \"genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech.\"<ref>qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC \u2212 AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.</ref> This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.<ref>Jankowski, p. 29</ref> The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.<ref>Kamil, p. 16</ref>\n\nThe cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].<ref>Kamil, p. 21</ref>\n\nConsequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy \"When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt\" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''.\n\n[[File:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|A Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249\u201350. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]\nSt. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\">Jankowski, p. 32</ref>\n\nThis event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.<ref name=\"Jankowski, p. 32\"/>\n\nThe Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]].\n\nAt the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.<ref>Kamil, p. 35</ref>\n\nOne of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As [[Coptologist]] Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians \"paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. [[Coptic art]] developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power.\"<ref>Kamil, p. 39</ref>\n\n===Islamic period from Late antiquity to Middle Ages===\n<!-- [[File:Abdelbaset.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Abdul Basit 'Abd us-Samad|Qari Abdul Baset]], renowned Egyptian [[Quran]] reciter.]] -->\n[[File:Dhulnun tomb.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Egyptian saint [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (AD 796\u2013859) in Cairo's [[City of the Dead (Cairo)|City of the Dead]].]]\n[[File:Invitation-d'un-marriage-arab.jpg|thumb|right|En Route to an [[Arab Wedding]] or Katb el-Kit\u0101b in Cairo, Egypt]]\nBefore the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim the country after a brief [[Sasanian conquest of Egypt|Persian invasion]] in AD 616, and subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.<ref>Watterson, p. 232</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.<ref>Kamil, p. 40</ref>\n\nThe new Muslim rulers moved the capital to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax, in addition to a [[kharaj|land tax]] that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\">Watterson, p. 268</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.<ref name=\"Watterson, p. 268\"/> The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids\u2014a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen \"within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq.\"<ref>El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165</ref>\n\nThe form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 140</ref> Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.<ref>Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26</ref>\n\nDhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].<ref>El-Daly, p. 164</ref> He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.<ref>El-Daly, p. 112</ref>\n\n[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]] founded in AD 970 by the Fatimids]]\n[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple.

In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshids]] were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.\n\nEgyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.\n\n[[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper\n\nThe [[Mamluks of Egypt]] (AD 1258\u20131517)  as a whole were,  some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts.<ref>[http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/world_history/A_Short_History_of_Egypt.pdf A Short History of Egypt \u2013 to about 1970 from University of Standford]\n</ref> Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors. The reign of Kait Bey (1468-1496) was one of high achievement in architecture, showing great refinement of taste in the building of elegant tombs, mosques and palaces. It was a period in which learning flourished.\n\nTheir rule is generally {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority.<ref>{{cite journal|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|first1=Bego\u00f1a|last1=Dobon|first2=Hisham Y.|last2=Hassan|first3=Hafid|last3=Laayouni|first4=Pierre|last4=Luisi|first5=Isis|last5=Rica\u00f1o-Ponce|first6=Alexandra|last6=Zhernakova|first7=Cisca|last7=Wijmenga|first8=Hanan|last8=Tahir|first9=David|last9=Comas|first10=Mihai G.|last10=Netea|first11=Jaume|last11=Bertranpetit|date=28 May 2015|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|pages=9996|doi=10.1038/srep09996|pmid=26017457|pmc=4446898}}</ref><ref>Jankowski, p. 35</ref> The Mamluks were mainly ethnic [[Circassians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:{{quote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.<ref>''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47</ref>}}\n\n===Ottoman period===\nEgyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 31</ref>\n\nThe only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.\n\n{{quote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor...

The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country.\n\nThe French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.\n\nWhen Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'\u00c9gypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.\n\nThe withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system\u2014the results of which are felt to this day.<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\">Jankowskil, p. 74</ref>\n\nIn order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].<ref name=\"Jankowskil, p. 74\"/> Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.\n\n====Nationalism====\n[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], 1801\u20131873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]\nThe period between 1860\u20131940 was characterized by an Egyptian ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\">Vatikiotis, p. 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]]. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. In them he introduces his students to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or \"good Egyptian\"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.<ref name=\"Vatikiotis, p. 115-16\"/>\n\nTahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.<ref>El-Daly, p. 29</ref> Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:Silk weavers.JPG|thumb|Egyptian silk weavers during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Ismail]], 1880.]]\nAmong Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country.<ref>Jankowski, p. 83</ref> Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIsmail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 135</ref>\n\nWhen the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Mohammed Ali family]] ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.\n\n====Liberal age====\n{{Main|Liberalism in Egypt}}\n[[File:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1874\u22121908), an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one\".]]\nEgyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 189</ref>\n\nSheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, \"If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one.\"\n\nEgyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: \"El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds.\"<ref>qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227</ref>\n\nBoth the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.<ref>Jankowski, p. 112</ref>\n\nThe Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the radical [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]]. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as \"an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only\",<ref>qtd. in Jankowski p. 123</ref> which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.\n\n[[File:Farouk family official.jpg|thumb|[[King Farouk I]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida]] and their first-born daughter [[Princess Farial of Egypt|Princess Ferial]] c. 1940.]]\nUnder the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.<ref>Jankowski, p. 130</ref> This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.\n\nWhen Egyptian novelist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon \u00c9gypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:\n\n{{quote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation ... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile ... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died ... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death ... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.<ref>Salmawy, Mohamed.

The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new regime.<ref>Jankowski, p. 137</ref>\n\nNasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and began a [[nationalization]] process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society.

Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.\n\nEgyptians fought one last time in the 1973 [[Yom Kippur War|October War]] in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel leading to the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]], which was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians,<ref>Vatikiotis, p. 443</ref> in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] in [[Cairo]] by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].\n\nHosni Mubarak was the president from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011, when he resigned under pressure of [[2011 Egyptian protests|popular protest]]. Although power was ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], in practice it rested almost solely with the president. In late February 2005, for the first time since the 1952 coup d'\u00e9tat, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates, most prominently [[Ayman Nour]].

In antiquity, Egyptians spoke the [[Egyptian language]]. It constitutes its own branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. The [[Coptic language]] is the direct descendant of the Egyptian language, written in [[Coptic alphabet]]. It is worth noting that other languages, such as Nubian, Arabic, and other Libyan languages also existed in Egypt outside of the Nile valley and in the mountains surrounding it since at least the time of Herodotus, with Arabic being used mainly in the [[Eastern Desert]] and [[Sinai (peninsula)|Sinai]] <ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\">The History of Herodotus By GEORGE RAWLINSON, Page 9</ref>, Nubian (referred to as Ethiopian By Herodotus) South of the first cataract of the Nile <ref>The History of Herodotus By GEORGE RAWLINSON, Page 33</ref>, and other Libyan Languages in the [[Libyan]] Desert<ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\"/>\n\nAlthough Arabic was spoken in parts of Egypt in the pre-islamic era such as the Eastern Desert and Sinai<ref name=\"RAWLINSON p9\"/>, Coptic was the Language of the majority of Egyptians residing in the Nile Valley.

It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Classical Arabic]] is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.\n\nWhile the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been influenced by many other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the old [[Egyptian language]]. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language among the [[Arab world]]. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread.

That contributed to forming an early sense of a collective imagined community among Arab soldiers as opposed to Turks, Kurds, and Albanians. Throughout the Ottoman Empire, all Arabic speakers, especially Muslims, were viewed as Arabs. As a consequence, being \"Arab\" was equivalent to being Egyptian in modern day. In an attempt to prove to his soldiers that he is one of them, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], the son of Mohammed Ali Pasha, who was an [[Albanians|Albanian]], told one of his soldiers after criticizing Turks: \"I am not a Turk, I came to Egypt when I was a child, and since that time, its sun has changed my blood, and I became fully Arab\".<ref>All the Pasha's Men, Arabic Version, P 337</ref>\n\n===British Rule===\nBeginning 1860, the state started making efforts to shape a collective Egyptian Identity, and the word \"Misreyeen\" started slowly replacing the word \"Evlad Arab\".

Especially after the British occupation of Egypt which brought a westernized style of education with it. Among the western ideas, the French Enlightenment notion of reviving Pre-Christian civilizations and cultures found a special place among Egyptian Nationalists {{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}, who sought to revive the Pharaonic culture as the main Pre-Islamic civilization of Egypt. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as \"Pharaonism\"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular [[Arab nationalism]] as well as [[Islamism]].\n\n\"Pharaonism\" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the [[Arab world]]. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean civilization]].

In particular, the growth of [[Zionism]] in neighboring Palestine was seen as a threat by many Egyptians and the cause of resistance there was adopted by rising Islamic movements such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as well as the political leadership including [[Faruq I|King Faruq I]] and Prime Minister [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]].<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch\"/>.\n\n===Nasserism===\nIt was not until the [[Nasser era]] more than a decade later that Arab nationalism, and by extension [[Arab socialism]], became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world,<ref>\"Before Nasser, Egypt, which had been ruled by Britain since 1882, was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology.

Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives, and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.<ref>Dawisha, p. 237.</ref> Although the Arabism instilled in the country by Nasser was not deeply embedded in society, a certain kinship with the rest of the Arab world was firmly established and Egypt saw itself as the leader of this larger cultural entity. Nasser's version of [[pan-Arabism]] stressed Egyptian sovereignty and leadership of Arab unity instead of the eastern Arab states.<ref name=\"Hinnesbusch94\"/>\n\nNasser's successor [[Anwar el-Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. According to Dawisha, the terms \"Arab\", \"Arabism\" and \"Arab unity\", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.<ref>Dawisha, pp. 264\u201365, 267</ref> (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.<ref name=\"Barakat4\"/>\n\nDuring this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|conflict]] opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author [[Louis Awad]] was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported.<ref name=\"Barakat5\"/> Egyptian scholar [[Gamal Hamdan]] stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and \"cultural hub\" of the Arab world, arguing that \"Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt.\" Hamdan further contended \"We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland.\"<ref name=\"Barakat4\">Barakat, p. 4.</ref>\n\nMany Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: \"in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?\"<ref>Barakat, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being \"an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ... Thus in seeking a cultural identity, Egypt has revived its Arab cultural heritage.\"<ref name=\"Barakat5\">Barakat, p. 5.</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Egypt}}\n{{See also|Ancient Egypt}}\nEgyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the [[Near East]] and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself influenced by Ancient Egypt.\n\n==Surnames==\n[[File:Zangaki. 0263. Chech arab.jpg|thumb|An Egyptian elder, 1860s]] \nToday, Egyptians carry names that have Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, Greek and Western meanings (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a [[surname]] is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.\n[[File:Charmeur des serpents 1860s.jpg|thumb|A serpent charmer in Egypt, 1860s]]\n\nSome Egyptians tend to have Surnames based on their cities, like ''Monoufi'' (from [[Monufia]]), ''Banhawy'' (from [[Benha]]), ''Aswany'' (from [[Aswan]]), ''Tahtawy'' (from [[Tahta]]), ''Fayoumi'' (from [[Fayoum]]), ''Sakandary / Eskandrani'' (from [[Alexandria]]) and so on. \n\nAs a result of the Long Islamic history of Egypt, and as a result of several mass migration waves into Egypt such as the [[Banu Hilal]] Exodus. Some Egyptian muslims carry historical Arabic last names. For example the surname \"Al Sharif\" (The Noble) from the Ashraf tribes \"Al Juhaini\", from Juhainah, \"Al Qarmouti\" from Al Qaramita, \"Al Hawary\" from Hawara.\n\nOther people have their family names based on their traditional crafts, like ''El Nagar'' ([[Carpenter]]), ''El Fawal'' (the one who sells [[Ful medames|Foul]]), ''El Hadad'' ([[Blacksmith]]), ''El Khayat'' ([[Tailor]]) and so on. \n\nThe Majority of people, however, have surnames that used to be their great grand parents first names, this habit is especially dominant among the fellahin, where Surnames isn't really strong tradition. For example, if a person named Khaled Mohamed Ali has a son named Ashraf, his son's full name may become Ashraf Khaled Mohamed. Thus, a son may have a different last name than his father.\n\nHowever,It is not entirely unusual for families to have Ancient Egyptian based names (especially Coptic ones) and have their first names or surnames beginning with the [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] masculine possessive [[pronoun]] ''pa'' (generally ''ba'' in Arabic, which lost the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the course of developing from [[Proto-Semitic]]). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) \"of Fayyoum\", Fayyoum meaning \"of the big water (yom)\", Basyouni (of [[Aswan]]), Bashandi, Bakhoum (\"the eagle\"), Bekhit, Bahur (\"of [[Horus]]\") and Banoub (\"of [[Anubis]]\").\n\nThe name Shenouda, which is very common among [[Copt]], means \"child of God\". Hence, names and many [[toponym]]s may end with ''-nouda'', ''-noudi'' or ''-nuti'', which means ''Of God'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are [[Qozman]] and [[Habib]].\n\nWith the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.\n\nNames starting with the [[Ancient Egyptian]] affix ''pu'' (\"of the place of\") were sometimes Arabized to ''abu'' (\"father of\"); for example, Busiri (\"of the place of [[Osiris]]\") occasionally became [[Abusir]] and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy (\"the Levantine\") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri (\"the Egyptian\") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.\n\nWith [[French people|French]] influence, names like [[Mounier]], [[Pierre]], and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.\n\n==Genetic history==\n{{main article|DNA history of Egypt}}\n{{see also|Population history of Egypt}}\nBeginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.<ref>Batrawi A (1945).

[the] [[Badari|Badarian people]], who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara.\"<ref>Frank Yurco, \"An Egyptological Review\" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. p. 62-100</ref></blockquote>\n\nA 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[ancient Egyptians]] by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:\n<blockquote>[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced [[dentition]]s that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a\u2013c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing [[phenetic]] distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD \u00bc 0.050), 11\u201312th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th\u201330th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... [[Gebel Ramlah]] [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from [[Badari]] based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.<ref>Irish pp. 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nA study published in 2017 described the extraction and analysis of DNA from 151 mummified ancient Egyptian individuals, whose remains were recovered from Abusir. The study was able to measure the mitochondrial DNA of 90 individuals, and it showed that [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptians]] had the greatest affinity for modern Middle Eastern ([[Arabs]], [[Levant|Levantine]] and [[Anatolia|Anatolian]]) and [[North Africa|North African]] populations and had significantly more affinity with south-eastern Europeans than with sub-Saharan Africans. Genome-wide data could only be successfully extracted from three of these individuals. Of these three, the Y-chromosome haplogroups of two individuals could be assigned to the Middle-Eastern haplogroup J, and one to haplogroup E1b1b1 common in North Africa. The absolute estimates of sub-Saharan African ancestry in these three individuals ranged from 6 to 15%, which is slightly lower than the level of sub-Saharan African ancestry in Egyptians from Abusir, who range from 14 to 21%. The study's authors cautioned that the Mummies may be unrepresentative of the whole Ancient Egyptian population, since they were recovered from the northern part of Egypt and that the Southern part might have more Sub-Saharan component being closer to [[Nubia]].<ref name=\"nature.com\">{{cite journal|last1=Schuenemann|first1=Verena|last2=Peltzer|first2=Alexander|last3=Welte|first3=Beatrix|title=Ancient Egyptian mummy genomes suggest an increase of Sub-Saharan African ancestry in post-Roman periods|journal=Nature Communications|volume=8|pages=15694|date=30 May 2017|doi=10.1038/ncomms15694|pmid=28556824|pmc=5459999|bibcode=2017NatCo...815694S}}</ref> and that they only dated from the late New Kingdom to the Roman Period.

The rights conveyed by this ''janmam'' were not a [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] in the European sense, but an office of dignity. Owing to their ritual status as priests (Nambudris), the jenmis could neither cultivate nor supervise the land but would instead provide a grant of ''kanam'' to a ''kanakkaran'' in return for a fixed share of the crops produced. Typically, a Jenmi would have a large number of ''kanakkarar'' under him.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n====Verumpattakkaran====\nThe Verumpattakkarar, generally [[Thiyya]] and Mappila classes, cultivated the land but were also its part-proprietors under the ''kanakkarar''. These classes were given a ''Verum Pattam'' (Simple Lease) of the land that was typically valid for one year. According to custom, they were also entitled to one-third or an equal share of the net produce.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe net produce of the land was the share left over after providing for the ''cherujanmakkar'' or all the other birthright holders such as the village [[Carpentry|carpenter]], the [[goldsmith]] and agricultural [[Laborer|labourers]] who helped to gather, prepare and store produce. The system ensured that no Jenmi could evict tenants under him except for non-payment of rent. This land tenure system was generally referred to as the ''janmi-kana-maryada'' (customary practices).<ref name=\"cooperjal\"/><ref name=\"VVK\"/>\n\n[[File:Madras map 1913.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Madras Presidency, after the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]].]]\n\n===Land reforms and Mappila outbreaks (1836\u20131921) \u2013 Theory of class conflict===\n\nDuring the [[Mysorean invasion of Malabar]], the Jenmi took refuge in neighbouring states. The tenants and the Nair army men who could not escape were converted into Islam, as described in [https://books.google.co.in/books/about/MALABAR_MANUAL.html?id=0TJFDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y William Logan's Malabar Manual]. Thus, [[Tipu Sultan]]'s Kingdom of Mysore, having driven the Jenmi out of Malabar, reached accord with the Muslim Kanakkars. A new system of land revenue was introduced for the first time in the region's history with the government share fixed on the basis of actual produce from the land.<ref name=\"DevReport\">Pg 53, Kerala Development Report, Government of India Planning Commission, Academic Foundation, 2008</ref>\n\nHowever, within five years, the British [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War|took over Malabar]], defeating Tipu Sultan and ending his reign over the region. This allowed the Jenmi to return to their homes and regain the lands lost during the Mysorean invasion, with the help of the British government and its duly-constituted courts.<ref>Logan, 1951b:209-10.</ref> The British superimposed several Western juridical concepts, such as that of absolute property rights, upon the existing legal system of Malabar. Up until then, such rights had been unknown in the region and as a result all land became the private property of the Jenmi. This legal recognition gave them the right to evict tenants, which was in turn enforced through the British civil courts.<ref name=\"VVK\"/><ref name=\"DevReport\"/> In the words of William Logan:\n{{bquote|The (British) authorities, recognised the Janmi as absolute owner of his holding, and therefore free to take as big a share of the produce of the soil as he could get out of the classes beneath him... (Gradually) The British Courts backed up by Police and Magistrates and troops and big guns made the Janmi's independence complete. The hard terms thus imposed on the Kanakkaran had, of course, the effect of hardening the terms imposed by the Kanakkaran on those below him, the Verumpattakkar. The one-third of the net produce to which the Verumpattakkaran was customarily entitled, was more and more encroached upon as the terms imposed on the Kanakkaran became harder and harder. (Government of Madras. 1882, Vol. I: xvii, xxxi\u2013ii)}}\n\nAs conditions worsened, rents rose to as high as 75\u201380% of net produce, leaving the Verumpattakkar cultivators largely \"only straw\".<ref name=\"DevReport\"/> This caused great resentment among the Mappilas, who, in the words of Logan, were \"labouring late and early to provide a sufficiency of food for their wives and children\".<ref name=\"VVK\"/> General resentment amongst the Muslim population led to a long series of violent outbreaks beginning in 1836. These always involved the murder of Hindus, an act which the disgruntled Mappilas regarded as religiously meritorious and as part of their larger obligation to establish an Islamic state. In 1921, for instance, the stated aim was not simply to oust the Jenmi system, but to establish an [[Islamic state|Islamic nation]] in Malabar.<ref name=\"Hardgrave\"/> The British administration referred to the outbreaks as \"Moplah outrages\", but modern historians tend to treat them as religious outbreaks<ref>Mazumdar, 1973; Ravindran, 1973; Dale, 1980.</ref> or expressions of agrarian discontent.<ref>Houtart and Lemercinier, 1978; Namboodiripad, 1943:1\u20132; Panikkar. 1979:611; Wood, 1974.</ref> The massacre of Hindus and widespread [[sexual violence]] in 1921\u201322 sustained this tradition of violence in Malabar but with one crucial difference: this time it had also a political ideology and a formal organisation.<ref name=\"brill\"/><ref name=\"IHQ\">Pg 447, Pan-Islam in British Indian politics: a study of the Khilafat Movement, 1918\u20131924 M.

The evidence conclusively shows that it was the influence of the Khilafat and Non-co-operation movements that drove them to their crime. It is this which distinguishes the present from all previous outbreaks. Their intention was, absurd though it may seem, to subvert the British Government and to substitute a Khilafat Government by force of arms.(Judgement in Case No. 7 of 1921 on the file of the Special Tribunal, Calicut.) ...|author=|title=|source=}}\n\nNair noted Ali Musliyar rose to prominence at the instance of a Khilafat conference held in Karachi. Furthermore, Musliyar was not a native of Tirurangadi. He had only moved in 14 years earlier. So, according to Nair, there was not class revolt he was handling. It was a Khilafat edifice prepared and passed from distant Karachi, possibly controlled by spiritual leaders of Islam.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Gopalan Nair|first=Diwan Bahadur|title=Moplah Rebellion , 1921|publisher=Norman Printing Bureau|year=1922|isbn=|location=https://archive.org/stream/MoplahRebellion1921/Moplah%20rebellion,%201921_djvu.txt|pages=8}}</ref>\n\nThe Khilafat movement was introduced into the district of Malabar on 28 April 1920, by a Resolution at the Malabar District Conference, held at Manjeri, the headquarters of Ernad Taluk. On 30 March 1921, there was a meeting at which one Abdulla Kutti Musaliar of Vayakkad lectured on Khilafat, in Kizhakoth Amsom, Calicut Taluk. And at a second meeting held the next day at Pannur Mosque, there was some unpleasantness between the Mappilas on one side, and Nairs and Tiyyar, who resented the Khilafat meeting, on the other. The Mappilas mustered the strength to attack the place of worship belonging to the Hindu Adhigari of the village.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Nature of crimes ===\nThe Malabar Rebellion witnessed many attacks on the British officers.

They converted over 2,000 Hindus who had been forcibly converted to Islam by the Mappilas. However, their leader, [[Swami Shraddhanand|Swami Shraddhananda]] was stabbed on 23 December 1926 by an Islamist at his Ashram.\n\n==Rebellion and Response==\n[[File:Ali Musliyar.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Musliyar]] photographed during the uprising.]]\nOn 20 August 1921, the police attempted to arrest Vadakkevittil Muhammed, the secretary of the Khilafat Committee of Ernad at [[Pookkottur]], alleging that he had stolen the pistol of a Hindu ''[[Thirumulpad]]'' from a ''[[Kovilakam]]'' (manor) in [[Nilambur]]. A crowd of 2,000 Mappilas from the neighbourhood foiled the attempt, but on the following day, a squad of police arrested a number of Khilafat volunteers and seized records at the [[Mambaram, Malappuram|Mambaram]] Mosque in [[Tirurangadi]], leading to rumours that the building had been desecrated. A large crowd of Mappilas converged on Tirurangadi and besieged the local police station. The police opened fire on the crowd, triggering a furious reaction which soon engulfed the Eranad and [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]] Taluks along with neighbouring areas and continued for over two months.<ref name=\"keralagov\"/>\n\nFollowing the mosque incident, the rebels attacked and seized police stations, government treasuries, and entered the courts and registry offices where they destroyed records. Some even climbed into the judges' seats and proclaimed the advent of ''[[swaraj]]'' (self-rule).{{additional citation|date=January 2017}} The rebellion soon spread to the neighbouring areas of [[Malappuram]], [[Manjeri]], [[Perinthalmanna]], [[Pandikkad]] and [[Tirur]] under principle leaders [[Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed Haji|Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji]], Seethi Koya Thangal of Kumaranpathor and [[Ali Musliyar]]. By 28 August 1921, British administration had virtually come to an end in Malappuram, Tirurangadi, Manjeri, and Perinthalmanna, which then fell into the hands of the rebels who established complete domination over the Eranad and Valluvanad Taluks. On 24 August 1921, Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji took over command of the rebellion from Ali Musliyar. Public proclamations were issued by Variyankunnath and Seethi that those Mappilas who resorted to looting would receive exemplary punishments.<ref name=\"gazette\"/>{{additional citation|date=January 2017}}\n\n[[File:Moplah prisoners.jpg|thumb|Captured Mappila prisoners taken after a battle with British troops.]]\nDuring the initial stages of the rebellion, the British military and police were forced to withdraw from these areas but by the end of August, several contingents of British troops and [[Gurkha]] arrived.

The British administration raised a special quasi-military (or Armed Police) battalion, the [[Malabar Special Police]], initially consisting of non-Muslims and trained by the British Indian Army.

Any person could have said that this was too heavy a price for Hindu-Muslim unity. But Mr. Gandhi was so much obsessed by the necessity of establishing Hindu-Muslim unity that he was prepared to make light of the doings of the Moplas and the Khilafats who were congratulating them.

But I was surprised, an out-and-out Nationalist like Maulana Hasrat Mohani opposed the resolution on the ground that the Mopla country no longer remained Dar-ul-Aman but became Dar-ul-Harab and they suspected the Hindus of collusion with the British enemies of the Moplas. Therefore, the Moplas were right in presenting the Quran or sword to the Hindus.

He was highly critical of the \"sheer brutality\" of the atrocities committed on women during the rebellion, finding them \"horrible and unmentionable\". In particular, he referred to a resolution under the [[Zamorin]] Raja of the time and an appeal by the Rani of Nilambur. He further wrote:\n{{bquote|\"The horrid tragedy continued for months.

The rights conveyed by this ''janmam'' were not a [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] in the European sense, but an office of dignity. Owing to their ritual status as priests (Nambudris), the jenmis could neither cultivate nor supervise the land but would instead provide a grant of ''kanam'' to a ''kanakkaran'' in return for a fixed share of the crops produced. Typically, a Jenmi would have a large number of ''kanakkarar'' under him.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\n====Verumpattakkaran====\nThe Verumpattakkarar, generally [[Thiyya]] and Mappila classes, cultivated the land but were also its part-proprietors under the ''kanakkarar''. These classes were given a ''Verum Pattam'' (Simple Lease) of the land that was typically valid for one year. According to custom, they were also entitled to one-third or an equal share of the net produce.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nThe net produce of the land was the share left over after providing for the ''cherujanmakkar'' or all the other birthright holders such as the village [[Carpentry|carpenter]], the [[goldsmith]] and agricultural [[Laborer|labourers]] who helped to gather, prepare and store produce. The system ensured that no Jenmi could evict tenants under him except for non-payment of rent. This land tenure system was generally referred to as the ''janmi-kana-maryada'' (customary practices).<ref name=\"cooperjal\"/><ref name=\"VVK\"/>\n\n[[File:Madras map 1913.jpg|thumb|200px|Map of the Madras Presidency, after the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]].]]\n\n===Land reforms and Mappila outbreaks (1836\u20131921) \u2013 Theory of class conflict===\n\nDuring the [[Mysorean invasion of Malabar]], the Jenmi took refuge in neighbouring states. The tenants and the Nair army men who could not escape were converted into Islam, as described in [https://books.google.co.in/books/about/MALABAR_MANUAL.html?id=0TJFDwAAQBAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y William Logan's Malabar Manual]. Thus, [[Tipu Sultan]]'s Kingdom of Mysore, having driven the Jenmi out of Malabar, reached accord with the Muslim Kanakkars. A new system of land revenue was introduced for the first time in the region's history with the government share fixed on the basis of actual produce from the land.<ref name=\"DevReport\">Pg 53, Kerala Development Report, Government of India Planning Commission, Academic Foundation, 2008</ref>\n\nHowever, within five years, the British [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War|took over Malabar]], defeating Tipu Sultan and ending his reign over the region. This allowed the Jenmi to return to their homes and regain the lands lost during the Mysorean invasion, with the help of the British government and its duly-constituted courts.<ref>Logan, 1951b:209-10.</ref> The British superimposed several Western juridical concepts, such as that of absolute property rights, upon the existing legal system of Malabar. Up until then, such rights had been unknown in the region and as a result all land became the private property of the Jenmi. This legal recognition gave them the right to evict tenants, which was in turn enforced through the British civil courts.<ref name=\"VVK\"/><ref name=\"DevReport\"/> In the words of William Logan:\n{{bquote|The (British) authorities, recognised the Janmi as absolute owner of his holding, and therefore free to take as big a share of the produce of the soil as he could get out of the classes beneath him... (Gradually) The British Courts backed up by Police and Magistrates and troops and big guns made the Janmi's independence complete. The hard terms thus imposed on the Kanakkaran had, of course, the effect of hardening the terms imposed by the Kanakkaran on those below him, the Verumpattakkar. The one-third of the net produce to which the Verumpattakkaran was customarily entitled, was more and more encroached upon as the terms imposed on the Kanakkaran became harder and harder. (Government of Madras. 1882, Vol. I: xvii, xxxi\u2013ii)}}\n\nAs conditions worsened, rents rose to as high as 75\u201380% of net produce, leaving the Verumpattakkar cultivators largely \"only straw\".<ref name=\"DevReport\"/> This caused great resentment among the Mappilas, who, in the words of Logan, were \"labouring late and early to provide a sufficiency of food for their wives and children\".<ref name=\"VVK\"/> General resentment amongst the Muslim population led to a long series of violent outbreaks beginning in 1836. These always involved the murder of Hindus, an act which the disgruntled Mappilas regarded as religiously meritorious and as part of their larger obligation to establish an Islamic state. In 1921, for instance, the stated aim was not simply to oust the Jenmi system, but to establish an [[Islamic state|Islamic nation]] in Malabar.<ref name=\"Hardgrave\"/> The British administration referred to the outbreaks as \"Moplah outrages\", but modern historians tend to treat them as religious outbreaks<ref>Mazumdar, 1973; Ravindran, 1973; Dale, 1980.</ref> or expressions of agrarian discontent.<ref>Houtart and Lemercinier, 1978; Namboodiripad, 1943:1\u20132; Panikkar. 1979:611; Wood, 1974.</ref> The massacre of Hindus and widespread [[sexual violence]] in 1921\u201322 sustained this tradition of violence in Malabar but with one crucial difference: this time it had also a political ideology and a formal organisation.<ref name=\"brill\"/><ref name=\"IHQ\">Pg 447, Pan-Islam in British Indian politics: a study of the Khilafat Movement, 1918\u20131924 M.

Furthermore, Musliyar was not a native of Tirurangadi. He had only moved in 14 years earlier. So, according to Nair, there was not class revolt he was handling.

And at a second meeting held the next day at Pannur Mosque, there was some unpleasantness between the Mappilas on one side, and Nairs and Tiyyar, who resented the Khilafat meeting, on the other.

A crowd of 2,000 Mappilas from the neighbourhood foiled the attempt, but on the following day, a squad of police arrested a number of Khilafat volunteers and seized records at the [[Mambaram, Malappuram|Mambaram]] Mosque in [[Tirurangadi]], leading to rumours that the building had been desecrated. A large crowd of Mappilas converged on Tirurangadi and besieged the local police station. The police opened fire on the crowd, triggering a furious reaction which soon engulfed the Eranad and [[Valluvanad (southern Malabar)|Valluvanad]] Taluks along with neighbouring areas and continued for over two months.<ref name=\"keralagov\"/>\n\nFollowing the mosque incident, the rebels attacked and seized police stations, government treasuries, and entered the courts and registry offices where they destroyed records. Some even climbed into the judges' seats and proclaimed the advent of ''[[swaraj]]'' (self-rule).{{additional citation|date=January 2017}} The rebellion soon spread to the neighbouring areas of [[Malappuram]], [[Manjeri]], [[Perinthalmanna]], [[Pandikkad]] and [[Tirur]] under principle leaders [[Variyan Kunnathu Kunjahammed Haji|Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji]], Seethi Koya Thangal of Kumaranpathor and [[Ali Musliyar]].

On 24 August 1921, Variankunnath Kunjahammad Haji took over command of the rebellion from Ali Musliyar.

Being forced off the track by Bottas, Verstappen went onto the curbs and was almost passed by his Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo. The teammates collided at turn 2, after Verstappen's tyres locked up. This caused Ricciardo's radiator to break, forcing him to retire. Verstappen subsequently received a 10-second penalty for causing the incident. Ricciardo condemned Verstappen and called the incident \"an amateur error\".

The safety car went in at the end of lap 5, and shortly after the restart Vettel started to notice his steering pulling left on the straights. He was instructed to avoid the kerbs and his lap times started to increase, allowing teammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and the two Mercedes to catch up.\n\n[[Romain Grosjean]] pitted and was released with a loose wheel-nut. His car had to be retired and [[Haas F1 Team]] was fined \u20ac5,000 for releasing Grosjean in unsafe conditions.\n\nR\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen radioed to Ferrari that he wanted to get Vettel to move aside because Vettel was having problems and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was putting in quicker lap times. Ferrari ordered Vettel to speed up and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen kept up with him, and they both gradually increased the gap to both Mercedes cars. Hamilton was allowed past teammate Bottas and given 10 laps to use his engine overtake mode to try and get past R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Mercedes promised that if Hamilton couldn't get past, they would switch the cars back.\n\nWith nine laps to go, [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] was forced off track by [[Kevin Magnussen]] and subsequently had to retire his car due to issues with the brakes and the gearbox. Magnussen was later given a five-second penalty for his actions, which were described as \"nasty\" by H\u00fclkenberg.<ref name=nasty>{{Cite news|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/7/f1-hulkenberg-magnussen-hungary-clash-nasty.html|title=Hulkenberg blasts 'nasty' Magnussen after Hungary clash|work=Formula1.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> H\u00fclkenberg condemned Magnussen and called him \"the most unsporting driver on the grid\".<ref name=nasty/>\n\nWith Verstappen closing in, it appeared as if the switch back wasn't going to happen, but coming out of the last corner on the last lap, Hamilton slowed down, allowing Bottas past to claim the podium. Hamilton finished fourth, with Verstappen in fifth. [[McLaren|McLaren-Honda]] got their first double-points finish of the season with [[Fernando Alonso|Alonso]] finishing sixth and [[Stoffel Vandoorne|Vandoorne]] finishing tenth. This result moved them out of last place in the Constructors' standings. [[Carlos Sainz Jr.]] finished seventh for [[Scuderia Toro Rosso|Toro Rosso]]. [[Force India]] got yet another double-points finish with [[Sergio P\u00e9rez|P\u00e9rez]] in eighth and [[Esteban Ocon|Ocon]] in ninth.\n\nAs a result of the race, Vettel extended his lead in the Drivers' Championship over Hamilton to 14 points.

racing|Formula One motor race]] that took place on 30 July 2017 at the [[Hungaroring]] in [[Mogyor\u00f3d]], [[Hungary]]. The 2017 event was the 32nd time that the race has been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in {{F1|1950}}, every single time at the Hungaroring.\n\n[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] driver [[Sebastian Vettel]] entered the round&nbsp;leading the World Drivers' Championship by one point ahead of [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]]'s [[Lewis Hamilton]]. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by fifty-five points.\n\n==Report==\n===Background===\n[[Paul di Resta]] replaced [[Felipe Massa]] at Williams after Massa was taken ill after free practice. Massa's failure to compete in the race broke a streak of 605 consecutive races in which a Brazilian driver contested a Formula 1 World Championship race.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n=== Practice ===\n[[Red Bull Racing|Red&nbsp;Bull's]] [[Daniel&nbsp;Ricciardo]] went fastest in first practice,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2017/races/969/hungary/practice-1.html|title=Results|website=Formula1.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> setting a time of 1:18.486.

Massa had been unwell and dizzy<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/WilliamsRacing/status/891244951127949314/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https://drivetribe.com/p/felipe-massa-explains-why-hes-had-KRvtWz1tRnOCDjtkA0KhDw|title=Statement from @WilliamsRacing on @MassaFelipe19 #HungarianGPpic.twitter.com/I6W47CE6tk|last=RACING|first=WILLIAMS|date=2017-07-29|website=@WilliamsRacing|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> on Friday but was certified as fit to compete in Practice 3 by the medical staff. However, Massa did not feel any better during Practice 3, and his seat was taken by Williams reserve driver [[Paul di Resta]] for qualifying and the race.\n\n=== Qualifying ===\nIn Q1, [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] reserve driver Paul di Resta made his first start since the [[2013 Brazilian Grand Prix]] and quickly got up to speed with little prior practice. Di Resta's only experience in a hybrid F1 car consisted of 10 laps in a 2014-spec car and some laps in the simulator prior to the Australian Grand Prix.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/7/f1-di-resta-hungary-cliff-williams-qualifying-massa-illness.html|title='It was like being thrown off a cliff' \u2013 Di Resta on his late Williams call up|work=Formula1.com |access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> Di Resta qualified 19th in a car with Massa's settings, a performance that was described as \"unbelievable\" by Mercedes boss [[Toto Wolff]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/131016|title=Paul di Resta F1 qualifying performance unbelievable \u2013 Toto Wolff|last=Straw|first=Adam Cooper and Edd|work=Autosport.com|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}</ref> Di Resta later admitted that he was \"scared, nervous, [and] anxious\" about how he would perform given his lack of experience.\n\nIn Q3, Sebastian Vettel secured pole position with a time of 1:16.276. His teammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen secured second place, thus giving Ferrari its first qualifying 1\u20132 in Hungary since [[2004 Hungarian Grand Prix|2004]]. [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] locked out the second row on the grid, [[Red Bull Racing|Red Bull]] locked out the third row on the grid, and [[McLaren|McLaren-Honda]] locked out the fourth row of the grid in its best qualifying performance of the season.\n\n===Race===\nAt the start of the race, Vettel stayed ahead of his teammate and Bottas whilst Verstappen tried to go around the outside of R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Bottas. Being forced off the track by Bottas, Verstappen went onto the curbs and was almost passed by his Red Bull teammate Daniel Ricciardo. The teammates collided at turn 2, after Verstappen's tyres locked up. This caused Ricciardo's radiator to break, forcing him to retire. Verstappen subsequently received a 10-second penalty for causing the incident. Ricciardo condemned Verstappen and called the incident \"an amateur error\". Verstappen later apologised for the incident after the chequered flag.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/7/ricciardo-bemoans-verstappens-amateur-error.html|title=Verstappen apologises as Ricciardo bemoans 'amateur' error|work=Formula1.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref>\n\nThe [[safety car]] was called out almost immediately to clear Ricciardo's stricken Red Bull car and clean up oil from the track surface. The safety car went in at the end of lap 5, and shortly after the restart Vettel started to notice his steering pulling left on the straights. He was instructed to avoid the kerbs and his lap times started to increase, allowing teammate Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and the two Mercedes to catch up.\n\n[[Romain Grosjean]] pitted and was released with a loose wheel-nut. His car had to be retired and [[Haas F1 Team]] was fined \u20ac5,000 for releasing Grosjean in unsafe conditions.\n\nR\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen radioed to Ferrari that he wanted to get Vettel to move aside because Vettel was having problems and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen was putting in quicker lap times. Ferrari ordered Vettel to speed up and R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen kept up with him, and they both gradually increased the gap to both Mercedes cars. Hamilton was allowed past teammate Bottas and given 10 laps to use his engine overtake mode to try and get past R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. Mercedes promised that if Hamilton couldn't get past, they would switch the cars back.\n\nWith nine laps to go, [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]] was forced off track by [[Kevin Magnussen]] and subsequently had to retire his car due to issues with the brakes and the gearbox. Magnussen was later given a five-second penalty for his actions, which were described as \"nasty\" by H\u00fclkenberg.<ref name=nasty>{{Cite news|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/headlines/2017/7/f1-hulkenberg-magnussen-hungary-clash-nasty.html|title=Hulkenberg blasts 'nasty' Magnussen after Hungary clash|work=Formula1.com|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> H\u00fclkenberg condemned Magnussen and called him \"the most unsporting driver on the grid\".<ref name=nasty/>\n\nWith Verstappen closing in, it appeared as if the switch back wasn't going to happen, but coming out of the last corner on the last lap, Hamilton slowed down, allowing Bottas past to claim the podium. Hamilton finished fourth, with Verstappen in fifth. [[McLaren|McLaren-Honda]] got their first double-points finish of the season with [[Fernando Alonso|Alonso]] finishing sixth and [[Stoffel Vandoorne|Vandoorne]] finishing tenth.

W. Bromiley, D. M. Beegle, and W. M. Smith, \u201cEnglish Versions,\u201d ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979\u20131988), 83.</ref> The [[Authorized King James Version]] of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the [[Revised Version]] in 1885; it was not until the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1952 (New Testament in 1948) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962.  It was updated as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] in 1989.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the [[New English Bible]] was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, [[John Bertram Phillips|J. B. Phillips]] (1906\u20131982) produced an edition of the [[New Testament]] [[Epistles|letters]] in paraphrase, the ''Letters to Young Churches'', so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, ''[[Good News for Modern Man]]'', a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance.  Others followed suit. [[The Living Bible]], released in 1971, was published by its author [[Kenneth N. Taylor]], based on the literal [[American Standard Version]] of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips' version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the [[King James Bible|King James version]].\n \nDespite widespread criticism due to being a [[paraphrase]] rather than a translation, the popularity of [[The Living Bible]] created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called [[dynamic equivalence]], which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the [[American Bible Society]] extended the ''Good News for Modern Man'' to the [[Good News Bible]] (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor's Living Bible was published. This [[New Living Translation]] is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.\n\nAnother project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the [[King James Bible]] and the more informal [[Good News Bible]]. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the [[New International Version]] (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.\n\nThe debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or 'functional') equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of [[Gender-neutral language|inclusive language]] versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as ''feminist'', ''gender neutral'', or ''gender accurate''. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989), the [[Revised English Bible]] (1989), and [[Today's New International Version]] (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the [[English Standard Version]] (2001).\n\nA further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print \u2013 especially given the development of \"[[print on demand]]\".\n\nToday, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the ''[[Young's Literal Translation]]'' to the most free such as ''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'' and ''[[The Word on the Street (book)|The Word on the Street]]''.\n\n==18th and 19th century translations==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

W. Bromiley, D. M. Beegle, and W. M. Smith, \u201cEnglish Versions,\u201d ed. Geoffrey W. Bromiley, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised (Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979\u20131988), 83.</ref> The [[Authorized King James Version]] of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the [[Revised Version]] in 1885; it was not until the [[Revised Standard Version]] of 1952 (New Testament in 1948) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962.  It was updated as the [[New Revised Standard Version]] in 1989.\n\nIn the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the [[New English Bible]] was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, [[John Bertram Phillips|J. B. Phillips]] (1906\u20131982) produced an edition of the [[New Testament]] [[Epistles|letters]] in paraphrase, the ''Letters to Young Churches'', so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, ''[[Good News for Modern Man]]'', a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance.  Others followed suit. [[The Living Bible]], released in 1971, was published by its author [[Kenneth N. Taylor]], based on the literal [[American Standard Version]] of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips' version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the [[King James Bible|King James version]].\n \nDespite widespread criticism due to being a [[paraphrase]] rather than a translation, the popularity of [[The Living Bible]] created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called [[dynamic equivalence]], which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the [[American Bible Society]] extended the ''Good News for Modern Man'' to the [[Good News Bible]] (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor's Living Bible was published. This [[New Living Translation]] is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.\n\nAnother project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the [[King James Bible]] and the more informal [[Good News Bible]]. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the [[New International Version]] (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.\n\nThe debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or 'functional') equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of [[Gender-neutral language|inclusive language]] versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as ''feminist'', ''gender neutral'', or ''gender accurate''. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (1985), the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989), the [[Revised English Bible]] (1989), and [[Today's New International Version]] (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the [[English Standard Version]] (2001).\n\nA further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print \u2013 especially given the development of \"[[print on demand]]\".\n\nToday, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the ''[[Young's Literal Translation]]'' to the most free such as ''[[The Message (Bible)|The Message]]'' and ''[[The Word on the Street (book)|The Word on the Street]]''.\n\n==18th and 19th century translations==\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of ''Dance TV''. Although Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out as a dancer for ''Dance TV'', Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions anyway.\n\nAt the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she narrowly misses Lynne while parking her car. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner is cut (it is later discovered that Natalie bribed Lynne's partner to sabotage her audition). Janey and a local high school kid, Jeff, both shine, and are partnered together once they make the finals. Jeff loves to dance, though he feels pressured to attend [[trade school]] after graduation, like his father did before him.\n\nThe two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice, due to her strict father's rules. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling as she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \"Sister Natalie\".\n\nAn excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make hundreds of copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to quite a few odd characters all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the oddballs that were given invites show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl who locked her keys in her car. Meanwhile, a large admirer moves in on her. On Jeff's return, a fight ensues and after Jeff sucker punches the much larger man, they run out of the club together. Once at Janey's house, she is aglow over what her life has become: she is in the running to become a ''Dance TV'' regular, has a great best friend, as well as a boyfriend. They finally kiss before she excitedly runs inside.\n\nGiven the total wreck the party became, the rivalry with Natalie has intensified. She convinces her father to become more involved in ensuring her win. This is an easy feat considering that her father owns the company that Jeff's father works for. One day, Natalie's father, J.P. Sands, corners Jeff and tells him that if Natalie does not win, Jeff's father will lose his job. This puts him in a bad mood and he has a falling-out with Janey when he arrives at rehearsal. Her mood quickly matches his when she arrives home and sneaks into the house only to find that her father has installed a security system. He then grounds her for her continuous deception, making it virtually impossible for her to attend the dance contest final the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff's surly attitude and decreased desire to be in the contest is noticed by his father. Once he finally gets his son to talk, he simply asks if he can win the contest. When Jeff answers yes, he is instructed to do so and not to worry about his father's job. However, Janey is still on restriction and does not know Jeff has changed his mind. However, that changes when her little brother brings her a message that Jeff will compete and she employs Lynne to get her out of the house undetected.\n\nOnce Lynne arrives, Janey cuts the wires to the security system and escapes the clutches of the guard dog. When they arrive at the station, Janey makes the elevator up to the studio and Lynne does not. She barely makes the beginning of the show, embracing and kissing Jeff as she arrives. The show begins and the competition is underway. At home, Janey's family turns on the television and sees her dancing. Her father, furious, storms out of the house, on the way to the studio. Meanwhile, Jeff's father watches the show from his neighborhood pub, surrounded by friends who are all cheering on Jeff and Janey.\n\nAfter all of the dancers have performed on the live show, the decision comes back: there is a tie between Janey and Jeff and Natalie and her partner. A dance-off ensues. Natalie goes first and when done, strolls off the stage proudly, believing she has won. But after Janey tells Jeff \"Let's do it\", they pull out all the stops with a series of synchronized gymnastics Janey has taught Jeff over their time together. When the judges deliberate again, the decision is unanimous: Jeff and Janey win. Natalie is furious and begins to berate her partner over costing her the contest.

At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of ''Dance TV''. Although Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out as a dancer for ''Dance TV'', Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions anyway.\n\nAt the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she narrowly misses Lynne while parking her car. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner is cut (it is later discovered that Natalie bribed Lynne's partner to sabotage her audition). Janey and a local high school kid, Jeff, both shine, and are partnered together once they make the finals. Jeff loves to dance, though he feels pressured to attend [[trade school]] after graduation, like his father did before him.\n\nThe two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice, due to her strict father's rules. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling as she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \"Sister Natalie\".\n\nAn excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make hundreds of copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to quite a few odd characters all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the oddballs that were given invites show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl who locked her keys in her car. Meanwhile, a large admirer moves in on her. On Jeff's return, a fight ensues and after Jeff sucker punches the much larger man, they run out of the club together. Once at Janey's house, she is aglow over what her life has become: she is in the running to become a ''Dance TV'' regular, has a great best friend, as well as a boyfriend. They finally kiss before she excitedly runs inside.\n\nGiven the total wreck the party became, the rivalry with Natalie has intensified. She convinces her father to become more involved in ensuring her win. This is an easy feat considering that her father owns the company that Jeff's father works for. One day, Natalie's father, J.P. Sands, corners Jeff and tells him that if Natalie does not win, Jeff's father will lose his job. This puts him in a bad mood and he has a falling-out with Janey when he arrives at rehearsal. Her mood quickly matches his when she arrives home and sneaks into the house only to find that her father has installed a security system. He then grounds her for her continuous deception, making it virtually impossible for her to attend the dance contest final the next day.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff's surly attitude and decreased desire to be in the contest is noticed by his father. Once he finally gets his son to talk, he simply asks if he can win the contest. When Jeff answers yes, he is instructed to do so and not to worry about his father's job. However, Janey is still on restriction and does not know Jeff has changed his mind. However, that changes when her little brother brings her a message that Jeff will compete and she employs Lynne to get her out of the house undetected.\n\nOnce Lynne arrives, Janey cuts the wires to the security system and escapes the clutches of the guard dog. When they arrive at the station, Janey makes the elevator up to the studio and Lynne does not. She barely makes the beginning of the show, embracing and kissing Jeff as she arrives. The show begins and the competition is underway. At home, Janey's family turns on the television and sees her dancing. Her father, furious, storms out of the house, on the way to the studio. Meanwhile, Jeff's father watches the show from his neighborhood pub, surrounded by friends who are all cheering on Jeff and Janey.\n\nAfter all of the dancers have performed on the live show, the decision comes back: there is a tie between Janey and Jeff and Natalie and her partner. A dance-off ensues. Natalie goes first and when done, strolls off the stage proudly, believing she has won. But after Janey tells Jeff \"Let's do it\", they pull out all the stops with a series of synchronized gymnastics Janey has taught Jeff over their time together. When the judges deliberate again, the decision is unanimous: Jeff and Janey win. Natalie is furious and begins to berate her partner over costing her the contest. When she goes to her father to complain, he finally puts his foot down and tells his spoiled daughter to shut up, to her amazement. When Janey spots her father in the studio, she thinks she is in for trouble, but he smiles and shows his enthusiasm at her obvious talent. Miss Dance TV is called to the stage and when she enters, it is none other than Lynne, who has received the job when the former Miss Dance TV quit during the show.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] as Janey Glenn\n* [[Lee Montgomery]] as Jeff Malene\n* [[Morgan Woodward]] as JP Sands\n* [[Jonathan Silverman]] as Drew Boreman\n* [[Shannen Doherty]] as Maggie Malene\n* [[Helen Hunt]] as Lynne Stone\n* [[Ed Lauter]] as Col.

{"title_page": "The Family (sketch)", "text_new": "[[File:Carol Burnett Madeline Kahn Harvey Korman The Family 1976.jpg|thumb|Eunice rehearses a play with drama coach Mavis Danton ([[Madeline Kahn]]) in ''The Rehearsal'' (1976), with Ed watching.]]\n'''\"The Family\"''' is a series of [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] featured on ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', with one installment airing on ''[[Carol Burnett & Company]]''. ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs. Though Ed occasionally capitulates to his wife's browbeating and mother-in-law's carping, he has no qualms with exploding at and bickering with them, although it only gets him into shouting matches and heated altercations with Mama and Eunice, who will quickly move to bickering with each other in the process. Ed has nothing much to show for his life, and his low-class job and manner gives Eunice's rants and Mama's insults credibility. While in \"The Family\" sketches, as well as the Eunice movie, Ed leaves and divorces Eunice, he's seen married to her in all of their ''Mama's Family'' appearances. \n* '''Phillip Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Phillip was the eldest of Mama's three sons. He was a successful [[Hollywood]]-based [[screenwriter]] and [[Pulitzer Prize|Pulitzer]]/[[Nobel Peace Prize]]-winning author. Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son. He was a free-spirit who is a [[commercial illustrator]], and he was teased by Ed, who thought that painting was somewhat sissy. He appeared in the ''Christmas'' sketch, coming home for [[Christmas]] after five years, and he is unmarried.\n* '''Jack Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Jack was Mama's youngest son. He was visited by Eunice, Ed, and Mama in the hospital. It is mentioned that he and his wife Janie have children, and that he works in sales.\n* '''[[Ellen Harper]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Ellen was older than Eunice, and was as snobby and stuck on herself as she was on ''Mama's Family'' with a difference: She would snap back at her mother with more frequency and didn't even try to hide her glee when she got something that Eunice wanted.  She was married (her husband originally referred to as Tom, then Arthur, and later as Bruce) and had two spoiled daughters, Mary Beth and Debbie.  At one time, it was revealed that Ellen's full name was Mary Ellen.\n* '''Mickey Hart''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mickey was Ed's employee at the hardware store. He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).  Eunice evidently was rather sweet on him, but since Van Dyke left the show in the middle of the season, the relationship was never developed.\n*'''Carl Harper''' \u2013 A predominately [[unseen character]], he is the deceased husband of Mama and father of Ellen, Eunice, Jack, Larry, and Philip. He spends the vast majority of his time nested on the [[toilet]] in the bathroom with the door closed. In fact, he died on the toilet. In flashbacks, Carl's portrayed as a grouch who doesn't want to be interrupted during his long hours on the toilet, even for emergencies.\n\n==Sketches==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Season\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Episode\n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Airdate \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Title & Description \n! style=\"padding:0 8px;\" | Guest Stars\n|-\n| Season 7 \n| Ep 23\n| March 16, 1974\n| ''The Reunion'' \u2013 Phillip comes home for a visit.\n| [[Roddy McDowall]] as Phillip Harper\n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 1\n| September 14, 1974\n| ''Brotherly Love'' \u2013 Mama, Eunice and Ed come back home from church.\n|  \n|-\n| Season 8 \n| Ep 5\n| October 12, 1974\n| ''Hospital Visit'' \u2013 The family visits Jack in the hospital.\n| [[Tom Smothers]] as Jack Harper\n|-  \n| Season 8 \n| Ep 9\n| November 16, 1974\n| ''Sorry!'' \u2013 The family plays ''[[Sorry!

''The Carol Burnett Show'' debuted the skit series during its seventh season in 1973\u201374. It would air new installments of the skit for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"The Family\" wouldn't air until September 8, 1979 on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"The Family\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show.'' ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978. Altogether, there were 31 installments of \"The Family\" sketches.\n\nNot only was \"The Family\" well received enough to become a recurring skit on ''The Carol Burnett Show'', but it was admired enough to be developed into a 1982 [[television film|made-for-TV]] movie, ''[[Eunice (film)|Eunice]]'', and then [[Spin-off (media)|spun off]] into a full-fledged comedy series in 1983, titled ''[[Mama's Family]]'': a show which first aired on [[NBC]], until it was cancelled in 1984; then revived in 1986 in [[television syndication|first-run syndication]], lasting until its series finale in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.televisionhits.com/mamasfamily/ |title=The Mama's Family Site |publisher=Televisionhits.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref> [[Carol Burnett]], whose [[Eunice Higgins]] character was central in \"The Family\" sketches, did not appear in the sitcom's second incarnation, due to her acrimonious 1984 divorce from ''The Carol Burnett Show'' and ''Mama's Family'' producer [[Joe Hamilton (producer)|Joe Hamilton]], who owned all the ''Mama's Family'' characters. Burnett also resented [[Vicki Lawrence]] for accepting the role of Mama in first-run syndication as she would be working for Hamilton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=dTAwUcvzFOTw2QXQloGoCw&id=xT4EGArhKIAC&dq=Vicki+Lawrence+autobiography&q=Eunice+ |title=Vicki!: the true-life adventures of Miss Fireball \u2013 Vicki Lawrence, Marc Eliot \u2013 Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>\n\nAlong with featuring Carol Burnett as Eunice Higgins, \"The Family\" skits featured [[Vicki Lawrence]] as [[Thelma Harper]] (originally, only known as \"Mama\" for the most part, although Mickey Hart, Ed's employee, had referred to her as \"Thelma\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7OqigcLrMc |title=The Carol Burnett Show \u2013 The Family \u2013 Mickey's Apartment 1/2 (uncut) |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2013-03-01}}</ref>), and [[Harvey Korman]] as [[Ed Higgins]]. In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama has five children (in the subsequent series, she has only three): in addition to [[Ellen Harper]] (played by [[Betty White]]) and Eunice, there were three sons: Larry Harper ([[Alan Alda]]), Phillip Harper ([[Roddy McDowall]]), and Jack Harper ([[Tommy Smothers]]).  All three were replaced by [[Vinton Harper]], played by [[Ken Berry]], in the spin-off television series. Berry played Phillip in the made-for-TV movie, ''Eunice'' (precursor to ''Mama's Family''). [[Tim Conway]] played recurring character Mickey Hart, Ed's employee.\n\n==Background==\n\"The Family\" sketch was created and written by [[Dick Clair]] and [[Jenna McMahon]]. They originally had Burnett in mind to play Mama and have a guest star to play Eunice. However, Burnett decided that she wanted to play Eunice and wanted to give the part of Mama to Lawrence. Burnett also decided to do the sketch [[Southern American English|southern]] because of her own [[Texas]] background. The writers were so displeased with these decisions that during the first run-through, they threw down their pads and pencils and stormed out of the rehearsal hall. They complained that the sketch was ruined and that it would offend the [[American south|South]]. After airing and the enormously favorable viewer response, Clair and McMahon wound up writing the sketches for the rest of the run of the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=29 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nAmong plot techniques, \"The Family\" uses: (A) [[satire]] and [[observational comedy]], as the sketch subtly pokes fun of  real life occurrences and real-life human behaviors, inflating them and making fun of them; (B) [[comedy of manners]], as the characters satirize the behaviors of [[blue-collar worker|blue-collar]], [[working class|working-class]] southerners and speak in southern [[drawl]]s.\n\nUnlike ''Mama's Family'', the central character of \"The Family\" sketches is Eunice. \"The Family\" sketches are about the noisy, quarrelsome couple of Eunice and Ed and Eunice's unwelcome house guest who only adds to the drama, that being her catty elderly mama. There was a great deal more squabbling in \"The Family\" sketches than on ''Mama's Family''. It was stated many times that Eunice and Ed had two young sons, named [[Bubba Higgins]] and Billy-Joe Higgins (though in one skit, Eunice calls her children Bubba and Raymond); they are [[unseen character]]s in \"The Family\" sketches. The Bubba Higgins character, however, regularly appears in the first-run syndication version of ''Mama's Family''. Mama, Eunice, and Ed often have uproarious verbal wars over petty issues, such as board games (they played ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'', ''[[Sorry! (game)|Sorry!]]'',  and ''[[Password (game show)|Password]]''), how much butter has been used for the bread, what exactly happened 30 or 40 years ago, etc. The final \"Family\" sketch to air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' had Eunice talking to a psychiatrist trying to figure out what went wrong with her life.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n* '''[[Eunice Harper Higgins|Eunice Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the very fiery, stormy, irrepressible, browbeating daughter of Mama and wife of Ed, Eunice is histrionic and full of powerful emotions: cheerful and giddy one minute and uncontrollably upset the next. Eunice seemingly never changes outfits as she's always seen in the same [[Olive (color)|olive green]] dress. Greatly ambitious, Eunice aspires to achieve [[Celebrity|fame]], power, and a career in [[entertainment industry|entertainment]]; however, she's portrayed as a woman who can't excel past substandard living due to a selfless nature to see after her elderly mother (heavily emphasized in the ''Eunice'' movie). In addition, she feels deprived of even minimal contentment due to what she perceives as an inconsiderate, [[wikt:lowbrow#Adjective|lowbrow]] husband who couldn't care less about her happiness.\n\n:She wishes for nothing more than to move up the ladder and live out her dreams, but lacks the initiative and get-up-and-go, choosing rather to care for her aging mother. Her siblings, who rarely visit or call Mama, all live successful lives. Eunice is the only offspring willing to care for Mama, but Mama ungratefully treats her the worst. This is often shown in Mama's tendency to praise her other children for their successes, and in the same breath belittling Eunice for having no talent and thereby making nothing of herself. This is just one of many reasons why heated altercations break out among the three characters. When Eunice starts ranting, she brings up loads of irrelevant matters that she holds resentment over. Often her long-drawn-out rants will relate to issues dating as far back as her childhood. Of the three characters, Eunice exercises the most control in the gang.\n\n* '''[[Thelma Harper|Mama]]''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Mama is a cold, [[spite (sentiment)|spiteful]], cantankerous, elderly [[widow]]. Mama has other sides to her in ''Mama's Family'', such as her tendency to make good-natured wisecracks and snappy retorts; however, her commentary in \"The Family\" sketches is limited to constant captious complaints, belligerent remarks that instigate the other characters, and an easily annoyed demeanor. She also makes insinuative, disparaging remarks intended to offend and anger her daughter and son-in-law. For example, she constantly lets Ed and Eunice know what's wrong with them and how they've amounted to nothing.\n\n:In contrast to ''Mama's Family'', where she's portrayed as more independent and active, she's portrayed as a dependent senior in \"The Family\" sketches.  Ever an aggressor, Mama's often the one stirring up all the conflict and commotion among the three. Sometimes when they're all starting to get along (an ephemeral occurrence on the show, often arising from a [[wikt: mercurial|mercurial]] trait in all the characters), Mama will say something that she's fully aware will provoke Eunice and Ed. In fact, one of Eunice's most commonly used locutions is based on this behavior of Mama's: ''\"Don't you start with me, ol' lady!\"''\n\n:Mama originally lives on her own in \"The Family\" sketches, but ends up moving in with Eunice and Ed when old age catches up to her. It's worth noting as well that the home Mama is said and shown to have raised her children in is different among \"The Family\" sketches, the ''Eunice'' movie, and ''Mama's Family''. Moreover, there are slight changes between the home used in the [[Mama's Family#First life of the sitcom (seasons 1 & 2)|first life]] of ''Mama's Family'' and its [[Mama's Family#Second life of the sitcom (seasons 3-6)|second life]].\n\n* '''[[Ed Higgins]]''' \u2013 As the fiercely ill-tempered, slovenly, goofy, quirky son-in-law of Mama and the husband to Eunice. Ed is quick to become irritated by his wife and mother-in-law and doesn't hesitate to show it fiercely. When they're not at each other's throats, Eunice and Mama regularly bash Ed. Mama antagonizes Ed with putdowns over what a failure and unsuccessful slob he is, and Eunice regularly nags him about his \"inconsiderate\" treatment of her and her needs.

Although Phillip was Mama's favorite (along with Ellen), he was never spared Thelma's criticism, insults, or wrath.\n* '''Larry Harper''' \u2013 In \"The Family\" sketches, Larry was Mama's first-to-last son.

He wears a [[hearing aid]] and calls Mama \"Mother Harper\" and has referred to her as \"Thelma.\"\n* '''Dan Fogarty''' \u2013 An old friend of Ed's \u2013 portrayed by Dick Van Dyke \u2013 who stayed with Eunice for a short time after Ed abandoned her in the final season (Harvey Korman had left the series).
