He was one of the key figures in the [[Spanish Golden Age]] of [[Spanish Baroque literature|Baroque]] literature. His reputation in the world of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] literature is second only to that of [[Miguel de Cervantes]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicspanishbooks.com/16th-cent-baroque-lope-works.html|title=Works of Lope de Vega|website=www.classicspanishbooks.com|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> while the sheer volume of his literary output is unequalled, making him one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature. He was nicknamed \"The Phoenix of Wits\" and \"Monster of Nature\" (in {{lang-es|F\u00e9nix de los Ingenios, Monstruo de la Naturaleza|links=no}}) by Cervantes because of his prolific nature.\n\nLope de Vega renewed the Spanish theatre at a time when it was starting to become a mass cultural phenomenon. He defined its key characteristics, and along with [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and [[Tirso de Molina]], took Spanish Baroque theatre to its greatest heights. Because of the insight, depth and ease of his plays, he is regarded as one of the greatest dramatists in [[Western literature]], his plays still being produced worldwide. He was also considered one of the best [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poets in the Spanish language, and wrote several novels. Although not well known in the English-speaking world, his plays were presented in England as late as the 1660s, when diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded having attended some adaptations and translations of them, although he omits mentioning the author.\n\nSome 3,000 [[sonnet]]s, 3 [[novel]]s, 4 [[novella]]s, 9 [[epic poem]]s, and about 500 [[play (theatre)|plays]] are attributed to him. Although he has been criticised for putting quantity ahead of quality, nevertheless at least 80 of his plays are considered masterpieces. He was a friend of the writer [[Francisco de Quevedo]] and an arch-enemy of the dramatist [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]]. The volume of his lifework made him envied by not only contemporary authors such as Cervantes and [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]], but also by many others: for instance, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] once wished he had been able to produce such a vast and colourful oeuvre.<ref>Cfr. Eckermann, ''Conversations with Goethe'': in 1828 Eckermann recorded having a conversation about the extent of author's works, in which Goethe expressed his admiration towards Lope's.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Youth===\nLope de Vega y Fern\u00e1ndez<ref>Certificate of baptism: \u00abEn seis de Diciembre de mil quinientos y sesenta y dos a\u00f1os, el Muy Reverendo Se\u00f1or Licenciado Mu\u00f1oz bautiz\u00f3 a Lope, hijo de Feliz de Vega y de Francisca su mujer. Compadre mayor, Antonio G\u00f3mez; madrina su mujer\u00bb. Joaqu\u00edn de Entrambasaguas, ''Vida de Lope de Vega'', Ed. Labor, 1936, p. 20.</ref> (later Carpio) was born in [[Madrid]] to a family of undistinguished origins, recent arrivals in the capital from [[Valle de Carriedo]] in [[Cantabria]]. His father, F\u00e9lix de Vega, was an embroiderer. Little is known of his mother, Francisca Fern\u00e1ndez Fl\u00f3rez. He later changed the distinguished name of Carpio from one of his in-laws.\n\nAfter a brief stay in [[Valladolid]], his father moved to Madrid in 1561, perhaps drawn by the possibilities of the new capital city. However, Lope de Vega would later affirm that his father arrived in Madrid through a love affair from which his future mother was to rescue him. Thus the writer became the fruit of this reconciliation and owed his existence to the same jealousies he would later analyze so much in his dramatic works.\n\nThe first indications of young Lope's genius became apparent in his earliest years.  His friend and biographer P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n stated that at the age of five he was already reading Spanish and Latin, and by his tenth birthday, he was translating Latin verse. He wrote his first play when he was 12, allegedly ''El verdadero amante'', as he would later affirm in his dedication of the work to his son Lope, although these statements are most probably exaggerations.\n\nHis great talent bore him to the school of poet and musician [[Vicente Espinel]] in the Philippines, to whom he later always referred with veneration. In his fourteenth year he continued his studies in the ''[[Colegio Imperial de Madrid|Colegio Imperial]]'', a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school in Madrid, from which he absconded to take part in a military expedition in [[Portugal]]. Following that escapade, he had the good fortune of being taken into the protection of the [[Bishop of \u00c1vila]], who recognized the lad's talent and saw him enrolled in the [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]. Following graduation, Lope had planned to follow in his patron's footsteps and join the priesthood, but those plans were dashed by falling in love and realizing that celibacy was not for him. Thus he failed to attain a bachelor's degree and made what living he could as a secretary to aristocrats or by writing plays.\n\nIn 1583 Lope enlisted in the [[Spanish Navy]] and saw action at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] in the [[Azores]], under the command of his future friend [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz]], to whose son he would later dedicate a play.\n\nFollowing this, he returned to Madrid and began his career as a playwright in earnest. He also began a love affair with Elena Osorio (the \"Filis\" of his poems), who was separated from her husband, actor [[Crist\u00f3bal Calder\u00f3n]], and was the daughter of a leading theater director. When, after some five years of this torrid affair, Elena spurned Lope in favor of another suitor, his vitriolic attacks on her and her family landed him in jail for [[defamation|libel]] and, ultimately, earned him the punishment of eight years' banishment from the court and two years' [[internal exile]] from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].\n\n===Exile===\nHe went into exile undaunted, taking with him the 16-year-old Isabel de Alderete y Urbina, known in his poems by the [[anagram]] \"Belisa,\" the daughter of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II's]] court painter, [[Diego de Urbina]]. The two married under pressure from her family on 10 May 1588.\n\nJust a few weeks later, on the 29th of May, Lope signed up for another tour of duty with the Spanish Navy: this was the summer of 1588, and the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]] was about to sail against [[England]]. It is likely that his military enlistment was the condition required by Isabel's family, eager to be rid of such an ill presentable son-in-law, to forgive him for carrying her away.<ref>[http://www.cisi.unito.it/artifara/rivista2/testi/lopedevega.asp#_ftn7  Guillermo Carrasc\u00f3n, \"Modelos de comedia: Lope y Cervantes\", ''Artifara'' 2 (2002) 'Monographica', nota 7.]</ref>\n\nLope's luck again served him well, however, and his ship, the ''San Juan'', was one of the vessels to make it home to Spanish harbors in the aftermath of that failed expedition. Back in Spain by December 1588, he settled in the city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. There he lived with Isabel de Urbina and continued perfecting his dramatic formula participating regularly in the ''[[tertulia]]'' known as the ''Academia de los nocturnos'', in the company of such accomplished dramatists as the [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Francisco Agust\u00edn T\u00e1rrega, the secretary to the [[Duke of Gand\u00eda]] [[Gaspar de Aguilar]], [[Guill\u00e9n de Castro y Bellvis|Guill\u00e9n de Castro]], [[Carlos Boyl]], and [[Ricardo de Turia]]. With them he refined his approach to theatrical writing by violating the [[Classical unities|unity of action]] and weaving two plots together in a single play, a technique known as [[imbroglio]].\n\nIn 1590, at the end of his two years' [[exile]] from the realm, he moved to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to serve Francisco de Ribera Barroso, who later became the 2nd Marquis of Malpica, and, some time later, [[Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Duke of Alba]]. In this later appointment he became [[gentleman of the bedchamber]] to the ducal court of the [[House of Alba]], where he lived from 1592 to 1595. Here he read the work of [[Juan del Encina]], from whom he improved the character of the ''donaire'', perfecting still further his dramatic formula. In the fall of 1594, Isabel de Urbina died of [[postpartum]] complications. It was around this time that Lope wrote his [[pastoral]] novel ''La Arcadia'', which included many poems and was based on the Duke's household in Alba de Tormes.\n\n===Return to Castile===\n[[File:Casa-Museo de Lope de Vega (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[House-Museum of Lope de Vega|Lope's house]] in [[Madrid]] (1610\u20131635).]]\nIn 1595, following Isabel's death in childbirth, he left the Duke's service and &ndash; eight years having passed &ndash; returned to Madrid. There were other love affairs and other scandals: Antonia Trillo de Armenta, who earned him another lawsuit, and [[Micaela de Luj\u00e1n]], an illiterate but beautiful actress, who inspired a rich series of [[sonnet]]s, rewarded him with four children and was his lover until around 1608. In 1598, he married Juana de Guardo, the daughter of a wealthy butcher. Nevertheless, his trysts with others &ndash; including Micaela &ndash; continued.\n\nIn the 17th century Lope's literary output reached its peak. From 1607 he was also employed as a secretary, but not without various additional duties, by the Duke of Sessa. Once that decade was over, however, his personal situation took a turn for the worse. His favorite son, Carlos F\u00e9lix (by Juana), died and, in 1612, Juana herself died in childbirth. His writing in the early 1610s also assumed heavier religious influences and, in 1614, he joined the priesthood.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=F\u00e9lix de Lope de Vega Carpio}}</ref> The taking of holy orders did not, however, impede his romantic dalliances; what is more, he supplied his employer the duke with various female companions. The most notable and lasting of Lope's relationships was with Marta de Nevares, who met him in 1616 and would remain with him until her death in 1632.\n\nFurther tragedies followed in 1635 with the loss of Lope, his son by Micaela and a worthy poet in his own right, in a shipwreck off the coast of [[Venezuela]], and the abduction and subsequent abandonment of his beloved youngest daughter Antonia. Lope de Vega took to his bed and died of [[scarlet fever]], in Madrid, on 27 August of that year.\n\n===Priesthood===\n[[File:Monumento a Lope de Vega (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Lope de Vega dressed in sotan.(Madrid, 1902).]]\nThe period of life that characterizes priestly ordination of Lope de Vega was one of profound existential crisis, perhaps impelled by the death of close relatives. To this inspiration respond his Sacred Rhymes and the numerous devout works he began to compose, as well as the meditative and philosophical tone that appears in his last verses. On the night of December 19, 1611, the writer was the victim of an assassination attempt from which he could barely escape.<ref>El suceso consta en Jos\u00e9 del Corral, ''Sucedi\u00f3 en Madrid'' (Ediciones La Librer\u00eda, 2000) y ''ABC'' (26 de febrero de 2016): [http://www.abc.es/espana/madrid/abci-intento-asesinato-lope-vega-nunca-resolvio-201602262218_noticia.html \u00abEl intento de asesinato a Lope de Vega que nunca se resolvi\u00f3.\u00bb]</ref> Juana de Guardo suffered frequent illnesses and in 1612 Carlos F\u00e9lix died of fevers. On August 13 of the following year, Juana de Guardo died while giving birth to Feliciana. So many misfortunes affected Lope emotionally, and on May 24, 1614, he finally decided to be ordained a priest.\n\nThe literary expression of this crisis and its repentances are the Sacred Rhymes, published in 1614; there it says: \"If the body wants to be earth on earth / the soul wants to be heaven in heaven\", unredeemed dualism that constitutes all its essence. The Sacred Rhymes constitute a book at the same time introspective in the sonnets (he uses the technique of the spiritual exercises that he learned in his studies with the Jesuits) as devotee for the poems dedicated to diverse saints or inspired in the sacred iconography, then in full deployment thanks to the recommendations emanated from the Council of Trent.\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Lope de vega 02.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''El testimonio vengado''.]]\nLope's non-dramatic works were collected and published in Spain in the eighteenth century under the title ''Obras Sueltas'' (Madrid, 21 vols., 1776\u201379). The more important elements of this collection include the following:\n*''La Arcadia'' (1598), a pastoral romance;\n*''La Dragontea'' (1598), an epic poem of Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s last expedition and death;\n*''El Isidro'' (1599), a poetic narrative of the life of [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore]], future [[patron saint]] of Madrid, composed in octosyllabic [[Quintilla (poetry)|quintillas]];\n*''La Hermosura de Ang\u00e9lica'' (1602), an epic poem in three books, is a quasi sequel to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso''.\nLope de Vega was one of the greatest Spanish poets of his time, along with [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Francisco de Quevedo]]. His poems of Moorish and pastoral themes were extremely popular in the 1580s and 1590s, and in these, he portrayed elements of his own love affairs (appearing as a moor called Zaide or a shepherd called Belardo). In 1602 he published two hundred sonnets in the collection ''La Hermosura de Ang\u00e9lica'' and in 1604 he republished them with new material in ''Rimas''. In 1614, his religious sonnets appeared in a book entitled ''Rimas sacras'', which was another bestseller. In 1634, in a third book with similar title, ''Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tom\u00e9 de Burguillos'', which has been considered his poetic masterpiece and the most modern book of 17th-century poetry, Lope created a heteronym, Tom\u00e9 de Burguillos, a poor scholar who is in love with a maid called Juana and who observes society from a cynical and disillusioned position.\n\n===Background===\nLope was the playwright who established in Spanish drama the three-act ''[[Comedia (Spanish play)|comedia]]'' as the definitive form, ignoring the precepts of the prevailing school of his contemporaries. In ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609), which was his artistic manifesto and the justification of his style which broke the neoclassical [[Classical unities|three unities]] of place, time and action, he showed that he knew the established rules of poetry but refused to follow them on the grounds that the \"vulgar\" Spaniard cared nothing about them: \"Let us then speak to him in the language of fools, since it is he who pays us\" are famous lines from his manifesto.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vega Carpio, Lope Felix de|volume=27|pages=965\u2013967}}</ref>\n\nLope boasted that he was a Spaniard ''pur sang'' (pure-blooded), maintaining that a writer's business is to write so as to make himself understood, and took the position of a defender of the language of ordinary life.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLope's literary influence was chiefly Latin-Italian and, while he defended the tradition of the nation and the simplicity of the old [[Castilian language|Castilian]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> he emphasized his university education and the difference between those educated in the classics and the layman.\n\nThe majority of his works were written in haste and to order. Lope confessed that \"more than a hundred of my comedies have taken only twenty-four hours to pass from the [[Muse]]s to the boards of the theatre.\" His biographer P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n tells how in Toledo, Lope composed fifteen acts in as many days \u2013 five comedies in two weeks.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn spite of some discrepancies in the figures, Lope's own records indicate that by 1604 he had composed 230 three-act plays (''comedias''). The figure had risen to 483 by 1609, to 800 by 1618, to 1000 by 1620, and to 1500 by 1632. Montalb\u00e1n, in his ''Fama P\u00f3stuma'' (1636) set down the total of Lope's dramatic productions at 1800 ''comedias'' and more than 400 shorter sacramental plays. Of these, 637 plays are known by their titles, but only about 450 are extant. Many of these pieces were printed during Lope's lifetime, mostly by the playwright himself in the shape of twelve-play volumes, but also by booksellers who surreptitiously bought manuscripts from the actors who performed them.\n\n===Themes and sources===\nThe classification of this large mass of dramatic literature is a task of great difficulty. The terms traditionally employed &ndash; comedy, tragedy, and the like &ndash; are difficult to apply to Lope's oeuvre and another approach to categorization has been suggested. Lope's work essentially belongs to the drama of intrigue, the plot determining everything else. Lope used history, especially Spanish history, as his main source of subject matter. There were few national and patriotic subjects, from the reign of [[Pelagius of Asturias|King Pelayo]] to the history of his own age, he did not put upon the stage. Nevertheless, Lope's most celebrated plays belong to the class called ''capa y espada'' (\"[[cloak and dagger]]\"), where the plots are chiefly love intrigues along with affairs of honor, most commonly involving the [[petty nobility]] of medieval Spain.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAmong the best known works of this class are ''El perro del hortelano'' (''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Dog in the Manger]]''), ''El castigo sin venganza'' (''[[Punishment Without Revenge]]''),<ref>Lope de Vega: Three Major Plays, translated by Gwynne Edwards, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954017-4}}</ref> and ''El maestro de danzar'' (''The Dance Teacher''). In some of these, Lope strives to set forth some moral maxim and to illustrate its abuse with a living example. On the theme that poverty is no crime, in the play ''Las Flores de Don Juan'',  he uses the history of two brothers to illustrate the triumph of virtuous poverty over opulent vice, while indirectly attacking the institution of [[primogeniture]], which often places in the hands of an unworthy person the honor and substance of a family when younger members would be  better qualified for the trust. However, such morality pieces are rare in Lope's repertory; generally, his aim is to amuse and stir with his focus being on the plot, not concerning himself with instruction.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nLope encountered a poorly organized dramatic tradition; plays were sometimes composed in four acts, sometimes in three, and though they were written in verse, the structure of the versification was left to the individual writer. Because the Spanish public liked it, he adopted the style of drama which was then in vogue. He enlarged its narrow framework to a great degree, introducing a wide range of  material for dramatic situations \u2013 the [[Bible]], ancient [[mythology]], the lives of the [[saint]]s, ancient history, [[History of Spain|Spanish history]], the legends of the Middle Ages, the writings of the Italian novelists, current events, and everyday Spanish life in the 17th century. Prior to Lope, playwrights sketched the conditions of persons and their characters superficially. With fuller observation and more careful description, Lope de Vega depicted real character types with language and accouterments appropriate to their position in society. The old comedy was awkward and poor in its versification. Lope introduced order into all the forms of national poetry, from the old romance couplets to the lyrical combinations borrowed from Italy. He wrote that those who should come after him had only to go on along the path which he had opened.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Plays===\nListed here are some of the better-known of de Vega's plays:\n\n* ''El maestro de danzar'' (1594) (''The Dancing Master'')\n* ''Los locos de Valencia'' (''[[Madness in Valencia]]'')\n* ''El acero de Madrid'' (''[[The Steel of Madrid]]'')\n* ''El perro del Hortelano'' (''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Gardener's Dog]]'', a variation of [[The Dog in the Manger]] fable)\n* ''[[La viuda valenciana]]''\n* ''[[Perib\u00e1\u00f1ez y el comendador de Oca\u00f1a]]''\n* ''[[Fuenteovejuna]]''\n* ''El anzuelo de Fenisa'' (''[[Fenisa's Hook]]'')\n* ''El cordob\u00e9s valeroso Pedro Carbonero''\n* ''Mujeres y criados'' (''Women and Servants'')\n* ''El mejor alcalde, el Rey'' (''[[The Best Mayor, The King]]'')\n* ''El Nuevo Mundo descubierto por Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n'' (''The New World Discovered by Christopher Columbus'')\n* ''El caballero de Olmedo'' (''The Knight from Olmedo'')\n* ''[[La dama boba]]'' (''[[The Stupid Lady]]''; ''[[The Lady-Fool]]'')\n* ''El amor enamorado''\n* ''El castigo sin venganza'' (''[[Punishment Without Revenge]]'')\n* ''[[Las bizarr\u00edas de Belisa]]''\n* ''El mayordomo de la duquesa de Amalfi'' (''The Duchess of Amalfi's Steward'')\n* ''Lo Fingido Verdadero'' (''What you Pretend Has Become Real'')\n* ''El ni\u00f1o inocente de La Guardia'' (''The Innocent Child of La Guardia'')\n* ''La fe rompida''\n* ''El Honrado Hermano'' (''The Honourable Brother'', based in the Classic story of the Horatii and Curiatii)\n\n===Opera===\n* ''La selva sin amor'' (18 December 1627) (''The Lovelorn Forest''), first Spanish [[operetta]] / [[zarzuela]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=n2I4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215][[Melveena McKendrick]]<span>: \"Theatre in Spain, 1490\u20131700\"</span>, p. 215.

He was one of the key figures in the [[Spanish Golden Age]] of [[Spanish Baroque literature|Baroque]] literature. His reputation in the world of [[Spanish language|Spanish]] literature is second only to that of [[Miguel de Cervantes]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicspanishbooks.com/16th-cent-baroque-lope-works.html|title=Works of Lope de Vega|website=www.classicspanishbooks.com|access-date=2019-03-09}}</ref> while the sheer volume of his literary output is unequalled, making him one of the most prolific authors in the history of literature. He was nicknamed \"The Phoenix of Wits\" and \"Monster of Nature\" (in {{lang-es|F\u00e9nix de los Ingenios, Monstruo de la Naturaleza|links=no}}) by Cervantes because of his prolific nature.\n\nLope de Vega renewed the Spanish theatre at a time when it was starting to become a mass cultural phenomenon. He defined its key characteristics, and along with [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] and [[Tirso de Molina]], took Spanish Baroque theatre to its greatest heights. Because of the insight, depth and ease of his plays, he is regarded as one of the greatest dramatists in [[Western literature]], his plays still being produced worldwide. He was also considered one of the best [[Lyric poetry|lyric]] poets in the Spanish language, and wrote several novels. Although not well known in the English-speaking world, his plays were presented in England as late as the 1660s, when diarist [[Samuel Pepys]] recorded having attended some adaptations and translations of them, although he omits mentioning the author.\n\nSome 3,000 [[sonnet]]s, 3 [[novel]]s, 4 [[novella]]s, 9 [[epic poem]]s, and about 500 [[play (theatre)|plays]] are attributed to him. Although he has been criticised for putting quantity ahead of quality, nevertheless at least 80 of his plays are considered masterpieces. He was a friend of the writer [[Francisco de Quevedo]] and an arch-enemy of the dramatist [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]]. The volume of his lifework made him envied by not only contemporary authors such as Cervantes and [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]], but also by many others: for instance, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] once wished he had been able to produce such a vast and colourful oeuvre.<ref>Cfr. Eckermann, ''Conversations with Goethe'': in 1828 Eckermann recorded having a conversation about the extent of author's works, in which Goethe expressed his admiration towards Lope's.</ref>\n\n==Life==\n\n===Youth===\nLope de Vega y Fern\u00e1ndez<ref>Certificate of baptism: \u00abEn seis de Diciembre de mil quinientos y sesenta y dos a\u00f1os, el Muy Reverendo Se\u00f1or Licenciado Mu\u00f1oz bautiz\u00f3 a Lope, hijo de Feliz de Vega y de Francisca su mujer. Compadre mayor, Antonio G\u00f3mez; madrina su mujer\u00bb. Joaqu\u00edn de Entrambasaguas, ''Vida de Lope de Vega'', Ed. Labor, 1936, p. 20.</ref> (later Carpio) was born in [[Madrid]] to a family of undistinguished origins, recent arrivals in the capital from [[Valle de Carriedo]] in [[Cantabria]]. His father, F\u00e9lix de Vega, was an embroiderer. Little is known of his mother, Francisca Fern\u00e1ndez Fl\u00f3rez. He later changed the distinguished name of Carpio from one of his in-laws.\n\nAfter a brief stay in [[Valladolid]], his father moved to Madrid in 1561, perhaps drawn by the possibilities of the new capital city. However, Lope de Vega would later affirm that his father arrived in Madrid through a love affair from which his future mother was to rescue him. Thus the writer became the fruit of this reconciliation and owed his existence to the same jealousies he would later analyze so much in his dramatic works.\n\nThe first indications of young Lope's genius became apparent in his earliest years.  His friend and biographer P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n stated that at the age of five he was already reading Spanish and Latin, and by his tenth birthday, he was translating Latin verse. He wrote his first play when he was 12, allegedly ''El verdadero amante'', as he would later affirm in his dedication of the work to his son Lope, although these statements are most probably exaggerations.\n\nHis great talent bore him to the school of poet and musician [[Vicente Espinel]] in the Philippines, to whom he later always referred with veneration. In his fourteenth year he continued his studies in the ''[[Colegio Imperial de Madrid|Colegio Imperial]]'', a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] school in Madrid, from which he absconded to take part in a military expedition in [[Portugal]]. Following that escapade, he had the good fortune of being taken into the protection of the [[Bishop of \u00c1vila]], who recognized the lad's talent and saw him enrolled in the [[University of Alcal\u00e1]]. Following graduation, Lope had planned to follow in his patron's footsteps and join the priesthood, but those plans were dashed by falling in love and realizing that celibacy was not for him. Thus he failed to attain a bachelor's degree and made what living he could as a secretary to aristocrats or by writing plays.\n\nIn 1583 Lope enlisted in the [[Spanish Navy]] and saw action at the [[Battle of Ponta Delgada]] in the [[Azores]], under the command of his future friend [[\u00c1lvaro de Baz\u00e1n, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz]], to whose son he would later dedicate a play.\n\nFollowing this, he returned to Madrid and began his career as a playwright in earnest. He also began a love affair with Elena Osorio (the \"Filis\" of his poems), who was separated from her husband, actor [[Crist\u00f3bal Calder\u00f3n]], and was the daughter of a leading theater director. When, after some five years of this torrid affair, Elena spurned Lope in favor of another suitor, his vitriolic attacks on her and her family landed him in jail for [[defamation|libel]] and, ultimately, earned him the punishment of eight years' banishment from the court and two years' [[internal exile]] from [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]].\n\n===Exile===\nHe went into exile undaunted, taking with him the 16-year-old Isabel de Alderete y Urbina, known in his poems by the [[anagram]] \"Belisa,\" the daughter of [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II's]] court painter, [[Diego de Urbina]]. The two married under pressure from her family on 10 May 1588.\n\nJust a few weeks later, on the 29th of May, Lope signed up for another tour of duty with the Spanish Navy: this was the summer of 1588, and the [[Spanish Armada|Armada]] was about to sail against [[England]]. It is likely that his military enlistment was the condition required by Isabel's family, eager to be rid of such an ill presentable son-in-law, to forgive him for carrying her away.<ref>[http://www.cisi.unito.it/artifara/rivista2/testi/lopedevega.asp#_ftn7  Guillermo Carrasc\u00f3n, \"Modelos de comedia: Lope y Cervantes\", ''Artifara'' 2 (2002) 'Monographica', nota 7.]</ref>\n\nLope's luck again served him well, however, and his ship, the ''San Juan'', was one of the vessels to make it home to Spanish harbors in the aftermath of that failed expedition. Back in Spain by December 1588, he settled in the city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]]. There he lived with Isabel de Urbina and continued perfecting his dramatic formula participating regularly in the ''[[tertulia]]'' known as the ''Academia de los nocturnos'', in the company of such accomplished dramatists as the [[Canon (priest)|canon]] Francisco Agust\u00edn T\u00e1rrega, the secretary to the [[Duke of Gand\u00eda]] [[Gaspar de Aguilar]], [[Guill\u00e9n de Castro y Bellvis|Guill\u00e9n de Castro]], [[Carlos Boyl]], and [[Ricardo de Turia]]. With them he refined his approach to theatrical writing by violating the [[Classical unities|unity of action]] and weaving two plots together in a single play, a technique known as [[imbroglio]].\n\nIn 1590, at the end of his two years' [[exile]] from the realm, he moved to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to serve Francisco de Ribera Barroso, who later became the 2nd Marquis of Malpica, and, some time later, [[Antonio \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 5th Duke of Alba]]. In this later appointment he became [[gentleman of the bedchamber]] to the ducal court of the [[House of Alba]], where he lived from 1592 to 1595. Here he read the work of [[Juan del Encina]], from whom he improved the character of the ''donaire'', perfecting still further his dramatic formula. In the fall of 1594, Isabel de Urbina died of [[postpartum]] complications. It was around this time that Lope wrote his [[pastoral]] novel ''La Arcadia'', which included many poems and was based on the Duke's household in Alba de Tormes.\n\n===Return to Castile===\n[[File:Casa-Museo de Lope de Vega (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[House-Museum of Lope de Vega|Lope's house]] in [[Madrid]] (1610\u20131635).]]\nIn 1595, following Isabel's death in childbirth, he left the Duke's service and &ndash; eight years having passed &ndash; returned to Madrid. There were other love affairs and other scandals: Antonia Trillo de Armenta, who earned him another lawsuit, and [[Micaela de Luj\u00e1n]], an illiterate but beautiful actress, who inspired a rich series of [[sonnet]]s, rewarded him with four children and was his lover until around 1608. In 1598, he married Juana de Guardo, the daughter of a wealthy butcher. Nevertheless, his trysts with others &ndash; including Micaela &ndash; continued.\n\nIn the 17th century Lope's literary output reached its peak. From 1607 he was also employed as a secretary, but not without various additional duties, by the Duke of Sessa. Once that decade was over, however, his personal situation took a turn for the worse. His favorite son, Carlos F\u00e9lix (by Juana), died and, in 1612, Juana herself died in childbirth. His writing in the early 1610s also assumed heavier religious influences and, in 1614, he joined the priesthood.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=F\u00e9lix de Lope de Vega Carpio}}</ref> The taking of holy orders did not, however, impede his romantic dalliances; what is more, he supplied his employer the duke with various female companions. The most notable and lasting of Lope's relationships was with Marta de Nevares, who met him in 1616 and would remain with him until her death in 1632.\n\nFurther tragedies followed in 1635 with the loss of Lope, his son by Micaela and a worthy poet in his own right, in a shipwreck off the coast of [[Venezuela]], and the abduction and subsequent abandonment of his beloved youngest daughter Antonia. Lope de Vega took to his bed and died of [[scarlet fever]], in Madrid, on 27 August of that year.\n\n===Priesthood===\n[[File:Monumento a Lope de Vega (Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Lope de Vega dressed in sotan.(Madrid, 1902).]]\nThe period of life that characterizes priestly ordination of Lope de Vega was one of profound existential crisis, perhaps impelled by the death of close relatives. To this inspiration respond his Sacred Rhymes and the numerous devout works he began to compose, as well as the meditative and philosophical tone that appears in his last verses. On the night of December 19, 1611, the writer was the victim of an assassination attempt from which he could barely escape.<ref>El suceso consta en Jos\u00e9 del Corral, ''Sucedi\u00f3 en Madrid'' (Ediciones La Librer\u00eda, 2000) y ''ABC'' (26 de febrero de 2016): [http://www.abc.es/espana/madrid/abci-intento-asesinato-lope-vega-nunca-resolvio-201602262218_noticia.html \u00abEl intento de asesinato a Lope de Vega que nunca se resolvi\u00f3.\u00bb]</ref> Juana de Guardo suffered frequent illnesses and in 1612 Carlos F\u00e9lix died of fevers. On August 13 of the following year, Juana de Guardo died while giving birth to Feliciana. So many misfortunes affected Lope emotionally, and on May 24, 1614, he finally decided to be ordained a priest.\n\nThe literary expression of this crisis and its repentances are the Sacred Rhymes, published in 1614; there it says: \"If the body wants to be earth on earth / the soul wants to be heaven in heaven\", unredeemed dualism that constitutes all its essence. The Sacred Rhymes constitute a book at the same time introspective in the sonnets (he uses the technique of the spiritual exercises that he learned in his studies with the Jesuits) as devotee for the poems dedicated to diverse saints or inspired in the sacred iconography, then in full deployment thanks to the recommendations emanated from the Council of Trent.\n\n==Work==\n[[File:Lope de vega 02.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''El testimonio vengado''.]]\nLope's non-dramatic works were collected and published in Spain in the eighteenth century under the title ''Obras Sueltas'' (Madrid, 21 vols., 1776\u201379). The more important elements of this collection include the following:\n*''La Arcadia'' (1598), a pastoral romance;\n*''La Dragontea'' (1598), an epic poem of Sir [[Francis Drake]]'s last expedition and death;\n*''El Isidro'' (1599), a poetic narrative of the life of [[Isidore the Laborer|Saint Isidore]], future [[patron saint]] of Madrid, composed in octosyllabic quintillas;\n*''La Hermosura de Ang\u00e9lica'' (1602), an epic poem in three books, is a quasi sequel to [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto]]'s ''Orlando Furioso''.\nLope de Vega was one of the greatest Spanish poets of his time, along with [[Luis de G\u00f3ngora]] and [[Francisco de Quevedo]]. His poems of Moorish and pastoral themes were extremely popular in the 1580s and 1590s, and in these, he portrayed elements of his own love affairs (appearing as a moor called Zaide or a shepherd called Belardo). In 1602 he published two hundred sonnets in the collection ''La Hermosura de Ang\u00e9lica'' and in 1604 he republished them with new material in ''Rimas''. In 1614, his religious sonnets appeared in a book entitled ''Rimas sacras'', which was another bestseller. In 1634, in a third book with similar title, ''Rimas humanas y divinas del licenciado Tom\u00e9 de Burguillos'', which has been considered his poetic masterpiece and the most modern book of 17th-century poetry, Lope created a heteronym, Tom\u00e9 de Burguillos, a poor scholar who is in love with a maid called Juana and who observes society from a cynical and disillusioned position.\n\n===Background===\nLope was the playwright who established in Spanish drama the three-act ''[[Comedia (Spanish play)|comedia]]'' as the definitive form, ignoring the precepts of the prevailing school of his contemporaries. In ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609), which was his artistic manifesto and the justification of his style which broke the neoclassical [[Classical unities|three unities]] of place, time and action, he showed that he knew the established rules of poetry but refused to follow them on the grounds that the \"vulgar\" Spaniard cared nothing about them: \"Let us then speak to him in the language of fools, since it is he who pays us\" are famous lines from his manifesto.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Vega Carpio, Lope Felix de|volume=27|pages=965\u2013967}}</ref>\n\nLope boasted that he was a Spaniard ''pur sang'' (pure-blooded), maintaining that a writer's business is to write so as to make himself understood, and took the position of a defender of the language of ordinary life.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nLope's literary influence was chiefly Latin-Italian and, while he defended the tradition of the nation and the simplicity of the old [[Castilian language|Castilian]],<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> he emphasized his university education and the difference between those educated in the classics and the layman.\n\nThe majority of his works were written in haste and to order. Lope confessed that \"more than a hundred of my comedies have taken only twenty-four hours to pass from the [[Muse]]s to the boards of the theatre.\" His biographer P\u00e9rez de Montalb\u00e1n tells how in Toledo, Lope composed fifteen acts in as many days \u2013 five comedies in two weeks.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn spite of some discrepancies in the figures, Lope's own records indicate that by 1604 he had composed 230 three-act plays (''comedias''). The figure had risen to 483 by 1609, to 800 by 1618, to 1000 by 1620, and to 1500 by 1632. Montalb\u00e1n, in his ''Fama P\u00f3stuma'' (1636) set down the total of Lope's dramatic productions at 1800 ''comedias'' and more than 400 shorter sacramental plays. Of these, 637 plays are known by their titles, but only about 450 are extant. Many of these pieces were printed during Lope's lifetime, mostly by the playwright himself in the shape of twelve-play volumes, but also by booksellers who surreptitiously bought manuscripts from the actors who performed them.\n\n===Themes and sources===\nThe classification of this large mass of dramatic literature is a task of great difficulty. The terms traditionally employed &ndash; comedy, tragedy, and the like &ndash; are difficult to apply to Lope's oeuvre and another approach to categorization has been suggested. Lope's work essentially belongs to the drama of intrigue, the plot determining everything else. Lope used history, especially Spanish history, as his main source of subject matter. There were few national and patriotic subjects, from the reign of [[Pelagius of Asturias|King Pelayo]] to the history of his own age, he did not put upon the stage. Nevertheless, Lope's most celebrated plays belong to the class called ''capa y espada'' (\"[[cloak and dagger]]\"), where the plots are chiefly love intrigues along with affairs of honor, most commonly involving the [[petty nobility]] of medieval Spain.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAmong the best known works of this class are ''El perro del hortelano'' (''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Dog in the Manger]]''), ''El castigo sin venganza'' (''[[Punishment Without Revenge]]''),<ref>Lope de Vega: Three Major Plays, translated by Gwynne Edwards, Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-19-954017-4}}</ref> and ''El maestro de danzar'' (''The Dance Teacher''). In some of these, Lope strives to set forth some moral maxim and to illustrate its abuse with a living example. On the theme that poverty is no crime, in the play ''Las Flores de Don Juan'',  he uses the history of two brothers to illustrate the triumph of virtuous poverty over opulent vice, while indirectly attacking the institution of [[primogeniture]], which often places in the hands of an unworthy person the honor and substance of a family when younger members would be  better qualified for the trust. However, such morality pieces are rare in Lope's repertory; generally, his aim is to amuse and stir with his focus being on the plot, not concerning himself with instruction.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n===Legacy===\nLope encountered a poorly organized dramatic tradition; plays were sometimes composed in four acts, sometimes in three, and though they were written in verse, the structure of the versification was left to the individual writer. Because the Spanish public liked it, he adopted the style of drama which was then in vogue. He enlarged its narrow framework to a great degree, introducing a wide range of  material for dramatic situations \u2013 the [[Bible]], ancient [[mythology]], the lives of the [[saint]]s, ancient history, [[History of Spain|Spanish history]], the legends of the Middle Ages, the writings of the Italian novelists, current events, and everyday Spanish life in the 17th century. Prior to Lope, playwrights sketched the conditions of persons and their characters superficially. With fuller observation and more careful description, Lope de Vega depicted real character types with language and accouterments appropriate to their position in society. The old comedy was awkward and poor in its versification. Lope introduced order into all the forms of national poetry, from the old romance couplets to the lyrical combinations borrowed from Italy. He wrote that those who should come after him had only to go on along the path which he had opened.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Plays===\nListed here are some of the better-known of de Vega's plays:\n\n* ''El maestro de danzar'' (1594) (''The Dancing Master'')\n* ''Los locos de Valencia'' (''[[Madness in Valencia]]'')\n* ''El acero de Madrid'' (''[[The Steel of Madrid]]'')\n* ''El perro del Hortelano'' (''[[The Dog in the Manger (play)|The Gardener's Dog]]'', a variation of [[The Dog in the Manger]] fable)\n* ''[[La viuda valenciana]]''\n* ''[[Perib\u00e1\u00f1ez y el comendador de Oca\u00f1a]]''\n* ''[[Fuenteovejuna]]''\n* ''El anzuelo de Fenisa'' (''[[Fenisa's Hook]]'')\n* ''El cordob\u00e9s valeroso Pedro Carbonero''\n* ''Mujeres y criados'' (''Women and Servants'')\n* ''El mejor alcalde, el Rey'' (''[[The Best Mayor, The King]]'')\n* ''El Nuevo Mundo descubierto por Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n'' (''The New World Discovered by Christopher Columbus'')\n* ''El caballero de Olmedo'' (''The Knight from Olmedo'')\n* ''[[La dama boba]]'' (''[[The Stupid Lady]]''; ''[[The Lady-Fool]]'')\n* ''El amor enamorado''\n* ''El castigo sin venganza'' (''[[Punishment Without Revenge]]'')\n* ''[[Las bizarr\u00edas de Belisa]]''\n* ''El mayordomo de la duquesa de Amalfi'' (''The Duchess of Amalfi's Steward'')\n* ''Lo Fingido Verdadero'' (''What you Pretend Has Become Real'')\n* ''El ni\u00f1o inocente de La Guardia'' (''The Innocent Child of La Guardia'')\n* ''La fe rompida''\n* ''El Honrado Hermano'' (''The Honourable Brother'', based in the Classic story of the Horatii and Curiatii)\n\n===Opera===\n* ''La selva sin amor'' (18 December 1627) (''The Lovelorn Forest''), first Spanish [[operetta]] / [[zarzuela]]<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=n2I4AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA215][[Melveena McKendrick]]<span>: \"Theatre in Spain, 1490\u20131700\"</span>, p. 215.

The younger Avery grew up hearing at his grandfather's dinner table about the nobility of being a surgeon, which inspired him to pursue that career. His father \"ran off to God knows where because he couldn't stand the pressure of being an Avery\", and his mother Catherine raised him alone. He says that in his family, he was identified as \"just the pretty one\" and they never pushed him academically, so he pushed himself. Jackson is initially a [[Residency (medicine)|surgical resident]] at Mercy West Hospital. Alongside [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]), Reed Adamson ([[Nora Zehetner]]), and Charles Percy ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]), he joins the staff at Seattle Grace Mercy West after the institutions are merged. His grandfather Harper Avery is affiliated with Harvard and has to be treated at the hospital; during this period, he tries to convince his grandson to transfer to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], which he can arrange, but the younger Avery refuses.\n\nIn the aftermath of a mass shooting at SGMW, in which 11 people are killed, Avery suffers [[PTSD]]. For comfort, he and Kepner both take rooms in the large house of fellow resident [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]). Also living there are her husband, [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), resident [[Alex Karev]] and intern [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), her half-sister. For some time, Avery suffers because of the death of his friend Percy in the shooting, and having assisted in surgery on Shepherd while threatened at gunpoint by the shooter. The [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]] shows Avery's emerging interest in Meredith's sister, Lexie Grey, and they start a relationship. Avery also starts working with chief of [[plastic surgery]] [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), who had previously had a relationship with Lexie. She is discomfited by the two men working together and, when she later shows that she still has feelings for Sloan, Avery breaks up with her.\n\nAs the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Avery, prepare for their [[board certification]]s as they prepare for fellowships. The night before taking the exam, Jackson and April Kepner have sexual intercourse. However, Kepner is a virgin and regrets having broken her promise to [[Jesus]] to stay a virgin until marriage, the two have sex again during the period of the exams. During the exam, Avery is supported by his mother Catherine ([[Debbie Allen]]), who happens to be a tester at the exams.\n\nAvery, Meredith Grey, [[Cristina Yang]], and [[Alex Karev]] eventually pass their boards, while Kepner fails. Although Avery has true feelings for her, she pushes him away because she believes that he feels guilty for having sex with her. In the [[Flight (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight finale]], Avery reveals to April that he is taking the position at [[Tulane Medical Center]], despite feeling sick for leaving Seattle Grace Mercy West and her behind. As a celebration of the conclusion of their residencies, the former chief of surgery [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) organizes his annual dinner for them. The [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|eighth season]] ends with Avery, Karev, Kepner, and Webber waiting for Meredith and Yang. They are victims of an [[aviation accident]] in which Lexie Grey and eventually Mark Sloan die of their injuries.\n\nAfter the accident, Avery stays at Seattle Grace and continues his work in plastic surgery. He and Kepner continue a sexual relationship, although April is uneasy and believes she is pregnant. When she tells Avery, he proposes to her and she accepts, anticipating a happy wedding. But the pregnancy is false and the couple break up before announcing their engagement to the staff. As a means to avoid each other, the two doctors decide to each bring a date to [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]]'s wedding, both of whom are interns.\n\nAfter the wedding, Avery has sex in his car with his date, intern Stephanie Edwards ([[Jerrika Hinton]]). Shortly afterwards he tells Kepner about the incident, and she thanks him for his honesty. It is hinted that Avery still loves Kepner when she turns to him for dating advice and he shows jealousy. They re-establish a friendship. When the hospital faces a financial crisis, Avery's mother Catherine agrees to invest in the hospital via the Harper Avery foundation; but she insists that Avery be made chairman. The board (at Avery's suggestion) later renames the hospital as Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Kepner gets engaged to Matthew but at their wedding, Avery stands up to profess his love for her.\n\nKepner chooses Avery, and they run out of her wedding together. When Kepner regrets her decision, Avery proposes to her and they elope. They keep their marriage a secret from the rest of the hospital staff, because of a new rule restricting relations among the staff. Avery's ex-girlfriend Stephanie feels especially betrayed because of how he left her. Catherine Avery is not happy about her son's eloping with Kepner, as he failed to make a prenuptial agreement to protect the Avery family fortune. They make up after Kepner sign such an agreement.\n\nJackson and April soon hit a rough patch when they realize that they have different views about the way their children should be raised with respect to religion. Soon after their fight, April realizes she is pregnant. April and Jackson's baby is diagnosed during pregnancy with Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2, and they learn that the baby will not survive long after birth. Jackson believes that termination is the best option; however, April would rather give birth to the baby, knowing it will not live very long. They schedule an induction for the next day, and at the beginning of the appointment they are asked to sign their baby's death certificate, which is too hard for the couple to bear. April doesn't sign the papers and returns to work the same day praying for a miracle, while at work she has a heart to heart with a lady who lost her fianc\u00e9e the night before. They decide to give birth to the baby via induction at 24 weeks gestation, having it baptized right then. She gives birth to Samuel Norbert Avery and he passes away shortly after birth.\n\nIn the series 11 finale, Kepner tells Avery that she is leaving with [[Owen Hunt]] to serve as a trauma surgeon in the Army; it will help her grieve for their son. Avery lets her go and wonders how he can deal with his own grief.  After discussions over the phone via Facetime, Kepner tells Avery that she is extending her service time. The sound of gunfire and explosions are heard at April's base camp, leaving her to quickly terminate the call. On Valentine's Day, Kepner returns to the hospital, where she and Avery embrace in the foyer.\n\nIn season 12, their marriage begins to fall apart and they grow estranged.  In episode 11, they file for a civil divorce.  After their divorce is completed, Kepner reveals that she is pregnant with Avery's child. In season 14, Jackson begins a relationship with [[Maggie Pierce]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\nIn February 2009, [[Michael Ausiello]] hinted at the possibility of central character, [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), having another sibling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/02/25/greys-exclusive-3/|title='Grey's' exclusive: Does Mer have another MIA sibling?|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> The series had released a casting call for an actor who could pass as biracial; casting was postponed until season six.<ref name=\"Fancast120809\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212085721/http://www.fancast.com/blogs/greys-anatomy/is-mer-getting-a-brother-greys-star-speaks-out/|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/greys-anatomy/is-mer-getting-a-brother-greys-star-speaks-out/|title=Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams Addresses Meredith's Brother Rumor|date=December 8, 2009|first=Matt|last=Webb Mitovich|archivedate=December 12, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> Williams's casting was announced in late August 2009.

The younger Avery grew up hearing at his grandfather's dinner table about the nobility of being a surgeon, which inspired him to pursue that career. His father \"ran off to God knows where because he couldn't stand the pressure of being an Avery\", and his mother Catherine raised him alone. He says that in his family, he was identified as \"just the pretty one\" and they never pushed him academically, so he pushed himself. Jackson is initially a [[Residency (medicine)|surgical resident]] at Mercy West Hospital. Alongside [[April Kepner]] ([[Sarah Drew]]), Reed Adamson ([[Nora Zehetner]]), and Charles Percy ([[Robert Baker (actor)|Robert Baker]]), he joins the staff at Seattle Grace Mercy West after the institutions are merged. His grandfather Harper Avery is affiliated with Harvard and has to be treated at the hospital; during this period, he tries to convince his grandson to transfer to [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], which he can arrange, but the younger Avery refuses.\n\nIn the aftermath of a mass shooting at SGMW, in which 11 people are killed, Avery suffers [[PTSD]]. For comfort, he and Kepner both take rooms in the large house of fellow resident [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]). Also living there are her husband, [[Derek Shepherd]] ([[Patrick Dempsey]]), resident [[Alex Karev]] and intern [[Lexie Grey]] ([[Chyler Leigh]]), her half-sister. For some time, Avery suffers because of the death of his friend Percy in the shooting, and having assisted in surgery on Shepherd while threatened at gunpoint by the shooter. The [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|seventh season]] shows Avery's emerging interest in Meredith's sister, Lexie Grey, and they start a relationship. Avery also starts working with chief of [[plastic surgery]] [[Mark Sloan (Grey's Anatomy)|Mark Sloan]] ([[Eric Dane]]), who had previously had a relationship with Lexie. She is discomfited by the two men working together and, when she later shows that she still has feelings for Sloan, Avery breaks up with her.\n\nAs the end of the fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Avery, prepare for their [[board certification]]s as they prepare for fellowships. The night before taking the exam, Jackson and April Kepner have sexual intercourse. However, Kepner is a virgin and regrets having broken her promise to [[Jesus]] to stay a virgin until marriage, the two have sex again during the period of the exams. During the exam, Avery is supported by his mother Catherine ([[Debbie Allen]]), who happens to be a tester at the exams.\n\nAvery, Meredith Grey, [[Cristina Yang]], and [[Alex Karev]] eventually pass their boards, while Kepner fails. Although Avery has true feelings for her, she pushes him away because she believes that he feels guilty for having sex with her. In the [[Flight (Grey's Anatomy)|season eight finale]], Avery reveals to April that he is taking the position at [[Tulane Medical Center]], despite feeling sick for leaving Seattle Grace Mercy West and her behind. As a celebration of the conclusion of their residencies, the former chief of surgery [[Richard Webber]] ([[James Pickens, Jr.]]) organizes his annual dinner for them. The [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|eighth season]] ends with Avery, Karev, Kepner, and Webber waiting for Meredith and Yang. They are victims of an [[aviation accident]] in which Lexie Grey and eventually Mark Sloan die of their injuries.\n\nAfter the accident, Avery stays at Seattle Grace and continues his work in plastic surgery. He and Kepner continue a sexual relationship, although April is uneasy and believes she is pregnant. When she tells Avery, he proposes to her and she accepts, anticipating a happy wedding. But the pregnancy is false and the couple break up before announcing their engagement to the staff. As a means to avoid each other, the two doctors decide to each bring a date to [[Miranda Bailey|Dr. Bailey]]'s wedding, both of whom are interns.\n\nAfter the wedding, Avery has sex in his car with his date, intern Stephanie Edwards ([[Jerrika Hinton]]). Shortly afterwards he tells Kepner about the incident, and she thanks him for his honesty. It is hinted that Avery still loves Kepner when she turns to him for dating advice and he shows jealousy. They re-establish a friendship. When the hospital faces a financial crisis, Avery's mother Catherine agrees to invest in the hospital via the Harper Avery foundation; but she insists that Avery be made chairman. The board (at Avery's suggestion) later renames the hospital as Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Kepner gets engaged to Matthew but at their wedding, Avery stands up to profess his love for her.\n\nKepner chooses Avery, and they run out of her wedding together. When Kepner regrets her decision, Avery proposes to her and they elope. They keep their marriage a secret from the rest of the hospital staff, because of a new rule restricting relations among the staff. Avery's ex-girlfriend Stephanie feels especially betrayed because of how he left her. Catherine Avery is not happy about her son's eloping with Kepner, as he failed to make a prenuptial agreement to protect the Avery family fortune. They make up after Kepner sign such an agreement.\n\nJackson and April soon hit a rough patch when they realize that they have different views about the way their children should be raised with respect to religion. Soon after their fight, April realizes she is pregnant. April and Jackson's baby is diagnosed during pregnancy with Osteogenesis Imperfecta type 2, and they learn that the baby will not survive long after birth. Jackson believes that termination is the best option; however, April would rather give birth to the baby, knowing it will not live very long. They schedule an induction for the next day, and at the beginning of the appointment they are asked to sign their baby's death certificate, which is too hard for the couple to bear. April doesn't sign the papers and returns to work the same day praying for a miracle, while at work she has a heart to heart with a lady who lost her fianc\u00e9e the night before. They decide to give birth to the baby via induction at 24 weeks gestation, having it baptized right then. She gives birth to Samuel Norbert Avery and he passes away shortly after birth.\n\nIn the series 11 finale, Kepner tells Avery that she is leaving with [[Owen Hunt]] to serve as a trauma surgeon in the Army; it will help her grieve for their son. Avery lets her go and wonders how he can deal with his own grief.  After discussions over the phone via Facetime, Kepner tells Avery that she is extending her service time. The sound of gunfire and explosions are heard at April's base camp, leaving her to quickly terminate the call. On Valentine's Day, Kepner returns to the hospital, where she and Avery embrace in the foyer.\n\nIn season 12, their marriage begins to fall apart and they grow estranged.  In episode 11, they file for a civil divorce.  After their divorce is completed, Kepner reveals that she is pregnant with Avery's child. In season 14, Jackson begins a relationship with [[Maggie Pierce]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Casting and creation===\nIn February 2009, [[Michael Ausiello]] hinted at the possibility of central character, [[Meredith Grey]] ([[Ellen Pompeo]]), having another sibling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2009/02/25/greys-exclusive-3/|title='Grey's' exclusive: Does Mer have another MIA sibling?|first=Michael|last=Ausiello|authorlink=Michael Ausiello|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=February 25, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> The series had released a casting call for an actor who could pass as biracial; casting was postponed until season six.<ref name=\"Fancast120809\">{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212085721/http://www.fancast.com/blogs/greys-anatomy/is-mer-getting-a-brother-greys-star-speaks-out/|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/greys-anatomy/is-mer-getting-a-brother-greys-star-speaks-out/|title=Grey's Anatomy's Jesse Williams Addresses Meredith's Brother Rumor|date=December 8, 2009|first=Matt|last=Webb Mitovich|archivedate=December 12, 2009|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> Williams's casting was announced in late August 2009.

Jackson is unaware of Yang's relationship with [[Owen Hunt]] ([[Kevin McKidd]]), so the attraction is natural. Williams does not worry about fans of the couple hating his character because he understands that fans aren't really supposed to like the Mercy Westers; Jackson is in the enemy camp and \"has to take his lumps.\" Williams said the kiss was a \"pretty relatable crime of passion.\" The kiss doesn't have any immediate effects on Owen and Cristina's romance and it remains secret.<ref name=\"TVG110509\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/GreyAnatomy-Jackson-Cristina-1011684.aspx|title=Grey's Anatomy: Jesse Williams Dissects the Jackson-Cristina Kiss|date=November 5, 2009|first=Natalie|last=Abrams|work=[[TV Guide]]|publisher=[[Lions Gate Entertainment]]|accessdate=December 8, 2013}}</ref> Jackson and Cristina develop a sort of mutual understanding as they tend to push one another to be better.\n\nSpeaking of Jackson's past relationship with [[Lexie Grey]], Williams said: \"He tried to be safe and wise and not deal with girls, really, when he first focused on transitioning into Seattle Grace from Mercy West.

They get married and have a child together, but he dies shortly after birth. Distraught and searching for purpose, April turns to the army and goes on tour with Owen, leaving Jackson at Grey-Sloan Memorial. After extending her leave several times, Jackson gives April an ultimatum that if she does not return immediately to Seattle, their relationship is over. April does not immediately return, and when she finally does, Jackson feels that April does not respect his needs in the relationship, especially after losing a child. The two try to make it work, but eventually come to the decision to end their marriage. April discover she's pregnant the day of their divorce proceedings, but does not disclose this until after the papers have been signed.
