His 1924 Wimbledon victory made him the first player from outside the English-speaking world to win the tournament. His first appearance was in the [[France Davis Cup team|French Davis Cup team]] of 1921. He also made the final of the [[World Covered Court Championships]] in 1922, losing to Henri Cochet, but won the doubles and mixed doubles.

He was one of the famous \"[[The Four Musketeers (tennis)|Four Musketeers]]\" from his country who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Borotra was imprisoned in [[Itter Castle]] during the latter years of [[World War II]] and subsequently fought in the [[Battle for Castle Itter]].\n\n==Career==\nBorotra was born in Domaine du Pouy, [[Biarritz]], [[Aquitaine]], the oldest of four children.<ref name=\"deadspin\">{{cite web|author1=Adam Doster|title=Jean Borotra, The Most Interesting Man In Tennis, Won 19 Grand Slams And Escaped A Nazi Prison|url=http://deadspin.com/5918428/jean-borotra-the-most-interesting-man-in-tennis-won-19-grand-slams-and-escaped-a-nazi-prison|website=[[Deadspin]]|date=14 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nKnown as \"the Bounding [[Basque people|Basque]]\", he won four [[Grand Slam in tennis|Grand Slam]] singles titles in the [[French Open|French]], [[Australian Open|Australian]], and [[Wimbledon Championships|All England]] championships. The 1924 French Championship does not count towards his grand slam total as the French was only open to French nationals and members of French clubs. He only failed to win the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Championships]], as he was defeated in the final by his countryman [[Ren\u00e9 Lacoste]] in straight sets, thus missing a career Grand Slam. His 1924 Wimbledon victory made him the first player from outside the English-speaking world to win the tournament. His first appearance was in the [[France Davis Cup team|French Davis Cup team]] of 1921. He also made the final of the [[World Covered Court Championships]] in 1922, losing to Henri Cochet, but won the doubles and mixed doubles. The other major he did well in was the [[World Hard Court Championships]] (played on clay) \u2013 he won the doubles with Henri Cochet there in 1922.\n\nBorotra was ranked as high as World No. 2 by [[A. Wallis Myers]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 1926.<ref name=\"USLTAEncyclopedia\"/> Borotra won his last major in 1936 when he teamed up with [[Marcel Bernard]] for the French Championship doubles at Roland Garros.\n\nIn 1974, Borotra was one of the last three people to be awarded the IOC's [[Olympic Diploma of Merit]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Olympic Review, Issues 89-96 |publisher=International Olympic Committee |year=1975 |pages=162}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=Olympic Charter 1983 |publisher=Comite International Olympique |year=1983 |pages=142\u2013143}}</ref> And in 1976, he along with the three other Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].

Jane's stepfather, Dr. William Fletcher Penn was the first African American to graduate form Yale Medical College. Lastly, Jane's father, Dr. Louis T. Wright, who she took her greatest inspiration from, was among the first black students to earn an M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and the first African American doctor at a public hospital in New York City. During his 30 years working at the Harlem Hospital, he founded and directed the Harlem Hospital Cancer Research Foundation.<ref name=\"Kentake\">{{cite web |last1=Kentake |first1=Meserette |title=Louis T.

After her studies at Smith College, Jane earned a full scholarship to study medicine at New York Medical College. She graduated as a part of an accelerated three-year program at the top of her class in 1945 with the honors award.

During her time at the research institute, she and her father sparked an interest in chemotherapeutic agents. They were interested in making chemotherapy more accessible for everyone. In the 1940s chemotherapy was a new development, so it was not a well-known or well-practiced source for treatment because it was still in its experimental stage of drug development. Chemotherapy was considered the \u201clast resort\u201d and the drugs available and dosage was not very well defined. Both Jane and her father wanted to make chemotherapy a more accessible method of cancer treatment. They were the first groups to report the use of nitrogen mustard agents and folic acid antagonists as cancer treatments. The Folic acid antagonist can block folic acid in the body, which is required for cells to produce certain types of amino acids. By inhibiting the folic acids, cells are unable to make new strands of DNA/RNA or produce proteins to drive mitosis. Because cancer cells are highly proliferative compared to the other class in the human body, it is crucial to stop mitosis from happening. The folic acid antagonists that were tested were probably the most important discovery because the antifolates are highly potent against a vast array of solid tumors, including several types of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Methotrexate is still one of the main chemotherapy drugs used today to treat many types of cancer, and it has been a basis for all modern chemotherapy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/methotrexate|title=Treatment of Solid Tumor Cancers with the Chemotherapy Drug Methotrexate|date=2014-04-30|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\nWright's research work involved studying the effects of various drugs on tumors, and she was the first to identify [[methotrexate]], one of the foundational chemotherapy drugs, as an effective tool against cancerous tumors.<ref name=\"encworldbio\" /><ref name=\"Forster\">{{cite web |last1=Forster |first1=Victoria |last2=Wayne |first2=Elizabeth |title=Dr. Jane C.

In particular, Wright is credited with developing the technique of using human [[tissue culture]] rather than laboratory mice to test the effects of potential drugs on cancer cells.  She also pioneered the use of the drug [[methotrexate]] to treat [[breast cancer]] and [[skin cancer]] ([[mycosis fungoides|mycosis fungoids]]).\n\n==Early life and education==\nWright was born in Manhattan to Corinne Cooke, a public school teacher, and [[Louis T.

The first medical member of the Wright family was Dr. Ceah Ketcham Wright. Ceah was first born into slavery, and after the Civil War, Ceah earned his medical degree at Meharry Medical College. Jane's stepfather, Dr. William Fletcher Penn was the first African American to graduate form Yale Medical College. Lastly, Jane's father, Dr. Louis T. Wright, who she took her greatest inspiration from, was among the first black students to earn an M.D. from Harvard Medical School, and the first African American doctor at a public hospital in New York City. During his 30 years working at the Harlem Hospital, he founded and directed the Harlem Hospital Cancer Research Foundation.<ref name=\"Kentake\">{{cite web |last1=Kentake |first1=Meserette |title=Louis T.

After her studies at Smith College, Jane earned a full scholarship to study medicine at New York Medical College. She graduated as a part of an accelerated three-year program at the top of her class in 1945 with the honors award.  After graduating from medical school, Dr. Wright earned an internship at Bellevue Hospital during 1945 and 1946. In 1947, she married David D.

During her time at the research institute, she and her father sparked an interest in chemotherapeutic agents. They were interested in making chemotherapy more accessible for everyone. In the 1940s chemotherapy was a new development, so it was not a well-known or well-practiced source for treatment because it was still in its experimental stage of drug development. Chemotherapy was considered the \u201clast resort\u201d and the drugs available and dosage was not very well defined. Both Jane and her father wanted to make chemotherapy a more accessible method of cancer treatment. They were the first groups to report the use of nitrogen mustard agents and folic acid antagonists as cancer treatments. The Folic acid antagonist can block folic acid in the body, which is required for cells to produce certain types of amino acids. By inhibiting the folic acids, cells are unable to make new strands of DNA/RNA or produce proteins to drive mitosis. Because cancer cells are highly proliferative compared to the other class in the human body, it is crucial to stop mitosis from happening. The folic acid antagonists that were tested were probably the most important discovery because the antifolates are highly potent against a vast array of solid tumors, including several types of leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, melanoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Methotrexate is still one of the main chemotherapy drugs used today to treat many types of cancer, and it has been a basis for all modern chemotherapy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/research/progress/discovery/methotrexate|title=Treatment of Solid Tumor Cancers with the Chemotherapy Drug Methotrexate|date=2014-04-30|website=National Cancer Institute|access-date=2018-11-17}}</ref>\n\nWright's research work involved studying the effects of various drugs on tumors, and she was the first to identify [[methotrexate]], one of the foundational chemotherapy drugs, as an effective tool against cancerous tumors.<ref name=\"encworldbio\" /><ref name=\"Forster\">{{cite web |last1=Forster |first1=Victoria |last2=Wayne |first2=Elizabeth |title=Dr. Jane C.

The salesmen act more as con artists, lying about their identities and circumstances, in selling parcels of land in Florida and Arizona to customers, many of whom are uninterested or unable to afford a real estate investment. They rely on leads, information of potential customers, provided to them by office manager John Williamson ([[Kevin Spacey]]). The leads are purchased by their unseen bosses Mitch and Murray. \n\nA sales meeting is held by Blake ([[Alec Baldwin]]){{mdash}}a salesman \"from downtown\". In a profanity-laden tirade, he chastises the salesmen for their lack of sales and questions their manhood. Blake reveals that, in addition to the month's sale contest (whose winner and first runner-up receive a new Cadillac and a set of steak knives respectively), the bottom two salesmen will be fired. He stresses the mantra \"ABC\u2013Always Be Closing\" and reveals that a valuable set of leads, the \"Glengarry leads\", have arrived, but they will not be distributed to salesmen of their caliber. After Blake leaves, the salesmen split up for the rest of the evening.\n\n'''Levene''':\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene was once a brilliant salesman, but has since fallen into a rut implied to be lasting months, perhaps even years. Adding to Levene's plight is that fact his daughter is sick in the hospital with an unspecified illness. After the others leave, Levene attempts to secure one of the premiere leads from Williamson, who refuses on account of his recent sales record. Levene persists, first charming, then insulting, and finally bribing Williamson by offering him a part of his sales commission. Williamson agrees to 20 percent of the commission plus $50 per lead, but reneges on the deal when Levene is unable to pay upfront. Forced to leave with no good leads, Levene goes cold calling to a customer named Larry Spannel, but fails to close. Throughout the night, Levene is seen conversing on the phone with another lead, a couple named Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.\n\n'''Moss and Aaronow''':\nMoss and Aaronow go out together on an unsuccessful sale. Throughout their trip, an incensed Moss rants to a passive Aaronow about the state of affairs with the company, complaining about the business model where the top leads goes to the most successful salesmen and how Mitch and Murray take 90 percent of their sale. Upon returning to the Chinese restaurant across from the office, Moss proposes that someone strike back against Mitch and Murray by stealing the Glengarry leads and selling them to Jerry Graf, a colleague who has done well in his own business. Aaronow correctly deduces that Moss has indeed discussed an endeavor with Graf. Moss offers to let Aaronow in on the deal, which includes $2,500 and a job with Graf. The latter expresses interest, but balks when Moss tells him he must be the one to break into the office and steal the leads, and it must be done that night. Aaronow tries to remove himself from the topic, but Moss says he is already an accessory to the crime, simply because he listened. \n\n'''Roma''':  \nRichard \"Ricky\" Roma is by far the top salesman in the office. Rather than attend Blake's meeting, Roma instead stays at the Chinese restaurant, where he meets and converses with a timid man named James Lingk. Roma wows Lingk with philosophical monologues and puts him at ease, not once even mentioning real estate until the end of the scene. Convincing Lingk to be more outgoing with his life, Roma presents him literature about land in Florida. \n\n'''Act II'''\nThe next morning, it's revealed the office has been broken into. Leads and the salesmen's phones have been stolen. Police are on the scene and a detective is set to interview each of the salesmen. Roma arrives and pesters Williamson about the status of his latest sales contract, that of James Lingk's. Williamson says it has been filed at the bank, leading Roma to declare himself the winner of the Cadillac, since this sale puts him \"over the top\". Roma further insults Williamson by refusing to act on old leads. He then goes on to ease Aaronow, who is nervous about talking to the detective. \n\nAn overjoyed Levene arrives, announcing he has closed an $82,000 sale with the Nyborgs. While Roma is eager to hear Levene's story, a furious Moss, emerging from his interview with the detective, expresses only vitriol. Roma reminds Moss that he hasn't made a big sale in a month, causing Moss to furiously curse Roma out and storm out of the office, declaring he is \"going to Wisconsin\". Levene finishes his story to Roma, who congratulates him on his sale. \n\nEnergized with the close, Levene demands new leads and insults Williamson, who is left speechless. Roma, seeing Lingk arrive at the office, has Levene pose as his client and tries to usher him off to the airport to avoid a discussion. Lingk reveals that his wife told him to ask for his check back and that she has threatened to call the state's attorney. After a hysterical Aaronow emerges from his interview, Roma tries to put Lingk's mind at ease, eventually convincing him to get a drink and that his check has not been cashed yet. However, the ruse is ruined when Williamson (who erroneously believed that Lingk was worried about whether his check was stolen) claims that the check is already at the bank and has been cashed. A distressed Lingk leaves, causing Roma to launch into a profanity-laden tirade against him before going into his interview. \n\nLevene piles onto Williamson, ending his own rant by telling him \"if you're going to make something up, be sure that it helps\". Williamson realizes that Levene knows that the Lingk contract was still on his desk, something only the one who robbed the office would know. Confronted by Williamson, Levene denies the accusation at first, but eventually reveals he sold the leads to Jerry Graf, working with Moss. When Williamson nonetheless threatens to go to the police, Levene tries once more to charm and bribe his way out of the situation. He offers Williamson his entire cut from the Graf deal, which is rejected. When he offers a bigger cut of his commission, citing his new sale, Williamson reveals that the Nyborgs are mentally ill and unable to afford such pricy real estate and that \"they just like talking to salesmen\". Levene makes one last plea by mentioning his daughter, but Williamson coldly rebuffs him.\n\nUnaware of what's transpired, Roma emerges from his interrogation and praises Levene for his acting during the Lingk situation. He proposes that he and Levene enter business together. As Roma makes a call on a newly installed phone, Levene is called in by the detective. He tries to say something to Roma, who is entrenched in his call. Defeated, Levene walks into the office. While Roma goes off to the restaurant, Aaronow starts making his sales calls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Richard Roma]]\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as George Aaronow\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Dave Moss\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Williamson\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as James Lingk\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Larry Spannel\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as the detective\n\n==Production== \nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the <!-- Not 'Royal' until 1988. -->[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That same year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | coauthors = | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}</ref> Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks and [[New Line Cinema]] over the course of four years.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/>\n\n[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked [[Jack Lemmon]] to act in the film.<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\">{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 27, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. [[Alec Baldwin]], who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | coauthors = | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.<ref name= \"production notes\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky  remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\"<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients \u2013 [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] \u2013 soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> This did not stop other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\"/> from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembers: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.<ref name= \"Berardinelli, James\">{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anch\u00eda]], relied on low lighting and shadows. A blues, greens, and reds color scheme was used for the first part of the film, while the second half had a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\n\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film.

The salesmen act more as con artists, lying about their identities and circumstances, in selling parcels of land in Florida and Arizona to customers, many of whom are uninterested or unable to afford a real estate investment. They rely on leads, information of potential customers, provided to them by office manager John Williamson ([[Kevin Spacey]]). The leads are purchased by their unseen bosses Mitch and Murray. \n\nA sales meeting is held by Blake ([[Alec Baldwin]]){{mdash}}a salesman \"from downtown\". In a profanity-laden tirade, he chastises the salesmen for their lack of sales and questions their manhood. Blake reveals that, in addition to the month's sale contest (whose winner and first runner-up receive a new Cadillac and a set of steak knives respectively), the bottom two salesmen will be fired. He stresses the mantra \"ABC\u2013Always Be Closing\" and reveals that a valuable set of leads, the \"Glengarry leads\", have arrived, but they will not be distributed to salesmen of their caliber. After Blake leaves, the salesmen split up for the rest of the evening.\n\n'''Levene''':\nShelley \"The Machine\" Levene was once a brilliant salesman, but has since fallen into a rut implied to be lasting months, perhaps even years. Adding to Levene's plight is that fact his daughter is sick in the hospital with an unspecified illness. After the others leave, Levene attempts to secure one of the premiere leads from Williamson, who refuses on account of his recent sales record. Levene persists, first charming, then insulting, and finally bribing Williamson by offering him a part of his sales commission. Williamson agrees to 20 percent of the commission plus $50 per lead, but reneges on the deal when Levene is unable to pay upfront. Forced to leave with no good leads, Levene goes cold calling to a customer named Larry Spannel, but fails to close. Throughout the night, Levene is seen conversing on the phone with another lead, a couple named Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.\n\n'''Moss and Aaronow''':\nMoss and Aaronow go out together on an unsuccessful sale. Throughout their trip, an incensed Moss rants to a passive Aaronow about the state of affairs with the company, complaining about the business model where the top leads goes to the most successful salesmen and how Mitch and Murray take 90 percent of their sale. Upon returning to the Chinese restaurant across from the office, Moss proposes that someone strike back against Mitch and Murray by stealing the Glengarry leads and selling them to Jerry Graf, a colleague who has done well in his own business. Aaronow correctly deduces that Moss has indeed discussed an endeavor with Graf. Moss offers to let Aaronow in on the deal, which includes $2,500 and a job with Graf. The latter expresses interest, but balks when Moss tells him he must be the one to break into the office and steal the leads, and it must be done that night. Aaronow tries to remove himself from the topic, but Moss says he is already an accessory to the crime, simply because he listened. \n\n'''Roma''':  \nRichard \"Ricky\" Roma is by far the top salesman in the office. Rather than attend Blake's meeting, Roma instead stays at the Chinese restaurant, where he meets and converses with a timid man named James Lingk. Roma wows Lingk with philosophical monologues and puts him at ease, not once even mentioning real estate until the end of the scene. Convincing Lingk to be more outgoing with his life, Roma presents him literature about land in Florida. \n\n'''Act II'''\nThe next morning, it's revealed the office has been broken into. Leads and the salesmen's phones have been stolen. Police are on the scene and a detective is set to interview each of the salesmen. Roma arrives and pesters Williamson about the status of his latest sales contract, that of James Lingk's. Williamson says it has been filed at the bank, leading Roma to declare himself the winner of the Cadillac, since this sale puts him \"over the top\". Roma further insults Williamson by refusing to act on old leads. He then goes on to ease Aaronow, who is nervous about talking to the detective. \n\nAn overjoyed Levene arrives, announcing he has closed an $82,000 sale with the Nyborgs. While Roma is eager to hear Levene's story, a furious Moss, emerging from his interview with the detective, expresses only vitriol. Roma reminds Moss that he hasn't made a big sale in a month, causing Moss to furiously curse Roma out and storm out of the office, declaring he is \"going to Wisconsin\". Levene finishes his story to Roma, who congratulates him on his sale. \n\nEnergized with the close, Levene demands new leads and insults Williamson, who is left speechless. Roma, seeing Lingk arrive at the office, has Levene pose as his client and tries to usher him off to the airport to avoid a discussion. Lingk reveals that his wife told him to ask for his check back and that she has threatened to call the state's attorney. After a hysterical Aaronow emerges from his interview, Roma tries to put Lingk's mind at ease, eventually convincing him to get a drink and that his check has not been cashed yet. However, the ruse is ruined when Williamson (who erroneously believed that Lingk was worried about whether his check was stolen) claims that the check is already at the bank and has been cashed. A distressed Lingk leaves, causing Roma to launch into a profanity-laden tirade against him before going into his interview. \n\nLevene piles onto Williamson, ending his own rant by telling him \"if you're going to make something up, be sure that it helps\". Williamson realizes that Levene knows that the Lingk contract was still on his desk, something only the one who robbed the office would know. Confronted by Williamson, Levene denies the accusation at first, but eventually reveals he sold the leads to Jerry Graf, working with Moss. When Williamson nonetheless threatens to go to the police, Levene tries once more to charm and bribe his way out of the situation. He offers Williamson his entire cut from the Graf deal, which is rejected. When he offers a bigger cut of his commission, citing his new sale, Williamson reveals that the Nyborgs are mentally ill and unable to afford such pricy real estate and that \"they just like talking to salesmen\". Levene makes one last plea by mentioning his daughter, but Williamson coldly rebuffs him.\n\nUnaware of what's transpired, Roma emerges from his interrogation and praises Levene for his acting during the Lingk situation. He proposes that he and Levene enter business together. As Roma makes a call on a newly installed phone, Levene is called in by the detective. He tries to say something to Roma, who is entrenched in his call. Defeated, Levene walks into the office. While Roma goes off to the restaurant, Aaronow starts making his sales calls.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Richard Roma]]\n* [[Jack Lemmon]] as Shelley \"The Machine\" Levene\n* [[Alec Baldwin]] as Blake\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as George Aaronow\n* [[Ed Harris]] as Dave Moss\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as John Williamson\n* [[Jonathan Pryce]] as James Lingk\n* [[Bruce Altman]] as Larry Spannel\n* [[Jude Ciccolella]] as the detective\n\n==Production== \nDavid Mamet's play was first performed in 1983 at the <!-- Not 'Royal' until 1988. -->[[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]], London. It won the  [[Pulitzer Prize for Drama|Pulitzer Prize]] in 1984. That same year, the play made its [[United States|American]] debut in [[Chicago]] before moving to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Producer Jerry Tokofsky read the play on a trip to [[New York City]] in 1985 at the suggestion of director [[Irvin Kershner]] who wanted to make it into a film.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\">{{cite news | last = Weinraub | first = Bernard | coauthors = | title = The ''Glengarry'' Math: Add Money and Stars, then Subtract Ego | work = [[The New York Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = October 12, 1992 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/12/movies/the-talk-of-hollywood-the-glengarry-math-add-money-and-stars-then-subtract-ego.html | accessdate = 2010-03-31 }}</ref> Tokofsky saw the play on Broadway and contacted Mamet. Stanley R. Zupnik was a [[Washington, D.C.]] based producer of [[B movie]]s who was looking for a more profitable project. Tokofsky had co-produced two previous Zupnik films. In 1986, Tokofsky told Zupnik about Mamet's play, and Zupnik saw it on Broadway but found the plot confusing.\n\nMamet wanted $500,000 for the film rights and another $500,000 to write the screenplay. Zupnik agreed to pay Mamet's $1 million asking price, figuring that they could cut a deal with a cable company to bankroll the production. Because of the uncompromising subject matter and abrasive language, no major studio wanted to finance it, even with film stars attached. Financing came from cable and video companies, a German television station, an Australian cinema chain, several banks and [[New Line Cinema]] over the course of four years.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/>\n\n[[Al Pacino]] originally wanted to do the play on Broadway, but at the time he was doing another Mamet production, ''[[American Buffalo (play)|American Buffalo]]'', in [[London]]. He expressed interest in appearing in the film adaptation. In 1989, Tokofsky asked [[Jack Lemmon]] to act in the film.<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\">{{cite news | last = Blanchard | first = Jayne M | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry'' Hits the Screen with the Joys of Male Angst | work = [[Washington Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 27, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> During this time, Kershner dropped out to make another film, as did Pacino. [[Alec Baldwin]], who also attached, left the project over a contract disagreement. [[James Foley (director)|James Foley]]'s agent sent Foley Mamet's screenplay in early 1991, but Foley was hesitant to direct because he \"wanted great actors, people with movie charisma, to give it watchability, especially since the locations were so restricted\".<ref name= \"Hartl, John\">{{cite news | last = Hartl | first = John | coauthors = | title = Director is Happy to put Big Stars in Film Version of Mamet Play | work = [[Seattle Times]] | pages = | language = | publisher = | date = September 28, 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley took the screenplay to Pacino, with whom he had been trying to work on a film for years.<ref name= \"production notes\">{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' Production Notes | work = [[New Line Cinema]] Press Kit | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 1992 | url = | accessdate = }}</ref> Foley was hired to direct, only to leave the production as well.\n\nBy March 1991, Tokofsky contacted Baldwin and begged him to reconsider doing the film. Baldwin's character was specifically written for the actor, to include in the film version, and is not part of the original play. Tokofsky  remembers, \"Alec said: 'I've read 25 scripts and nothing is as good as this. OK. If you make it, I'll do it'.\"<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> The two men arranged an informal reading with Lemmon in [[Los Angeles]]. Subsequently, the three men organized readings with several other actors, as Lemmon remembers, \"Some of the best damn actors you're ever going to see came in and read and I'm talking about ''names''\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Tokofsky's lawyer, Jake Bloom, called a meeting at the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who represented many of the actors involved, and asked for their help. CAA showed little interest, but two of their clients \u2013 [[Ed Harris]] and [[Kevin Spacey]] \u2013 soon joined the cast.\n\nBecause of the film's modest budget, many of the actors took significant pay cuts. For example, Pacino cut his per-movie price from $6 million to $1.5 million, Lemmon was paid $1 million, Baldwin received $250,000, and so on.<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> This did not stop other actors, like [[Robert De Niro]], [[Bruce Willis]],<ref name= \"Weinraub, Bernard\"/> [[Richard Gere]], and [[Joe Mantegna]],<ref name= \"Blanchard, Jayne\"/> from expressing interest in the film. Mantegna had been in the original Broadway cast and won a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1985 for his portrayal of Roma.\n\nOnce the film's cast was assembled, they spent three weeks in rehearsals. With a budget set at $12.5 million, filming began in August 1991 at the [[Kaufman Astoria Studios]] in [[Queens, New York]], and on location in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], over 39 days. Harris remembers: \"There were five and six-page scenes we would shoot all at once. It was more like doing a play at times [when] you'd get the continuity going\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> Alan Arkin said of the script, \"What made it [challenging] was the language and the rhythms, which are enormously difficult to absorb\".<ref name= \"production notes\"/> During filming, members of the cast who were not required to be on the set certain days would show up anyway to watch the other actors' performances.<ref name= \"Berardinelli, James\">{{cite news | last = Berardinelli | first = James | coauthors = | title = ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' | work = ReelViews | pages = | language = | publisher = | year = 2006 | url = http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/g/glengarry_glen.html | accessdate = 2007-09-23 }}</ref>\n\nThe film's director of photography, [[Juan Ruiz Anch\u00eda]], relied on low lighting and shadows. A blues, greens, and reds color scheme was used for the first part of the film, while the second half had a monochromatic blue-grey color scheme.\n\nDuring the production, Tokofsky and Zupnik had a falling out over money and credit for the film.

This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'. Over the course of the episode, the two discuss the pros and cons of psychedelics, the dangers of drug usage if not well educated, and whether or not drugs can be beneficial for an individual's personal spiritual growth. They end up helping a pregnant woman give birth before they are all turned into zombies. However, they find this new situation a relief.

Sometime later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached him again to show a rough concept; taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\n===Writing and production===\nLater, this rough concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix ordered eight episodes, which premiered on April 20th, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|website=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] who were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust. The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Mike Mayfield joined the project as a supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations. The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to develop it out to following a concept. According to Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like [[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism. The animation also acts as a background for stories that expand the interviews.<ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Season 1 is a mesmerizing contemplation on life, love and death that mustn't be missed |url=https://meaww.com/the-midnight-gospel-duncan-trussell-family-hour-podcast-animated-netflix-series-love-death-life-431699 |website=Meaww|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the second episode deer-dog hybrids mangling baby clowns to a knight seeking vengeance against an ass-wielding villain. The animation also intentionally complements the dialogue of an interview. For example, during the episode with interviewee [[Anne Lamott]], she comments on her lack of fear of death as her character is wheeled to an industrial meat grinder run by a bunch of clowns.

An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is a continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season, there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to human life, and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels.

Sometime later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

The two assembled a team of approximately 190 people at Titmouse and started working on creating the episodes.<ref name=\"AnMag\"/> Mike Mayfield joined the project as a supervising director and writer for all the episodes. The team behind the show is composed of Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nDuring the beginning of production, they needed to know how much of the episodes will be story, to how much will be a podcast conversation, and they also need to choose which parts of the podcast to use in the show. According to Trussell, the parts of the podcast chosen for the series are about highlighting revelatory moments from his career. Trussell said: \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a podcast, there are moments where my whole universe changes because someone told me something that I never knew. Once you hear that, you\u2019re forever changed; you live in a completely different dimension than you lived in before.\u201d<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\">{{cite web |last1=Schager|first1=Nick |title=From the minds of \u201cAdventure Time\u201d creator Pendleton Ward and podcaster Duncan Trussell comes this fantastically beautiful head-trip of a show. |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-midnight-gospel-on-netflix-is-trippy-horny-and-the-next-great-animated-show |website=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=April 20, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> When Ward and Trussell started working on the scripts, Ward said it would be like taking an [[Indiana Jones]] movie and replacing the dialogue with podcast conversations. The main idea was to turn it into an entertaining animated show. They began to develop it out to following a concept. According to Trussell that concept was \"During the apocalypse, people aren\u2019t just going to talk about the apocalypse, being in apocalyptic movies the situation revolves all around the survival.\u2019 Sort of the genesis of the show is what would happen if we took these podcast conversations and made them the dialogue that was happening during the various forms of the apocalypse.\u201d<ref name=\"ComingS\">{{cite web |last1=Hermanns|first1=Grant|title=CS Interview: Duncan Trussell on The Midnight Gospel |url=https://www.comingsoon.net/tv/features/1132053-cs-interview-duncan-trussell-on-the-midnight-gospel |website=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was expanded as the writer\u2019s room began exploring various potential apocalypses and finding a way to ensure that the podcast material was able to match up the storylines they built around the episode.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> This was the main challenge of writing the episodes, besides choosing the best interviews, was making them coherent for animation.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> Trussell described as a \u201claborious process\u201d while also realizing it helped evolve into a series with a story arc.<ref name=\"ComingS\"/> They also worked to find a way to embed them in the psychedelic apocalyptic tapestry of the animation. They thought episodes should have a balance so the animation does not take people out of the interview. With an excessive focus on animation, people would not pay attention to everything equally. The team worked to let the conversations react with the world.<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/> According to Trussell, the influence for The Midnight Gospel come from [[Adult Swim]]'s lo-fi aesthetic in general and shows like [[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] and [[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]. Others references included the animated films \"[[Watership Down]]\" and \"[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]\" and the animated television series \"[[\u00c6on Flux]]\" and \"[[Liquid Television]]\" and the mystery horror drama television series \"[[Twin Peaks]]\".<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\nFor Ward, it was Trussell\u2019s long-form audio chats that inspired him to return to TV animation<ref name=\"The Daily Beast\"/> and the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and ''The Midnight Gospel'' would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel. Trussell says, \"\u2019Gospel\u2019 means good news, and I was hoping that we convey the message that even through the most catastrophic situations, when everything is falling part, there is opportunity to grow as a person.\u201d<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nA second season for the show is uncertain. According to Trussell \"[the world of the Chromatic Ribbon] is a very big world. I spent a long time with Pen working out all the details. Some people might see it and think some people are saying gibberish, that something was absurd and unintended, but every brick in that structure, every piece of the puzzle is intentional and based on a lot of lore. It's a very, very, very, very interesting big world, and I would love to explore that world for as long as I possibly can.\"<ref name=\"CBRIn\"/>\n\n===Themes===\nThroughout the episodes the series deals with different themes that explored through the interviews. During the first season, the guests interviewed covered topics such as [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]], [[meditation]], forgiveness, spiritualism, funerary rituals, death positivity, drug use, pain, moksha (transcendence) and existentialism. The animation also acts as a background for stories that expand the interviews.<ref name=\"Mea1\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Season 1 is a mesmerizing contemplation on life, love and death that mustn't be missed |url=https://meaww.com/the-midnight-gospel-duncan-trussell-family-hour-podcast-animated-netflix-series-love-death-life-431699 |website=Meaww|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 20, 2020}}</ref> In the second episode deer-dog hybrids mangling baby clowns to a knight seeking vengeance against an ass-wielding villain. The animation also intentionally complements the dialogue of an interview. For example, during the episode with interviewee [[Anne Lamott]], she comments on her lack of fear of death as her character is wheeled to an industrial meat grinder run by a bunch of clowns. These animated backstories pulls the viewer into the conversation, making him an important part of the exploration of said subject.<ref name=\"Thr1\">{{cite web |last1=Robinson|first1=Joshua|title=Netflix's Mind-Melting Animated Series 'The Midnight Gospel' Is a Soul-Affirming Success|url=https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/the-midnight-gospel-review-netflix |website=[[Thrillist]]|accessdate=April 21, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> \n\nOne constant in several episodes is the life cycle. An analysis of birth and death. The series reinforces how this cycle is a continuous, ending process and one cannot escape it. In the last episode of the first season, there is a deeper discussion about the miracle of life, the suffering that existence brings to human life, and the detestable pain that death brings with it. The main theme of this episode entitled \"Mouse of Silver\" is to deal with the loss of a loved one. Despite being the main theme in this episode, the theme reappears in several others at different levels. For Trussell, the last episode becomes even more personal due to the discourse brought by him deep sorrow he felt after he lost his mother to cancer.<ref name=\"Mea2\">{{cite web |last1=Salvi|first1=Pooja|title='The Midnight Gospel' Ending Explained: Is Clancy dead?

David Opie from ''[[Digital Spy]]'' identified ''The Midnight Gospel'' as an antithesis to ''Rick and Morty''. He claims that both shows change the viewers' perspective on the worldview. According him \"''Rick and Morty'' might embrace nihilism more than most, thriving in the chaos of Rick's anarchic worldview, but the world ends over and over again for real in ''The Midnight Gospel'', providing a cosmic counterpoint to the introspective teachings of the 'space-cast'.\" He also points out how the show deals positively with topics like hope and loss. <ref name=\"DigS\">{{cite web |last1=Opie|first1=David|title=Why The Midnight Gospel is the anti-Rick and Morty|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a32205363/midnight-gospel-review-netflix-rick-and-morty/ |website=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=April 22, 2020 |date=April 21, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|11639414}}\n\n{{Netflix original current series}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Midnight Gospel}}\n[[Category:2020 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2020s animated television series]]\n[[Category:American adult animated adventure television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Netflix original programming]]\n[[Category:Surrealist television series]]\n[[Category:Television series by Netflix Animation]]\n[[Category:Television series created by Pendleton Ward]]\n", "name_user": "MatthewHoobin", "label": "safe", "comment": "Clarified.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Gospel"}
