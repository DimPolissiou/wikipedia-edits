First, during an interview by DoD on April 24, 2018,  Lieber was asked whether he was involved in the [[Thousand Talents Program]]. Lieber stated that \"he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program\", adding that \"he 'wasn't sure' how China categorized him.\" The DOJ believes that  Lieber's statement was false, because an intercepted email dated June 27, 2012, from Wuhan University of Technology (\"WUT\") included a contract for  Lieber to sign. Second, in November 2018, the NIH inquired of Harvard University about Lieber's foreign affiliations. In January 2019, Harvard interviewed Lieber and reported to NIH that Lieber \"had no formal association with WUT\" after 2012. The DOJ believes Lieber's statement was false. Lieber was charged with two counts of violating  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), one on April 24, 2018, and one in January 2019 for making the allegedly false statements.\n\nDuring his arraignment, authorities executed [[Search warrant|search warrants]] at his home and office in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. The charges against Lieber carry a sentence of five years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] and a quarter million dollar fine.  Lieber has been placed on paid administrative leave by Harvard.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|title=Harvard scientist charged with lying about ties to Chinese university; two Chinese nationals accused of economic espionage - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128215029/https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|archive-date=2020-01-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 2010 he won the annual weigh-off at Frerich's Farm in Rhode Island with a 1,610-lb pumpkin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|title=Frerich's Farm Newsletter/November 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223856/http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and returned in 2012 with a 1,770-lb pumpkin that won 2nd place in that year's weigh-off but set a Massachusetts record.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|title=Chem professor grows Mass.'s largest pumpkin, no plans for pie|last=|first=|date=15 October 2014|website=The Harvard Crimson|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223729/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|archive-date=7 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> His 1,870-lb pumpkin in 2014 was named the largest pumpkin in Massachusetts and ranked 17th largest in the world that year.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|title=Nanoscientist grows giant pumpkin, crabs in costume|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Chemical and Engineering News 92(43):40|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223647/http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The discrepancy between the size scales of his day job and hobby has been noted: \u201c\u2026on the one hand, Lieber\u2019s chemistry \u201chas had a defining influence on the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology,\u201d according to his CV.

LIEBER) by Robert Plumb , FBI Special Agent|last=|first=|date=|website=US Department of Justice|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=February 4, 2020}}</ref>, there are two counts of alleged crime committed by Lieber. First, during an interview by DoD on April 24, 2018,  Lieber was asked whether he was involved in the [[Thousand Talents Program]]. Lieber stated that \"he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program\", adding that \"he 'wasn't sure' how China categorized him.\" The DOJ believes that  Lieber's statement was false, because an intercepted email dated June 27, 2012, from Wuhan University of Technology (\"WUT\") included a contract for  Lieber to sign. Second, in November 2018, the NIH inquired of Harvard University about Lieber's foreign affiliations. In January 2019, Harvard interviewed Lieber and reported to NIH that Lieber \"had no formal association with WUT\" after 2012. The DOJ believes Lieber's statement was false. Lieber was charged with two counts of violating  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(a)(2), one on April 24, 2018, and one in January 2019 for making the allegedly false statements.\n\nDuring his arraignment, authorities executed [[Search warrant|search warrants]] at his home and office in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]. The charges against Lieber carry a sentence of five years in [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal prison]] and a quarter million dollar fine.  Lieber has been placed on paid administrative leave by Harvard.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|title=Harvard scientist charged with lying about ties to Chinese university; two Chinese nationals accused of economic espionage - The Boston Globe|website=BostonGlobe.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128215029/https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/01/28/metro/federal-prosecutors-boston-announce-charge-against-renowned-harvard-professor-lying-about-ties-program-chinese-university/|archive-date=2020-01-28|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nLieber is Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jinfo.org/Wolf.html | title=Jewish Recipients of the Wolf Prize}}</ref> Since 2007 he has grown giant [[Pumpkin|pumpkins]] in his back yard in Lexington, Massachusetts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuvGPuI-vmc|title=Journey of the great pumpkins|last=Mahoney|first=Bryan|date=11 October 2007|website=YouTube|access-date=}}</ref> In 2010 he won the annual weigh-off at Frerich's Farm in Rhode Island with a 1,610-lb pumpkin,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|title=Frerich's Farm Newsletter/November 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223856/http://www.frerichsfarm.com/November%202010%20News.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> and returned in 2012 with a 1,770-lb pumpkin that won 2nd place in that year's weigh-off but set a Massachusetts record.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|title=Chem professor grows Mass.'s largest pumpkin, no plans for pie|last=|first=|date=15 October 2014|website=The Harvard Crimson|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223729/http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/10/15/lieber-grows-prize-winning-pumpkin/|archive-date=7 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> His 1,870-lb pumpkin in 2014 was named the largest pumpkin in Massachusetts and ranked 17th largest in the world that year.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|title=Nanoscientist grows giant pumpkin, crabs in costume|last=|first=|date=2014|website=Chemical and Engineering News 92(43):40|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107223647/http://cen.acs.org/articles/92/i43/Nanoscientist-Grows-Giant-Pumpkin-Crabs.html|archive-date=2016-11-07|url-status=live}}</ref> The discrepancy between the size scales of his day job and hobby has been noted: \u201c\u2026on the one hand, Lieber\u2019s chemistry \u201chas had a defining influence on the field of nanoscience and nanotechnology,\u201d according to his CV.
