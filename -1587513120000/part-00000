This has the advantages of improving mechanical stiffness, and improving the reliability of the sealing between them.\n\n''Monobloc'' techniques date back to the beginnings of the [[internal combustion engine]]. Use of the term has changed over time, usually to address the most pressing mechanical problem affecting the engines of its day. There have been three distinct uses of the technique:\n* [[#Cylinder head|Cylinder head]] and cylinder\n* [[#Cylinder block|Cylinder block]]\n* Cylinder block and [[#Crankcase|crankcase]]\nIn most cases, any use of the term describes single-unit construction, opposed to the more common contemporary practice. Where the monobloc technique has later become the norm, the specific term fell from favour. It is now usual practice to use monobloc cylinders and crankcases, but a monobloc head (for a water-cooled inline engine at least) would be regarded as peculiar and obsolescent.\n\n== Cylinder head ==\n[[File:Napier petrol boat engine, side section (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III).jpg|thumb|[[Napier & Son|Napier]] engine, with monobloc head<ref name=\"Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III, Napier\" >[[#Rankin|Kennedy]], pp.&nbsp;163-167</ref>]]\n[[File:Daimler DB 605 cutaway.jpg|thumb|[[DB 605]] inverted aircraft engine of [[World War II|WW2]], with monobloc cylinder blocks and heads]]\n[[File:Air-cooled monobloc cylinder, section (Manual of Driving and Maintenance).jpg|thumb|upright|Sectioned view of an air-cooled single cylinder, with monobloc head and access plug above the side valve]]\nThe [[head gasket]] is the most highly stressed static seal in an engine, and was a source of considerable trouble in early years. The monobloc cylinder head forms both cylinder and head in one unit, thus avoiding the need for a seal.\n\nAlong with head gasket failure, one of the least reliable parts of the early petrol engine was the exhaust valve, which tended to fail by overheating. A monobloc head could provide good water cooling, thus reduced valve wear, as it could extend the water jacket uninterrupted around both head and cylinder. Engines with gaskets required a metal-to-metal contact face here, disrupting water flow.\n\nThe drawback to the monobloc head is that access to the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) is difficult. Access through the cylinder bore is restricted for machining the valve seats, or for inserting angled valves. An even more serious restriction is de-coking and re-grinding valve seats, a regular task on older engines. Rather than removing the cylinder head from above, the mechanic must remove pistons, connecting rods and the crankshaft from beneath.<ref name=\"Conway, Bugatti, 1984, 64\" >{{Cite book\n  |series=Great Marques\n  |title=Bugatti\n  |chapter=Type 41 Royale\n  |last=Conway  |first=H.G.\n  |year=1984\n  |publisher=Octopus\n  |isbn=0-7064-2046-2\n  |ref=Conway, Bugatti, 1984\n  |pages=64\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Stein, 1973, 172\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=The World of the Automobile\n  |last=Stein  |first=Ralph\n  |year=1973\n  |publisher=Hamlyn\n  |isbn=0-600-39305-4\n  |ref=Stein, 1973\n  |pages=172\u2013173\n}}</ref>\n\nOne solution to this for [[side-valve engine]]s was to place a screwed plug directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the screwed plug provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less \"dead space\". One solution was to place the [[spark plug]] in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space.

This has the advantages of improving mechanical stiffness, and improving the reliability of the sealing between them.\n\n''Monobloc'' techniques date back to the beginnings of the [[internal combustion engine]]. Use of the term has changed over time, usually to address the most pressing mechanical problem affecting the engines of its day. There have been three distinct uses of the technique:\n* [[#Cylinder head|Cylinder head]] and cylinder\n* [[#Cylinder block|Cylinder block]]\n* Cylinder block and [[#Crankcase|crankcase]]\nIn most cases, any use of the term describes single-unit construction, opposed to the more common contemporary practice. Where the monobloc technique has later become the norm, the specific term fell from favour. It is now usual practice to use monobloc cylinders and crankcases, but a monobloc head (for a water-cooled inline engine at least) would be regarded as peculiar and obsolescent.\n\n== Cylinder head ==\n[[File:Napier petrol boat engine, side section (Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III).jpg|thumb|[[Napier & Son|Napier]] engine, with monobloc head<ref name=\"Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III, Napier\" >[[#Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III|Rankin Kennedy, Modern Engines, Vol III]], pp.&nbsp;163-167</ref>]]\n[[File:Daimler DB 605 cutaway.jpg|thumb|[[DB 605]] inverted aircraft engine of [[World War II|WW2]], with monobloc cylinder blocks and heads]]\n[[File:Air-cooled monobloc cylinder, section (Manual of Driving and Maintenance).jpg|thumb|upright|Sectioned view of an air-cooled single cylinder, with monobloc head and access plug above the side valve]]\nThe [[head gasket]] is the most highly stressed static seal in an engine, and was a source of considerable trouble in early years. The monobloc cylinder head forms both cylinder and head in one unit, thus avoiding the need for a seal.\n\nAlong with head gasket failure, one of the least reliable parts of the early petrol engine was the exhaust valve, which tended to fail by overheating. A monobloc head could provide good water cooling, thus reduced valve wear, as it could extend the water jacket uninterrupted around both head and cylinder. Engines with gaskets required a metal-to-metal contact face here, disrupting water flow.\n\nThe drawback to the monobloc head is that access to the inside of the combustion chamber (the upper volume of the cylinder) is difficult. Access through the cylinder bore is restricted for machining the valve seats, or for inserting angled valves. An even more serious restriction is de-coking and re-grinding valve seats, a regular task on older engines. Rather than removing the cylinder head from above, the mechanic must remove pistons, connecting rods and the crankshaft from beneath.<ref name=\"Conway, Bugatti, 1984, 64\" >{{Cite book\n  |series=Great Marques\n  |title=Bugatti\n  |chapter=Type 41 Royale\n  |last=Conway  |first=H.G.\n  |year=1984\n  |publisher=Octopus\n  |isbn=0-7064-2046-2\n  |ref=Conway, Bugatti, 1984\n  |pages=64\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Stein, 1973, 172\" >{{Cite book\n  |title=The World of the Automobile\n  |last=Stein  |first=Ralph\n  |year=1973\n  |publisher=Hamlyn\n  |isbn=0-600-39305-4\n  |ref=Stein, 1973\n  |pages=172\u2013173\n}}</ref>\n\nOne solution to this for [[side-valve engine]]s was to place a screwed plug directly above each valve, and to access the valves through this (illustrated). The tapered threads of the screwed plug provided a reliable seal. For low-powered engines this was a popular solution for some years. It was difficult to cool this plug, as the water jacket didn't extend into the plug. As performance increased, it also became important to have better combustion chamber designs with less \"dead space\". One solution was to place the [[spark plug]] in the centre of this plug, which at least made use of the space. This placed the spark plug further from the combustion chamber, leading to long flame paths and slower ignition.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], development of the internal combustion engine greatly progressed.

They represented a growing love for [[surf music]] and helped make the genre popular. Their debut album, ''[[Surfbeat]]'', was the biggest-selling surf album of all time and helped bring surf music from California to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-challengers-mn0000068584 |title=The Challengers |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe band was formed out of the pioneer surf band called [[The Bel-Airs]]. The Bel-Airs were still in high school at the time, but scored a hit with an instrumental song titled \"Mr. Moto\". Their potential was cited by many, but it was an argument about use of the then new Fender reverb unit that led to their breakup. The Bel-Airs were originally formed by two guitarists, Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson, both 16 years old at the time they recorded \"Mr. Moto\". In early 1963, Eddie Bertrand heard [[Dick Dale]] using the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] reverb unit and wanted to start incorporating heavy reverb into The Bel-Airs songs. He felt reverb was the sound that would come to define surf music. Even at 17, Johnson was something of an independent thinker and told Bertrand that The Bel-Airs had done quite well without [[Reverberation|reverb]] and he didn't see any reason at all to begin using it. The argument escalated until Bertrand finally left the band which then broke up for good shortly after. Johnson confirmed this story in the liner notes he contributed to The Bel-Airs reunion album released in 1986.\n\n==Early years==\n\nDuring their peak years, from late 1960 to Summer 1963, The Bel-Airs had two drummers who played gigs with the band alternately, original [[Mouseketeer]], Dick Dodd ([[Eddie & the Showmen]] and [[The Standells]]) and a local school friend named [[Richard Delvy]]. Delvy saw value in publishing, promoting and recording and began a career of managing and producing surf music. He then ultimately recorded numerous Southern California bands in the latter part of the 1960s. Since the 60's Delvy has produced many different musical artists and has made music management his lifelong passion.\n\nThe year before The Bel-Airs breakup, Richard Delvy left The Bel-Airs to form a new band called The Challengers. He brought in bassist [[Randy Nauert]] and keyboardist Jim Roberts who had played with The Bel-Airs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/191123945 |title=Amazing Interview |publisher=vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Delvy later brought in guitarist Art Fisher who had played with The Bel-Airs during the recording of The Challengers third album ''On The Move''. Delvy also recruited Glenn Grey (lead guitar), Don Landis (rhythm guitar) and Nick Hefner (saxophone). They played at many high schools and many local dances and clubs. They eventually earned enough money to rent a recording studio, \"World Pacific\" to start recording. In about three and a half hours, they had an album titled ''Surfbeat''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nauert.com/ransurf.htm |title=Surfbeat |publisher=nauert.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Saxophonist Nick Hefner played on only one track. \n\n''Surfbeat'' was released in January 1963 on [[Vault Records]] and quickly went up the charts. Just months earlier, [[The Beach Boys]] released a vocal single called \"Surfin' Safari\". Some months before The Challenger's ''Surfbeat'' release, surf music icon [[Dick Dale]]'s first album ''Surfers' Choice'' was released. ''Surfbeat'' contained songs that were early influences on surf rock, including songs first recorded by [[The Fireballs]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. In the early years [[Rick Griffin]] contributed cartoons of the band that appeared on their albums and a fan oriented \"Challengers Band Cartoon Book\". He later became well known for his work creating psychedelic poster art later in the 1960's.\n\nThe original group released a second album titled ''Lloyd Thaxton Goes Surfing With The Challengers'' with the benefit of being associated with the popular teen television show host [[Lloyd Thaxton]].\n\n==Years of success==\n\nThe Challengers moved on and continued to record albums. During the recording of their third album ''On The Move'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m6pdkPIgzVrl41BETzxTPbc_P4s2JQTuA |title=On The Move |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Hefner, Grey, Roberts and Landis all left the band. Richard Delvy and Randy Nauert remained. Art Fisher and Ed Fournier filled two guitar spots and Phil Pruden came in on saxophone. Delvy, Fisher and Fournier also contributed to song compositions for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-surf-music-bands-ever |title=The Best Surf Music Bands Ever |publisher=surfertoday.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, they released their hit album ''K-39''. The title track became a big hit and is one of their best known songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nC8pX10f1Disa9sDwhgbczcmIHPbLRLNo |title=K-39 |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> The group continued their successful career, recording several albums a year, shocking by today's \"one album every two years\" pattern. They also had their own TV show called \"Surf's Up!\" hosted by Stan Richards in 1965-66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwWV5iz4zwRLGh27wI9J8X-jKYzHra1MM |title=Surf's Up! TV Show |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> and appeared frequently on another dance show called \"[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]\" hosted by Sam Riddle in 1965-66. Saxophonist Phil Pruden left the group starting with the release of ''California Kicks'' in 1966 making The Challengers a four piece guitar driven group for the remainder of their run. During this time the group and surf music popularity overseas in Japan and other countries was exploding. This led to the creation of four more groups with members from The Challengers: The Surfriders, The Good Guys, The Clee-Shays and The De-Fenders all produced albums for these foreign markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/23/remember-the-surfer-stomp-surf-music-pioneer-recalls-o-c-s-role-in-shaping-the-culture/ |title=Remember The Surfer Stomp? |publisher=ocregister.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, The Challengers produced some tracks for the car and hot rod music scene that was gaining popularity in the US on the heels of the surf craze. Delvy could see a music trend coming and capture it at just the right time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_challengers |title=The Challengers |publisher=rateyourmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Although primarily an instrumental band, the group added vocals to the following albums as all band members could also sing:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6jZGMCG1_Y |title=The Challengers Secret Agent Man |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n''At The Teenage Fair''<br>\n''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''<br>\n''Challengers A Go Go''<br>\n''Light My Fire With Classical Gas''<br>\n   \nIn the mid to late 1960s, as music changed, so did The Challengers. They began recording more pop-oriented music, like an instrumental version of \"[[Kicks (song)|Kicks]]\" by [[Paul Revere & The Raiders]], \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]], \"[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E]]\" from the TV show and many others. By 1967, they had gone the way of most other surf bands and stopped performing live, but still continued recording and releasing albums. Their album ''[[Billy Strange]] & The Challengers'' brought the collaboration of another fine guitarist from the GNP Crescendo label to work with The Challengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/The-Challengers-Band-216378048397404/posts/ |title=The Challengers Posts |publisher=facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nA 1973 greatest hits release of the band was fittingly titled ''Where Were You In The Summer Of '62?''.\n\n==Later years & reunion==\n\nThe Challengers were seen in a few of 1980s surf band reunion concerts. Richard Delvy always kept in contact with his bandmates. His surf band history was extensive and he maintained his friendships with his former Bel-Airs guitarist Paul Johnson (PJ and the Galaxies) and Eddie Bertrand ([[Eddie & the Showmen]]). In 1992 a local surf company owned by Brad Jennings (The Early Sixties Company) signed a contract with Delvy to reproduce the Challengers band LP covers and Rick Griffin artwork for tee shirts and surf related products. That successful relationship lasted for over 20 years.\n\nIn 1994, after 24 years without new recordings, The Challengers reunited with some new members to release the album ''New Wave'' produced by band leader and founder Richard Delvy. Paul Johnson graciously joined the group to play guitar and composed. Art Fisher played guitar on \"Mr. Moto\", Ed Fournier contributed a new song he wrote and Richard Delvy plays drums on the new tracks. It was released on compact disc on the independent label Atmospheres. Richard Delvy died on February 6, 2010 ending his lifelong influence on music in the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-delvy-idUSTRE61B0U120100212 |title=Surf-rock pioneer Richard Delvy dies at 67 |publisher=www.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Bassist [[Randy Nauert]] died on February 7, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shackedmag.com/2019/04/randy-nauert-paddle-out.html |title=Randy Nauert Paddle Out |publisher=shackedmag.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/malibu-rebuilding-woolsey-fire-772461/ |title=Malibu residents are returning to rebuild after the Woolsey fire |publisher=rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n==Selected discography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | The Challengers\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!

They represented a growing love for [[surf music]] and helped make the genre popular. Their debut album, ''[[Surfbeat]]'', was the biggest-selling surf album of all time and helped bring surf music from California to the rest of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-challengers-mn0000068584 |title=The Challengers |publisher=allmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n\n==Overview==\n\nThe band was formed out of the pioneer surf band called [[The Bel-Airs]]. The Bel-Airs were still in high school at the time, but scored a hit with an instrumental song titled \"Mr. Moto\". Their potential was cited by many, but it was an argument about use of the then new Fender reverb unit that led to their breakup. The Bel-Airs were originally formed by two guitarists, Eddie Bertrand and Paul Johnson, both 16 years old at the time they recorded \"Mr. Moto\". In early 1963, Eddie Bertrand heard [[Dick Dale]] using the [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] reverb unit and wanted to start incorporating heavy reverb into The Bel-Airs songs. He felt reverb was the sound that would come to define surf music. Even at 17, Johnson was something of an independent thinker and told Bertrand that The Bel-Airs had done quite well without [[Reverberation|reverb]] and he didn't see any reason at all to begin using it. The argument escalated until Bertrand finally left the band which then broke up for good shortly after. Johnson confirmed this story in the liner notes he contributed to The Bel-Airs reunion album released in 1986.\n\n==Early years==\n\nDuring their peak years, from late 1960 to Summer 1963, The Bel-Airs had two drummers who played gigs with the band alternately, original [[Mouseketeer]], Dick Dodd ([[Eddie & the Showmen]] and [[The Standells]]) and a local school friend named [[Richard Delvy]]. Delvy saw value in publishing, promoting and recording and began a career of managing and producing surf music. He then ultimately recorded numerous Southern California bands in the latter part of the 1960s. Since the 60's Delvy has produced many different musical artists and has made music management his lifelong passion.\n\nThe year before The Bel-Airs breakup, Richard Delvy left The Bel-Airs to form a new band called The Challengers. He brought in bassist [[Randy Nauert]] and keyboardist Jim Roberts who had played with The Bel-Airs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/191123945 |title=Amazing Interview |publisher=vimeo.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Delvy later brought in guitarist Art Fisher who had played with The Bel-Airs during the recording of The Challengers third album ''On The Move''. Delvy also recruited Glenn Grey (lead guitar), Don Landis (rhythm guitar) and Nick Hefner (saxophone). They played at many high schools and many local dances and clubs. They eventually earned enough money to rent a recording studio, \"World Pacific\" to start recording. In about three and a half hours, they had an album titled ''Surfbeat''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nauert.com/ransurf.htm |title=Surfbeat |publisher=nauert.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Saxophonist Nick Hefner played on only one track. \n\n''Surfbeat'' was released in January 1963 on [[Vault Records]] and quickly went up the charts. Just months earlier, [[The Beach Boys]] released a vocal single called \"Surfin' Safari\". Some months before The Challenger's ''Surfbeat'' release, surf music icon [[Dick Dale]]'s first album ''Surfers' Choice'' was released. ''Surfbeat'' contained songs that were early influences on surf rock, including songs first recorded by [[The Fireballs]] and [[Duane Eddy]]. In the early years [[Rick Griffin]] contributed cartoons of the band that appeared on their albums and a fan oriented \"Challengers Band Cartoon Book\". He later became well known for his work creating psychedelic poster art later in the 1960's.\n\nThe original group released a second album titled ''Lloyd Thaxton Goes Surfing With The Challengers'' with the benefit of being associated with the popular teen television show host [[Lloyd Thaxton]].\n\n==Years of success==\n\nThe Challengers moved on and continued to record albums. During the recording of their third album ''On The Move'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_m6pdkPIgzVrl41BETzxTPbc_P4s2JQTuA |title=On The Move |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Hefner, Grey, Roberts and Landis all left the band. Richard Delvy and Randy Nauert remained. Art Fisher and Ed Fournier filled two guitar spots and Phil Pruden came in on saxophone. Delvy, Fisher and Fournier also contributed to song compositions for the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfertoday.com/surfing/the-best-surf-music-bands-ever |title=The Best Surf Music Bands Ever |publisher=surfertoday.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, they released their hit album ''K-39''. The title track became a big hit and is one of their best known songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nC8pX10f1Disa9sDwhgbczcmIHPbLRLNo |title=K-39 |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> The group continued their successful career, recording several albums a year, shocking by today's \"one album every two years\" pattern. They also had their own TV show called \"Surf's Up!\" hosted by Stan Richards in 1965-66<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nwWV5iz4zwRLGh27wI9J8X-jKYzHra1MM |title=Surf's Up! TV Show |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> and appeared frequently on another dance show called \"[[Hollywood A Go-Go]]\" hosted by Sam Riddle in 1965-66. Saxophonist Phil Pruden left the group starting with the release of ''California Kicks'' in 1966 making The Challengers a four piece guitar driven group for the remainder of their run. During this time the group and surf music popularity overseas in Japan and other countries was exploding. This led to the creation of four more groups with members from The Challengers: The Surfriders, The Good Guys, The Clee-Shays and The De-Fenders all produced albums for these foreign markets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ocregister.com/2017/08/23/remember-the-surfer-stomp-surf-music-pioneer-recalls-o-c-s-role-in-shaping-the-culture/ |title=Remember The Surfer Stomp? |publisher=ocregister.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, The Challengers produced some tracks for the car and hot rod music scene that was gaining popularity in the US on the heels of the surf craze. Delvy could see a music trend coming and capture it at just the right time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/the_challengers |title=The Challengers |publisher=rateyourmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Although primarily an instrumental band, the group added vocals to the following albums as all band members could also sing:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6jZGMCG1_Y |title=The Challengers Secret Agent Man |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n''At The Teenage Fair''<br>\n''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.''<br>\n''Challengers A Go Go''<br>\n''Light My Fire With Classical Gas''<br>\n   \nIn the mid to late 1960s, as music changed, so did The Challengers. They began recording more pop-oriented music, like an instrumental version of \"[[Kicks (song)|Kicks]]\" by [[Paul Revere & The Raiders]], \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by [[The Doors]], \"[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E]]\" from the TV show and many others. By 1967, they had gone the way of most other surf bands and stopped performing live, but still continued recording and releasing albums. Their album ''[[Billy Strange]] & The Challengers'' brought the collaboration of another fine guitarist from the GNP Crescendo label to work with The Challengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pg/The-Challengers-Band-216378048397404/posts/ |title=The Challengers Posts |publisher=facebook.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\nA 1973 greatest hits release of the band was fittingly titled ''Where Were You In The Summer Of '62?''.\n\n==Later years & reunion==\n\nThe Challengers were seen in a few of 1980s surf band reunion concerts. Richard Delvy always kept in contact with his bandmates. His surf band history was extensive and he maintained his friendships with his former Bel-Airs guitarist Paul Johnson (PJ and the Galaxies) and Eddie Bertrand ([[Eddie & the Showmen]]). In 1992 a local surf company owned by Brad Jennings (The Early Sixties Company) signed a contract with Delvy to reproduce the Challengers band LP covers and Rick Griffin artwork for tee shirts and surf related products. That successful relationship lasted for over 20 years.\n\nIn 1994, after 24 years of no new recordings, The Challengers reunited with some new members to release the album ''New Wave'' produced by band leader and founder Richard Delvy. Paul Johnson graciously joined the group to play guitar and composed. Art Fisher played guitar on \"Mr. Moto\", Ed Fournier contributed a new song he wrote and Richard Delvy plays drums on the new tracks. It was released on compact disc on the independent label Atmospheres. Richard Delvy died on February 6, 2010 ending his lifelong influence on music in the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-delvy-idUSTRE61B0U120100212 |title=Surf-rock pioneer Richard Delvy dies at 67 |publisher=www.reuters.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref> Bassist [[Randy Nauert]] died on February 7, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shackedmag.com/2019/04/randy-nauert-paddle-out.html |title=Randy Nauert Paddle Out |publisher=shackedmag.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/malibu-rebuilding-woolsey-fire-772461/ |title=Malibu residents are returning to rebuild after the Woolsey fire |publisher=rollingstone.com |date= |accessdate=2019-05-10}}</ref>\n\n==Selected discography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background: LightSteelBlue;\" | The Challengers\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" align=\"center\"\n!
