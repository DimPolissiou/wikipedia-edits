The engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] for possession of the strategically important Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (''Lissa'' in Italian), from which the British squadron had been disrupting French shipping in the Adriatic. The French needed to control the Adriatic to supply a growing army in the [[Illyrian Provinces]], and consequently dispatched an invasion force in March 1811 consisting of six frigates, numerous smaller craft and a battalion of Italian soldiers.\n\nThe French invasion force under [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] was met by Captain [[William Hoste]] and his four ships based on the island. In the subsequent battle, Hoste sank the French flagship, captured two others, and scattered the remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron. The battle has been hailed as an important British victory, due to both the disparity between the forces and the signal raised by Hoste, a former subordinate of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]. Hoste had raised the message \"Remember Nelson\" as the French bore down, and had then manoeuvred to drive Dubourdieu's flagship ashore and scatter his squadron in what has been described as \"one of the most brilliant naval achievements of the war\".<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]], the name for a succession of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and his European opponents, were nine years old when the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] ended in 1809. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole [[Adriatic Sea]] since the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807.<ref name=\"DC441\"/> In the Treaty of Tilsit, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had granted France control over the [[Septinsular Republic]] and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> At Sch\u00f6nbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan [[France]] and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule.<ref name=\"JH111\"/> Thus, the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would allow him to transport troops and supplies to the [[Balkans]]. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in conjunction with the Russians;<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.<ref name=\"DC441\">Chandler p. 441</ref>\n\nTo disrupt the preparations of this army, the British [[Royal Navy]], which had controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in 1807 and used it as a base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region.<ref name=\"RG154\">Gardiner, p. 154</ref> To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly [[Venice]], and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]'s Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under [[William Hoste]] to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref>\n[[File:001 Dubourdieu.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]]]\n[[File:William-hoste-1-sized.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain William Hoste]]\n\nIn October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian soldiers on Lissa while Hoste searched in vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic.<ref name=\"RW253\">Woodman, p. 253</ref> The island had been left in the command of two [[midshipmen]], James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew the entire population of the island into the central mountains along with their supplies.<ref name = \"JH119\"/> The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]].<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p. 256</ref> The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned.<ref name=\"RG172\">Gardiner, p. 172</ref> The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the [[third-rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Montagu (1779)|HMS ''Montagu'']].<ref name=\"WLC472\">Clowes, p. 472</ref>\n\nEarly in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks along the Italian coast prompted Dubourdieu to mount a second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of ''Montagu'', Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga.<ref>Sources differ on the spelling of Gifflenga's first name, using Alexander and Alexandre interchangeably.</ref> The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot.<ref name=\"WJ360\">James, p. 360</ref> Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.<ref name=\"JH113\"/>\n\n==Battle==\nDubourdieu (as [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]) led a squadron consisting of six [[frigate]]s (four of 40 guns and two of 32 guns), a 16-gun [[brig]], two [[schooner]]s, one [[xebec]], and two [[gunboat]]s. Three of his ships were from the [[French Navy]], and the others from the Navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of ''Montagu'', Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun [[post ship]]. The island of Lissa itself was defended by a small number of local troops under the command of two [[midshipmen]].\n\nDubourdieu's squadron was spotted approaching the island of Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in [[HMS Active (1799)|HMS ''Active'']], which had led the British squadron from [[Vis (town)|Port St George]] on a cruise off Ancona.<ref name=\"RLA358\">Adkins, p. 358</ref> Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|''Favorite'']] at the head of the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of ''Active'' at the head of the British line and cross it further east with [[French frigate Dana\u00e9 (1807)|''Dana\u00e9'']], which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.<ref name=\"RG173\">Gardiner, p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Lissa 1811 Map.png|thumb|300px|The opening stages of the battle]]\n\nOver the next three hours the squadrons continued to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three [[Knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"WJ352\"/> A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Nelson's signal]] before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and raised his own: \"Remember Nelson\", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron.<ref name=\"JH113\">Henderson, p. 113</ref> As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised that he would be unable to successfully cross ''Active's'' bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship [[HMS Amphion (1799)|HMS ''Amphion'']]. Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully.<ref name=\"JH113\"/> The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, ''Favorite'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into ''Favorite'''s bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"WJ352\"/>\n\nHoste was aware of Dubourdieu's intentions and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large {{convert|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzer]] on ''Amphion's'' deck [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|triple-shotted]] until the cannon contained over 750&nbsp;[[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]]<ref name=\"RLA360\">Adkins, p. 360</ref> Once ''Favorite'' was within a few yards of ''Amphion'''s stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of ''Favorite'' clear of the French and Italian boarding party.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of ''Favorite''.<ref name=\"JH115\">Henderson, p. 115</ref> As ''Favorite'' and ''Amphion'' closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by ''Dana\u00e9''. Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on [[HMS Cerberus (1794)|HMS ''Cerberus'']], the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides at one another.<ref name=\"WJ352\">James p. 352</ref>\n\n===Hoste's manoeuvre===\nFollowing the death of Dubourdieu, Captain P\u00e9ridier on [[French frigate Flore (1806)|''Flore'']] ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The battered ''Favorite'' led with an attempt to round ''Amphion'' and [[Raking fire|rake]] her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention.<ref name=\"WJ353\">James p. 353</ref> The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers to bear on the British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to [[Jibe|wear]], turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised.<ref name=\"JH115\"/> ''Favorite'', which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.<ref name=\"BI194\">Ireland p. 194</ref>\n\nThrown into further confusion by the loss of ''Favorite'', the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships ''Flore'' and ''Bellona'' succeeded in only reaching ''Amphion'', which was now at the rear of the British line.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> ''Amphion'' found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by ''Dana\u00e9'', was able to strike at [[HMS Volage (1807)|HMS ''Volage'']], now the leading British ship after overtaking ''Cerberus'' during the turn.<ref name=\"JH116\"/> ''Volage'' was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, short range guns that caused such damage to ''Dana\u00e9'' that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured ''Volage's'' short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James p. 354</ref>\n\n===Chase===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa.jpg|300px|thumb|''Battle of Lissa, 13 March 1811''<br />Engraved by [[Henri Merke]] after a painting by [[George Webster (painter)|George Webster]], 1812]]\nBehind ''Volage'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', the Venetian ''Corona'' had engaged ''Cerberus'' in a close range duel, during which ''Cerberus'' took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of ''Active'' caused the ''Dana\u00e9'', ''Corona'' and ''Carolina'' to sheer off and retreat to the east.<ref name=\"WJ355\">James p. 355</ref> To the rear, ''Amphion'' succeeded in closing with and raking ''Flore'', and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the [[French tricolour|French colours]] overboard in surrender. Captain P\u00e9ridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in ''Flore'''s later movements. ''Amphion'' then attacked ''Bellona'' and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender.<ref name=\"RW255\">Woodman p. 255</ref> During this combat, the small ship ''Principessa Augusta'' fired on ''Amphion'' from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> Hoste sent a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to take possession of ''Bellona'' but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize ''Flore''. Realising ''Amphion's'' difficulty, the officers of ''Flore'', who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between ''Amphion'' and ''Bellona'', immediately set sail for the French harbour on [[Hvar|Lesina]] (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.<ref name=\"JH116\">Henderson, p. 116</ref><ref name=\"RG174\"/>\n\n''Active'', the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the ''Corona'' in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon.<ref name=\"JH117\">Henderson, p. 117</ref> The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, ''Active'' forcing ''Corona'''s surrender 45&nbsp;minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship.<ref name=\"RLA361\">Adkins, p. 361</ref> ''Active'' too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end.<ref name=\"JH119\"/> The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' had used the conflict between ''Active'' and ''Corona'' to cover their escape while ''Flore'' had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once ''Flore'' was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.<ref name=\"JH119\"/>\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:BattleofLissa1811(2).jpg|300px|thumb|The latter stages of the battle. The burning '' [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|Favorite]]'' can be seen in the background.<br />Engraving by Henri Merke after a painting by George Webster, 1812]]\nAlthough ''Favorite'' was wrecked, over 200 of her crew and soldier-passengers had reached the land and, having set fire to their ship, prepared to march on Port St. George under the leadership of Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated.<ref name=\"RG174\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\">James, p. 361</ref> At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat ''Lodola'' sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, ''Vincitore''. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.<ref name=\"RW256\">Woodman p. 256</ref>\n\nIn the seas off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous efforts to protect their captures; ''Corona'' was heavily on fire in consequence of her engagement with ''Active'' and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Problems were also experienced aboard ''Bellona'', where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p. 358</ref>\n\nHoste also remained at sea, cruising in the battered ''Amphion'' beyond the range of the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of ''Flore's'' officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of ''Flore'' had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. ''Flore'' had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act.<ref name=\"JH119\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties of the action were heavy on both sides. The British ships suffered 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard ''Corona''. Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron was in need of urgent repair before resuming the campaign.<ref name=\"WJ357\"/> In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise losses are not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard ''Favorite'' either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. ''Bellona'' had suffered at least 70 casualties and ''Corona's'' losses were also severe.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p. 357</ref> Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian losses are estimated at no less than 700.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and P\u00e9ridier seriously wounded.\n\nThe immediate aftermath saw renewed efforts by Hoste to induce the French to hand over ''Flore'', efforts that were rebuffed by the captain of the ''Dana\u00e9'', who had assumed command of the French squadron.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The surviving French and Venetian ships were initially laid up in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (Dubrovnik) awaiting supplies to continue the campaign, but a separate British squadron discovered and sank the supply ship at [[Pore\u010d|Parenzo]] (Pore\u010d), necessitating a full French withdrawal from the area.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> In Britain, Hoste's action was widely praised; the squadron's first lieutenants were all promoted to commander and the captains all presented with a commemorative medal.<ref name=\"BI194\"/><ref name=\"JH120\">Henderson, p. 120</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was also recognized in the issue of the clasp ''Lissa'' to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref> On their arrival in Britain, ''Corona'' and ''Bellone'' were repaired and later purchased for service in the Royal Navy, the newly built ''Corona'' being named {{HMS|Daedalus|1811|6}} and ''Bellone'' becoming the [[troopship]] {{HMS|Dover|1811|6}}.<ref name=\"JH119\">Henderson, p. 119</ref> ''Daedalus'' was commissioned in 1812 under Captain [[Murray Maxwell]], but served less than a year; wrecked off [[Ceylon]] in July 1813.<ref name=\"TG357\">Grocott, p. 357</ref>\n\nBritish numerical superiority in the region was assured; when French reinforcements for the Adriatic departed [[Toulon]] on 25 March they were hunted down and driven back to France by Captain [[Robert Otway]] in {{HMS|Ajax|1809|6}} before they had even passed [[Corsica]].<ref name=\"WJ362\">James p. 362</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1811 however, British and French frigate squadrons continued to spar across the Adriatic, the most significant engagement being the [[action of 29 November 1811]], in which a second French squadron was destroyed.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> The action had significant long-term effects; the destruction of one of the best-trained and best-led squadrons in the French Navy and the death of the aggressive Dubourdieu ended the French ability to strike into the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"RLA363\">Adkins, p. 363</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Hoste's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n!

{{lang-fr|Bataille de Lissa}}; {{lang-it|Battaglia di Lissa}}; {{lang-hr|Vi\u0161ka bitka}}) was a naval action fought between a British [[frigate]] squadron and a much larger squadron of French and Italian frigates and smaller vessels on Wednesday 13 March 1811 during the [[Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814|Adriatic campaign]] of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] for possession of the strategically important Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (''Lissa'' in Italian), from which the British squadron had been disrupting French shipping in the Adriatic. The French needed to control the Adriatic to supply a growing army in the [[Illyrian Provinces]], and consequently dispatched an invasion force in March 1811 consisting of six frigates, numerous smaller craft and a battalion of Italian soldiers.\n\nThe French invasion force under [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] was met by Captain [[William Hoste]] and his four ships based on the island. In the subsequent battle, Hoste sank the French flagship, captured two others, and scattered the remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron. The battle has been hailed as an important British victory, due to both the disparity between the forces and the signal raised by Hoste, a former subordinate of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]. Hoste had raised the message \"Remember Nelson\" as the French bore down, and had then manoeuvred to drive Dubourdieu's flagship ashore and scatter his squadron in what has been described as \"one of the most brilliant naval achievements of the war\".<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]], the name for a succession of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and his European opponents, were nine years old when the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] ended in 1809. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole [[Adriatic Sea]] since the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807.<ref name=\"DC441\"/> In the Treaty of Tilsit, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had granted France control over the [[Septinsular Republic]] and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> At Sch\u00f6nbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan [[France]] and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule.<ref name=\"JH111\"/> Thus, the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would allow him to transport troops and supplies to the [[Balkans]]. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in conjunction with the Russians;<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.<ref name=\"DC441\">Chandler p. 441</ref>\n\nTo disrupt the preparations of this army, the British [[Royal Navy]], which had controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in 1807 and used it as a base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region.<ref name=\"RG154\">Gardiner, p. 154</ref> To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly [[Venice]], and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]'s Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under [[William Hoste]] to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref>\n[[File:001 Dubourdieu.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]]]\n[[File:William-hoste-1-sized.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain William Hoste]]\n\nIn October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian soldiers on Lissa while Hoste searched in vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic.<ref name=\"RW253\">Woodman, p. 253</ref> The island had been left in the command of two [[midshipmen]], James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew the entire population of the island into the central mountains along with their supplies.<ref name = \"JH119\"/> The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]].<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p. 256</ref> The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned.<ref name=\"RG172\">Gardiner, p. 172</ref> The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the [[third-rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Montagu (1779)|HMS ''Montagu'']].<ref name=\"WLC472\">Clowes, p. 472</ref>\n\nEarly in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks along the Italian coast prompted Dubourdieu to mount a second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of ''Montagu'', Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga.<ref>Sources differ on the spelling of Gifflenga's first name, using Alexander and Alexandre interchangeably.</ref> The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot.<ref name=\"WJ360\">James, p. 360</ref> Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.<ref name=\"JH113\"/>\n\n==Battle==\nDubourdieu (as [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]) led a squadron consisting of six [[frigate]]s (four of 40 guns and two of 32 guns), a 16-gun [[brig]], two [[schooner]]s, one [[xebec]], and two [[gunboat]]s. Three of his ships were from the [[French Navy]], and the others from the Navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of ''Montagu'', Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun [[post ship]]. The island of Lissa itself was defended by a small number of local troops under the command of two [[midshipmen]].\n\nDubourdieu's squadron was spotted approaching the island of Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in [[HMS Active (1799)|HMS ''Active'']], which had led the British squadron from [[Vis (town)|Port St George]] on a cruise off Ancona.<ref name=\"RLA358\">Adkins, p. 358</ref> Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|''Favorite'']] at the head of the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of ''Active'' at the head of the British line and cross it further east with [[French frigate Dana\u00e9 (1807)|''Dana\u00e9'']], which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.<ref name=\"RG173\">Gardiner, p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Lissa 1811 Map.png|thumb|300px|The opening stages of the battle]]\n\nOver the next three hours the squadrons continued to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three [[Knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"WJ352\"/> A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Nelson's signal]] before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and raised his own: \"Remember Nelson\", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron.<ref name=\"JH113\">Henderson, p. 113</ref> As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised that he would be unable to successfully cross ''Active's'' bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship [[HMS Amphion (1799)|HMS ''Amphion'']]. Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully.<ref name=\"JH113\"/> The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, ''Favorite'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into ''Favorite'''s bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"WJ352\"/>\n\nHoste was aware of Dubourdieu's intentions and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large {{convert|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzer]] on ''Amphion's'' deck [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|triple-shotted]] until the cannon contained over 750&nbsp;[[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]]<ref name=\"RLA360\">Adkins, p. 360</ref> Once ''Favorite'' was within a few yards of ''Amphion'''s stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of ''Favorite'' clear of the French and Italian boarding party.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of ''Favorite''.<ref name=\"JH115\">Henderson, p. 115</ref> As ''Favorite'' and ''Amphion'' closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by ''Dana\u00e9''. Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on [[HMS Cerberus (1794)|HMS ''Cerberus'']], the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides at one another.<ref name=\"WJ352\">James p. 352</ref>\n\n===Hoste's manoeuvre===\nFollowing the death of Dubourdieu, Captain P\u00e9ridier on [[French frigate Flore (1806)|''Flore'']] ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The battered ''Favorite'' led with an attempt to round ''Amphion'' and [[Raking fire|rake]] her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention.<ref name=\"WJ353\">James p. 353</ref> The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers to bear on the British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to [[Jibe|wear]], turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised.<ref name=\"JH115\"/> ''Favorite'', which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.<ref name=\"BI194\">Ireland p. 194</ref>\n\nThrown into further confusion by the loss of ''Favorite'', the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships ''Flore'' and ''Bellona'' succeeded in only reaching ''Amphion'', which was now at the rear of the British line.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> ''Amphion'' found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by ''Dana\u00e9'', was able to strike at [[HMS Volage (1807)|HMS ''Volage'']], now the leading British ship after overtaking ''Cerberus'' during the turn.<ref name=\"JH116\"/> ''Volage'' was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, short range guns that caused such damage to ''Dana\u00e9'' that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured ''Volage's'' short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James p. 354</ref>\n\n===Chase===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa.jpg|300px|thumb|''Battle of Lissa, 13 March 1811''<br />Engraved by [[Henri Merke]] after a painting by [[George Webster (painter)|George Webster]], 1812]]\nBehind ''Volage'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', the Venetian ''Corona'' had engaged ''Cerberus'' in a close range duel, during which ''Cerberus'' took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of ''Active'' caused the ''Dana\u00e9'', ''Corona'' and ''Carolina'' to sheer off and retreat to the east.<ref name=\"WJ355\">James p. 355</ref> To the rear, ''Amphion'' succeeded in closing with and raking ''Flore'', and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the [[French tricolour|French colours]] overboard in surrender. Captain P\u00e9ridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in ''Flore'''s later movements. ''Amphion'' then attacked ''Bellona'' and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender.<ref name=\"RW255\">Woodman p. 255</ref> During this combat, the small ship ''Principessa Augusta'' fired on ''Amphion'' from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> Hoste sent a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to take possession of ''Bellona'' but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize ''Flore''. Realising ''Amphion's'' difficulty, the officers of ''Flore'', who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between ''Amphion'' and ''Bellona'', immediately set sail for the French harbour on [[Hvar|Lesina]] (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.<ref name=\"JH116\">Henderson, p. 116</ref><ref name=\"RG174\"/>\n\n''Active'', the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the ''Corona'' in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon.<ref name=\"JH117\">Henderson, p. 117</ref> The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, ''Active'' forcing ''Corona'''s surrender 45&nbsp;minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship.<ref name=\"RLA361\">Adkins, p. 361</ref> ''Active'' too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end.<ref name=\"JH119\"/> The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' had used the conflict between ''Active'' and ''Corona'' to cover their escape while ''Flore'' had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once ''Flore'' was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.<ref name=\"JH119\"/>\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:BattleofLissa1811(2).jpg|300px|thumb|The latter stages of the battle. The burning '' [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|Favorite]]'' can be seen in the background.<br />Engraving by Henri Merke after a painting by George Webster, 1812]]\nAlthough ''Favorite'' was wrecked, over 200 of her crew and soldier-passengers had reached the land and, having set fire to their ship, prepared to march on Port St. George under the leadership of Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated.<ref name=\"RG174\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\">James, p. 361</ref> At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat ''Lodola'' sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, ''Vincitore''. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.<ref name=\"RW256\">Woodman p. 256</ref>\n\nIn the seas off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous efforts to protect their captures; ''Corona'' was heavily on fire in consequence of her engagement with ''Active'' and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Problems were also experienced aboard ''Bellona'', where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p. 358</ref>\n\nHoste also remained at sea, cruising in the battered ''Amphion'' beyond the range of the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of ''Flore's'' officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of ''Flore'' had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. ''Flore'' had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act.<ref name=\"JH119\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties of the action were heavy on both sides. The British ships suffered 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard ''Corona''. Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron was in need of urgent repair before resuming the campaign.<ref name=\"WJ357\"/> In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise losses are not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard ''Favorite'' either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. ''Bellona'' had suffered at least 70 casualties and ''Corona's'' losses were also severe.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p. 357</ref> Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian losses are estimated at no less than 700.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and P\u00e9ridier seriously wounded.\n\nThe immediate aftermath saw renewed efforts by Hoste to induce the French to hand over ''Flore'', efforts that were rebuffed by the captain of the ''Dana\u00e9'', who had assumed command of the French squadron.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The surviving French and Venetian ships were initially laid up in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (Dubrovnik) awaiting supplies to continue the campaign, but a separate British squadron discovered and sank the supply ship at [[Pore\u010d|Parenzo]] (Pore\u010d), necessitating a full French withdrawal from the area.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> In Britain, Hoste's action was widely praised; the squadron's first lieutenants were all promoted to commander and the captains all presented with a commemorative medal.<ref name=\"BI194\"/><ref name=\"JH120\">Henderson, p. 120</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was also recognized in the issue of the clasp ''Lissa'' to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref> On their arrival in Britain, ''Corona'' and ''Bellone'' were repaired and later purchased for service in the Royal Navy, the newly built ''Corona'' being named {{HMS|Daedalus|1811|6}} and ''Bellone'' becoming the [[troopship]] {{HMS|Dover|1811|6}}.<ref name=\"JH119\">Henderson, p. 119</ref> ''Daedalus'' was commissioned in 1812 under Captain [[Murray Maxwell]], but served less than a year; wrecked off [[Ceylon]] in July 1813.<ref name=\"TG357\">Grocott, p. 357</ref>\n\nBritish numerical superiority in the region was assured; when French reinforcements for the Adriatic departed [[Toulon]] on 25 March they were hunted down and driven back to France by Captain [[Robert Otway]] in {{HMS|Ajax|1809|6}} before they had even passed [[Corsica]].<ref name=\"WJ362\">James p. 362</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1811 however, British and French frigate squadrons continued to spar across the Adriatic, the most significant engagement being the [[action of 29 November 1811]], in which a second French squadron was destroyed.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> The action had significant long-term effects; the destruction of one of the best-trained and best-led squadrons in the French Navy and the death of the aggressive Dubourdieu ended the French ability to strike into the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"RLA363\">Adkins, p. 363</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Hoste's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n!

Red-winged blackbirds are hatched blind and naked, but are ready to leave the nest 11 to 14 days after hatching.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nRed-winged blackbirds are [[polygyny in animals|polygynous]], with territorial males defending up to 10 females. However, females frequently copulate with males other than their social mate and often lay clutches of mixed [[Parent|paternity]]. Pairs raise two or three clutches per season, in a new [[bird nest|nest]] for each clutch.<ref name=USGS/>\n\nPredation of eggs and nestlings is quite common. Nest predators include [[snake]]s, [[mink]], [[raccoon]]s, and other [[bird]]s, even as small as [[marsh wren]]s. The red-winged blackbird is occasionally a victim of brood parasites, particularly [[brown-headed cowbird]]s.<ref name=\"Terres\"/> Since nest predation is common, several adaptations have evolved in this species. Group nesting is one such trait which reduces the risk of individual predation by increasing the number of alert parents. Nesting over water reduces the likelihood of predation, as do alarm calls. Nests, in particular, offer a strategic advantage over predators in that they are often well concealed in thick, waterside reeds and positioned at a height of one to two meters.<ref>Cristol, Daniel. 1995. Early arrival, initiation of nesting, and social status: an experimental study of breeding female red-winged blackbirds. Behavioral Ecology. 6(1): 87\u201393.</ref> Males often act as sentinels, employing a variety of calls to denote the kind and severity of danger. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]], especially by males, is also used to scare off unwanted predators, although mobbing often targets large animals and man-made devices by mistake. The brownish coloration of the female may also serve as an anti-predator trait in that it may provide camouflage for her and her nest while she is incubating.<ref name=Rosenthal/> Adults are vulnerable to a multitude of raptorial birds, at least 16 species have hunted them in North America, including all ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks and [[falcon]]s as well as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' hawk and any [[owl]]s that hunt in open or wetland habitats.<ref>Orians, G.

Females typically migrate longer distances than males. These female populations located near the Great Lakes migrate nearly 230&nbsp;km farther. Yearly-traveled females also migrate further than adult males, while also moving roughly the same distance as other adult females.  Red-winged blackbirds migrate primarily during daytime. In general, males\u2019 migration flocks arrive prior to females in the spring and after females in the fall.<ref name=\"Yasukawa1995\"/>\n\n===Territorial===\n[[File:Red-winged-blackbird-mvnwr-alarm.ogv|thumb|220px|right|Agitated male]]\n[[File:Red-winged blackbird versus osprey 4.jpg|thumb|Male red-winged blackbird hectoring an osprey]]\n[[File:Agelaius phoeniceus male, Yosemite National Park - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=Perched display|The \"perched display\", with wings held away from the body, is an [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] behavior of the red-winged blackbird.]]\nMale red-winged blackbirds exhibit important territorial behaviors, most of which provides them with the necessary fidelity for many years to come. A few important factors for male red-winged blackbirds\u2019 adherence to territories include food, hiding spaces from predators, types of neighbors, and reactions towards predators. Additionally, a study was done on site fidelity and movement patterns by Les D. Beletsky and Gordon H. Orians in 1987 which explained much of the males\u2019 territorial behaviors once migrated and settled onto a territory of their own. Sufficient evidence had shown that males are committed to staying in their territory over a long period of time and are not more likely to change territories at a younger age due to limited experience of knowledge for success. Studies also showed that most of the males that were first-time movers to a new territory were between two and three years old. The majority of males that moved were young and inexperienced. Later on they had moved towards more available territories.  If males had chosen to leave their territory for reproductive success, as an example, they would do so within a short distance. Males who moved shorter distances were more successful in reproducing than those who moved longer distances. Further studies showed that when males moved further away from their territories there was a decrease in probability of successfully fledging<ref>Beletsky, Les and Orians, Gordon. 1987.

Nest predators include [[snake]]s, [[mink]], [[raccoon]]s, and other [[bird]]s, even as small as [[marsh wren]]s. The red-winged blackbird is occasionally a victim of brood parasites, particularly [[brown-headed cowbird]]s.<ref name=\"Terres\"/> Since nest predation is common, several adaptations have evolved in this species. Group nesting is one such trait which reduces the risk of individual predation by increasing the number of alert parents. Nesting over water reduces the likelihood of predation, as do alarm calls. Nests, in particular, offer a strategic advantage over predators in that they are often well concealed in thick, waterside reeds and positioned at a height of one to two meters.<ref>Cristol, Daniel. 1995. Early arrival, initiation of nesting, and social status: an experimental study of breeding female red-winged blackbirds. Behavioral Ecology. 6(1): 87\u201393.</ref> Males often act as sentinels, employing a variety of calls to denote the kind and severity of danger. [[Mobbing (animal behavior)|Mobbing]], especially by males, is also used to scare off unwanted predators, although mobbing often targets large animals and man-made devices by mistake. The brownish coloration of the female may also serve as an anti-predator trait in that it may provide camouflage for her and her nest while she is incubating.<ref name=Rosenthal/> Adults are vulnerable to a multitude of raptorial birds, at least 16 species have hunted them in North America, including all ''[[Accipiter]]'' hawks and [[falcon]]s as well as most species of ''[[Buteo]]'' hawk and any [[owl]]s that hunt in open or wetland habitats.<ref>Orians, G.

Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C.</ref>\n\n===Migration===\nRed-winged blackbirds that breed in the northern part of their range, i.e., Canada and border states in the United States, migrate south for the winter. However, populations near the Pacific and Gulf coasts of North America and those of Middle America are year-round resident.<ref name=\"Yasukawa1995\"/> Red-winged blackbirds live in both Northern U.S. and Canada, ranging from Yucatan Peninsula in the south to the southern part of Alaska.<ref name=\"Yasukawa1995\"/> These extensions account for the majority of the continent stretching from California's Pacific coast and Canada to the eastern seaboard. Much of the populations within Middle America are non-migratory<ref name=\"animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu\">Rosenthal, A. 2004. \"Agelaius phoeniceus\" (On-line), Animal Diversity Web. Accessed October 31, 2014 at http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Agelaius_phoeniceus/.</ref> During the fall, populations begin migrating towards Southern U.S. Movement of red-winged blackbirds can begin as early as August through October. Spring migration begins anywhere between mid-February to mid-May. Numerous birds from northern parts of the U.S., particularly the Great lakes, migrate nearly 1,200&nbsp;km between their breeding season and winter<ref name=\"Yasukawa1995\"/>  Winter territorial areas differ based on geographic location<ref name=\"animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu\"/> Other populations that migrate year-round include those located in Middle America or in the western U.S. and Gulf Coast. Females typically migrate longer distances than males. These female populations located near the Great Lakes migrate nearly 230&nbsp;km farther. Yearly-traveled females also migrate further than adult males, while also moving roughly the same distance as other adult females.  Red-winged blackbirds migrate primarily during daytime. In general, males\u2019 migration flocks arrive prior to females in the spring and after females in the fall.<ref name=\"Yasukawa1995\"/>\n\n===Territorial===\n[[File:Red-winged-blackbird-mvnwr-alarm.ogv|thumb|220px|right|Agitated male]]\n[[File:Red-winged blackbird versus osprey 4.jpg|thumb|Male red-winged blackbird hectoring an osprey]]\n[[File:Agelaius phoeniceus male, Yosemite National Park - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|220px|alt=Perched display|The \"perched display\", with wings held away from the body, is an [[Agonistic behaviour|agonistic]] behavior of the red-winged blackbird.]]\nMale red-winged blackbirds exhibit important territorial behaviors, most of which provides them with the necessary fidelity for many years to come. A few important factors for male red-winged blackbirds\u2019 adherence to territories included food, hiding spaces from predators, types of neighbors, and reactions towards predators. Additionally, a study was done on site fidelity and movement patterns by Les D. Beletsky and Gordon H. Orians in 1987 which explained much of the males\u2019 territorial behaviors once migrated and settled onto a territory of their own. Sufficient evidence had shown that males are committed to staying in their territory over a long period of time and are not more likely to change territories at a younger age due to limited experience of knowledge for success. Studies also showed that most of the males that were first-time movers to a new territory were between two and three years old. The majority of males that moved were young and inexperienced. Later on they had moved towards more available territories.  If males had chosen to leave their territory for reproductive success, as an example, they would do so within a short distance. Males who moved shorter distances were more successful in reproducing than those who moved longer distances. Further studies showed that when males moved further away from their territories there was a decrease in probability of successfully fledging<ref>Beletsky, Les and Orians, Gordon. 1987.

It is sometimes considered an agricultural pest.<ref name = jaramillo/> Farmers have been known to use pesticides\u2014such as [[parathion]]\u2014in illegal attempts to control their populations.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Condor |volume=86 |pages=333\u2013336 | title=Intentional poisoning of birds with parathion |last=Stone |first=W.B. |author2=Overmann S.R. |author3=Okoniewski, J.C. |year=1984|url=http://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v086n03/p0333-p0336.pdf|doi=10.2307/1367004 |issue=3}}</ref> In the United States, such efforts are illegal because no pesticide can be used on non-target organisms, or for any use not explicitly listed on the pesticide's label.

In the [[Anishinaabe language]]s, an indigenous language group spoken throughout much of the bird's northeastern range, this bird's names are diverse. In the [[Oji-Cree language]], the northernmost of the Anishinaabe languages, it is called ''jachakanoob'', while the [[Ojibwa language]] spoken in [[Northwestern Ontario]] and into [[Manitoba]] ranging immediately south of the Oji-Cree's range, the bird is called ''jachakanoo'' (with the cognates ''cahcahkaniw'' (Swampy Cree), ''cahcahkaluw'' (coastal Southern East Cree), ''cahcahkayuw'' (inland Southern East Cree), ''cahcahkayow'' (Plains Cree)); the northern Algonquian languages classify the red-winged blackbird as a type of a [[junco]] or [[grackle]], deriving the bird's name from their word for \"spotted\" or \"marked\". In the vast majority of the other Ojibwa language dialects, the bird is called ''memiskondinimaanganeshiinh'', literally meaning \"a bird with a very red damn-little shoulder-blade\". However, in the [[Odawa language]], an Anishinaabe language in [[southwestern Ontario]] and in [[Michigan]], the bird is instead called either ''memeskoniinisi'' (\"bird with a red [patch on its wing]\") or ''memiskonigwiigaans'' (\"[bird with a] wing of small and very red [patch]\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.freelang.net/online/ojibwe.php |title=Freelang Ojibwe Dictionary |accessdate=2008-07-09 |author=Weshki-ayaad, Lippert |author2=Gambill |last-author-amp=yes}}</ref> In N'syilxcn (Colville-Okanagan, [[Interior Salish language]]) the bird is known as \u019b\u0313k\u019b\u0313a\u0295k\u0259k.<ref>Peterson, Sarah, Christopher Parkin and LaRae Wiley.

From the third year onward the caricatures were not included, after the start of the [[First World War]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Hemat Association ==\nThe Hemat Association was established in 1944 by the managers of the girls\u2019 schools. Maryam Amid, a member of this association, was instrumental in introducing and expanding its activities. One of the important goals of the association, which was headed by Mrs Nuraldji, was to ban foreign products and prohibit imports of these products. For example, at that time the boycott of foreign textiles was on the agenda of this association, an all-girls' schools (including students and teachers) were allowed to use only Iranian fabrics and, if there was a violation and purchase of foreign textiles, the guilty person would be fired. As a result, nearly five thousand people joined the boycott within a month.\n\n== War with superstition ==\nThe struggle against [[superstition]] and fighting against old traditions, especially among women was one of the activities of Maryam. She used the ''Shokoufeh newspaper'' to expose oppression  and her reactionary ideas. Maryam, in condemning women's [[underdeveloped]] traditions in [[Iran]], reviewed and compared the situation of women in other parts of the world (especially  of [[women in Europe]]), and considered this as the most important and fundamental way to improve women's awareness in Iran.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Death ==\nMaryam died of a heart attack in September 1919 during a trip to her hometown [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Iranian women]]   \n* [[Women's rights movement in Iran]]\n* [[Women's rights in Iran]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af \u0642\u0648\u0645\u0633\u061b \u0641\u0635\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u067e\u0698\u0648\u0647\u0634\u06cc\u060c \u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u06cc\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0645\u0646\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f3\u06f7 \u0648 \u06f3\u06f8 \u0628\u0647\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u062a\u0627\u0628\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f6/Ghomis Culture, The quarterly research of cultural and artistic in Semnan Province, numbers 37\u201338, spring and summer 2007.\n* \u0631\u0648\u0632\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0633\u0631\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0647\u060c \u0634\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0647 \u06f2\u06f5\u06f7 (\u06f2 \u0634\u0647\u0631\u06cc\u0648\u0631 \u06f1\u06f3\u06f8\u06f5)-\tSarmayeh Newspaper, number 257, (24 August 2006). \n* [http://www.sharghnewspaper.ir/830514/media.htm#s94047 /Journalist women under the shadow of constitutionalism]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.barnameh-budjeh.com/npview.asp?ID=1118573 Maryam Amid, Girls' Literacy Light]{{Dead link|date=March 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Amid, Maryam}}\n[[Category:People from Semnan, Iran]]\n[[Category:1919 deaths]]\n[[Category:Iranian journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women journalists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women's rights activists]]\n[[Category:Iranian women writers]]\n", "name_user": "Editor with truth", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCareer", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryam_Amid"}

The conflict, which peaked between 1825 and 1831, and led to more than three years of martial law, cost the lives of almost 1,100 Aboriginals and settlers.\n\nThe island was permanently settled by Europeans in 1803 as a [[penal colony|penal settlement]] of the [[British Empire]] to prevent claims to the land by the [[First French Empire]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

This name is taken from the [[Bruny Island language]] word for the Tasmanian mainland, which was recorded by [[George Augustus Robinson]] as ''Loe.trou.witter''. Robinson also recorded the name ''Trow.wer.nar'' for Tasmania, likely from the [[Eastern Tasmanian languages|Eastern]] or [[Northeastern Tasmanian languages]]. However, he also recorded it as a name for [[Cape Barren Island]]. In the 20th century, some writers used it as an Aboriginal name for Tasmania, spelled \"Trowenna\" or \"Trowunna\". It is now believed that the name is more properly applied to Cape Barren Island,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tacinc.com.au/tasmanian-aboriginal-place-names/|title=Tasmanian Aboriginal place names|publisher=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> which has had an official [[dual naming|dual name]] of \"Truwana\" since 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tacinc.com.au/official-aboriginal-and-dual-names/|title=Aboriginal and Dual Names of places in lutruwita (Tasmania)|publisher=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nTasmania is named after [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[explorer]] [[Abel Tasman]], who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. Tasman named the island '''Anthony van Diemen's Land''' after his sponsor [[Anthony van Diemen]], the Governor of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The name was later shortened to '''Van Diemen's Land''' by the British. It was officially renamed '''Tasmania''' in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |title=Appendix 2: Select chronology of renaming |last1= Newman |first1=Terry |year=2005 |work=Becoming Tasmania \u2013 Companion Web Site |publisher=[[Parliament of Tasmania]] |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nTasmania was sometimes referred to as \"Dervon,\" as mentioned in the [[Jerilderie Letter]] written by the notorious Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is \"Tassie\". Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to \"Tas,\" mainly when used in business names and website addresses. TAS is also the [[Australian postal abbreviations|Australia Post abbreviation]] for the state.\n\nA number of [[Palawa kani]] names, based on historical records of aboriginal names, have been accepted by the Tasmanian government. A dozen of these (below) are 'dual-use' (bilingual) names, and another two are unbounded areas with only Palawa names.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tacinc.com.au/official-aboriginal-and-dual-names/|title=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre \u2013 Official Aboriginal and Dual Names of places|website=tacinc.com.au}}</ref>\n\n;Bilingual names\n* kanamaluka / [[Tamar River]]\n* kunanyi / [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]]\n* laraturunawn / [[Sundown Point, Tasmania|Sundown Point]]\n* nungu / [[West Point, Tasmania|West Point]]\n* pinmatik / [[Rocky Cape, Tasmania|Rocky Cape]]\n* takayna / [[The Tarkine]]\n* taypalaka / [[Green Point, Tasmania|Green Point]]\n* titima / [[Trefoil Island]]\n* truwana / [[Cape Barren Island]]\n* wukalina / [[Mount William National Park|Mount William]]\n* yingina / [[Great Lake (Tasmania)|Great Lake]]\n\n;Palawa names\n* larapuna: an unbounded area centered on the [[Bay of Fires]]\n* [[Narawntapu National Park]] (formerly Asbestos Range National Park)\n* putalina: an unbounded area centered on [[Oyster Cove]] (including the community of [[Oyster Cove, Tasmania|Oyster Cove]])\n\nThere are also a number of archaeological sites with Palawa names.

Much of the island is composed of [[Jurassic]] [[Diabase|dolerite]] intrusions (the upwelling of [[magma]]) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The [[Central Plateau (Tasmania)|central plateau]] and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites. [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] above [[Hobart]] is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.\n\nIn the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by [[sandstone]] and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, [[Precambrian]] [[quartzite]]s were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or [[Frenchmans Cap, Tasmania|Frenchmans Cap]].\n\nIn the northeast and east, continental [[granite]]s can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at [[Mount Read (Tasmania)|Mount Read]] near [[Rosebery, Tasmania|Rosebery]], or at [[Mount Lyell, Tasmania|Mount Lyell]] near [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]]. Also present in the south and northwest is [[limestone]] with caves.\n\nThe quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of [[glaciation]], and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. [[Cradle Mountain]], another dolerite peak, for example, was a [[nunatak]].

Van Diemen's Land had an enormous gender imbalance, with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822\u2014and 16 to one among the convict population.

Settlers responded vigorously, resulting in many mass-killings. In November 1826 Governor [[Sir George Arthur, 1st Baronet|George Arthur]] issued a government notice declaring that colonists were free to kill Aborigines when they attacked settlers or their property and in the following eight months more than 200 Aborigines were killed in the Settled Districts in reprisal for the deaths of 15 colonists.

Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile [[spodosols]] or [[psamments]], with some even less fertile \"lateritic podzolic soils\" in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive [[forestry in Tasmania]]\u2014which remains one of the state's major industries.\n\nOn the north coast, apart from some relatively fertile alluvial soils used for fruit-growing, there are also deep red, easily workable soils known as \"krasnozems\" (\"red land\"). These soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively, but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying, beef cattle and fodder crops.\n\nThe Midlands and the Lower Derwent present a different story from the rest of the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly [[dolerite]]) parent material, these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as \"prairie soils\" or \"brown earths\" and bear some resemblance to the [[chernozem]]s of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available [[phosphorus]] and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.\n\nTasmania became known as the \"Apple Isle\" because for many years it was one of the world's major apple producers. Apples are still grown in large numbers, particularly in southern Tasmania, and have the distinction of being the first approved by the Japanese government for import, due to their verifiable pest-free status.<ref name=\"Why is Tasmania called the 'Apple Isle'\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|title=Centre of the apple universe|accessdate=20 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120115242/https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|archive-date=20 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ecology===\n{{Main|Flora and fauna of Tasmania}}\n[[File:Hellyer Gorge, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|[[Fern]]s in [[Hellyer Gorge]], to the northeast of [[Savage River National Park]]]]\n[[File:Tasmanian Devil resting.jpg|thumb|alt=A devil lying belly down on dry scrub grass and dead leaves.

Many flora species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of [[Gondwana]], 50 million years ago. [[Beech]] species ''[[Nothofagus gunnii]]'', commonly known as Fagus, is Australia's only temperate native deciduous tree that is found exclusively in Tasmania.<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2016-03-07/deciduous-trees-in-australia/7200608 Why don't we have more native deciduous trees in Australia?] by Anne Salleh ([[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]])</ref>\n\n====Fauna====\nThe island of Tasmania was home to the [[thylacine]], a [[marsupial]] which resembled a [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the [[dingo]], introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The [[Tasmanian devil]] became the [[Largest mammals#Marsupials (Marsupialia)|largest carnivorous marsupial]] in the world following the [[extinction]] of the [[thylacine]] in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and [[emu]]s. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.<ref>Boyce, James, 'The social and Environmental impact of the introduction of the dog to Tasmania' in ''Environmental History'' Vol. 11, No. 1 (Jan. 2006), pp. 102\u2013129</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n[[File:Hobart moonrise from Mt Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Hobart]], seen here from [[Mount Wellington, Tasmania|Mount Wellington]], is Tasmania's most populous city and comprises a large portion of the state's population.]]\n[[File:ABS-3101.0-AustralianDemographicStatistics-EstimatedResidentPopulationStatesTerritories-EstimatedResidentPopulation-Persons-Tasmania-A2060848V.svg|thumb|right|Estimated resident population since 1981]]\n\nTasmania's population is more homogeneous than that of other states of Australia, with many of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] descent.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583912/Tasmania Tasmania (island and state, Australia)]\".

Its relationship with the Federal Government and Parliament are regulated by the [[Australian Constitution]]. Tasmania is represented in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014the number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone.

Proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity, or opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world's first [[green party]], the [[United Tasmania Group]].<ref name=\"Lake Pedder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lake%20Pedder.htm|title=Lake Pedder|accessdate=6 March 2010|last=Davies|first=Lynn|year=2006|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies}}</ref><ref name=\"Lake Pedder\" />\n\nIn the early 1980s the state debated the proposed [[Franklin Dam|Franklin River Dam]]. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to [[old growth]] logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.\n\n===Local government===\nTasmania has 29 [[Local government areas of Tasmania|local government areas]]. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\n\nAs with the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]], Tasmania's local government elections use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single transferable vote|Hare\u2013Clark]].

This name is taken from the [[Bruny Island language]] word for the Tasmanian mainland, which was recorded by [[George Augustus Robinson]] as ''Loe.trou.witter''. Robinson also recorded the name ''Trow.wer.nar'' for Tasmania, likely from the [[Eastern Tasmanian languages|Eastern]] or [[Northeastern Tasmanian languages]]. However, he also recorded it as a name for [[Cape Barren Island]]. In the 20th century, some writers used it as an Aboriginal name for Tasmania, spelled \"Trowenna\" or \"Trowunna\". It is now believed that the name is more properly applied to Cape Barren Island,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tacinc.com.au/tasmanian-aboriginal-place-names/|title=Tasmanian Aboriginal place names|publisher=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref> which has had an official [[dual naming|dual name]] of \"Truwana\" since 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tacinc.com.au/official-aboriginal-and-dual-names/|title=Aboriginal and Dual Names of places in lutruwita (Tasmania)|publisher=Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre|access-date=30 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nTasmania is named after [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[explorer]] [[Abel Tasman]], who made the first reported European sighting of the island on 24 November 1642. Tasman named the island '''Anthony van Diemen's Land''' after his sponsor [[Anthony van Diemen]], the Governor of the [[Dutch East Indies]].

It was officially renamed '''Tasmania''' in honour of its first European discoverer on 1 January 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.tas.gov.au/php/BecomingTasmania/BTAppend2.htm |title=Appendix 2: Select chronology of renaming |last1= Newman |first1=Terry |year=2005 |work=Becoming Tasmania \u2013 Companion Web Site |publisher=[[Parliament of Tasmania]] |access-date=26 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nTasmania was sometimes referred to as \"Dervon,\" as mentioned in the [[Jerilderie Letter]] written by the notorious Australian [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] in 1879. The colloquial expression for the state is \"Tassie\". Tasmania is also colloquially shortened to \"Tas,\" mainly when used in business names and website addresses.

Much of the island is composed of [[Jurassic]] [[Diabase|dolerite]] intrusions (the upwelling of [[magma]]) through other rock types, sometimes forming large columnar joints. Tasmania has the world's largest areas of dolerite, with many distinctive mountains and cliffs formed from this rock type. The [[Central Plateau (Tasmania)|central plateau]] and the southeast portions of the island are mostly dolerites. [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] above [[Hobart]] is a good example, showing distinct columns known as the Organ Pipes.\n\nIn the southern midlands as far south as Hobart, the dolerite is underlaid by [[sandstone]] and similar sedimentary stones. In the southwest, [[Precambrian]] [[quartzite]]s were formed from very ancient sea sediments and form strikingly sharp ridges and ranges, such as Federation Peak or [[Frenchmans Cap, Tasmania|Frenchmans Cap]].\n\nIn the northeast and east, continental [[granite]]s can be seen, such as at Freycinet, similar to coastal granites on mainland Australia. In the northwest and west, mineral-rich volcanic rock can be seen at [[Mount Read (Tasmania)|Mount Read]] near [[Rosebery, Tasmania|Rosebery]], or at [[Mount Lyell, Tasmania|Mount Lyell]] near [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]]. Also present in the south and northwest is [[limestone]] with caves.\n\nThe quartzite and dolerite areas in the higher mountains show evidence of [[glaciation]], and much of Australia's glaciated landscape is found on the Central Plateau and the Southwest. [[Cradle Mountain]], another dolerite peak, for example, was a [[nunatak]]. The combination of these different rock types contributes to scenery which is distinct from any other region of the world.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In the far southwest corner of the state, the geology is almost wholly quartzite, which gives the mountains the false impression of having snow-capped peaks year round.\n\n===Indigenous people===\n{{Main|Aboriginal Tasmanians}}\nEvidence indicates the presence of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginals]] in Tasmania about 42,000&nbsp;years ago.

By 1824 the colonial population had swelled to 12,600, while the island's sheep population had reached 200,000.

Van Diemen's Land had an enormous gender imbalance, with male colonists outnumbering females six to one in 1822\u2014and 16 to one among the convict population.

With few external threats and strong trade links with the Empire, Tasmania enjoyed many fruitful periods in the late 19th century, becoming a world-centre of shipbuilding. It raised a local defence force that eventually played a [[Military history of Australia during the Second Boer War|significant role]] in the [[Second Boer War]] in South Africa, and Tasmanian soldiers in that conflict won the first two [[Victoria Cross]]es awarded to Australians.\n====Federation====\nIn 1901 the Colony of Tasmania [[Federation of Australia|united]] with the five other Australian colonies to form the Commonwealth of Australia.

The nearest bridge was approximately {{convert|20|km}} to the north, at Bridgewater.\n\nNational and international attention surrounded the campaign against the [[Franklin Dam]] in the early 1980s.\n\nOn 28 April 1996, in the incident now known as the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]], lone gunman [[Martin Bryant]] shot and killed 35 people (including tourists and residents) and injured 21 others. The use of [[firearm]]s was immediately reviewed, and new gun ownership laws were adopted nationwide, with Tasmania's law one of the strictest in Australia.\n\nIn April 2006 the [[Beaconsfield Mine collapse]] was triggered by a small earthquake. One person was killed and two others were trapped underground for 14 days.\n\nThe Tasmanian community has for some time been divided over the issue of the proposed [[Bell Bay Pulp Mill]] to be built in the [[Tamar Valley, Tasmania|Tamar Valley]].

Most soils on the Bass Strait Islands, the east coast and western Tasmania are very infertile [[spodosols]] or [[psamments]], with some even less fertile \"lateritic podzolic soils\" in the latter region. Most of these lands are thus not used for agriculture, but there is much productive [[forestry in Tasmania]]\u2014which remains one of the state's major industries.\n\nOn the north coast, apart from some relatively fertile alluvial soils used for fruit-growing, there are also deep red, easily workable soils known as \"krasnozems\" (\"red land\"). These soils are highly acidic and fix phosphate very effectively, but their extremely favourable physical properties make them extensively used for dairying, beef cattle and fodder crops.\n\nThe Midlands and the Lower Derwent present a different story from the rest of the state. Owing to a relatively dry climate and alkaline (mostly [[dolerite]]) parent material, these soils are relatively unleached and contain lime in the deeper subsoil. They are mostly classified as \"prairie soils\" or \"brown earths\" and bear some resemblance to the [[chernozem]]s of Russia and North America, although they are much lower in available [[phosphorus]] and somewhat acidic in the surface levels. Their higher nutrient levels, however, allow them to support productive pasture, and large numbers of sheep are grazed in these regions. Some grain crops are also grown in the driest areas. In the alluvial areas of southeastern Tasmania, rich alluvial soils permit apples to be grown.\n\nTasmania became known as the \"Apple Isle\" because for many years it was one of the world's major apple producers. Apples are still grown in large numbers, particularly in southern Tasmania, and have the distinction of being the first approved by the Japanese government for import, due to their verifiable pest-free status.<ref name=\"Why is Tasmania called the 'Apple Isle'\">{{cite web|url=https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|title=Centre of the apple universe|accessdate=20 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120115242/https://www.tasmanianregions.tas.gov.au/regions/centre-of-the-apple-universe/|archive-date=20 January 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Ecology===\n{{Main|Flora and fauna of Tasmania}}\n[[File:Hellyer Gorge, Tasmania.jpg|thumb|[[Fern]]s in [[Hellyer Gorge]], to the northeast of [[Savage River National Park]]]]\n[[File:Tasmanian Devil resting.jpg|thumb|alt=A devil lying belly down on dry scrub grass and dead leaves.

Many flora species are unique to Tasmania, and some are related to species in South America and New Zealand through ancestors which grew on the super continent of [[Gondwana]], 50 million years ago. [[Beech]] species ''[[Nothofagus gunnii]]'', commonly known as Fagus, is Australia's only temperate native deciduous tree that is found exclusively in Tasmania.<ref>[https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2016-03-07/deciduous-trees-in-australia/7200608 Why don't we have more native deciduous trees in Australia?] by Anne Salleh ([[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]])</ref>\n\n====Fauna====\nThe island of Tasmania was home to the [[thylacine]], a [[marsupial]] which resembled a [[Fossa (animal)|fossa]] or some say a wild dog. Known colloquially as the Tasmanian tiger for the distinctive striping across its back, it became extinct in mainland Australia much earlier because of competition by the [[dingo]], introduced in prehistoric times. Owing to persecution by farmers, government-funded bounty hunters and, in the final years, collectors for overseas museums, it appears to have been exterminated in Tasmania. The [[Tasmanian devil]] became the [[Largest mammals#Marsupials (Marsupialia)|largest carnivorous marsupial]] in the world following the [[extinction]] of the [[thylacine]] in 1936, and is now found in the wild only in Tasmania. Tasmania was one of the last regions of Australia to be introduced to domesticated dogs. Dogs were brought from Britain in 1803 for hunting kangaroos and [[emu]]s. This introduction completely transformed Aboriginal society, as it helped them to successfully compete with European hunters, and was more important than the introduction of guns for the Aboriginals.<ref>Boyce, James, 'The social and Environmental impact of the introduction of the dog to Tasmania' in ''Environmental History'' Vol. 11, No. 1 (Jan. 2006), pp. 102\u2013129</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n[[File:Hobart moonrise from Mt Wellington.jpg|thumb|right|The city of [[Hobart]], seen here from [[Mount Wellington, Tasmania|Mount Wellington]], is Tasmania's most populous city and comprises a large portion of the state's population.]]\n[[File:ABS-3101.0-AustralianDemographicStatistics-EstimatedResidentPopulationStatesTerritories-EstimatedResidentPopulation-Persons-Tasmania-A2060848V.svg|thumb|right|Estimated resident population since 1981]]\n\nTasmania's population is more homogeneous than that of other states of Australia, with many of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] descent.<ref>\"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/583912/Tasmania Tasmania (island and state, Australia)]\".

Since 1901, Tasmania has been a state of the Commonwealth of Australia, and the [[Australian Constitution]] regulates its relationship with the Commonwealth and prescribes which powers each level of government is allowed.\n\n{{Main|List of Governors of Tasmania|l1=Governors of Tasmania|Parliament of Tasmania}}\n\nTasmania is a State in the Australian federation. Its relationship with the Federal Government and Parliament are regulated by the [[Australian Constitution]]. Tasmania is represented in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] by 12 senators, on an equal basis with all other states. In the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], Tasmania is entitled to five seats, which is the minimum allocation for a state guaranteed by the Constitution\u2014the number of House of Representatives seats for each state is otherwise decided on the basis of their relative populations, and Tasmania has never qualified for five seats on that basis alone. Tasmania's [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]] use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single Transferable Vote|Hare-Clark]].\n\n===Elections===\nAt the [[2002 Tasmanian state election|2002 state election]], the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] won 14 of the 25 House seats. The people decreased their vote for the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]]; representation in the Parliament fell to seven seats. The [[Tasmanian Greens|Greens]] won four seats, with over 18% of the popular vote, the highest proportion of any Green party in any parliament in the world at that time.\n{| class=\"toccolours\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin-right:.5em; margin-top:.4em; margin-left:0.5em; font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Composition of the Parliament of Tasmania\n|- style=\"background:#ccc; vertical-align:top;\"\n!Political<br />Party\n!House of<br />Assembly\n!Legislative<br />Council\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#f66;\"|[[Australian Labor Party|ALP]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|4\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#00bfff;\"|[[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|13\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#90ee90;\"|[[Australian Greens|Greens]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:#ccf;\"|[[Independent (politician)|Independent]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|0\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:80%; background:#cef; text-align:center;\"| Source: Tasmanian Electoral Commission\n|}\n\n<!---kind of long and \"who cares anymore\".

Bacon was succeeded by [[Paul Lennon]], who, after leading the state for two years, went on to win the [[2006 Tasmanian state election|2006 state election]] in his own right. Lennon resigned in 2008 and was succeeded by [[David Bartlett]], who formed a coalition government with the Greens after the [[2010 Tasmanian state election|2010 state election]] resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. Bartlett resigned as Premier in January 2011 and was replaced by [[Lara Giddings]], who became Tasmania's first female Premier.

Proposals for local economic development have been faced with requirements for environmental sensitivity, or opposition. In particular, proposals for hydroelectric power generation were debated in the late 20th century. In the 1970s, opposition to the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] reservoir impoundment led to the formation of the world's first [[green party]], the [[United Tasmania Group]].<ref name=\"Lake Pedder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.utas.edu.au/library/companion_to_tasmanian_history/L/Lake%20Pedder.htm|title=Lake Pedder|accessdate=6 March 2010|last=Davies|first=Lynn|year=2006|publisher=Centre for Tasmanian Historical Studies}}</ref><ref name=\"Lake Pedder\" />\n\nIn the early 1980s the state debated the proposed [[Franklin Dam|Franklin River Dam]]. The anti-dam sentiment was shared by many Australians outside Tasmania and proved a factor in the election of the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke]] [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government in 1983, which halted construction of the dam. Since the 1980s the environmental focus has shifted to [[old growth]] logging and mining in the Tarkine region, which have both proved divisive. The Tasmania Together process recommended an end to clear felling in high conservation old growth forests by January 2003, but was unsuccessful.\n\n===Local government===\nTasmania has 29 [[Local government areas of Tasmania|local government areas]]. Local councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Tasmanian parliament, such as urban planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.\n\nAs with the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]], Tasmania's local government elections use a system of multi-seat [[proportional representation]] known as [[Single transferable vote|Hare\u2013Clark]]. Local government elections take place every four years and are conducted by the [[Tasmanian Electoral Commission]] by full [[postal ballot]]. The next local government elections will be held during September and October 2018.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Tasmania}}\n[[File:WesternTasmania1865.jpg|thumb|[[West Coast, Tasmania|Western Tasmania]] and [[South West Tasmania]] with natural resources on 1865 map]]\n[[File:Tasmanian salmon on a pea and corn fritter.jpg|thumb|Smoked Tasmanian salmon.

In the 1940s and 1950s, a hydro-industrialisation initiative was embodied in the state by [[Hydro Tasmania]]. These all have had varying fortunes over the last century and more, involved in ebbs and flows of population moving in and away dependent upon the specific requirements of the dominant industries of the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The state also has a large number of food exporting sectors, including but not limited to seafood (such as [[Atlantic salmon]], [[abalone]] and [[crayfish]]).\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s there was a decline in traditional crops such as apples and pears,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |title=Industry Info page |publisher=Fruit Growers Tasmania |accessdate=26 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821224809/http://www.fruitgrowerstas.com.au/industry_fgt.html |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> with other crops and industries eventually rising in their place. During the 15 years until 2010, new agricultural products such as wine, [[saffron]], [[pyrethrum]] and [[cherry|cherries]] have been fostered by the [[Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research]].\n\nFavourable economic conditions throughout Australia, cheaper air fares, and two new ''Spirit of Tasmania'' ferries have all contributed to what is now a rising tourism industry.\n\nAbout 1.7% of the Tasmanian population are employed by local government.<ref>{{cite book|title=Local Government and Southern Tasmanian Economy|author=Eslaka, Saul |date=August 2011}}</ref> Other major employers include [[Nyrstar]], [[Norske Skog]], Grange Resources, [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Major employers campaign to boost their public profile|url=http://www.themercury.com.au/news/tasmania/major-employers-campaign-to-boost-their-public-profile/story-fnj4f7k1-1226765643507|accessdate=4 April 2015|publisher=The Mercury|date=22 November 2013}}</ref> the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hobart]], and [[Federal Group]].

The state is also home to [[Incat]], a manufacturer of very high-speed aluminium catamarans that regularly broke records when they were first launched. The state government tried using them on the Bass Strait run but eventually decided to discontinue the run because of concerns over viability and the suitability of the vessels for the extreme weather conditions sometimes experienced in the strait.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Tasmania}}\n[[File:One-day Cricket Australia vs England, Bellerive Oval, January 2011 (2).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bellerive Oval]] at night, during the [[one-day cricket]] Australia vs England.]]\n\nSport is an important pastime in Tasmania, and the state has produced several famous sportsmen and women and also hosted several major sporting events. The [[Tasmanian Tigers]] cricket team represents the state successfully (for example the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 2007, 2011 and 2013) and plays its home games at the [[Bellerive Oval]] in Hobart; which is also the home ground for the [[Hobart Hurricanes]] in the Big Bash League. In addition, Bellerive Oval regularly hosts international cricket matches. Famous Tasmanian cricketers include [[David Boon]] and former Australian captain [[Ricky Ponting]].\n\n[[Australian Rules Football]] is also popularly followed, with frequent discussion of a proposed [[Tasmanian AFL Bid|Tasmanian team]] in the Australian Football League ([[Australian Football League|AFL]]). Several AFL games have been played at [[York Park|Aurora Stadium]], Launceston, including the [[Hawthorn Football Club]] and {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, at the Bellerive Oval with the [[North Melbourne Football Club]] playing 3 home games there. The stadium was the site of an infamous match between [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] which was [[AFL siren controversy, 2006|controversially drawn]] after the umpires failed to hear the final siren. Local leagues include the [[North West Football League]] and [[Tasmanian State League]].\n\n[[Rugby League]] Football is also played in the area, with the highest level of football played is in the [[Tasmanian Rugby League]] competition. The most successful team is the [[Hobart Football Club|Hobart Tigers]], who have won the title three times.\n\n[[Rugby Union]] is also played in Tasmania and is governed by the [[Tasmanian Rugby Union]]. Ten clubs take part in the statewide Tasmanian Rugby Competition.\n\n[[Association Football]] (soccer) is played throughout the state, including a proposed [[Tasmania United FC|Tasmanian A-League Club]] and an existing statewide league called the [[National Premier Leagues Tasmania|NPL Tasmania]].\n\nTasmania hosts the professional [[Moorilla Hobart International|Moorilla International]] tennis tournament as part of the lead up to the Australian Open and is played at the [[Hobart International Tennis Centre]], Hobart.\n\nThe [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]] is an annual event starting in Sydney, NSW, on Boxing Day and finishing in Hobart, Tasmania. It is widely considered to be one of the most difficult yacht races in the world.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/sailing/1721104.stm |work=BBC News | title=Tough legacy of a Sydney classic | date=29 December 2001 | accessdate=12 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile some of the other sports played and [[cheering|barracked]] for have grown in popularity, others have declined.

He was embroiled in virulent political controversies during the [[Vietnam War]] era, the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born into the an upper-middle-class Czech Jewish family in [[Vienna]] and enjoyed a happy childhood until the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria in 1938. Realising the personal danger, he fled the country in November 1939 with other members of a [[Zionist]] youth group, to the join a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. In January 1942, he joined the Communist Party and spent the remainder of [[World War II]] as a member of the Free Czech Forces, attached to the [[British Army]]. The family that he had left in Vienna all perished in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name=Andknop/>{{Better source|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Prague]], where he had returned in 1945, had been taken over by the Communists. Reading [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' had soured him from them, and he used money from his family estate to bribe officials into letting him flee to [[England]]. He thereafter detested the [[Soviet Union]], while continuing to revere [[Karl Marx]] as a man, whom, as late as July 1983, he defended, in a ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' article)<ref>Knopfelmacher, F. (1983) As I please: In (mild) defence of Karl Marx. ''Quadrant'' 27, 7-8.</ref>.\n\n==Academic career==\nKnopfelmacher completed a doctorate in philosophy and psychology at the [[University of Bristol]]. In 1955, he moved to Melbourne and took up a lectureship at University of Melbourne's Psychology Department.\n\nFew outside professional circles had heard of him until 1965, when he applied and was approved for a post in political philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]] but had his appointment blocked, in what became a front-page ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'', by the University Senate.<ref>Full details may be found in Robert Scoble, \"The Knopfelmacher Case\" in ''Quadrant'', Sept-Oct 1971, pp.72-82.</ref> \n\nThe Senate considered Knopfelmacher's published criticisms of [[Moscow]], and its apologists, to be unduly strong meat. He had written of Melbourne leftists that \"like rats, they wish to operate in the dark\" (''Twentieth Century'' magazine, Volume 18, 1964). Those firmly supporting him included [[Sydney]] philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]], who called Knopfelmacher \"a man fatally ahead of his time by a few years. A short time afterwards academic rebels were saying pretty much anything they liked, how they liked, about their opponents. If anyone tried to censure them or impede their careers as a result of this, the shouts that their academic freedom had been violated were deafening. To Knopfelmacher, however... [[Saki]]'s saying applied: it is the first Christian martyr who gets the hungriest lion.\"<ref>James Franklin, ''Corrupting the Youth: A History of Philosophy in Australia'' (Macleay Press, Sydney, 2003), [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/corruptingtheyouthch11.pdf ch. 11].</ref>\n\n==Association with right-wing figures==\nCatholic activist [[Bob Santamaria|B.A. Santamaria]] stated (in his 1969 book ''Point of View'') that, compared with Knopfelmacher's opponents, \"[[Pontius Pilate]] was an amateur!\".<ref>B.A. Santamaria, ''Point of View'' (Melbourne: Hawthorn Press, 1969), p. 239.</ref> During the late 1960s Knopfelmacher (still lecturing at Melbourne University) became de facto academic leader of those, usually associated with the Santamaria-controlled Peace With Freedom group, who favoured continuing Australian military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He became a strong proponent of the controversial drive for [[Conscription in Australia|Australian conscription]] and the method of conscription by lottery.  \n\nWhen, in 1972, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War ended (with the election of the [[Whitlam government]]), Knopfelmacher's long-standing intellectual unpredictability became more pronounced. He turned vehemently against Santamaria. In ''[[The Age]]'' on 7 April 1984, he likened Santamaria's treatment of trade-union opponents to [[Stalin]]'s treatment of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]; this assertion was clearly libellous, but Santamaria refused to press charges. The previous year (''Quadrant'', October 1983), Knopfelmacher had directed some of his most sarcastic prose against Santamaria's supporters among conservative Catholic activists.\n\nHis self-contradictions did not end there. In 1977, he had proclaimed, in an article in the short lived Sydney magazine ''[[Nation Review]]'', that \"Australia is a deeply racist nation\" and lauded [[Indochina refugee crisis|Indochinese refugee]] arrivals, viewing their acceptance by the immigration authorities as a debt of honour that Australia owed to its defeated allies. Within five years he executed a complete ''volte-face'' in condemning [[multiculturalism]] in sharp terms and calling it an \"ethnic cauldron\" (''The Bulletin'', 24 March 1981) and \"a banana republic of squabbling and mutually resentful expatriated mini-cultures, each with its own special bunch of ethnic ... f\u00fchrers\" ([[Robert Manne]] [ed.], ''The New Conservatism in Australia'', St Lucia, Queensland, 1982). Elsewhere he described multiculturalism as a racket, an industry scrambling for government grants.<ref>Norman Abjorensen, (1995), A key figure in a puzzling era, [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/130551744 ''The Canberra Times'', 19 May 1995, p.13.] Accessed 16 March 2018.</ref> From 1979, he denounced (especially in letters to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine) John Bennett, the secretary of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, for disseminating [[Holocaust denial]] literature. Yet by 1989 he was arguing vituperatively with Jews who publicly advocated a national war crimes statute.<ref>See [[W. D. Rubinstein]], ''The Jews in Australia'' (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1991).</ref> \n\nFor all his admiration of Koestler and [[George Orwell]], Knopfelmacher wrote far less than either man, and his hardcover bibliography amounted to one 1968 reflection, ''Intellectuals and Politics''. (A promised full-length memoir remains in manuscript, but a brief account of his political education appeared in the 1981 anthology ''Twenty-Five Years of Quadrant''.)\n\nIn his last years Knopfelmacher mended fences with Santamaria, who, from the early 1990s, deliberately sought reconciliations with ex-Cabinet Minister [[Clyde Cameron]] and other erstwhile foes.<ref>Bill Guy, ''A Life on the Left: A Biography of Clyde Cameron'' (Adelaide: Wakefield Press, 1999), pp. 154-157</ref> Knopfelmacher died after incurring severe injuries in a road accident following a meeting with [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]. Obituarists likened him to [[Primo Levi]] and to [[Samuel Johnson]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nKnopfelmacher's first wife, fellow refugee Jarmila \"Jacka\" Pick, whom he had married in 1944, succumbed in 1968 to an especially cruel and protracted form of [[multiple sclerosis]]. In 1970, Knopfelmacher wed Australian teacher Susan Robinson; the couple had two children.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications include==\n*Knopfelmacher, F.

Retrieved 23 May 2013</ref>{{Better source|date=October 2016}} who migrated to [[Australia]] in 1955 and became a [[psychology]] lecturer and [[anticommunist]] [[advocacy journalism|political commentator]] at the [[University of Melbourne]]. He was embroiled in virulent political controversies during the [[Vietnam War]] era, the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born into the an upper-middle-class Czech Jewish family in [[Vienna]] and enjoyed a happy childhood until the [[Anschluss]], the annexation of Austria in 1938. Realising the personal danger, he fled the country in November 1939 with other members of a [[Zionist]] youth group, to the join a [[kibbutz]] in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. In January 1942, he joined the Communist Party and spent the remainder of [[World War II]] as a member of the Free Czech Forces, attached to the [[British Army]]. The family that he had left in Vienna all perished in the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].<ref name=Andknop/>{{Better source|date=October 2016}}\n\n[[Prague]], where he had returned in 1945, had been taken over by the Communists. Reading [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'' had soured him from them, and he used money from his family estate to bribe officials into letting him flee to [[England]]. He thereafter detested the [[Soviet Union]], while continuing to revere [[Karl Marx]] as a man, whom, as late as July 1983, he defended, in a ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'' article)<ref>Knopfelmacher, F. (1983) As I please: In (mild) defence of Karl Marx. ''Quadrant'' 27, 7-8.</ref>.\n\n==Academic career==\nKnopfelmacher completed a doctorate in philosophy and psychology at the [[University of Bristol]]. In 1955, he moved to Melbourne and took up a lectureship at University of Melbourne's Psychology Department.\n\nFew outside professional circles had heard of him until 1965, when he applied and was approved for a post in political philosophy at the [[University of Sydney]] but had his appointment blocked, in what became a front-page ''cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre'', by the University Senate.<ref>Full details may be found in Robert Scoble, \"The Knopfelmacher Case\" in ''Quadrant'', Sept-Oct 1971, pp.72-82.</ref> \n\nThe Senate considered Knopfelmacher's published criticisms of [[Moscow]], and its apologists, to be unduly strong meat. He had written of Melbourne leftists that \"like rats, they wish to operate in the dark\" (''Twentieth Century'' magazine, Volume 18, 1964). Those firmly supporting him included [[Sydney]] philosopher [[David Malet Armstrong]], who called Knopfelmacher \"a man fatally ahead of his time by a few years. A short time afterwards academic rebels were saying pretty much anything they liked, how they liked, about their opponents. If anyone tried to censure them or impede their careers as a result of this, the shouts that their academic freedom had been violated were deafening. To Knopfelmacher, however... [[Saki]]'s saying applied: it is the first Christian martyr who gets the hungriest lion.\"<ref>James Franklin, ''Corrupting the Youth: A History of Philosophy in Australia'' (Macleay Press, Sydney, 2003), [http://www.maths.unsw.edu.au/~jim/corruptingtheyouthch11.pdf ch. 11].</ref>\n\n==Association with right-wing figures==\nCatholic activist [[Bob Santamaria|B.A. Santamaria]] stated (in his 1969 book ''Point of View'') that, compared with Knopfelmacher's opponents, \"[[Pontius Pilate]] was an amateur!\".<ref>B.A. Santamaria, ''Point of View'' (Melbourne: Hawthorn Press, 1969), p. 239.</ref> During the late 1960s Knopfelmacher (still lecturing at Melbourne University) became de facto academic leader of those, usually associated with the Santamaria-controlled Peace With Freedom group, who favoured continuing Australian military involvement in the [[Vietnam War]]. He became a strong proponent of the controversial drive for [[Conscription in Australia|Australian conscription]] and the method of conscription by lottery.  \n\nWhen, in 1972, Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War ended (with the election of the [[Whitlam government]]), Knopfelmacher's long-standing intellectual unpredictability became more pronounced. He turned vehemently against Santamaria. In ''[[The Age]]'' on 7 April 1984, he likened Santamaria's treatment of trade-union opponents to [[Stalin]]'s treatment of [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]; this assertion was clearly libellous, but Santamaria refused to press charges. The previous year (''Quadrant'', October 1983), Knopfelmacher had directed some of his most sarcastic prose against Santamaria's supporters among conservative Catholic activists.\n\nHis self-contradictions did not end there. In 1977, he had proclaimed, in an article in the short lived Sydney magazine ''[[Nation Review]]'', that \"Australia is a deeply racist nation\" and lauded [[Indochina refugee crisis|Indochinese refugee]] arrivals, viewing their acceptance by the immigration authorities as a debt of honour that Australia owed to its defeated allies. Within five years he executed a complete ''volte-face'' in condemning [[multiculturalism]] in sharp terms and calling it an \"ethnic cauldron\" (''The Bulletin'', 24 March 1981) and \"a banana republic of squabbling and mutually resentful expatriated mini-cultures, each with its own special bunch of ethnic ... f\u00fchrers\" ([[Robert Manne]] [ed.], ''The New Conservatism in Australia'', St Lucia, Queensland, 1982). Elsewhere he described multiculturalism as a racket, an industry scrambling for government grants.<ref>Norman Abjorensen, (1995), A key figure in a puzzling era, [https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/130551744 ''The Canberra Times'', 19 May 1995, p.13.] Accessed 16 March 2018.</ref> From 1979, he denounced (especially in letters to [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine) John Bennett, the secretary of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties, for disseminating [[Holocaust denial]] literature. Yet by 1989 he was arguing vituperatively with Jews who publicly advocated a national war crimes statute.<ref>See [[W. D. Rubinstein]], ''The Jews in Australia'' (Melbourne: Melbourne University Press, 1991).</ref> \n\nFor all his admiration of Koestler and [[George Orwell]], Knopfelmacher wrote far less than either man, and his hardcover bibliography amounted to one 1968 reflection, ''Intellectuals and Politics''. (A promised full-length memoir remains in manuscript, but a brief account of his political education appeared in the 1981 anthology ''Twenty-Five Years of Quadrant''.)\n\nIn his last years Knopfelmacher mended fences with Santamaria, who, from the early 1990s, deliberately sought reconciliations with ex-Cabinet Minister [[Clyde Cameron]] and other erstwhile foes.<ref>Bill Guy, ''A Life on the Left: A Biography of Clyde Cameron'' (Adelaide: Wakefield Press, 1999), pp. 154-157</ref> Knopfelmacher died after incurring severe injuries in a road accident following a meeting with [[V\u00e1clav Havel]]. Obituarists likened him to [[Primo Levi]] and to [[Samuel Johnson]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\nKnopfelmacher's first wife, fellow refugee Jarmila \"Jacka\" Pick, whom he had married in 1944, succumbed in 1968 to an especially cruel and protracted form of [[multiple sclerosis]]. In 1970, Knopfelmacher wed Australian teacher Susan Robinson; the couple had two children.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Publications include==\n*Knopfelmacher, F.

The [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 changed the setup nationally, but this was one of the few counties totally unaffected.\n\n==== 1885-1918 ====\nUnder the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the County was divided into 2 seats:\n*the Northern or [[Biggleswade (UK Parliament constituency)|Biggleswade]] Division (often written North Beds); and \n*the Southern or [[Luton (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton]] Division (often written South Beds)  \n\nBiggleswade covered the northern half of the county including Ampthill and Kempston. It also welcomed votes from non-resident freeholders of the Municipal Borough of Bedford.  Luton covered the southern half of the county, including Leighton Buzzard and the Municipal Boroughs of Dunstable and Luton. \n\n*Bedford was kept as a Parliamentary Borough but reduced to 1 MP.\n\n==== 1918-1950 ====\nUnder the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], the Parliamentary Borough was technically abolished.  The Municipal Borough was now included in a Bedford seat/Division of the county taking in the Urban District of Kempston and the rural areas of the northern part of the abolished North Beds; the southern areas of which, including the Urban Districts of Biggleswade and Ampthill made a [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]] Division, along with Leighton Buzzard and surrounding rural areas transferred from Luton.\n\n==== 1950-1974 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] resumed the pre-1885 net total of 4 MPs. It created a \"South Bedfordshire\" seat of Dunstable with the Leagrave and Limbury parts of the Municipal Borough of Luton, from abolished Luton/South Beds, and Leighton Buzzard, from \"Mid Bedfordshire\".  \"Luton\" was created, a Borough Constituency, for the Municipal Borough save the mentioned parts.  Mid Bedfordshire gained southern and eastern rural areas from \"Bedford\".\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nThe county limits altered: South Bedfordshire gained the former Urban District of Linslade in Buckinghamshire which had been merged with that of Leighton Buzzard to form the Urban District of Leighton-Linslade; and Mid Bedfordshire lost the village of Eaton Socon taken into the Urban District of St Neots in Huntingdonshire.\n\nThe Second Review resulted in an increase to 5 MPs. Luton was abolished to create Borough Constituencies of [[Luton East (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton East]] and [[Luton West (UK Parliament constituency)|West]].  The majority of the latter comprised the Leagrave and Limbury districts, taken from South Bedfordshire.  \n\n==== 1983-1997 ====\nThe Third Periodic Review left the county's representation at 5 MPs, but saw significant changes, retaining only Mid Bedfordshire.  Bedford was abolished, being largely replaced by [[North Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Bedfordshire]] save for Kempston, transferred to Mid Bedfordshire.  Luton East and Luton West were replaced by [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] and [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] respectively, with both taking small parts of South Bedfordshire, with Luton North extending further north to include Flitwick that had been in Mid Bedfordshire.  South Bedfordshire was abolished and largely replaced by [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]], which  took in south-western parts of Mid Bedfordshire.\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review resulted in an increase to 6 MPs.  Bedford was re-established as a Borough Constituency comprising the town of Bedford itself, which had constituted the majority of the abolished constituency of North Bedfordshire, and Kempston which was transferred back from Mid Bedfordshire. A new County Constituency of [[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire]] was created, comprising the remaining (rural) areas of North Bedfordshire and northern and eastern parts of Mid Bedfordshire seeing about half its electorate lost including Biggleswade and Sandy.  To compensate for this and the loss of Kempston, Mid Bedfordshire regained the areas previously transferred to South West Bedfordshire and gained the parts outside the Borough of Luton from North Luton (including Flitwick).  The latter became a Borough Constituency and gained the Saints ward from Luton South.\n\n==== 2010-present ====\n[[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] - marginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" \n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Name!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Pre-2010 Boundaries!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Post-2010 Boundaries\n|-\n|\n#[[Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedford BC]]\n#[[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North BC]]\n#[[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South BC]]\n#[[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire CC]]\n#[[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire CC]]\n#[[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire CC]]\n|[[Image:BedfordshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Bedfordshire 1997 - 2005]]\n|[[Image:BedfordshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Bedfordshire 2010 - present]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Changes proposed in 2018==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. The proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not timetabled by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. They were thus ignored for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|election on 12 December 2019]].\n\nUnder the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Review would cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and see a revived strictness of avoiding [[malapportionment]] (electoral parity rule) that the electorate of all seats must be within 5% of the electoral (average national) quota (number of electors). The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 thus quota found to be 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=2019-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=2019-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTo meet this the Commission was able to treat Bedfordshire as a sub-region of the Eastern Region and recommended that the county retained six seats.  [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] would gain the remainder of the [[Central Bedfordshire]] ward of [[Caddington]] from [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]] and the [[Luton|Borough of Luton]] ward of [[Barnfield, Luton|Barnfield]] from [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]]. In turn, Luton North would gain three wards from South West Bedfordshire comprising the town of [[Houghton Regis]]. In recognition of this the name of this seat is to be/would be '''Luton North and Houghton Regis'''.  The separator of South West Bedfordshire from [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]] would be moved northwards again and limits around the town of [[Bedford]] affecting the seats of [[Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedford]], [[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire]] and Mid Bedfordshire would be adjusted to take account of the revision of wards in the [[Borough of Bedford]] and updated electorate (eligible adults to vote) figures.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current

The [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 changed the setup nationally, but this was one of the few counties totally unaffected.\n\n==== 1885-1918 ====\nUnder the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the County was divided into 2 seats:\n*the Northern or [[Biggleswade (UK Parliament constituency)|Biggleswade]] Division (often written North Beds); and \n*the Southern or [[Luton (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton]] Division (often written South Beds)  \n\nBiggleswade covered the northern half of the county including Ampthill and Kempston. It also welcomed votes from non-resident freeholders of the Municipal Borough of Bedford.  Luton covered the southern half of the county, including Leighton Buzzard and the Municipal Boroughs of Dunstable and Luton. \n\n*Bedford was kept as a Parliamentary Borough but reduced to 1 MP.\n\n==== 1918-1950 ====\nUnder the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], the Parliamentary Borough was technically abolished.  The Municipal Borough was now included in a Bedford seat/Division of the county taking in the Urban District of Kempston and the rural areas of the northern part of the abolished North Beds; the southern areas of which, including the Urban Districts of Biggleswade and Ampthill made a [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]] Division, along with Leighton Buzzard and surrounding rural areas transferred from Luton.\n\n==== 1950-1974 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] resumed the pre-1885 net total of 4 MPs. It created a \"South Bedfordshire\" seat of Dunstable with the Leagrave and Limbury parts of the Municipal Borough of Luton, from abolished Luton/South Beds, and Leighton Buzzard, from \"Mid Bedfordshire\".  \"Luton\" was created, a Borough Constituency, for the Municipal Borough save the mentioned parts.  Mid Bedfordshire gained southern and eastern rural areas from \"Bedford\".\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nThe county limits altered: South Bedfordshire gained the former Urban District of Linslade in Buckinghamshire which had been merged with that of Leighton Buzzard to form the Urban District of Leighton-Linslade; and Mid Bedfordshire lost the village of Eaton Socon taken into the Urban District of St Neots in Huntingdonshire.\n\nThe Second Review resulted in an increase to 5 MPs. Luton was abolished to create Borough Constituencies of [[Luton East (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton East]] and [[Luton West (UK Parliament constituency)|West]].  The majority of the latter comprised the Leagrave and Limbury districts, taken from South Bedfordshire.  \n\n==== 1983-1997 ====\nThe Third Periodic Review left the county's representation at 5 MPs, but saw significant changes, retaining only Mid Bedfordshire.  Bedford was abolished, being largely replaced by [[North Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North Bedfordshire]] save for Kempston, transferred to Mid Bedfordshire.  Luton East and Luton West were replaced by [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] and [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]] respectively, with both taking small parts of South Bedfordshire, with Luton North extending further north to include Flitwick that had been in Mid Bedfordshire.  South Bedfordshire was abolished and largely replaced by [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]], which  took in south-western parts of Mid Bedfordshire.\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review resulted in an increase to 6 MPs.  Bedford was re-established as a Borough Constituency comprising the town of Bedford itself, which had constituted the majority of the abolished constituency of North Bedfordshire, and Kempston which was transferred back from Mid Bedfordshire. A new County Constituency of [[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire]] was created, comprising the remaining (rural) areas of North Bedfordshire and northern and eastern parts of Mid Bedfordshire seeing about half its electorate lost including Biggleswade and Sandy.  To compensate for this and the loss of Kempston, Mid Bedfordshire regained the areas previously transferred to South West Bedfordshire and gained the parts outside the Borough of Luton from North Luton (including Flitwick).  The latter became a Borough Constituency and gained the Saints ward from Luton South.\n\n==== 2010-present ====\n[[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] - marginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" \n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Name!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Pre-2010 Boundaries!! bgcolor=\"#ff9999\" |Post-2010 Boundaries\n|-\n|\n#[[Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedford BC]]\n#[[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North BC]]\n#[[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South BC]]\n#[[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire CC]]\n#[[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire CC]]\n#[[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire CC]]\n|[[Image:BedfordshireParliamentaryConstituenciesNumbered.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Bedfordshire 1997 - 2005]]\n|[[Image:BedfordshireParliamentaryConstituencies2007.svg|left|Parliamentary constituencies in Bedfordshire 2010 - present]]\n|-\n|}\n\n==Changes proposed by the Boundary Commission==\nThe [[Boundary Commission for England]] submitted their final proposals in respect of the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] (the 2018 review) in September 2018. The proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not timetabled by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. They were thus ignored for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|election on 12 December 2019]].\n\nUnder the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Review would cut the number of MPs from 650 to 600 and see a revived strictness of avoiding [[malapportionment]] (electoral parity rule) that the electorate of all seats must be within 5% of the electoral (average national) quota (number of electors). The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 thus quota found to be 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=2019-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=2019-02-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nTo meet this the Commission was able to treat Bedfordshire as a sub-region of the Eastern Region and recommended that the county retained six seats.  [[Luton South (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton South]] would gain the remainder of the [[Central Bedfordshire]] ward of [[Caddington]] from [[South West Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South West Bedfordshire]] and the [[Luton|Borough of Luton]] ward of [[Barnfield, Luton|Barnfield]] from [[Luton North (UK Parliament constituency)|Luton North]]. In turn, Luton North would gain three wards from South West Bedfordshire comprising the town of [[Houghton Regis]]. In recognition of this the name of this seat is to be/would be '''Luton North and Houghton Regis'''.  The separator of South West Bedfordshire from [[Mid Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Bedfordshire]] would be moved northwards again and limits around the town of [[Bedford]] affecting the seats of [[Bedford (UK Parliament constituency)|Bedford]], [[North East Bedfordshire (UK Parliament constituency)|North East Bedfordshire]] and Mid Bedfordshire would be adjusted to take account of the revision of wards in the [[Borough of Bedford]] and updated electorate (eligible adults to vote) figures.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current

The county also included the Parliamentary Boroughs of [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], [[Wallingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallingford]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]] each returning 2 MPs and [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] (which was partly in Oxfordshire) which returned 1 MP (one of only a handful of English Boroughs to do so).\n\n==== 1832-1885 ====\nThe [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons. The County's representation was increased to 3 MPs, whilst that of the Borough of Wallingford was reduced to 1 MP.  Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], the representation of the Borough of New Windsor was also reduced to 1 MP, at the same time expanding its boundaries to include [[Clewer]] and [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] (the latter being north of the River Thames in [[Buckinghamshire]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/sheet/bc_reports_1868/New_Windsor_1868|title=H.M.S.O.

The Boroughs of Wallingford and Abingdon were abolished and absorbed into the county Division of Abingdon and Reading had its representation reduced to 1 MP.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Berkshire since 1885.

Eton was now included in the [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] Division of Buckinghamshire The Municipal Borough of Wokingham itself was added to the Newbury Division and the Parliamentary Borough of Reading was expanded in line with the County Borough, including the absorption of [[Caversham, Reading|Caversham]], to the north of the River Thames, which had previously been part of the [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] Division of Oxfordshire.\n\n==== 1950-1955 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] increased the county's representation from 4 to 6 MPs.  Reading was split into the two Borough Constituencies of Reading North and Reading South and Wokingham was re-established as a County Constituency, comprising the borough of Wokingham and rural areas to the south and east of Reading, transferred from Newbury, and extending eastwards to include the Rural District of [[Easthampstead Rural District|Easthampstead]] (which incorporated [[Bracknell]]), transferred from Windsor.\n\n==== 1955-1974 ====\nUnder the [[First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|First Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] Reading North and Reading South were recombined, with one ward of the County Borough being included in each of the Newbury and Wokingham constituencies.\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nUnder the Second Periodic Review, representation was increased back up to 6 MPs with the recreation of Reading North and Reading South.  The County Borough wards in Newbury and Wokingham were returned whilst Reading South (which was designated as a County Constituency) was extended southwards to include parts of the [[Wokingham Rural District|Rural District of Wokingham]], transferred from the constituency thereof.\n\n==== 1983-1997 ====\nThe Third Review reflected the changes to the county of Berkshire resulting from the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and saw major changes. The bulk of the area comprising the constituency of [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] had been moved to [[Oxfordshire]], with the majority of its contents, including [[Wantage (UK Parliament constituency)|Wantage]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Didcot]] and [[Faringdon]] being included in the new County Constituency of [[Wantage (UK Parliament constituency)|Wantage]]. The town of [[Abingdon-on-Thames]] itself, together with areas to the west of Oxford, was included in the new County Constituency of [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]]. The small part which was retained in Berkshire was transferred to Newbury.  The county had absorbed the Municipal Borough of Slough and the small Urban District of Eton (which together had formed the Borough Constituency of [[Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Eton and Slough]]) from Buckinghamshire.  Slough was formed as a new Borough Constituency and Eton was added back to Windsor.\n\nA further County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire]] was created, largely comprising the Borough of Bracknell (formerly the Rural District of Easthampstead) but also including the areas comprising the former Rural District of Windsor (including Old Windsor and Sunningdale), transferred from Windsor and Maidenhead, and the parts of the former Rural District of Eton (including Datchet) which had also been transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire and were previously part of the County Constituency of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]].\n\nReading North and Reading South were abolished once again and replaced by the County Constituencies of [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]] and [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading West]]. Reading East was formed largely from parts of Reading South, together with parts of Reading North, including Caversham.  Reading West was formed largely from parts of Reading North and extended westwards to include parts of Newbury.  North-western parts of Reading South were transferred back to Wokingham.\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review resulted in a further increase from 7 to 8 MPs with the abolition of Windsor and Maidenhead and the creation of the two separate County Constituencies of [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]].  Maidenhead included Bisham and Cookham and was extended westwards to include northern parts of Wokingham.  Windsor included [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]], Eton and the Slough ward of Foxborough. It was extended southwards to include parts of East Berkshire ([[Datchet]], [[Old Windsor]], [[Sunningdale]] and [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]]).  East Berkshire was abolished with remaining parts forming the basis of the new County Constituency of Bracknell, which also included the ward of Wokingham Without, transferred from Wokingham, and [[Finchampstead]], transferred from Reading East.\n\nReading East was redesignated as a Borough Constituency, gaining parts to the east of the borough from Wokingham in exchange for areas to the south, including Shinfield.  Wokingham also added two wards from Newbury.  Finally, Reading East gained the borough ward of [[Katesgrove]] from Reading West in exchange for the ward of [[Whitley, Reading|Whitley]].\n\n==== 2010\u2013present ====\n[[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] - Modest changes, including the transfer of Bray from Windsor to Maidenhead, [[Binfield]] from Bracknell to Windsor and the return of Foxborough ward from Windsor to Slough.

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they will '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] due to take place on 12 December 2019, which will be contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn order to minimise the changes required, the Commission recommended combining Berkshire with Surrey as a sub-region of the South East Region. However, this involved only one ward ([[Windlesham]] in the Borough of Surrey Heath in Surrey) being transferred from the constituency of [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] to the constituency of Windsor. After adjusting for this, the Commission recommended that Berkshire retained eight seats, with no name changes, of which four (Bracknell, Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham) were unchanged. Elsewhere, Reading West would gain a further two [[West Berkshire|District of West Berkshire]] wards ([[Basildon, Berkshire|Basildon]] and [[Bucklebury]]) from Newbury and the [[Reading, Berkshire|Borough of Reading]] ward of [[Battle (Reading ward)|Battle]] would be transferred from Reading West to Reading East.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current constituencies'''\n|'''Electorate'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=The electorate of each region subdivided by both local authorities and each existing constituency|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents (Document type: Electoral data)|date=24 February 2016|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Proposed constituencies'''<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations constituency list (with wards)|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Electorate'''<ref name=\":1\" />\n|-\n|[[Bracknell (UK Parliament constituency)|Bracknell]] CC\n|76,917\n|Bracknell BC\n|76,917\n|-\n|[[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] CC\n|71,834\n|Maidenhead CC\n|71,834\n|-\n|[[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]] CC\n|78,963\n|Newbury CC\n|71,737\n|-\n|[[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]] BC\n|67,846\n|Reading East BC\n|73,626\n|-\n|[[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading West]] CC\n|69,709\n|Reading West CC\n|71,155\n|-\n|[[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]] BC\n|76,668\n|Slough BC\n|76,668\n|-\n|[[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]] CC\n|68,834\n|Windsor CC\n|68,834<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|[[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] CC\n|76,905\n|Wokingham CC\n|76,905\n|-\n|\n|'''587,676'''\n|\n|'''587,676'''\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>Also includes part in Surrey (3,256)\n\n==Results maps==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"80\">\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1983'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1987'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1992'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2001Results.svg|'''1997'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2001Results.svg|'''2001'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|'''2005'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2010'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2015'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2017Results.svg|'''2017'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2017Results.svg|'''2019'''\n</gallery>\n\n===Total Votes by Party===\nThe total number of aggregate votes cast for each political party which fielded candidates in Berkshire in the 2017 general election was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Votes\n!Votes%\n!Seats\n|-\n|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|242,350\n|54.0\n|6\n|-\n|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|74,613\n|32.9\n|2\n|-\n|[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]\n|46,418\n|10.3\n| -\n|-\n|[[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]]\n|7,309\n|1.6\n| -\n|-\n|[[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]\n|3,620\n|0.8\n| -\n|-\n|[[Independent politician|Independents]]\n|1,210\n|0.2\n| -\n|-\n|Apolitical Democrats \n|304\n|0.1\n| -\n|-\n|Gremloids\n|249\n|0.1\n| -\n|-\n|[[Official Monster Raving Loony Party|Monster Raving Loony]]\n|119\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|[[Christian Peoples Alliance]]\n|69\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|The Just Political Party \n|52\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|Give Me Back My Elmo \n|3\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|449,628\n|100.0\n|8\n|}\n\n==Historical representation by party==\n===1885 to 1950===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!''90''\n!1892\n!1895\n!''98''\n!1900\n!''01''\n!''04''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''13''\n!''16''\n!1918\n!''21''\n!''22''\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1929\n!1931\n!1935\n!''42''\n!1945\n|-\n|[[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"4\" |[[Philip Wroughton|Wroughton]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"5\" |[[Archie Kirkman Loyd|A.

The county also included the Parliamentary Boroughs of [[Reading (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading]], [[Wallingford (UK Parliament constituency)|Wallingford]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|New Windsor]] each returning 2 MPs and [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] (which was partly in Oxfordshire) which returned 1 MP (one of only a handful of English Boroughs to do so).\n\n==== 1832-1885 ====\nThe [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832 radically changed the representation of the House of Commons. The County's representation was increased to 3 MPs, whilst that of the Borough of Wallingford was reduced to 1 MP.  Under the [[Representation of the People Act 1867|Reform Act of 1867]], the representation of the Borough of New Windsor was also reduced to 1 MP, at the same time expanding its boundaries to include [[Clewer]] and [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] (the latter being north of the River Thames in [[Buckinghamshire]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/maps/sheet/bc_reports_1868/New_Windsor_1868|title=H.M.S.O. Boundary Commission Report 1868, New Windsor|website=www.visionofbritain.org.uk|access-date=2019-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==== 1885-1918 ====\nUnder the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]], the County was divided into 3 single-member constituencies, namely the Northern or [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] Division, the Southern or [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]] Division and the Eastern or [[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] Division.  The Boroughs of Wallingford and Abingdon were abolished and absorbed into the county Division of Abingdon and Reading had its representation reduced to 1 MP.\n\nThe table shows an approximate representation of the development of constituencies in Berkshire since 1885.

Eton was now included in the [[Wycombe (UK Parliament constituency)|Wycombe]] Division of Buckinghamshire The Municipal Borough of Wokingham itself was added to the Newbury Division and the Parliamentary Borough of Reading was expanded in line with the County Borough, including the absorption of [[Caversham, Reading|Caversham]], to the north of the River Thames, which had previously been part of the [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] Division of Oxfordshire.\n\n==== 1950-1955 ====\nThe [[Representation of the People Act 1948]] increased the county's representation from 4 to 6 MPs.  Reading was split into the two Borough Constituencies of Reading North and Reading South and Wokingham was re-established as a County Constituency, comprising the borough of Wokingham and rural areas to the south and east of Reading, transferred from Newbury, and extending eastwards to include the Rural District of [[Easthampstead Rural District|Easthampstead]] (which incorporated [[Bracknell]]), transferred from Windsor.\n\n==== 1955-1974 ====\nUnder the [[First Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|First Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies]] Reading North and Reading South were recombined, with one ward of the County Borough being included in each of the Newbury and Wokingham constituencies.\n\n==== 1974-1983 ====\nUnder the Second Periodic Review, representation was increased back up to 6 MPs with the recreation of Reading North and Reading South.  The County Borough wards in Newbury and Wokingham were returned whilst Reading South (which was designated as a County Constituency) was extended southwards to include parts of the [[Wokingham Rural District|Rural District of Wokingham]], transferred from the constituency thereof.\n\n==== 1983-1997 ====\nThe Third Review reflected the changes to the county of Berkshire resulting from the [[Local Government Act 1972]] and saw major changes. The bulk of the area comprising the constituency of [[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]] had been moved to [[Oxfordshire]], with the majority of its contents, including [[Wantage (UK Parliament constituency)|Wantage]], [[Wallingford, Oxfordshire|Wallingford]], [[Didcot]] and [[Faringdon]] being included in the new County Constituency of [[Wantage (UK Parliament constituency)|Wantage]]. The town of [[Abingdon-on-Thames]] itself, together with areas to the west of Oxford, was included in the new County Constituency of [[Oxford West and Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Oxford West and Abingdon]]. The small part which was retained in Berkshire was transferred to Newbury.  The county had absorbed the Municipal Borough of Slough and the small Urban District of Eton (which together had formed the Borough Constituency of [[Eton and Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Eton and Slough]]) from Buckinghamshire.  Slough was formed as a new Borough Constituency and Eton was added back to Windsor.\n\nA further County Constituency of [[East Berkshire (UK Parliament constituency)|East Berkshire]] was created, largely comprising the Borough of Bracknell (formerly the Rural District of Easthampstead) but also including the areas comprising the former Rural District of Windsor (including Old Windsor and Sunningdale), transferred from Windsor and Maidenhead, and the parts of the former Rural District of Eton (including Datchet) which had also been transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire and were previously part of the County Constituency of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]].\n\nReading North and Reading South were abolished once again and replaced by the County Constituencies of [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]] and [[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading West]]. Reading East was formed largely from parts of Reading South, together with parts of Reading North, including Caversham.  Reading West was formed largely from parts of Reading North and extended westwards to include parts of Newbury.  North-western parts of Reading South were transferred back to Wokingham.\n\n==== 1997-2010 ====\nThe Fourth Review resulted in a further increase from 7 to 8 MPs with the abolition of Windsor and Maidenhead and the creation of the two separate County Constituencies of [[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] and [[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]].  Maidenhead included Bisham and Cookham and was extended westwards to include northern parts of Wokingham.  Windsor included [[Bray, Berkshire|Bray]], Eton and the Slough ward of Foxborough. It was extended southwards to include parts of East Berkshire ([[Datchet]], [[Old Windsor]], [[Sunningdale]] and [[Ascot, Berkshire|Ascot]]).  East Berkshire was abolished with remaining parts forming the basis of the new County Constituency of Bracknell, which also included the ward of Wokingham Without, transferred from Wokingham, and [[Finchampstead]], transferred from Reading East.\n\nReading East was redesignated as a Borough Constituency, gaining parts to the east of the borough from Wokingham in exchange for areas to the south, including Shinfield.  Wokingham also added two wards from Newbury.  Finally, Reading East gained the borough ward of [[Katesgrove]] from Reading West in exchange for the ward of [[Whitley, Reading|Whitley]].\n\n==== 2010\u2013present ====\n[[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies|Fifth Review]] - Modest changes, including the transfer of Bray from Windsor to Maidenhead, [[Binfield]] from Bracknell to Windsor and the return of Foxborough ward from Windsor to Slough.  Further marginal changes due to revision of local authority wards.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Constituency\n! Pre-2010 boundaries\n! Post-2010 boundaries\n|-\n| 1.

Although the proposals were immediately laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] they were not brought forward by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] for approval. Accordingly, they will '''not''' come into effect for the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 election]] due to take place on 12 December 2019, which will be contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.\n\nUnder the terms of the [[Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011]], the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota. The review was carried out using the official UK electorate figures for 2015 and the electoral quota was set at 74,769, establishing a range of 71,031 to 78,507.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations report|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn order to minimise the changes required, the Commission recommended combining Berkshire with Surrey as a sub-region of the South East Region. However, this involved only one ward ([[Windlesham]] in the Borough of Surrey Heath in Surrey) being transferred from the constituency of [[Surrey Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Surrey Heath]] to the constituency of Windsor. After adjusting for this, the Commission recommended that Berkshire retained eight seats, with no name changes, of which four (Bracknell, Maidenhead, Slough and Wokingham) were unchanged. Elsewhere, Reading West would gain a further two [[West Berkshire|District of West Berkshire]] wards ([[Basildon, Berkshire|Basildon]] and [[Bucklebury]]) from Newbury and the [[Reading, Berkshire|Borough of Reading]] ward of [[Battle (Reading ward)|Battle]] would be transferred from Reading West to Reading East.<ref name=\":0\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|'''Current constituencies'''\n|'''Electorate'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=The electorate of each region subdivided by both local authorities and each existing constituency|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents (Document type: Electoral data)|date=24 February 2016|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Proposed constituencies'''<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|title=Final recommendations constituency list (with wards)|last=Boundary Commission for England, 2018 Review, Associated consultation documents|date=September 2018|access-date=15 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190215215741/https://www.bce2018.org.uk/publications|archive-date=15 February 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|'''Electorate'''<ref name=\":1\" />\n|-\n|[[Bracknell (UK Parliament constituency)|Bracknell]] CC\n|76,917\n|Bracknell BC\n|76,917\n|-\n|[[Maidenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Maidenhead]] CC\n|71,834\n|Maidenhead CC\n|71,834\n|-\n|[[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Newbury]] CC\n|78,963\n|Newbury CC\n|71,737\n|-\n|[[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]] BC\n|67,846\n|Reading East BC\n|73,626\n|-\n|[[Reading West (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading West]] CC\n|69,709\n|Reading West CC\n|71,155\n|-\n|[[Slough (UK Parliament constituency)|Slough]] BC\n|76,668\n|Slough BC\n|76,668\n|-\n|[[Windsor (UK Parliament constituency)|Windsor]] CC\n|68,834\n|Windsor CC\n|68,834<sup>1</sup>\n|-\n|[[Wokingham (UK Parliament constituency)|Wokingham]] CC\n|76,905\n|Wokingham CC\n|76,905\n|-\n|\n|'''587,676'''\n|\n|'''587,676'''\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>Also includes part in Surrey (3,256)\n\n==Results maps==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"80\">\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1983'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1987'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency1992Results.svg|'''1992'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2001Results.svg|'''1997'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2001Results.svg|'''2001'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2005Results.svg|'''2005'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2010'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2010Results.svg|'''2015'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2017Results.svg|'''2017'''\nFile:BerkshireParliamentaryConstituency2017Results.svg|'''2019'''\n</gallery>\n\n===Total Votes by Party===\nThe total number of aggregate votes cast for each political party which fielded candidates in Berkshire in the 2017 general election was as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Party\n!Votes\n!Votes%\n!Seats\n|-\n|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n|242,350\n|54.0\n|6\n|-\n|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|74,613\n|32.9\n|2\n|-\n|[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]\n|46,418\n|10.3\n| -\n|-\n|[[Green Party of England and Wales|Greens]]\n|7,309\n|1.6\n| -\n|-\n|[[UK Independence Party|UKIP]]\n|3,620\n|0.8\n| -\n|-\n|[[Independent politician|Independents]]\n|1,210\n|0.2\n| -\n|-\n|Apolitical Democrats \n|304\n|0.1\n| -\n|-\n|Gremloids\n|249\n|0.1\n| -\n|-\n|[[Official Monster Raving Loony Party|Monster Raving Loony]]\n|119\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|[[Christian Peoples Alliance]]\n|69\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|The Just Political Party \n|52\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|Give Me Back My Elmo \n|3\n|0.0\n| -\n|-\n|'''Total'''\n|449,628\n|100.0\n|8\n|}\n\n==Historical representation by party==\n===1885 to 1950===\n{{legend2|{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n{{legend2|{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}|[[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]|border=1px solid #aaaaaa}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Constituency\n!1885\n!1886\n!''90''\n!1892\n!1895\n!''98''\n!1900\n!''01''\n!''04''\n!1906\n!Jan 1910\n!Dec 1910\n!''13''\n!''16''\n!1918\n!''21''\n!''22''\n!1922\n!1923\n!1924\n!1929\n!1931\n!1935\n!''42''\n!1945\n|-\n|[[Abingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Abingdon]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"4\" |[[Philip Wroughton|Wroughton]]\n| bgcolor=\"{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" colspan=\"5\" |[[Archie Kirkman Loyd|A.

The incident, which occurred just after 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, May 21, 1944, began following an explosion in a staging area for [[Landing Ship, Tank|Landing Ships, Tank (LSTs)]]<!-- This is the proper plural form... --> and other [[amphibious assault ship]]s in West Loch. A fire quickly spread among the ships being prepared for [[Operation Forager]], the invasion of the Japanese-held [[Mariana Islands]]. Over the next 24 hours, six LSTs sank, 163 [[United States Navy|naval personnel]] died, and 396 were injured.\n\nA subsequent [[Naval Board of Inquiry]] never determined the exact cause of the disaster but concluded that the initial explosion was caused when a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar round]] aboard {{USS|LST-353||2}} detonated during an unloading operation because it was either dropped or went off when gasoline vapors ignited. The incident \u2013 together with the [[Port Chicago disaster]] two months later \u2013 led to major changes in weapons-handling practices within the United States Navy.\n\nThe LST wreckage was quickly cleared in a salvage operation and dumped at sea {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} south of Hawaii.<!--the island, or should this say Oahu?--> Only the hull of the partially beached {{USS|LST-480||2}} was left in West Loch. A press blackout was enforced and naval personnel were ordered not to talk about the incident. The disaster was classified until 1960 and is therefore not well known.\n\nThe disaster has been the focus of considerable speculation that during the salvage and removal of the wrecks from West Loch, the U.S. Navy might have found the remains of a Japanese [[midget submarine]], possibly the fifth Japanese midget submarine used in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack in December 1941]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:PearlHarbor Sm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pearl Harbor]] naval base. The West Loch is the arm of Pearl Harbor on the left side of the image.]]\nIn May 1944, the West Loch area of [[Pearl Harbor]] was unusually crowded with various vessels as it was being used as a staging area for the upcoming [[Operation Forager]]. Twenty-nine [[Landing Ship, Tank|Landing Ships, Tank]]<!-- This is the proper plural form... --> (LSTs) were tied up, beam to beam, at six Tare piers.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> Many of the LSTs, in addition to carrying their own complement of munitions and fuel, were also fully loaded with the munitions, fuel, vehicles, equipment, and other general stores required by the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]]s for the invasion of the Marianas, that was to begin in mid-June. To aid quick deployment once ashore, [[Octane rating|high-octane gasoline]] was stored in barrels on deck.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the incident, the vessels and crews had all been training for the upcoming invasion. The LSTs were each crewed by around 120 Navy sailors or Coast Guardsmen, and manned by around 200 Marine loaders, drivers and mechanics.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The rapid expansion of the fleet meant many of the crews were made up of inexperienced sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. On 21 May, many of the LSTs had only half their crew aboard because, after a week of intensive training, most officers and ratings had been given shore leave.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:LST-39 (ship).jpg|thumb|right| The burned hulk of '''LST-39''' on 21 May 1944.]]\n[[File:LST-480 following West Loch disaster.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|LST-480||2}} on 22 May 1944.]]\n[[File:USS LST-480 fire2.jpg|thumb|right|''LST-480'' burns again on 23 May 1944. The sunken {{USS|LST-353||2}} where the disaster originated lies off her starboard bow]]\nAt 15:08, {{USS|LST-353||2}}, moored at Tare 8, exploded, sending a large fireball into the sky.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The noise was heard miles away at Pearl Harbor Headquarters. More explosions of increasing intensity followed, sparking fears of a Japanese attack or even an earthquake. Fire and debris raining down on the fuel and munitions stored on the decks of other LSTs had caused an explosive chain reaction.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= AP19May2009/> Within minutes, 200 men had been blown into the water. Eleven wooden buildings on the shore were destroyed and vehicles blown on their side.<ref name=Oliver2005/> In all, 20 buildings were damaged.<ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/>\n\nInitial efforts by the crews to fight the fires were impeded by the heat, although some ships further away managed to muster damage control parties. Many of the LSTs tied together at Tare 8 began to sink. Within the hour, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]] was directing fire-fighting efforts from a launch.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nVarious LSTs managed to move to safety under their own power or with assistance by [[tugboat]]s. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, spreading fires, before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also spread fires to Tares 7 and 9 even though they had been unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the spreading fires. One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from a collision course with an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot.<ref name= AP19May2009/>\n\nA final explosion occurred at 22:30;<ref name=Oliver2005/> while several LSTs continued to burn for 24 hours.<ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> In total, the harbor tugs {{USS|Osceola|YTB-129|2}}, {{ship||Hoga|YT-146|2}}, and {{USS|Geronimo|YTM-119|2}}, the net tender {{USS|Tamaha|YNT-12|2}}, the chartered tug ''Mikioi'', and smaller tugs ''YTL-233'', ''YTL-306'', ''YTL-307'', ''YTL-308'', ''YTL-309'', and ''YTL-339'' were damaged while engaged in fire control efforts.<ref name=\"cressman\"/>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe initial official account listed 27 dead and 100 missing.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> The majority of sources state the final death toll as 163 men, with a further 396 wounded.<ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/><ref name=AP19May2009/><ref name=AP22May2009/> However, in 2005 the magazine, ''Sea Classics'', claimed the total dead was 392, of which 163 were sailors. The other 229 were Marines from the newly formed [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]]s, while Army dead were not recorded in the confusion.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Pearl Harbor attack survivor and historical researcher, Ray Emory, also disputes the official death toll; he believes 132 men died at West Loch.<ref name=AP22May2009/>\n\n==Investigation==\nA [[Naval Board of Inquiry]], under [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[John F. Shafroth Jr.]], was opened in Pearl Harbor the following day.<ref name=Oliver2005/> An early theory that the incident was the result of a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese submarine attack]] was dismissed as impractical because of the depth of the West Loch and the presence of anti-submarine nets.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nThe [[Executive officer#United States|executive officer]] of ''LST-353'' stated that immediately prior to the explosion, [[United States Army|Army]] [[stevedore]]s were unloading mortar ammunition from a [[Landing craft tank|Landing craft tank (LCT)]] on the deck of his ship. The procedure to remove the {{convert|4.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} mortar rounds was being undertaken because training had proved [[M2 4.2 inch mortar|M2 mortar]]s could not be fired accurately from LCTs.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=AP19May2009/> The enquiry was told the unit given the order to unload the mortar rounds had received no training for the task.<ref name=AP22May2009/> Meanwhile, 80 drums of fuel were stacked just {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the elevator being used to unload the LCT.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nFollowing testimony, the Naval Enquiry Board concluded that a mortar round exploded on ''LST-353'' sparking a chain reaction. However it could not determine the actual cause of the detonation because all those nearest to the explosion were killed.<ref name=AP19May2009/> This conclusion was sustained by subsequent reviews. The two most plausible explanations were considered to be:\n#the accidental dropping of a mortar round being unloaded from the LCT on the ''LST-353''\n#the ignition of gasoline vapors from high-octane fuel drums stored on the deck of ''LST-353''.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The source being a cigarette (although banned) or [[welding]], which had also been occurring that day aboard ''LST-353''.<ref name=AP19May2009/>\n\nThe enquiry also heard the conduct of the inexperienced crews may have exacerbated the disaster. [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Joseph B. Hoyt, [[USNR]], the Commander of LST Group 39, Flotilla 13, criticized many of the LST crews for abandoning their vessels too early, leaving them to sink or drift, rather than fire-fighting or attempting to beach them. However he praised the efforts of the crew from ''LST-274'', which received heavy damage but was saved.\nSeveral crews and skippers were called to account for inadequate reactions to the emergency, although the severity of the conditions were cited as mitigating factors.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nIn the end no [[Court-martial|courts-martial]] or [[Letter of reprimand|letters of reprimand]] were issued to anyone involved. The practice of loading fuel and munitions aboard closely moored vessels was deemed to be necessary under the conditions of war and the layout of Pearl Harbor U.S. Navy Base. A recommendation by the Board to avoid nesting in future was criticized by Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] as impractical.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/>\n\n==Reporting==\nThe [[United States military]] ordered a [[press blackout]] following the incident. The official inquiry was marked Top Secret and survivors and eyewitnesses were not permitted to mention the incident in letters home.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> Four days after the incident, the authorities released a one-paragraph statement noting an explosion had caused \"some loss of life, a number of injuries and resulted in the destruction of several small vessels\". It was only after Operation Forager that a fuller account was released to the press.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> The entire incident was not declassified and made public until 1960.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nAs a result of the secrecy surrounding the incident, it has been asserted that the public knows little about Pearl Harbor's \"second disaster\".<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/><ref name= AP22May2009/> As of 1997, the only book about the incident, ''The West Loch Story'', was privately published by survivor, William L.C. Johnson. He alleges that a full account had not emerged from the Navy until 1964, and that the incident had been caused by careless smoking.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/>\n\n==Impact on Operation Forager==\nSix LSTs were sunk<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> (''LST-39'', ''LST-43'', ''LST-69'', ''LST-179'', ''LST-353'', and ''LST-480''),<ref name=\"cressman\"/> two already carrying smaller, fully loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s (''LCT-961'', 963 and 983)<ref name=\"cressman\"/> lashed to their decks.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Several LSTs were damaged and/or ran aground. Four (including LST-205 and LST-225)<ref name=\"cressman\"/> could not be repaired in time for the invasion.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Seventeen tracked landing vehicles (LVT) and eight {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns were destroyed.<ref name=\"cressman\"/> Other sources place the total number of destroyed LSTs at nine.<ref name=AP19May2009/> With reinforcement of the fleet from elsewhere, and through quick repair efforts, Operation Forager was only delayed by one day as a result of the incident, with the operation commencing essentially as planned three weeks later.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\n==Medal of Honor==\nBoatswain's Mate 2nd Class [[Francis P. Hammerberg]], a Navy diver, posthumously received the [[Medal of Honor]] for heroism on February 17, 1945, during salvage operations on an LST sunk in the West Loch incident.  He was killed in a cave-in while attempting to tunnel under one of the sunken LSTs.  He was the only service member in World War II, and the last person of all, to receive the Medal of Honor for a non-combat action.  (Prior to World War II, the Navy had frequently awarded the Medal of Honor for non-combat heroism.)\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:US Navy 030521-N-8157C-040 59 years after explosions rang out in Pearl Harbor^rsquo,s West Loch, a memorial of disaster reminds all of a quiet Sunday afternoon on May 21, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|The rusting remains of {{USS|LST-480||2}} at  {{coord|21|21|26.04|N|157|59|50.05|W|scale:10000|display=inline}}.]]\n\nIn the weeks following the disaster, all wreckage was salvaged and removed, with the exception of {{USS|LST-480||2}} (sometimes reported as ''LST-353''<ref name=AP19May2009/>). Its rusting bow was left where it was beached during the disaster.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/><ref name= AP22May2009/> In April 1995, the first memorial to the disaster was unveiled: a table-sized plaque sited on the shore of the loch.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> At the behest of [[United States Congress|Congress]], gravestones of unidentified victims in the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] were amended in the 2000s (decade) from recording simply \"unknown\", to \"Unknown, West Loch Disaster, May 21, 1944\".<ref name=AP19May2009/> The Navy commemorated the 65th anniversary of the disaster on 21 May 2009.<ref name=AP19May2009/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAs a result of the incident, and the [[Port Chicago disaster]] two months later, the Navy drastically changed its ordnance-handling procedures. It insisted on full training for handlers, munitions to be redesigned for safer handling, and that vessels should no longer be nested together when ammunition was being loaded or handled.<ref name=AP22May2009/>\n\nIt is also possible that the salvage operation undertaken to clear the loch after the disaster inadvertently lengthened the hunt for the \"fifth midget submarine\" involved in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. After three pieces of a midget submarine were discovered three miles south of Pearl Harbor, a working theory was developed that this was the only submarine in a group of five Japanese [[Ko-hyoteki class submarine]]s involved in the attack that had not yet been accounted for. Researchers posited that it had penetrated the harbor to attack [[Battleship Row]], before escaping into West Loch and being scuttled by the two-man crew. Lying on the bed of the loch, it was then salvaged along with the remains of the LSTs, LCTs and landing tanks, and then dumped at sea.<ref name=LATimes7Dec2009/><ref name=NovaTranscript/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Explosions|List of accidents and disasters by death toll, explosions]]\n*[[List of accidents and incidents involving transport or storage of ammunition]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"cressman\">{{cite book|title=The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II|author=Cressman, Robert J.|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=1-55750-149-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheOfficialChronologyOfTheUSNavyInWorldWarII/page/229 229]|url=https://archive.org/details/TheOfficialChronologyOfTheUSNavyInWorldWarII/page/229}}</ref><ref name=NovaTranscript>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3701_killersubs.html \n |title=Killer Subs in Pearl Harbour \n |publisher=PBS \n |work=Transcript, Nova \n |date=5 January 2010 \n |accessdate=12 April 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owWRjeJv?url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3701_killersubs.html \n |archivedate=12 April 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref><ref name=LATimes7Dec2009>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-sci-minisub7-2009dec07,0,6991792.story |title=Pearl Harbor mini-submarine mystery solved? |publisher=LA Times |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owWR6r8n?url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-sci-minisub7-2009dec07%2C0%2C6991792.story |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=Oliver2005>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200511/ai_n16059243/|title=Navy's hushed up tragedy at West Loch|publisher=Challenge Publications|work=Sea Classics magazine|author=Oliver, A Alan|date=November 2005|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/scrs/scrs2z.htm |title=West Loch disaster |work=Submerged Cultural Resources Study:USS Arizona and Pearl Harbor National Historic Landmark, Chapter II: Historical Record |publisher=US National Park Service |date=27 April 2001 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owIMj68d?url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/scrs/scrs2z.htm |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=AP19May2009>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wirestory?id=7621375&page=1 |title=Navy Recalls Bravery at WWII's West Loch Disaster |publisher=ABC News / Associated Press |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owIsa8VQ?url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wirestory?id=7621375 |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=AP22May2009>{{cite news|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/05/ap_west_loch_disaster_052109/ |title=Deadly 1944 Pearl Harbor disaster remembered |publisher=Army Times / Associated Press |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owRwkfl9?url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/05/ap_west_loch_disaster_052109/ |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997>{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970521&slug=2540393 |title=Second Tragedy at Pearl Harbor Is Little-Known |publisher=Dallas Morning News |date=21 May 1997 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owLF9bbi?url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970521 |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1944]]\n[[Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in May 1944]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Navy in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:History of Oahu]]\n[[Category:Ship fires]]\n[[Category:Non-combat internal explosions on warships]]\n[[Category:1944 in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Transportation disasters in Hawaii]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n|conflict= West Loch disaster\n|image=USS LST-480 3.jpg\n|image_size=300px\n|caption= {{USS|LST-39||2}} and {{USS|LST-480||2}} still ablaze on 22 May 1944.\n|date=21 May 1944\n|place=West Loch, [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor U.S. Naval Base]], Hawaii\n|casus=\n|result=163 killed<br/>396 injured\n}}\nThe '''West Loch Disaster''' was a maritime accident during [[World War II]] at [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor U.S. Naval Base]] in Hawaii.

Over the next 24 hours, six LSTs sank, 163 [[United States Navy|naval personnel]] died, and 396 were injured.\n\nA subsequent [[Naval Board of Inquiry]] never determined the exact cause of the disaster but concluded that the initial explosion was caused when a [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar round]] aboard {{USS|LST-353||2}} detonated during an unloading operation because it was either dropped or went off when gasoline vapors ignited. The incident \u2013 together with the [[Port Chicago disaster]] two months later \u2013 led to major changes in weapons-handling practices within the United States Navy.\n\nThe LST wreckage was quickly cleared in a salvage operation and dumped at sea {{convert|3|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} south of Hawaii.<!--the island, or should this say Oahu?--> Only the hull of the partially beached {{USS|LST-480||2}} was left in West Loch. A press blackout was enforced and naval personnel were ordered not to talk about the incident. The disaster was classified until 1960 and is therefore not well known.\n\nThe disaster has been the focus of considerable speculation that during the salvage and removal of the wrecks from West Loch, the U.S. Navy found might have found the remains of a Japanese [[midget submarine]], possibly the fifth Japanese midget submarine used in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attack in December 1941]].\n\n==Background==\n[[File:PearlHarbor Sm.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pearl Harbor]] naval base. The West Loch is the arm of Pearl Harbor on the left side of the image.]]\nIn May 1944, the West Loch area of [[Pearl Harbor]] was unusually crowded with various vessels as it was being used as a staging area for the upcoming [[Operation Forager]]. Twenty-nine [[Landing Ship, Tank|Landing Ships, Tank]]<!-- This is the proper plural form... --> (LSTs) were tied up, beam to beam, at six Tare piers.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> Many of the LSTs, in addition to carrying their own complement of munitions and fuel, were also fully loaded with the munitions, fuel, vehicles, equipment, and other general stores required by the [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]]s for the invasion of the Marianas, that was to begin in mid-June. To aid quick deployment once ashore, [[Octane rating|high-octane gasoline]] was stored in barrels on deck.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the incident, the vessels and crews had all been training for the upcoming invasion. The LSTs were each crewed by around 120 Navy sailors or Coast Guardsmen, and manned by around 200 Marine loaders, drivers and mechanics.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The rapid expansion of the fleet meant many of the crews were made up of inexperienced sailors and [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. On 21 May, many of the LSTs had only half their crew aboard because, after a week of intensive training, most officers and ratings had been given shore leave.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\n==Explosion==\n[[File:LST-39 (ship).jpg|thumb|right| The burned hulk of '''LST-39''' on 21 May 1944.]]\n[[File:LST-480 following West Loch disaster.jpg|thumb|right|{{USS|LST-480||2}} on 22 May 1944.]]\n[[File:USS LST-480 fire2.jpg|thumb|right|''LST-480'' burns again on 23 May 1944. The sunken {{USS|LST-353||2}} where the disaster originated lies off her starboard bow]]\nAt 15:08, {{USS|LST-353||2}}, moored at Tare 8, exploded, sending a large fireball into the sky.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The noise was heard miles away at Pearl Harbor Headquarters. More explosions of increasing intensity followed, sparking fears of a Japanese attack or even an earthquake. Fire and debris raining down on the fuel and munitions stored on the decks of other LSTs had caused an explosive chain reaction.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name= AP19May2009/> Within minutes, 200 men had been blown into the water. Eleven wooden buildings on the shore were destroyed and vehicles blown on their side.<ref name=Oliver2005/> In all, 20 buildings were damaged.<ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/>\n\nInitial efforts by the crews to fight the fires were impeded by the heat, although some ships further away managed to muster damage control parties. Many of the LSTs tied together at Tare 8 began to sink. Within the hour, [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Richmond K. Turner]] was directing fire-fighting efforts from a launch.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nVarious LSTs managed to move to safety under their own power or with assistance by [[tugboat]]s. However others were abandoned and allowed to drift, spreading fires, before sinking in the channel. Leaking oil ignited on the water also spread fires to Tares 7 and 9 even though they had been unharmed after the first explosions at Tare 8.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Eventually tugboats and foam-carrying salvage ships from Pearl Harbor arrived to fight the spreading fires. One ship managed to turn a drifting LST away from a collision course with an ammunition ship docked across the loch at the ammunition depot.<ref name= AP19May2009/>\n\nA final explosion occurred at 22:30;<ref name=Oliver2005/> while several LSTs continued to burn for 24 hours.<ref name= USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> In total, the harbor tugs {{USS|Osceola|YTB-129|2}}, {{ship||Hoga|YT-146|2}}, and {{USS|Geronimo|YTM-119|2}}, the net tender {{USS|Tamaha|YNT-12|2}}, the chartered tug ''Mikioi'', and smaller tugs ''YTL-233'', ''YTL-306'', ''YTL-307'', ''YTL-308'', ''YTL-309'', and ''YTL-339'' were damaged while engaged in fire control efforts.<ref name=\"cressman\"/>\n\n==Casualties==\nThe initial official account listed 27 dead and 100 missing.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> The majority of sources state the final death toll as 163 men, with a further 396 wounded.<ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/><ref name=AP19May2009/><ref name=AP22May2009/> However, in 2005 the magazine, ''Sea Classics'', claimed the total dead was 392, of which 163 were sailors. The other 229 were Marines from the newly formed [[2nd Marine Division (United States)|2nd]] and [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th Marine Division]]s, while Army dead were not recorded in the confusion.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Pearl Harbor attack survivor and historical researcher, Ray Emory, also disputes the official death toll; he believes 132 men died at West Loch.<ref name=AP22May2009/>\n\n==Investigation==\nA [[Naval Board of Inquiry]], under [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[John F. Shafroth Jr.]], was opened in Pearl Harbor the following day.<ref name=Oliver2005/> An early theory that the incident was the result of a [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese submarine attack]] was dismissed as impractical because of the depth of the West Loch and the presence of anti-submarine nets.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nThe [[Executive officer#United States|executive officer]] of ''LST-353'' stated that immediately prior to the explosion, [[United States Army|Army]] [[stevedore]]s were unloading mortar ammunition from a [[Landing craft tank|Landing craft tank (LCT)]] on the deck of his ship. The procedure to remove the {{convert|4.2|in|mm|abbr=on}} mortar rounds was being undertaken because training had proved [[M2 4.2 inch mortar|M2 mortar]]s could not be fired accurately from LCTs.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=AP19May2009/> The enquiry was told the unit given the order to unload the mortar rounds had received no training for the task.<ref name=AP22May2009/> Meanwhile, 80 drums of fuel were stacked just {{convert|15|ft|m|abbr=on}} from the elevator being used to unload the LCT.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nFollowing testimony, the Naval Enquiry Board concluded that a mortar round exploded on ''LST-353'' sparking a chain reaction. However it could not determine the actual cause of the detonation because all those nearest to the explosion were killed.<ref name=AP19May2009/> This conclusion was sustained by subsequent reviews. The two most plausible explanations were considered to be:\n#the accidental dropping of a mortar round being unloaded from the LCT on the ''LST-353''\n#the ignition of gasoline vapors from high-octane fuel drums stored on the deck of ''LST-353''.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> The source being a cigarette (although banned) or [[welding]], which had also been occurring that day aboard ''LST-353''.<ref name=AP19May2009/>\n\nThe enquiry also heard the conduct of the inexperienced crews may have exacerbated the disaster. [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] Joseph B. Hoyt, [[USNR]], the Commander of LST Group 39, Flotilla 13, criticized many of the LST crews for abandoning their vessels too early, leaving them to sink or drift, rather than fire-fighting or attempting to beach them. However he praised the efforts of the crew from ''LST-274'', which received heavy damage but was saved.\nSeveral crews and skippers were called to account for inadequate reactions to the emergency, although the severity of the conditions were cited as mitigating factors.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nIn the end no [[Court-martial|courts-martial]] or [[Letter of reprimand|letters of reprimand]] were issued to anyone involved. The practice of loading fuel and munitions aboard closely moored vessels was deemed to be necessary under the conditions of war and the layout of Pearl Harbor U.S. Navy Base. A recommendation by the Board to avoid nesting in future was criticized by Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] as impractical.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/>\n\n==Reporting==\nThe [[United States military]] ordered a [[press blackout]] following the incident. The official inquiry was marked Top Secret and survivors and eyewitnesses were not permitted to mention the incident in letters home.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> Four days after the incident, the authorities released a one-paragraph statement noting an explosion had caused \"some loss of life, a number of injuries and resulted in the destruction of several small vessels\". It was only after Operation Forager that a fuller account was released to the press.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> The entire incident was not declassified and made public until 1960.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\nAs a result of the secrecy surrounding the incident, it has been asserted that the public knows little about Pearl Harbor's \"second disaster\".<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/><ref name= AP22May2009/> As of 1997, the only book about the incident, ''The West Loch Story'', was privately published by survivor, William L.C. Johnson. He alleges that a full account had not emerged from the Navy until 1964, and that the incident had been caused by careless smoking.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/>\n\n==Impact on Operation Forager==\nSix LSTs were sunk<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/> (''LST-39'', ''LST-43'', ''LST-69'', ''LST-179'', ''LST-353'', and ''LST-480''),<ref name=\"cressman\"/> two already carrying smaller, fully loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s (''LCT-961'', 963 and 983)<ref name=\"cressman\"/> lashed to their decks.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Several LSTs were damaged and/or ran aground. Four (including LST-205 and LST-225)<ref name=\"cressman\"/> could not be repaired in time for the invasion.<ref name=Oliver2005/> Seventeen tracked landing vehicles (LVT) and eight {{convert|155|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} guns were destroyed.<ref name=\"cressman\"/> Other sources place the total number of destroyed LSTs at nine.<ref name=AP19May2009/> With reinforcement of the fleet from elsewhere, and through quick repair efforts, Operation Forager was only delayed by one day as a result of the incident, with the operation commencing essentially as planned three weeks later.<ref name=Oliver2005/>\n\n==Medal of Honor==\nBoatswain's Mate 2nd Class [[Francis P. Hammerberg]], a Navy diver, posthumously received the [[Medal of Honor]] for heroism on February 17, 1945, during salvage operations on an LST sunk in the West Loch incident.  He was killed in a cave-in while attempting to tunnel under one of the sunken LSTs.  He was the only service member in World War II, and the last person of all, to receive the Medal of Honor for a non-combat action.  (Prior to World War II, the Navy had frequently awarded the Medal of Honor for non-combat heroism.)\n\n==Memorials==\n[[File:US Navy 030521-N-8157C-040 59 years after explosions rang out in Pearl Harbor^rsquo,s West Loch, a memorial of disaster reminds all of a quiet Sunday afternoon on May 21, 1944.jpg|thumb|right|The rusting remains of {{USS|LST-480||2}} at  {{coord|21|21|26.04|N|157|59|50.05|W|scale:10000|display=inline}}.]]\n\nIn the weeks following the disaster, all wreckage was salvaged and removed, with the exception of {{USS|LST-480||2}} (sometimes reported as ''LST-353''<ref name=AP19May2009/>). Its rusting bow was left where it was beached during the disaster.<ref name=Oliver2005/><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001/><ref name= AP22May2009/> In April 1995, the first memorial to the disaster was unveiled: a table-sized plaque sited on the shore of the loch.<ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997/> At the behest of [[United States Congress|Congress]], gravestones of unidentified victims in the [[National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific]] were amended in the 2000s (decade) from recording simply \"unknown\", to \"Unknown, West Loch Disaster, May 21, 1944\".<ref name=AP19May2009/> The Navy commemorated the 65th anniversary of the disaster on 21 May 2009.<ref name=AP19May2009/>\n\n==Legacy==\nAs a result of the incident, and the [[Port Chicago disaster]] two months later, the Navy drastically changed its ordnance-handling procedures. It insisted on full training for handlers, munitions to be redesigned for safer handling, and that vessels should no longer be nested together when ammunition was being loaded or handled.<ref name=AP22May2009/>\n\nIt is also possible that the salvage operation undertaken to clear the loch after the disaster inadvertently lengthened the hunt for the \"fifth midget submarine\" involved in the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. After three pieces of a midget submarine were discovered three miles south of Pearl Harbor, a working theory was developed that this was the only submarine in a group of five Japanese [[Ko-hyoteki class submarine]]s involved in the attack that had not yet been accounted for. Researchers posited that it had penetrated the harbor to attack [[Battleship Row]], before escaping into West Loch and being scuttled by the two-man crew. Lying on the bed of the loch, it was then salvaged along with the remains of the LSTs, LCTs and landing tanks, and then dumped at sea.<ref name=LATimes7Dec2009/><ref name=NovaTranscript/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of accidents and disasters by death toll#Explosions|List of accidents and disasters by death toll, explosions]]\n*[[List of accidents and incidents involving transport or storage of ammunition]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"cressman\">{{cite book|title=The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II|author=Cressman, Robert J.|publisher=Naval Institute Press|year=2000|isbn=1-55750-149-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/TheOfficialChronologyOfTheUSNavyInWorldWarII/page/229 229]|url=https://archive.org/details/TheOfficialChronologyOfTheUSNavyInWorldWarII/page/229}}</ref><ref name=NovaTranscript>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3701_killersubs.html \n |title=Killer Subs in Pearl Harbour \n |publisher=PBS \n |work=Transcript, Nova \n |date=5 January 2010 \n |accessdate=12 April 2010 \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owWRjeJv?url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3701_killersubs.html \n |archivedate=12 April 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref><ref name=LATimes7Dec2009>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-sci-minisub7-2009dec07,0,6991792.story |title=Pearl Harbor mini-submarine mystery solved? |publisher=LA Times |date=7 December 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owWR6r8n?url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-sci-minisub7-2009dec07%2C0%2C6991792.story |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=Oliver2005>{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4442/is_200511/ai_n16059243/|title=Navy's hushed up tragedy at West Loch|publisher=Challenge Publications|work=Sea Classics magazine|author=Oliver, A Alan|date=November 2005|accessdate=12 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=USNationalParksService27Apr2001>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/scrs/scrs2z.htm |title=West Loch disaster |work=Submerged Cultural Resources Study:USS Arizona and Pearl Harbor National Historic Landmark, Chapter II: Historical Record |publisher=US National Park Service |date=27 April 2001 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owIMj68d?url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/usar/scrs/scrs2z.htm |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=AP19May2009>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wirestory?id=7621375&page=1 |title=Navy Recalls Bravery at WWII's West Loch Disaster |publisher=ABC News / Associated Press |date=19 May 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owIsa8VQ?url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wirestory?id=7621375 |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=AP22May2009>{{cite news|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/05/ap_west_loch_disaster_052109/ |title=Deadly 1944 Pearl Harbor disaster remembered |publisher=Army Times / Associated Press |date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owRwkfl9?url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/05/ap_west_loch_disaster_052109/ |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=DallasMorningNews21May1997>{{cite news|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970521&slug=2540393 |title=Second Tragedy at Pearl Harbor Is Little-Known |publisher=Dallas Morning News |date=21 May 1997 |accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5owLF9bbi?url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970521 |archivedate=12 April 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}\n\n[[Category:Explosions in 1944]]\n[[Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Disasters in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in May 1944]]\n[[Category:Maritime incidents in the United States]]\n[[Category:United States Navy in the 20th century]]\n[[Category:History of Oahu]]\n[[Category:Ship fires]]\n[[Category:Non-combat internal explosions on warships]]\n[[Category:1944 in Hawaii]]\n[[Category:Transportation disasters in Hawaii]]\n", "name_user": "DulcetTone", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixing bad edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Loch_disaster"}
