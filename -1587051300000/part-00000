The recorded history of [[Ohio]] began in the late 17th century when [[French people|French]] explorers from [[Canada]] reached the [[Ohio River]], from which the \"[[Ohio Country]]\" took its name, a river the [[Iroquois]] called ''O-y-o'', \"great river\". Before that, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] speaking [[Algonquin language]]s had inhabited Ohio and the central [[midwestern United States]] for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \"[[Native American peoples|Indians]]\", including the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] \"mound builders\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the [[Bering land bridge]] about 14,500BCE - see [[Prehistory of Ohio]].\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes in present-day Ohio in the [[fur trade]]. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the [[Ohio Country]] came after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British territory. Congress prohibited [[slavery]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as ''free'' states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian Wars]] brought peace to the Ohio frontier.  In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from [[New England]], New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \"[[Western reserve]]\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, [[public education]], and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], although antiwar [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] sentiment was strong in southern settlements.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the [[Great Lakes]] to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Deep South, to escape [[Jim Crow]] and violence.\n\nThe cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in [[steel]], railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as [[heavy industry]] declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education.\n\n==Prehistoric period==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Serpent mound 8438.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Serpent Mound]] earthwork in [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams County]]]]\n[[File:Sunwatch Aerial illustration HRoe 2018 400px.jpg|thumb|Artists conception of the [[Fort Ancient]] period [[SunWatch Indian Village]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]]]\n\n{{main|Prehistory of Ohio}}\nA fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including [[Jefferson's ground sloth]], using stone tools.<ref name=cmnh>{{cite web|publisher=[[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]|url=http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|date=February 2012|access-date=April 12, 2012|title=Research reveals first evidence of hunting by prehistoric Ohioans|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202224/http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|archivedate=May 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic peoples]]. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Fort Ancient]], built monumental [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present.\n\nThe Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the [[Maple Creek Culture]] of southwestern Ohio, the [[Glacial Kame Culture]] of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]], provided [[flint]], an extremely important raw material and trade good.

The Adenas were [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the [[Hopewell culture]] (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as [[astronomical]] observatories and places of ritual celebration. The [[Fort Ancient culture]] also built mounds, including some [[effigy mounds]]. Researchers first considered the [[Serpent Mound]] in [[Adams County, Ohio]] to be an Adena mound. It is the largest [[effigy mound]] in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres.

When the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the [[Beaver Wars]], destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the [[Tennessee]] region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] along the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West Virginia lands as hunting grounds.

The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[fur trader]]s coming up the [[Hudson River]] in about 1626.

The Native American tribes were competing for hunting grounds for the fur trade. The western tribes had also been weakened by [[epidemics]] of European [[infectious diseases]], against which they had no acquired [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America.\n\nAbout 1664, the Five Nations became trading partners with the [[Kingdom of England|British]], who conquered the [[New Netherland]]s (renamed [[New York (state)|New York]]) from the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]].\n\nThe Five Nations enlarged their territory by [[right of conquest]]. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large [[Confederation|confederacies]] were destroyed or relocated, including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] and [[Shawnee]]. The Five Nations pushed several other eastern tribes to and even across the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Ohio country]] was virtually emptied, as the defeated tribes fled west to escape the Five Nations warriors. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated, they left much of the [[Northwest territory]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]] almost unpopulated and with abandoned villages. They had claimed the entire Ohio Valley as their own country.\n\nAfter about 1700, some remnants of the Native American tribes began returning to the Northwest Territory. They were often [[conglomerations]] of several tribes who paid tribute to the Five Nations (see also [[Mingo]]).<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_44.html ''The Jesuit Relations... 1610-1791''], Creighton University, accessed January 20, 2009</ref>\n\n==European colonization==\n{{Main|Ohio Country}}\n\n===New France===\n[[File:Wpdms ohio country.png|thumb|left|A map of the original [[Ohio Country]].]]\nIn the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as [[Ohio Country]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_YbBqcACm48C&dq The Ohio Country], p. 1.</ref> In 1663, it became part of [[New France]], a royal province of [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], and northeastern Ohio was further explored by [[Robert La Salle]] in 1669.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-uLUVJtHKkC&dq|title=Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754\u20131763|first=Donald I.|last=Stoetzel|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Heritage Books|page=371|access-date=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the [[fur trade]] in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day [[Canada]] and what they called the [[Illinois Country]] along the [[Mississippi River]].

From the east, the [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Shawnee]] arrived, and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] from the north. The [[Miami tribe|Miami]] lived in what is now western Ohio. The [[Mingo]] formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes.\n\n[[Christopher Gist]] was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as [[George Croghan]] started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the [[Miami]] Indian town of ''Pickawillany'' (modern [[Piqua, Ohio]]). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753.\n\n====French and Indian War====\nBy the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mum6vMM5YwC&dq The great frontier war: Britain, France, and the imperial struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755], p. 177</ref> They had occupied a trading post called [[Fort Loramie|Loramie's Fort]], which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the [[Ohio Company]] to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the [[French and Indian War]]. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]] to [[Louis Coulon de Villiers]] in 1754, and the subsequent [[Battle of the Monongahela]] to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755.\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to [[First British Empire|Great Britain]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes.\n\n===British Empire===\nPrior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.<ref>The last French Fort in Ohio Country, Fort Sandusky, was destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion.</ref> Just beyond Ohio Country was the great [[Miami Tribe|Miami]] capital of [[Kekionga]] which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future [[Northwest Territory]]. By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], British lands west of [[Appalachia]] were forbidden to settlement by colonists.  The [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought [[Lord Dunmore's War]] to a conclusion.

For example, the Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]] and the Delaware leader ''[[Buckongahelas]]'' sided with the British.

Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry.

Most traveled to Ohio by [[wagon]] and [[stagecoach]], following former Indian paths such as the [[Northern Trace]]. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the [[Mohawk River]] across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west.\n\nAmerican settlement of the [[Northwest Territory]] was resisted by Native Americans in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. The natives were eventually conquered by General [[Anthony Wayne]] at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794.

Migrants to the latter came chiefly from [[Virginia]] and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them.\n\nAs Northeastern states abolished [[slavery]] in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The [[Northwest Territory]] originally included areas previously called [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, [[Indiana Territory]] was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of [[Michigan]]'s lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \"The Gore\".\n\n===Statehood===\n[[File:Land patent-ohio-logan-co-1834-henry-hanford.gif|thumb|300px|Land patent.

The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention.

Seeing the need to replace steel-rimmed carriage tires with rubber, [[Harvey Firestone]] started [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company]] and began selling to [[Henry Ford]]. The Ohio Automobile Company eventually became known as [[Packard]], while [[Benjamin Goodrich]] entered the rubber industry in 1870 in Akron, founding Goodrich, Tew & Company, better known as the [[Goodrich Corporation]] in the present era.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Ohio had become a global industrial center.<ref name=OTH>[https://books.google.com/books?id=tC9d4JVvefIC&dq Ohio: the history of a people], p. 180</ref> Natural resources contributed to the industrial growth, including salt, iron ore, timber, limestone, coal, and natural gas, and the discovery of oil in northwestern Ohio led to the growth of the port of Toledo.<ref name=OTH /> By 1908, the state had 9,581 miles of railroad linking coal mines, oil fields, and industries with the world.<ref name=OTH /> Commercial enterprise began to prosper around towns with banks.<ref name=OTH />\n\n===Innovation===\n[[William Procter (candlemaker)|William Procter]] and [[James Gamble (industrialist)|James Gamble]] started a company which produced a high quality, inexpensive soap called Ivory, which is still the best known product today of [[Procter and Gamble]].

By the late 1810s, the [[National Road]] crossed the [[Appalachian Mountains]], connecting Ohio with the east coast. The [[Ohio River]] aided the agricultural economy by allowing farmers to move their goods by water to the southern states and the port of [[New Orleans]]. The construction of the [[Erie Canal]] in the 1820s allowed Ohio businesses to ship their goods through [[Lake Erie]] and to the east coast, which was followed by the completion of the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and the connection of Lake Erie with the Ohio River. This gave the state complete water access to the world within the borders of the [[United States]]. Other canals included [[Miami and Erie Canal]].<ref name=EI>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=1562|title=Early Industrialization \u2013 Ohio History Central|author=|date=|website=www.OhioHistoryCentral.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref> The [[Welland Canal]] would eventually give the state alternative global routes through Canada.\n\nThe first railroad in Ohio was a 33-mile line completed in 1836 called the [[Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad]], connecting Toledo with [[Adrian, Michigan]]. The [[Ohio Loan Law of 1837]] allowed the state to loan one-third of construction costs to businesses, passed initially to aid the construction of canals, but instead used heavily for the construction of railroads. The [[Little Miami Railroad]] was granted a state charter in 1836 and was completed in 1848, connecting Cincinnati with [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]]. Construction of a commuter rail began in 1851 called the [[Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton Railway (1846\u20131917)|Cincinnati, Hamilton, and Dayton Railroad]]. This allowed the affluent of Cincinnati to move to newly developed communities outside the city along the rail. The [[Ohio and Mississippi Railroad]] was given financial support from the city of Cincinnati and eventually connected them with [[St. Louis]], while the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] crossed the Appalachians in the mid-1850s and connected the state with the east coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=794|title=Railroads \u2013 Ohio History Central|author=|date=|website=OhioHistoryCentral.org|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe investment in infrastructure complemented Ohio's central location and put it at the heart of the nation's transportation system traveling north and south and east and west, and also gave the state a headstart during the national industrialization process which occurred between 1870 and 1920.<ref name=\"OW\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mtzg_mri498C&dq|title=Ohio and the World, 1753\u20132053: Essays Toward a New History of Ohio|first1=Geoffrey|last1=Parker|first2=Richard|last2=Sisson|first3=William Russell|last3=Coil|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Ohio State University Press|pages=98\u201399|accessdate=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWater ports sprang up along [[Lake Erie]], including the [[Ashtabula, Ohio|Port of Ashtabula]], [[Port of Cleveland]], [[Conneaut, Ohio|Port of Conneaut]], [[Fairport Harbor]], [[Huron, Ohio|Port of Huron]], [[Lorain, Ohio|Port of Lorain]], [[Marblehead, Ohio|Port of Marblehead]], [[Sandusky, Ohio|Port of Sandusky]], and [[Toledo-Lucas County Port Authority|Port of Toledo]].

The [[Columbus, ohio#Aviation|first commercial cargo flight]] occurred between Dayton and Columbus in 1910. [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]] was built in 1925 and became home to the first air traffic control tower, ground to air radio control, airfield lighting system, and commuter rail link.\n\nThe [[Interstate Highway System]] brought new travel routes to the state in the mid-20th century, further making Ohio a transportation hub.\n\n===Urbanization and commercialization===\nWith the rapid increase of industrialization in the country in the late 19th century, Ohio's population swelled from 2.3 million in 1860 to 4.2 million by 1900. By 1920, nine Ohio cities had populations of 50,000 or more.<ref name=OW />\n\nThe rapid urbanization brought about a growth of commercial industries in the state, including many financial and insurance institutions. The [[National City Corporation]] was founded in 1845, today part of [[PNC Financial Services]]. Cleveland's Society for Savings was founded in 1849, eventually becoming part of [[KeyBank]]. The Bank of the Ohio Valley opened in 1858, becoming known as [[Fifth Third Bank]] today. City National Bank and Trust Company was founded in 1866 in Columbus, eventually becoming [[Bank One]]. The [[American Financial Group]] was founded in 1872 and the [[Western & Southern Financial Group]] in 1888 in Cincinnati. The Farm Bureau Mutual Automobile Insurance Company was founded in Columbus in 1925, today known as the [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]].\n\nMajor retail operations emerged in the state, including [[Kroger]] in 1883 in Cincinnati, today second only to [[Walmart]].

With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]] spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3169028 Timothy L.

Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location \u2013 or \"market-minded agrarianism\" \u2013 and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.<ref>Ginette Aley, \"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s\u20131830s,\" ''Ohio History,'' (2007) 114#1 pp 28\u201345, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ohh/summary/v114/114.aley.html online]</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of [[German Americans]] arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the [[German Village]] in Columbus. They also founded the villages of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]] in the late 18th century; [[Bergholz, Ohio|Bergholz]], [[New Bremen, Ohio|New Bremen]], [[North Canton, Ohio|New Berlin]], [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], and other villages and towns.

Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. \nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[14] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers.

Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians, it was divided politically.  Portions of Southern Ohio followed the [[Peace Democrats]] under [[Clement Vallandigham]] and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the [[Underground Railroad]] prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.<ref>Robert S.

Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \"Available\"\u2014that is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Sinclair|1965|pp=28\u201330}}\n\nThis legend built on itself As the state set seven men to the White House and four more became Vice President. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] (1876), [[James A. Garfield]] (1880) and [[Benjamin Harrison]] (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its [[favorite son]]s a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Sinclair|title=The Available Man: The Life behind the Masks of Warren Gamaliel Harding|url=https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc |url-access=registration |year=1965|pages=[https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc/page/28 28\u201330]|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Progressive era===\n[[File:Fairbanks 4408868314 de2f1cd85b o.jpg|thumb|left|175px|U.S. Second Lady [[Cornelia Cole Fairbanks]] was a powerful progressive operative around the start of the 20th century who helped pave the way for the modern American female politician.]]\nThe [[Progressive Era]] brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before.

Ohio-native and U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]] signed the [[White-Slave Traffic Act]] in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade.\n\nThe [[Anti-Saloon League]] was founded in 1893 in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], which saw political success with the passage of the [[Volstead Act]] in 1918.\n\n===Constitutional Convention of 1912===\nIn 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with [[Charles Burleigh Galbreath]] as Secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. The constitution introduced the [[initiative]] and the [[referendum]], and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n===Ku Klux Klan===\nIn the early 1920s the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians.

The recorded history of [[Ohio]] began in the late 17th century when [[French people|French]] explorers from [[Canada]] reached the [[Ohio River]], from which the \"[[Ohio Country]]\" took its name, a river the [[Iroquois]] called ''O-y-o'', \"great river\". Before that, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] speaking [[Algonquin language]]s had inhabited Ohio and the central [[midwestern United States]] for hundreds of years until displaced by the Iroquois in the latter part of the 17th century. Other cultures not generally identified as \"[[Native American peoples|Indians]]\", including the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] \"mound builders\", preceded them. Human history in Ohio began a few millennia after formation of the [[Bering land bridge]] about 14,500BCE - see [[Prehistory of Ohio]].\n\nBy the mid-18th century, a few American and French fur traders engaged historic [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes in present-day Ohio in the [[fur trade]]. The Native Americans had their own extensive trading networks across the continent before the Europeans arrived. American settlement in the [[Ohio Country]] came after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the formation of the United States, with its takeover of former British territory. Congress prohibited [[slavery]] in the [[Northwest Territory]] which presaged Ohio and the five states of the Territory entering the Union as ''free'' states. Ohio's population increased rapidly after United States victory in the [[Northwest Indian Wars]] brought peace to the Ohio frontier.  In 1803, Ohio was admitted to the union as the 17th state. Settlement was chiefly by migrants from [[New England]], New York and Pennsylvania. Southerners settled along the southern part of the territory, arriving by travel along the Ohio River from the Upper South. Yankees, especially in the \"[[Western reserve]]\" (near Cleveland), supported modernization, [[public education]], and anti-slavery policies. The state supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] in the [[American Civil War]], although antiwar [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperhead]] sentiment was strong in southern settlements.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Ohio developed as a major industrial state. Ships traveled the [[Great Lakes]] to deliver iron ore and other products from western areas. This was also a route for exports, as were the railroads. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the fast-growing industries created jobs that employed hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe. In World War I Europe was closed off to passenger traffic. A new wave of migrants came from the South, with rural whites from Appalachia, and African Americans in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the Deep South, to escape [[Jim Crow]] and violence.\n\nThe cultures of Ohio's major cities became much more diverse with the traditions, cultures, foods, and music of the new arrivals. Ohio's industries were integral to American industrial power in the 20th century. In the later 20th century, economic restructuring in [[steel]], railroads, and other heavy manufacturing cost the state many jobs as [[heavy industry]] declined. The economy in the 21st century has gradually shifted to depend on service industries such as medicine and education.\n\n==Prehistoric period==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Serpent mound 8438.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Serpent Mound]] earthwork in [[Adams County, Ohio|Adams County]]]]\n[[File:Sunwatch Aerial illustration HRoe 2018 400px.jpg|thumb|Artists conception of the [[Fort Ancient]] period [[SunWatch Indian Village]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]]]\n\n{{main|Prehistory of Ohio}}\nA fossil which dated between 11,727 and 11,424 B.C. indicated that Paleo-Indians hunted large animals, including [[Jefferson's ground sloth]], using stone tools.<ref name=cmnh>{{cite web|publisher=[[Cleveland Museum of Natural History]]|url=http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|date=February 2012|access-date=April 12, 2012|title=Research reveals first evidence of hunting by prehistoric Ohioans|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514202224/http://www.cmnh.org/site/ResearchandCollections/Archaeology/Announcements/Sloth.aspx|archivedate=May 14, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Later ancestors of Native Americans were known as the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic peoples]]. Sophisticated successive cultures such as the [[Adena culture|Adena]], [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] and [[Fort Ancient]], built monumental [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] such as massive monuments, some of which have survived to the present.\n\nThe Late Archaic period featured the development of focal subsistence economies and regionalization of cultures. Regional cultures in Ohio include the [[Maple Creek Culture]] of southwestern Ohio, the [[Glacial Kame Culture]] of western Ohio (especially northwestern Ohio), and the Red Ochre and Old Copper cultures across much of northern Ohio. Flint Ridge, located in present-day [[Licking County, Ohio|Licking County]], provided [[flint]], an extremely important raw material and trade good. Objects made from Flint Ridge flint have been found as far east as the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, as far west as [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]], and as far south as [[Louisiana]], demonstrating the wide network of prehistoric trading cultures.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nAbout 800 BC, Late Archaic cultures were supplanted by the [[Adena culture]]. The Adenas were [[mound builder (people)|mound builder]]s. Many of their thousands of mounds in Ohio have survived. Following the Adena culture was the [[Hopewell culture]] (c. 100 to c. 400 C.E.), which also built sophisticated mounds and earthworks, some of which survive at Hopewell and Newark Earthworks. They used their constructions as [[astronomical]] observatories and places of ritual celebration. The [[Fort Ancient culture]] also built mounds, including some [[effigy mounds]]. Researchers first considered the [[Serpent Mound]] in [[Adams County, Ohio]] to be an Adena mound. It is the largest [[effigy mound]] in the United States and one of Ohio's best-known landmarks. Scholars believe it may have been a more recent work of Fort Ancient people.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In Southern Ohio alone, archaeologists have pinpointed 10000 mounds used as burial sites and have excavated another 1000 earth-walled enclosures, including one enormous fortification with a circumference of about 3.5 miles, enclosing about 100 acres. We now know from a great variety of items found in the mound tombs - large ceremonial blades chipped from obsidian rock formations in Yellowstone National Park; embossed breast-plates, ornaments and weapons fashioned from copper nuggets from the Great Lakes region; decorative objects cut from sheets of mica from the southern Appalachians; conch shells from the Atlantic seaboard; and ornaments made from shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf of Mexico - that the Mound Builders participated in a vast trading network that linked together hundreds of Native Americans across the continent.<ref>Nash, Gary B.

When the [[Iroquois]] Confederacy depleted the beaver and other game in its territory in the New York region, they launched a war known as the [[Beaver Wars]], destroying or scattering the contemporary inhabitants of the [[Tennessee]] region. During the Beaver Wars in the 1650s, the Iroquois nearly destroyed the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]] along the shore of [[Lake Erie]]. Thereafter, the Iroquois claimed Ohio and West Virginia lands as hunting grounds. For several decades, the land was nearly uninhabited.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Beaver Wars===\n{{Main|Beaver Wars}}\nThe land east of the [[Mississippi River]] and south of the [[Great Lakes]] had been fought over for centuries before the [[United States]] government was formed.\n\nIn 1608, [[France|French]] explorer and founder of [[Quebec City]] [[Samuel Champlain]] sided with the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] and their allies the ''[[Wyandot people|Huron]]'' people living along the [[St. Lawrence River]] against the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] (\"Five Nations\") living in what is now upper and western [[New York (state)|New York]] state. The result was a lasting enmity by the Iroquois Confederacy towards the French, which caused them to side with the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[fur trader]]s coming up the [[Hudson River]] in about 1626. The Dutch offered better prices than the French and traded [[firearm]]s, [[hatchet]]s and [[knives]] to the Iroquois in exchange for furs.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Josephy |editor-first=Alvin M. |title=The American Heritage Book of Indians |url=https://archive.org/details/americanheritage00bran |url-access=registration |publisher=American Heritage Publishing, Co., Inc. |year=1961 |lccn=61-14871}}</ref>\n\n[[File:DefeatOfIroquoisByChamplain.jpeg|thumb|Engraving based on a drawing by Champlain of his 1609 voyage, depicting a battle between [[Iroquois]] and [[Algonquian people|Algonquian]] tribes near Lake Champlain]]\n\nWith these more sophisticated weapons, the Five Nations nearly exterminated {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] and all of the other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] living immediately to their west in the [[Ohio country]] during the [[Beaver Wars]], beginning in the 1640s. The Native American tribes were competing for hunting grounds for the fur trade. The western tribes had also been weakened by [[epidemics]] of European [[infectious diseases]], against which they had no acquired [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]]. The Five Nations's use of modern weapons caused the wars to become deadlier. Historians consider the Beaver Wars to have been one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of North America.\n\nAbout 1664, the Five Nations became trading partners with the [[Kingdom of England|British]], who conquered the [[New Netherland]]s (renamed [[New York (state)|New York]]) from the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]].\n\nThe Five Nations enlarged their territory by [[right of conquest]]. The number of tribes paying tribute to them realigned the tribal map of eastern North America. Several large [[Confederation|confederacies]] were destroyed or relocated, including the [[Wyandot people|Huron]], [[Neutral Nation|Neutral]], [[Erie (tribe)|Erie]], [[Susquehannock]] and [[Shawnee]]. The Five Nations pushed several other eastern tribes to and even across the [[Mississippi River]]. The [[Ohio country]] was virtually emptied, as the defeated tribes fled west to escape the Five Nations warriors. After the Five Nations' warriors were defeated, they left much of the [[Northwest territory]], [[Kentucky]] and [[Ohio]] almost unpopulated and with abandoned villages. They had claimed the entire Ohio Valley as their own country.\n\nAfter about 1700, some remnants of the Native American tribes began returning to the Northwest Territory. They were often [[conglomerations]] of several tribes who paid tribute to the Five Nations (see also [[Mingo]]).<ref>[http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_44.html ''The Jesuit Relations... 1610-1791''], Creighton University, accessed January 20, 2009</ref>\n\n==European colonization==\n{{Main|Ohio Country}}\n\n===New France===\n[[File:Wpdms ohio country.png|thumb|left|A map of the original [[Ohio Country]].]]\nIn the 17th century, the French were the first modern Europeans to explore what became known as [[Ohio Country]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_YbBqcACm48C&dq The Ohio Country], p. 1.</ref> In 1663, it became part of [[New France]], a royal province of [[French colonial empire|French Empire]], and northeastern Ohio was further explored by [[Robert La Salle]] in 1669.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b-uLUVJtHKkC&dq|title=Encyclopedia of the French & Indian War in North America, 1754\u20131763|first=Donald I.|last=Stoetzel|date=August 17, 2017|publisher=Heritage Books|page=371|access-date=August 17, 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the [[fur trade]] in the region, linked to their settlements in present-day [[Canada]] and what they called the [[Illinois Country]] along the [[Mississippi River]].

From the east, the [[Lenape|Delaware]] and [[Shawnee]] arrived, and [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] and [[Ottawa (tribe)|Ottawa]] from the north. The [[Miami tribe|Miami]] lived in what is now western Ohio. The [[Mingo]] formed out of Iroquois who migrated west into the Ohio lands, as well as some refugee remnants of other tribes.\n\n[[Christopher Gist]] was one of the first English-speaking explorers to travel through and write about the Ohio Country in 1749. When British traders such as [[George Croghan]] started to do business in the Ohio Country, the French and their northern Indian allies drove them out. In 1752 the French raided the [[Miami]] Indian town of ''Pickawillany'' (modern [[Piqua, Ohio]]). The French began military occupation of the Ohio Valley in 1753.\n\n====French and Indian War====\nBy the mid-18th century, British traders were rivaling French traders in the area.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7Mum6vMM5YwC&dq The great frontier war: Britain, France, and the imperial struggle for North America, 1607\u20131755], p. 177</ref> They had occupied a trading post called [[Fort Loramie|Loramie's Fort]], which the French attacked from Canada in 1752, renaming it for a Frenchman named Loramie and establishing a trading post there. In the early 1750s [[George Washington]] was sent to the Ohio Country by the [[Ohio Company]] to survey, and the fight for control of the territory would spark the [[French and Indian War]]. It was in the Ohio Country where George Washington lost the [[Battle of Fort Necessity]] to [[Louis Coulon de Villiers]] in 1754, and the subsequent [[Battle of the Monongahela]] to Charles Michel de Langlade and Jean-Daniel Dumas to retake the country 1755.\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the country to [[First British Empire|Great Britain]] in 1763. During this period the country was routinely engaged in turmoil, with massacres and battles occurring among the tribes.\n\n===British Empire===\nPrior to the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.<ref>The last French Fort in Ohio Country, Fort Sandusky, was destroyed in 1763 during Pontiac's Rebellion.</ref> Just beyond Ohio Country was the great [[Miami Tribe|Miami]] capital of [[Kekionga]] which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future [[Northwest Territory]]. By the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], British lands west of [[Appalachia]] were forbidden to settlement by colonists.  The [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]] in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Indian lands. British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of [[Pontiac's Rebellion]] in 1763. Ohio Indians participated in that war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Colonel [[Henry Bouquet]] brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought [[Lord Dunmore's War]] to a conclusion. Lord Dunmore constructed [[Fort Gower]] on the [[Hocking River]] in 1774.<ref name=OH />\n\n===American Revolution===\nAs a result of the exploits of George Rogers Clark in 1778, Ohio Country (including the territory of the future state of Ohio) as well as eastern Illinois Country, became Illinois County, Virginia by claim of conquest under the Virginia Colony charter. The county was dissolved in 1782 and ceded to the United States.\n\n[[File:Gnadenhutten monument.JPG|thumb|right|Monument commemorating the [[Moravian Massacre]] in 1782 near the [[German American]] settlement of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]].]]\nDuring the [[American Revolutionary War]], Native Americans in the Ohio Country were divided over which side to support. For example, the Shawnee leader [[Blue Jacket]] and the Delaware leader ''[[Buckongahelas]]'' sided with the British. [[Cornstalk]] (Shawnee) and [[White Eyes]] (Delaware) sought to remain friendly with the rebellious colonists. There was major fighting in 1782.<ref>Milo Milton Quaife, \"The Ohio Campaigns of 1782.\" ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1931): 515\u2013529.

Cornstalk was killed by American militiamen, and White Eyes may have been. One of the most tragic incidents of the war \u2014 the killing of 96 Christian Delaware by U.S. militiamen from Pennsylvania on March 8, 1782 at the Moravian missionary village of Gnadenhutten, known as the [[Gnadenhutten massacre]] \u2014 took place in Ohio.<ref>Rob Harper, \"Looking the other way: the Gnadenhutten massacre and the contextual interpretation of violence.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (2007): 621\u2013644.

Between 1784 and 1789, the states of Virginia, [[Massachusetts]] and Connecticut ceded their earlier land claims in Ohio Country to Congress, but Virginia and Connecticut maintained reserves.<ref>Kip Sperry, ''Genealogical Research in Ohio'', Genealogical Publishing, 2003, p.2</ref> These areas were known as the [[Virginia Military District]] and [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Leonard Peacefull|title=A Geography of Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gefpsoo1nRIC&pg=PA89|year=1996|publisher=Kent State University Press|page=89}}</ref><ref>Harlan Hatcher, ''The Western Reserve: The Story of New Connecticut in Ohio'' (1949)</ref>\n\n==Territory and statehood==\n===Northwest Territory===\nStarting even before the war, and accelerating with the establishment of Fort Henry across the Ohio River in West Virginia, numerous settlers encroached on Indian lands west of the Ohio River in a broad arc from west of Fort Henry as far upriver as where Fort Steuben (today Steubenville) was later established. That there was continuous occupation of such lands is certain, though the location and continuity of any particular settlement, at least a few of which were referred to loosely as \"towns\" is very much in doubt. Most prominent among these were a series of squatters settlements with various names circa 1774 to 1795 in the area of what is today Martin's Ferry, directly across river from Fort Henry.

The [[Connecticut Land Company]] administered settlement in the Connecticut [[Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Northeast Ohio]]. A heavy flood of migrants came from New York and especially New England, where there had been a growing hunger for land as population increased before the Revolutionary War. Most traveled to Ohio by [[wagon]] and [[stagecoach]], following former Indian paths such as the [[Northern Trace]]. Many also traveled part of the way by barges on the [[Mohawk River]] across New York state. Farmers who settled in western New York after the war sometimes moved on to one or more locations in Ohio in their lifetimes, as new lands kept opening to the west.\n\nAmerican settlement of the [[Northwest Territory]] was resisted by Native Americans in the [[Northwest Indian War]]. The natives were eventually conquered by General [[Anthony Wayne]] at the [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] in 1794. They ceded much of present-day Ohio to the United States by the [[Treaty of Greenville]], concluded in 1795.\n\nFurthermore, in regards to the [[Leni Lenape]] Native Americans living in the region, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]] ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774\u201389|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=April 11, 2012}}{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] prohibited [[slavery]] in the territory.  (Once the population grew and the territory achieved statehood, the citizens could have legalized slavery, but chose not to do so.)  The states of the Midwest would be known as Free States, in contrast to those states south of the Ohio River. Migrants to the latter came chiefly from [[Virginia]] and other slave-holding states, and brought their culture and slaves with them.\n\nAs Northeastern states abolished [[slavery]] in the coming two generations, the free states would be known as Northern States. The [[Northwest Territory]] originally included areas previously called [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, [[Indiana Territory]] was carved out, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of [[Michigan]]'s lower peninsula and a sliver of land in southeastern Indiana along Ohio's western border called \"The Gore\".\n\n===Statehood===\n[[File:Land patent-ohio-logan-co-1834-henry-hanford.gif|thumb|300px|Land patent.

The assumption was the territory would have in excess of the required 60,000 residents by the time it became a state. Congress passed the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] that outlined the process for Ohio to seek statehood. The residents convened a constitutional convention. They used numerous provisions from other states and rejected slavery.\n\nOn February 19, 1803, [[Thomas Jefferson|President Jefferson]] signed the act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution. Congress did not pass a specific resolution formally admitting Ohio as the 17th state. The current custom of Congress' declaring an official date of statehood did not begin until 1812, when [[Louisiana]] was admitted as the 18th state.\n\n===War of 1812===\n{{see also|Ohio in the War of 1812}}\n\nOhio played a key role in the [[War of 1812]], as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in [[Lake Erie]]. On September 10, 1813, the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], one of the major battles, took place in Lake Erie near [[Put-in-Bay, Ohio]].

With so many active denominations, no one dominated and, increasingly, tolerance became the norm. Germans from Pennsylvania and from Germany brought Lutheran and Reformed churches and numerous smaller sects such as the Amish. Yankees brought Presbyterians and Congregationalists. Revivals during the [[Second Great Awakening]] spurred the growth of Methodist, Baptist and Christian (Church of Christ) churches. The building of many denominational liberal arts colleges was a distinctive feature of the 19th century. By the 1840s German and Irish Catholics were moving into the cities, and after the 1880s Catholics from eastern and southern Europe arrived in the larger cities, mining camps, and small industrial centers. Jews and Eastern Orthodox settlements added to the pluralism, as did the building of black Baptists and Methodist churches in the cities.<ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3169028 Timothy L.

He was the editor of the influential national magazine the ''Independent'' after 1871, and as pastor of the First Congregational Church of Columbus, Ohio from 1882 to his death in 1918. Gladden crusaded for Prohibition, resolving conflicts between labor and capital; he often denounced racial violence and lynching.<ref>Paul Boyer, \"An Ohio Leader of the Social Gospel Movement,\" ''Ohio History'', August 2009, Vol. 116, pp 88\u2013100</ref>\n\n===Ethnic groups===\nEarly Ohio state culture was a product of Native American cultures, which practically disappeared after 1790. The northeastern part of Ohio was settled by [[Yankees]] from Connecticut, and pioneers from New York and Pennsylvania.

From Virginia came members of the [[Harrison family of Virginia]], who rose to prominence in the state, producing Ohio's first of eight U.S. Presidents.

Clear-cut gender norms prevailed among the farm families who settled in the Midwestern region between 1800 and 1840. Men were the breadwinners who considered the profitability of farming in a particular location \u2013 or \"market-minded agrarianism\" \u2013 and worked hard to provide for their families. They had an almost exclusive voice regarding public matters, such as voting and handling the money. During the migration westward, women's diaries show little interest in and financial problems, but great concern with the threat of separation from family and friends. Furthermore, women experienced a physical toll because they were expected to have babies, supervise the domestic chores, care for the sick, and take control of the garden crops and poultry. Outside the German American community, women rarely did fieldwork on the farm. The women set up neighborhood social organizations, often revolving around church membership, or quilting parties. They exchanged information and tips on child-rearing, and helped each other in childbirth.<ref>Ginette Aley, \"A Republic of Farm People: Women, Families, and Market-Minded Agrarianism in Ohio, 1820s\u20131830s,\" ''Ohio History,'' (2007) 114#1 pp 28\u201345, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ohh/summary/v114/114.aley.html online]</ref>\n\nLarge numbers of [[German Americans]] arrived from Pennsylvania, augmented by new immigrants from Germany. They all clung to their German language and Protestant religions, as well as their specialized tastes in food and beer. Brewing was a main feature of the German culture. Their villages from this period included the [[German Village]] in Columbus. They also founded the villages of [[Gnadenhutten, Ohio|Gnadenhutten]] in the late 18th century; [[Bergholz, Ohio|Bergholz]], [[New Bremen, Ohio|New Bremen]], [[North Canton, Ohio|New Berlin]], [[Dresden, Ohio|Dresden]], and other villages and towns. The German Americans immigrating from the Mid-Atlantic states, especially eastern Pennsylvania, brought with them the [[Philadelphia dialect|Midland dialect]], which is still found throughout much of Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evolpub.com/Americandialects/PennaDialMap.html|title=Linguistic Geography of Pennsylvania|author=|date=|website=www.Evolpub.com|access-date=August 17, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/dialectsofenglish.html|title=Dialects of English|first=C.

The [[Forty-Eighters]] from Central Europe settled the [[Over-the-Rhine]] neighborhood in Cincinnati, while the Irish immigrants settled throughout the state, including [[Flytown]] in Columbus. Other immigrants from [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], [[China]], [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Poland]], and other places came in the latter years.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Xn7jMx1RYC ''The American Midwest: an interpretive encyclopedia''], p. 228\u2013231</ref> Around the start of the 20th century, rural southern [[European Americans]] and [[African Americans]] came north in search of better economic opportunity, infusing [[Hillbilly]] culture into the state. Newer ethnic villages emerged, including the [[Slavic Village]] in Cleveland and the [[Italian Village, Columbus, Ohio|Italian Village]] and [[Hungarian Village]] in Columbus. [[Howard Chandler Christy]], born in [[Morgan County, Ohio|Morgan County]], became a leading American artist during this century, as well as composer [[Dan Emmett]], founder of the [[Blackface]] tradition.\nOhio's mines factories and cities attracted Europeans.

Athletics became increasingly popular as the first professional baseball team, the [[Cincinnati Reds]], started playing at that level in 1869, and football leagues emerged. Bathhouses and rollercoasters became a popular past time with the opening of [[Cedar Point]] in 1870.

However these organizations steadily lost influence after 1925.\n\nPerhaps the biggest invention in Ohio and the US was the invention of flight by Dayton's [[Orville and Wilbur Wright]]. Starting this invention in their bike shop in what is now Dayton's west side, the Wright's brought flight to the world in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. \nThe brothers gained the mechanical skills essential to their success by working for years in their Dayton, Ohio-based shop with printing presses, bicycles, motors, and other machinery. Their work with bicycles in particular influenced their belief that an unstable vehicle such as a flying machine could be controlled and balanced with practice.[14] From 1900 until their first powered flights in late 1903, they conducted extensive glider tests that also developed their skills as pilots. Their shop employee Charlie Taylor became an important part of the team, building their first airplane engine in close collaboration with the brothers. The very first airplane passenger was the Wright's own mechanic, [[Charles Furnas]] of [[West Milton, Ohio]].\n\n===Depression years===\nDuring the 1930s, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] struck the state hard. American Jews watched the rise of the [[Third Reich]] with apprehension.

Due to its central location and burgeoning population, Ohio was both politically and logistically important to the war effort. Despite the state's boasting a number of very powerful [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] politicians, it was divided politically.  Portions of Southern Ohio followed the [[Peace Democrats]] under [[Clement Vallandigham]] and openly opposed President Lincoln's policies. Ohio played an important part in the [[Underground Railroad]] prior to the war, and remained a haven for escaped and runaway slaves during the war years.<ref>Robert S.

Ohio resident [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] wrote the famous book ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', which was largely influential in shaping the opinion of the north against slavery.\n\n===Ohio in national politics===\nAs a closely contested state, Ohio was the top choice of Republicans, and often also as Democrats, for place on the national ticket as candidate for president or vice president.\n\nBetween [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] and [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover]], every Republican president who did not gain the office by the death of his predecessor was born in Ohio; Ulysses Grant, although born in Ohio, was legally a residence of Illinois when he was elected.<ref name = \"prez birthplaces\">{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsusa.net/birth.html|title=U.S. Presidents Birth and Death Information|access-date=May 30, 2015|publisher=CB Presidential Research Service}}</ref>\n\nBy electing so many of her sons to the presidency, Ohio gained a role in politics disproportionate to its size. Several reasons came together. Ohio was a microcosm of the United States, balanced closely between the parties, and at the crossroads of America: between the South, the Northeast, and the developing West, and influenced by each. Its ethnic, religious, and cultural elements were a microcosm of the North. Its cutthroat politics trained candidates in how to win. A leading Ohio politician was \"Available\"\u2014that is, well-suited and electable. Thus, in most presidential years, the governor of Ohio was deemed more available than the governor of the larger states of New York or Pennsylvania.{{sfn|Sinclair|1965|pp=28\u201330}}\n\nThis legend built on itself As the state set seven men to the White House and four more became Vice President. Many others won major patronage plums. Between 1868 and 1924, not only did Ohio supply the most presidents, it supplied the most Cabinet members, and the most federal officeholders. Ohio-born [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] (1876), [[James A. Garfield]] (1880) and [[Benjamin Harrison]] (1888) were each nominated from a convention that had deadlocked, and where the delegates chose to turn to a candidate who could carry Ohio. In each case they did, and won the presidency. According to historian Andrew Sinclair, \"the potency of the Ohio myth gave its [[favorite son]]s a huge advantage in a deadlocked convention\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Sinclair|title=The Available Man: The Life behind the Masks of Warren Gamaliel Harding|url=https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc |url-access=registration |year=1965|pages=[https://archive.org/details/availablemanli00sinc/page/28 28\u201330]|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Progressive era===\n[[File:Fairbanks 4408868314 de2f1cd85b o.jpg|thumb|left|175px|U.S. Second Lady [[Cornelia Cole Fairbanks]] was a powerful progressive operative around the start of the 20th century who helped pave the way for the modern American female politician.]]\nThe [[Progressive Era]] brought about change in the state, although the state had been at the forefront of the movement decades before.

Ohio was the second state to hold a women's rights convention, the [[Ohio Women's Convention at Salem in 1850]].<ref>Wellman, Judith (2008).

The first two women's rights conventions were the [[Seneca Falls Convention]] and the [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], both held in 1848 in western New York.\n</ref> The public voted on women's suffrage in 1912, which failed, but the state ultimately adopted the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|19th amendment]] in 1920. Ohio-native and U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]] signed the [[White-Slave Traffic Act]] in 1910, which sought to end human trafficking and the sex slave trade.\n\nThe [[Anti-Saloon League]] was founded in 1893 in [[Oberlin, Ohio|Oberlin]], which saw political success with the passage of the [[Volstead Act]] in 1918.\n\n===Constitutional Convention of 1912===\nIn 1912 a Constitutional Convention was held with [[Charles Burleigh Galbreath]] as Secretary. The result reflected the concerns of the [[Progressive Era]]. The constitution introduced the [[initiative]] and the [[referendum]], and provided for the General Assembly to put questions on the ballot for the people to ratify laws and constitutional amendments originating in the Legislature. Under the [[Jeffersonian political philosophy|Jeffersonian]] principle that laws should be reviewed once a generation, the constitution provided for a recurring question to appear every 20 years on Ohio's general election ballots. The question asks whether a new constitutional convention is required. Although the question has appeared in 1932, 1952, 1972, and 1992, the people have not found the need for a convention. Instead, constitutional amendments have been proposed by petition and the legislature hundreds of times and adopted in a majority of cases.\n\n===Ku Klux Klan===\nIn the early 1920s the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted thousands of Protestant men into membership, warning of the need to purify America, especially against the influence of Catholics, bootleggers, and corrupt politicians.

{"title_page": "AS-Interface", "text_new": "'''AS-Interface''' (Actuator Sensor Interface, ASi) is an industrial networking solution (physical layer, data access method and protocol) used in PLC, DCS and PC-based automation systems. It is designed for connecting simple field I/O devices (e.g. binary ON/OFF devices such as actuators, sensors, rotary encoders, analog inputs and outputs, push buttons, and valve position sensors) in discrete manufacturing and process applications using a single two-conductor cable.\n\nAS-Interface is an 'open' technology supported by a multitude of automation equipment vendors. The AS-Interface has been an international standard according to IEC 62026-2 since 1999.\n\nAS-Interface is a networking alternative to the hard wiring of field devices. It can be used as a partner network for higher level fieldbus networks such as [[Profibus]], [[DeviceNet]], Interbus and [[Industrial Ethernet]], for whom it offers a low-cost remote I/O solution. It is used in automation applications, including conveyor control, packaging machines (e.g. Schubert's), process control valves, bottling plants, electrical distribution systems, airport baggage carousels, elevators, bottling lines and food production lines (e.g. 2SFG). AS-Interface provides a basis for [[Functional Safety]] in machinery safety/emergency stop applications. Safety devices communicating over AS-Interface follow all the normal AS-Interface data rules. The AS-Interface specification is managed by [[AS-International]], a member funded non-profit organization located in Gelnhausen/Germany. Several international subsidiaries exist around the world.\n\n==History==\nAS-Interface was developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s by a development partnership of 11 companies mostly known for their offering of industrial non-contact sensing devices like [[inductive sensor]]s, [[photoelectric sensor]]s, [[capacitive sensor]]s and [[ultrasonic sensor]]s. Once development was completed the consortium was resolved and a member organization, ''[[AS-International]]'', was founded. The first operational system was shown at the 1994 [[Hanover fair]].\n\nIn 2018, a new technology step was presented at SPS IPC Drives in Nuremberg. This technology is named ASi-5. ASi-5 was developed by well-known manufacturers of automation technology.\n\n==Use==\nThe AS-Interface (from the Actuator Sensor Interface) has been developed as an alternative to conventional parallel cabling of sensors and actuators and offers the following advantages:\n* Flexibility\n* Cost saving\n* Simplicity\n* Reduction of installation errors\n* Widely distributed\n* Best networking opportunities\n* Compatibility\n\nThe main application areas of the system are factory automation, process technology and home automation.\n\n==Technology==\nThe AS-Interface is a single-master system, this means a master device exchanges the input and output data with all configured devices.\nThe transmission medium is an unshielded two-wire yellow flat cable. The cable is used for signal transmission and at the same time for power supply (30&nbsp;V). The communication electronics and participants with low power requirements, like light beams, can be powered directly. Consumers with a higher energy requirement, such as valve terminals, can use a separate, usually black flat cable for power supply (30&nbsp;V).\nThe sensors or actuators are often connected via the so-called piercing technology. The insulation of the polarity profiled flat cable is pierced by means of two penetrating mandrels during assembly, this makes an easy and simple connection with reduced assembly efforts. Sensors and actuators that do not have an AS-Interface connection can be connected to the system via modules. For modules with penetration technology, the AS-Interface flat cable must be used. [[File:ASi CABLE2.JPG|frame|none|Here is a flat cable drawing]]\nThe topology of the AS-Interface networks is arbitrary. You can build lines, star, ring or tree structures.\n\n===ASi-3 communication and transmission technology===\nA telegram consists of 4-bit user data. The master communicates with the participants with a serial transmission protocol.\nEach subscriber is assigned an address by an addressing device or via the master. A maximum of 31 (standard devices) or 62 (advanced devices) nodes can be connected. Each node can have up to four inputs and/or four outputs for actuators or sensors. This provides up to 124 (4 x 31 = 124) input and 124 outputs on a standard device network (nodes addressed 1-31) or 248 (4 x 62 = 248) inputs and 248 outputs on an advanced network (nodes addressed 1A - 31A and 1B - 31B ).\nThe serial communication is modulated onto the power supply. [[Manchester coding]] is used for the communication.\nFor 31 participants, the cycle is 5 ms. To address 62 participants, two cycles are necessary.\nThe topology of the AS-Interface is arbitrary, but without a repeater or extender, the cable length must not exceed 100 m. Due to a special terminating resistor (a combination of resistive and capacitive load), however, it is possible to increase the maximum cable length up to 300 m.\nDiagnostic devices or masters with built-in diagnostics simplify network troubleshooting. Failed slaves can be easily replaced, the master automatically redirects them.\nSafety at Work is the concept of functional safety used in ASi-3 technology. This means that safety-related components such as emergency stop actuations, door interlocks or light grids can be used in the AS-Interface network. This is a different transmission protocol overlaid onto the regular ASi protocol on the same cable and requires a separate safety master such as Siemens ASiMon devices on which your safety devices are configured.\nAS-Interface can provide safety support up to SIL (Safety Integrity Level) 3 according to IEC 61508 as well as Performance Level e (PL e) according to EN ISO 13849-1.\n\n===ASi-5 communication and transmission technology===\n16 bits are available for cyclic transmission using ASi-5. A cyclic transmission of up to 32 bytes per participant is possible. An acyclic parameter channel with up to 256 bytes is available for each device as well. ASi-5 is to provide a set of up to 1536 binary inputs and 1536 binary outputs per Ethernet address.\n1.2 ms cycle time can be achieved by the system for up to 24 participants. This fast cycle time allows new fields of applications that were previously reserved for expensive network systems.\n96 participants can be addressed in an ASi-5 network. These 96 devices then have a cycle time of 5 ms.\nCommunication diagnostics describes the information about message transmission between the connected nodes and the master. The system continuously monitors the transmission quality of the messages from each device connected. This single channel diagnosis is available in the system. Disturbed transmission channels are redirected automatically.\nDevice diagnostics provides information about the connected device. The available diagnostics data are determined by the device manufacturer. Diagnostic data can be transmitted via the acyclic services with a data width of up to 256 bytes.\nThe ASi-5 system is open for the use of parameter interfaces such as e.g. IO-Link. IO-Link devices can be efficiently collected over long distances and could be integrated cyclically up to 32 bytes.\n16 safe bits are available for safety-related switching devices, such as emergency stop, light curtains, safety switches and similar are available. It is possible to achieve [[Safety Integrity Level]] (SIL)3 Performance Level e according to IEC 13849 for functional safety.\nASi-5 uses a novel communication method. The new ASi-5 technology allows the use of ASi-3 components together with components of the new ASi-5 technology on a common cable. If ASi-3 devices are to be used together with ASi-5 components, then in addition to the corresponding devices the use of a new ASi-3 / ASi-5 master is required. Old systems can be easily upgraded by new devices with additional functions. New systems can be installed on a cable using proven ASi-3 components and new ASi-5 devices.\n\n==Standardization==\nThe AS-Interface is described in the international standard IEC 62026-2: 2015.\nOther local standards are:\nEurope: EN 62026-2: 2015\nJapan: JIS C 82026-2 (2013)\nChina: GB / T 18858.2 (2002)\nKorea: KS C IEC 62026-2 (2007)\n\nAS-Interface products are certified by the [[AS-International]] Association e.V. Tests and certifications ensure that devices from different manufacturers work together.\nThe concepts of functional safety at AS-Interface have been positively assessed by the T\u00dcV (Technical Inspection Association) or the Institute for Occupational Safety of the German Social Accident Insurance and confirmed the fulfillment of the relevant safety standards.\n\n==References==\n* W.

They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is another past incarnation of himself, but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the [[The War Doctor|War Doctor]], the incarnation who fought during the great [[The Time War|Time War]].\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Ninth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.

They use [[soporific]] drugs to hold a conference call through time and space between themselves, Strax, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]], and Clara, in a dream. Vastra repeats DeMarco's words: \"The Doctor has a secret he will take to the grave, and it is discovered.\" During their conference, eyeless humanoids called Whisper Men kidnap Vastra and Strax and kill Jenny. The [[Great Intelligence]] tells Clara to tell the Doctor that his friends are \"lost\" unless he goes to Trenzalore.\n\nThe Doctor and Clara travel to Trenzalore, the planet holding his future grave, to save his friends. The planet is covered with tombstones, the result of a great war, while a future version of the [[TARDIS]] (having deteriorated and grown to enormous size) stands above the graveyard. The duo are attacked by Whisper Men. An echo of River, still telepathically linked to Clara, helps direct the two to an escape route that leads to the giant TARDIS. Strax, Vastra, and Jenny (who is revived by Strax) are awakened by Whisper Men and meet the Great Intelligence.\n\nThe Great Intelligence threatens to kill the Doctor's allies unless the Doctor says his name to unlock the TARDIS doors. The Doctor refuses, but as he speaks, River says the Doctor's name and unlocks the TARDIS. Inside, the Doctor reveals a pulsating column of light to be his time stream. The Great Intelligence enters it in order to undo the Doctor's past as revenge for all the defeats it has been dealt. The positive effects of the Doctor's travels begin to be nullified by the Intelligence's interference. Jenny and Strax both disappear.\n\nClara remembers the Doctor telling her that she has helped the Doctor in other places in time and space. She enters the time stream to restore the Doctor's timeline. Echoes of Clara fall through space and time and appear in adventures of the Doctor's previous incarnations. The Doctor enters the column of light to save the original Clara, guiding her from a place where she sees several previous incarnations of the Doctor. Reunited, the two spot another figure in the shadows which Clara does not recognise. The Doctor explains the elderly figure is [[War Doctor|another past incarnation of himself]], but what he did in the past was not in the Doctor's name. The figure turns around, revealing himself to be the War Doctor, the Doctor that fought during the [[Time War]]\n\n===Continuity===\nImagery of the Doctor's prior incarnations is used during scenes in which Clara and the Great Intelligence interact with the Doctor. Footage of the [[First Doctor|First]] (from ''[[The Aztecs (Doctor Who)|The Aztecs]]'', 1964, with dialogue from ''[[The Web Planet]]'', 1965), [[Second Doctor|Second]], [[Third Doctor|Third]] (both from ''[[The Five Doctors]]'', 1983), [[Fourth Doctor|Fourth]] (''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', 1978), [[Fifth Doctor|Fifth]] (''[[Arc of Infinity]]'', 1983), and [[Seventh Doctor|Seventh]] (''[[Dragonfire (Doctor Who)|Dragonfire]]'', 1987) Doctors was shown. [[Stunt double]]s were used for some other brief appearances, including the [[Sixth Doctor]] walking past Clara while she is in a corridor. The [[Ninth Doctor]] can also be seen running past her in the Doctor's time stream.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/the-name-of-the-doctor-past-references/|title=The Name of the Doctor Past References|work=The Doctor Who Site}}</ref> The opening scene also includes a representation of [[Susan Foreman]] and reference to the Doctor's original departure from [[Gallifrey]] (as a globed city, previously seen in \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", and later seen destroyed in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\").\n\nThe Great Intelligence says that the Doctor has been \"bloodsoaked\" several times, talking about the leader of the Sycorax (whom the [[Tenth Doctor]] kills in \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"), Solomon the trader (whom the Eleventh Doctor sends to his death in \"[[Dinosaurs on a Spaceship]]\"), the [[Daleks]], and the [[Cybermen]]. The Great Intelligence also states that the Doctor will be known as the [[Valeyard]] before the end of his life. The Valeyard appeared in the 1986 serial ''[[The Trial of a Time Lord]]'', where he is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between his twelfth and final incarnations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/05/18/eleven-thoughts-about-doctor-who/|title=Ten Thoughts About Doctor Who: The Name Of The Doctor|last=Johnston|first=Rich|work=bleedingcool.com|date=18 May 2013|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Doctor Who Experience (30943593585).jpg|right|thumb|175px|The Whisper Men as they appear at the Doctor Who Experience]]\nLead writer [[Steven Moffat]] stated that he wanted to have a new monster in the finale, after the series had seen the reappearance of old monsters such as the [[Ice Warrior]]s, Cybermen, and Daleks.

Laws are developed from data and can be further developed through [[mathematics]]; in all cases they are directly or indirectly based on [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they implicitly reflect, though they do not explicitly assert, causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.<ref name=\"McComas2013\">{{cite book|author=William F.

In general, the accuracy of a law does not change when a new theory of the relevant phenomenon is worked out, butt rather the scope of the law's application, since the mathematics or statement representing the law does not change. As with other kinds of scientific knowledge, laws do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be contradicted, restricted, or extended by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.\n\nLaws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may entail one or several laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work |title=Definitions from |publisher=the NCSE |date= |accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref> Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief }}</ref> Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].<ref name=gouldfact>{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34\u201337}}</ref> The nature of scientific laws has been much discussed in [[philosophy]], butt in essence scientific laws are simply empirical conclusions reached by [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nA scientific law always applies to a [[physical system]] under the same conditions, and it implies that there is a causal relationship involving the elements of the system. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | contribution = Laws, natural or scientific\n  | editor-last = Honderich\n  | editor-first = Bike\n  | title = Oxford Companion to Philosophy\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474 474\u2013476]\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | place = Oxford\n  | year = 1995\n  | isbn = 0-19-866132-0\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474\n  }}</ref>\n\nLaws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], [[Boyle's law]] applies with perfect accuracy only to the ideal gas, etc. These laws remain useful, butt only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as <math>\\Delta E = 0</math>, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as <math>\\mathrm{d}U=\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,</math>, and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] can be written as ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}. While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not like mathematical theorems (which can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment).\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.\n\nSome laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, [[Newtonian dynamics]] (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.\n\nLaws are constantly being tested experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed. Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, butt the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations, to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.\n\n==Properties==\n\nScientific laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. A scientific law is \"[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present.\"<ref>{{OED|Law of nature}}</ref> The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]].\n\nSeveral general properties of scientific laws, particularly when referring to laws in [[physics]], have been identified.

In these cases, laws may describe general trends or expected behaviors rather than being absolutes.\n\n== Laws as consequences of mathematical symmetries==\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\nSome laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (e.g. the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, and [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[spacetime]]). Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].\n\nThe [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].\n\nOne strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.\n\n== Laws of physics ==\n=== Conservation laws ===\n\n====Conservation and symmetry====\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\n\nMost significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.\n\n*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.\n* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, butt part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.\n*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.\n*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.\n\n====Continuity and transfer====\n\nConservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted \u2207\u2022) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Physics, conserved quantity\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Conserved quantity ''q'' \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Volume density ''\u03c1'' (of ''q'') \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Flux '''J''' (of ''q'')\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Equation\n|-\n| [[Hydrodynamics]], [[fluid]]s <br />\n| ''m'' = [[mass]] (kg)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume [[mass density]] (kg m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| ''\u03c1'' '''u''', where<br/ >\n'''u''' = [[velocity field]] of fluid (m s<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) </math>\n|-\n| [[Electromagnetism]], [[electric charge]]\n| ''q'' = electric charge (C)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume electric [[charge density]] (C m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''J''' = electric [[current density]] (A m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math> \n|-\n| [[Thermodynamics]], [[energy]]\n| ''E'' = energy (J)\n| ''u'' = volume [[energy density]] (J m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''q''' = [[heat flux]] (W m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} </math> \n|-\n| [[Quantum mechanics]], [[probability]] \n|| ''P'' = ('''r''', ''t'') = \u222b|\u03a8|<sup>2</sup>d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' = [[probability distribution]]\n|| ''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c1''('''r''', ''t'') = |\u03a8|<sup>2</sup> = [[probability density function]] (m<sup>\u22123</sup>),<br />\n\u03a8 = [[wavefunction]] of quantum system\n|| '''j''' = [[probability current]]/flux\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial |\\Psi|^2}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} </math> \n|}\n\nMore general equations are the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.\n\n===Laws of classical mechanics===\n\n====Principle of least action====\n\n{{Main|Principle of least action}}\n\nAll of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:\n\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal{S} = \\delta\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mathcal{S} </math> is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n\n:<math> L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) = T(\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)-V(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)</math>\n\nof the physical system between two times ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub>. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>N</sub>'').\n\nThere are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''p<sub>N</sub>''), where:\n\n:<math>p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}</math>\n\nThe action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term \"path\" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).\n\nThe action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' \"shape\" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''<sub>1</sub> to ''t''<sub>2</sub>). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as \"differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc\", rather this idea is applied to the entire \"shape\" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).<ref>Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P.

However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.\n\nThe said postulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] \u2013 the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]\n\n:<math>A' =\\Lambda A </math>\n\nthis replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.\n\nThe magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' \"conserved\", butt the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):\n\n:<math> E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 </math>\n\nin which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> is a special case.\n\n;[[General relativity]]\n\nGeneral relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field.

Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.\n\nOther postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| style=\"width:300px;\"| '''[[Quantum mechanics]], [[Quantum field theory]]'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (general form):''' Describes the time dependence of a quantum mechanical system.\n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{d}{dt} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle = \\hat{H} \\left| \\psi \\right\\rangle </math>\n\nThe [[Hamiltonian quaternions|Hamiltonian]] (in quantum mechanics) ''H'' is a [[self-adjoint operator]] acting on the state space, <math>| \\psi \\rangle </math> (see [[Dirac notation]]) is the instantaneous [[quantum state vector]] at time ''t'', position '''r''', ''i'' is the unit [[imaginary number]], ''\u0127'' = ''h''/2\u03c0 is the reduced [[Planck's constant]].\n| rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" style=\"width:300px;\"|'''[[Wave-particle duality]]'''\n\n'''[[Planck constant|Planck\u2013Einstein law]]:''' the [[energy]] of [[photon]]s is proportional to the [[frequency]] of the light (the constant is [[Planck's constant]], ''h'').  \n:<math> E = h\\nu = \\hbar \\omega </math>\n\n'''[[Matter wave|De Broglie wave]]length:''' this laid the foundations of wave\u2013particle duality, and was the key concept in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]],\n:<math> \\mathbf{p} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}\\mathbf{\\hat{k}} = \\hbar \\mathbf{k}</math>\n\n'''[[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]:''' [[Uncertainty]] in position multiplied by uncertainty in [[momentum]] is at least half of the [[reduced Planck constant]], similarly for time and [[energy]];\n:<math>\\Delta x \\Delta p \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2},\\, \\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac{\\hbar}{2} </math>\n\nThe uncertainty principle can be generalized to any pair of observables - see main article.\n|-\n| '''Wave mechanics'''\n\n'''[[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] (original form):''' \n:<math> i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 \\psi + V \\psi </math>\n|- style=\"border-top: 3px solid;\"\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:600px;\"| '''[[Pauli exclusion principle]]:''' No two identical [[fermion]]s can occupy the same quantum state ([[boson]]s can).

Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]\n\nThe most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].\n\nAdditional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.\n\n[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\n\nThe law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions are the first two of the three laws of [[stoichiometry]], the proportions by which the chemical elements combine to form chemical compounds. The third law of stoichiometry is the [[law of reciprocal proportions]], which provides the basis for establishing [[equivalent weight]]s for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive [[standard atomic weight|atomic weights]] for each element.\n \nMore modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.\n\n;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]\n\n* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules\u2014the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.\n* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.\n* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond\u2013Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].\n* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.\n* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.\n\n;[[Thermochemistry]]\n\n*[[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]\n*[[Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation]]\n*[[Hess's law]]\n\n;Gas laws\n\n*[[Raoult's law]]\n*[[Henry's law]]\n\n;Chemical transport\n\n*[[Fick's laws of diffusion]]\n*[[Graham's law]]\n*[[Lamm equation]]\n\n== Laws of biology ==\n{{Main|Biological rules}}\n\n\n== Laws of geology ==\n\n*[[Archie's law]]\n*[[Buys-Ballot's law]]\n*[[Birch's law]]\n*[[Byerlee's law]]\n* [[Principle of original horizontality]]\n* [[Law of superposition]] \n* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]\n* [[Principle of cross-cutting relationships]]\n* [[Principle of faunal succession]]\n* [[Law of included fragments|Principle of inclusions and components]] \n* [[Walther's law]] \n\n== Other fields ==\nSome [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.\n\nExamples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius\u2013Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, and [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as \"laws\". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.\n\n== History ==\nThe observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes\u2014such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena\u2014to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.\n\nAccording to a positivist view, when compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature replace the need for [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.\n\nIn Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.<blockquote>The formula \"law of nature\" first appears as \"a live metaphor\" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,<ref>in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, \"When Nature Got its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref> the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.<br/><br/>\nFor the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.<ref>Sedley, \"When Nature Got Its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] described \"nature\" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts \"are to be attributed to nature.

[[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).\n\nThe distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.<ref>Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use \"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists.

In general, the accuracy of a law does not change when a new theory of the relevant phenomenon is worked out, but rather the scope of the law's application, since the mathematics or statement representing the law does not change. As with other kinds of scientific knowledge, laws do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be contradicted, restricted, or extended by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.\n\nLaws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may entail one or several laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work |title=Definitions from |publisher=the NCSE |date= |accessdate=2019-03-18}}</ref> Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief }}</ref> Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].<ref name=gouldfact>{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34\u201337}}</ref> The nature of scientific laws has been much discussed in [[philosophy]], but in essence scientific laws are simply empirical conclusions reached by [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Overview==\nA scientific law always applies to a [[physical system]] under the same conditions, and it implies that there is a causal relationship involving the elements of the system. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like \"Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure\" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].<ref>{{Citation\n  | contribution = Laws, natural or scientific\n  | editor-last = Honderich\n  | editor-first = Bike\n  | title = Oxford Companion to Philosophy\n  | pages = [https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474 474\u2013476]\n  | publisher = Oxford University Press\n  | place = Oxford\n  | year = 1995\n  | isbn = 0-19-866132-0\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/474\n  }}</ref>\n\nLaws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], [[Boyle's law]] applies with perfect accuracy only to the ideal gas, etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.\n\nMany laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as <math>\\Delta E = 0</math>, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as <math>\\mathrm{d}U=\\delta Q-\\delta W\\,</math>, and [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second law]] can be written as ''F'' = {{frac|dp|dt}}. While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical, and so are not like mathematical theorems (which can be proved purely by mathematics and not by scientific experiment).\n\nLike theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.\n\nSome laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, [[Newtonian dynamics]] (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian [[gravitation]] law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb's law is an approximation to Quantum Electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.\n\nLaws are constantly being tested experimentally to higher and higher degrees of precision. This is one of the main goals of science. Just because laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed. Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations, to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.\n\n==Properties==\n\nScientific laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific [[experiment]]s and [[observations]] over many years and which have become accepted universally within the [[scientific community]]. A scientific law is \"[[inferred]] from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of [[phenomena]], and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present.\"<ref>{{OED|Law of nature}}</ref> The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of [[science]].\n\nSeveral general properties of scientific laws, particularly when referring to laws in [[physics]], have been identified. They are:\n\n* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.<!--concept pre-existing in article-->\n* Universal.

In these cases, laws may describe general trends or expected behaviors rather than being absolutes.\n\n== Laws as consequences of mathematical symmetries==\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\nSome laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in Nature (e.g. the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]] of [[space]], time, and [[Lorentz transformations]] reflect rotational symmetry of [[spacetime]]). Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various [[symmetries]] of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, [[Noether's theorem]] connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different than any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the [[Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics|Dirac]] and [[Bose\u2013Einstein statistics|Bose]] quantum statistics which in turn result in the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] for [[fermion]]s and in [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensation]] for [[boson]]s. The rotational symmetry between time and [[space]] coordinate axes (when one is taken as imaginary, another as real) results in [[Lorentz transformations]] which in turn result in [[special relativity]] theory. Symmetry between [[inertial]] and gravitational [[mass]] results in [[general relativity]].\n\nThe [[inverse square law]] of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of [[space]].\n\nOne strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.\n\n== Laws of physics ==\n=== Conservation laws ===\n\n====Conservation and symmetry====\n{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}\n\nMost significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.\n\n*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.\n* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.\n*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.\n*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.\n\n====Continuity and transfer====\n\nConservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math>\n\nwhere \u03c1 is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted \u2207\u2022) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\"| Physics, conserved quantity\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Conserved quantity ''q'' \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Volume density ''\u03c1'' (of ''q'') \n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:140px;\"| Flux '''J''' (of ''q'')\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10px;\"| Equation\n|-\n| [[Hydrodynamics]], [[fluid]]s <br />\n| ''m'' = [[mass]] (kg)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume [[mass density]] (kg m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| ''\u03c1'' '''u''', where<br/ >\n'''u''' = [[velocity field]] of fluid (m s<sup>\u22121</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot (\\rho \\mathbf{u}) </math>\n|-\n| [[Electromagnetism]], [[electric charge]]\n| ''q'' = electric charge (C)\n| ''\u03c1'' = volume electric [[charge density]] (C m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''J''' = electric [[current density]] (A m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} = - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} </math> \n|-\n| [[Thermodynamics]], [[energy]]\n| ''E'' = energy (J)\n| ''u'' = volume [[energy density]] (J m<sup>\u22123</sup>)\n| '''q''' = [[heat flux]] (W m<sup>\u22122</sup>)\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}=- \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} </math> \n|-\n| [[Quantum mechanics]], [[probability]] \n|| ''P'' = ('''r''', ''t'') = \u222b|\u03a8|<sup>2</sup>d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' = [[probability distribution]]\n|| ''\u03c1'' = ''\u03c1''('''r''', ''t'') = |\u03a8|<sup>2</sup> = [[probability density function]] (m<sup>\u22123</sup>),<br />\n\u03a8 = [[wavefunction]] of quantum system\n|| '''j''' = [[probability current]]/flux\n| <math> \\frac{\\partial |\\Psi|^2}{\\partial t}=-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{j} </math> \n|}\n\nMore general equations are the [[convection\u2013diffusion equation]] and [[Boltzmann transport equation]], which have their roots in the continuity equation.\n\n===Laws of classical mechanics===\n\n====Principle of least action====\n\n{{Main|Principle of least action}}\n\nAll of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:\n\n:<math> \\delta \\mathcal{S} = \\delta\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\mathcal{S} </math> is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]\n\n:<math> L(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t) = T(\\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)-V(\\mathbf{q}, \\mathbf{\\dot{q}}, t)</math>\n\nof the physical system between two times ''t''<sub>1</sub> and ''t''<sub>2</sub>. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''<sub>1</sub>, ''q''<sub>2</sub>, ... ''q<sub>N</sub>'').\n\nThere are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''<sub>1</sub>, ''p''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''p<sub>N</sub>''), where:\n\n:<math>p_i = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{q}_i}</math>\n\nThe action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term \"path\" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).\n\nThe action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' \"shape\" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''<sub>1</sub> to ''t''<sub>2</sub>). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as \"differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc\", rather this idea is applied to the entire \"shape\" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).<ref>Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P.

However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.\n\nThe said postulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] \u2013 the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]\n\n:<math>A' =\\Lambda A </math>\n\nthis replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.\n\nThe magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' \"conserved\", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):\n\n:<math> E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 </math>\n\nin which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup> is a special case.\n\n;[[General relativity]]\n\nGeneral relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.\n\n;[[Gravitomagnetism]]\n\nIn a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''.

There is no way to keep track of particles physically, labels are only used mathematically to prevent confusion.\n|}\n\n===Radiation laws===\n\nApplying electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics, to atoms and molecules, some laws of [[electromagnetic radiation]] and light are as follows.\n\n*[[Stefan-Boltzmann law]]\n*[[Planck's law of black body radiation]]\n*[[Wien's displacement law]]\n*[[Radioactive decay law]]\n\n== Laws of chemistry ==\n{{Main|Chemical law}}\n\n'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].\n\n;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]\n\nThe most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].\n\nAdditional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.\n\n[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.\n\nThe law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions are the first two of the three laws of [[stoichiometry]], the proportions by which the chemical elements combine to form chemical compounds. The third law of stoichiometry is the [[law of reciprocal proportions]], which provides the basis for establishing [[equivalent weight]]s for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive [[standard atomic weight|atomic weights]] for each element.\n \nMore modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.\n\n;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]\n\n* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules\u2014the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.\n* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.\n* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond\u2013Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].\n* All chemical processes are reversible (law of [[microscopic reversibility]]) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.\n* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the [[rate constant]]. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the temperature and [[activation energy]] dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.\n\n;[[Thermochemistry]]\n\n*[[Dulong\u2013Petit law]]\n*[[Gibbs\u2013Helmholtz equation]]\n*[[Hess's law]]\n\n;Gas laws\n\n*[[Raoult's law]]\n*[[Henry's law]]\n\n;Chemical transport\n\n*[[Fick's laws of diffusion]]\n*[[Graham's law]]\n*[[Lamm equation]]\n\n== Laws of biology ==\n{{Main|Biological rules}}\n\n\n== Laws of geology ==\n\n*[[Archie's law]]\n*[[Buys-Ballot's law]]\n*[[Birch's law]]\n*[[Byerlee's law]]\n* [[Principle of original horizontality]]\n* [[Law of superposition]] \n* [[Principle of lateral continuity]]\n* [[Principle of cross-cutting relationships]]\n* [[Principle of faunal succession]]\n* [[Law of included fragments|Principle of inclusions and components]] \n* [[Walther's law]] \n\n== Other fields ==\nSome [[Mathematics|mathematical]] [[theorem]]s and [[axiom]]s are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.\n\nExamples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the [[Titius\u2013Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, and [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of [[uncomfortable science]]. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[law of unintended consequences]]. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as \"laws\". These include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of philosophy and the [[Pareto principle]] of economics.\n\n== History ==\nThe observation that there are underlying regularities in nature dates from [[prehistoric]] times, since the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships is an implicit recognition that there are laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws ''[[Per se (phrase)|per se]]'', though, was limited by their entanglement in [[animism]], and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes\u2014such as [[meteorological]], [[astronomical]] and [[biological]] phenomena\u2014to the actions of various [[deity|gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[supernatural being]]s, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.\n\nAccording to a positivist view, when compared to [[pre-industrial society|pre-modern]] accounts of [[causality]], laws of nature replace the need for [[causality#Religion and theology|divine causality]] on the one hand, and accounts such as [[Plato]]'s [[theory of forms]] on the other.\n\nIn Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (''[[physis]]'') began with the early [[History of science in classical antiquity|Greek philosophers and scientists]] and continued into the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.<blockquote>The formula \"law of nature\" first appears as \"a live metaphor\" favored by Latin poets [[Lucretius]], [[Virgil]], [[Ovid]], [[Marcus Manilius|Manilius]], in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux's persuasive narrative,<ref>in Daryn Lehoux, ''What Did the Romans Know? An Inquiry into Science and Worldmaking'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2012), reviewed by David Sedley, \"When Nature Got its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref> the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.<br/><br/>\nFor the Romans . . . the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca's [[Naturales quaestiones|''Natural Questions'']], and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to [[Ptolemy]]'s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.<ref>Sedley, \"When Nature Got Its Laws\", ''Times Literary Supplement'' (12 October 2012).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from  the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and development of advanced forms of mathematics.  During this period, [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]] such as [[Isaac Newton]] were influenced by a religious view which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/24/opinion/24davies.html|title=Taking Science on Faith|last=Davies|first=Paul|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2012/05/08/3498202.htm|title=Christianity and the rise of western science|last=Harrison|first=Peter|date=8 May 2012|website=ABC|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>  In chapter 7 of ''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'', [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] described \"nature\" as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts \"are to be attributed to nature.

[[Natural law]] in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period (by [[Grotius]], [[Spinoza]], and [[Hobbes]], to name a few).\n\nThe distinction between [[natural law]] in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from ''[[physis]]'', the Greek word (translated into Latin as ''natura'') for ''nature''.<ref>Some modern philosophers, e.g. [[Norman Swartz]], use \"physical law\" to mean the laws of nature as they truly are and not as they are inferred by scientists.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.
