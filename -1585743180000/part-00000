He studied at the universities of [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and later taught at both. Influenced by [[Thomas Aquinas]], he was a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian.\n\nWinchelsey held various benefices in England and was the [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of Oxford University]] before being elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he initially had the support of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Winchelsey later became a forceful opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward's attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king's treasurer [[Walter Langton]] as well as other clergy. On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nFollowing the election of a former royal clerk as Pope [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]]. Winchelsey died in 1313.

When he swore his oath of fealty to Edward, he offended the king by adding a declaration that he was only swearing fealty for the [[temporalities]], not the [[spiritualities]]. All through his term as archbishop he refused to allow Edward to tax the clergy beyond certain levels, and withstood severe pressure to change his mind. In August 1295, he offered the king a tenth of all ecclesiastical revenues, less than Edward had hoped to collect from the clergy. Winchelsey did concede though that if the war with France, which was what the money was requested to fund, continued into the following year, then the clergy would be amenable to making further contributions.<ref name=Edward405>Prestwich. ''Edward I'' p. 405</ref>\n\nFollowing the issue of the papal bull ''[[Clericis laicos]]'' in 1296, forbidding the payment of taxes to a secular power, Winchelsey urged his clergy in 1297 to refuse payments to Edward. However, the clergy of the province of York paid a tax of a fifth of their revenues. Edward then declared clerics who refused to pay outlaws, and ordered their property to be seized. He conceded that the clergy could return to his protection if they paid a fine of a fifth of their revenues, exactly what the northern clergy had offered in the way of taxation. The royal clerks and many other clergy paid the fines, and in March, the southern clergy met again, and after a long debate, Winchelsey instructed each clerk to decide for himself whether or not to pay the fine. It appears that most chose to pay,<ref name=Edward415>Prestwich. ''Edward I'' pp. 415\u201317.</ref> but the archbishop still refused to make any contribution, and so Edward seized his lands.

One of the reasons which led the archbishop to ally with the barons was his hostility to Edward's adviser, Walter Langton, Bishop of [[Lichfield]].

He studied at the universities of [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and later taught at both. Influenced by [[Thomas Aquinas]], he was a [[scholasticism|scholastic]] theologian.\n\nWinchelsey held various benefices in England and was the [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of Oxford University]] before being elected to Canterbury in early 1293. Although he initially had the support of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], Winchelsey later became a forceful opponent of the king. The archbishop was encouraged by the papacy to resist Edward's attempts to tax the clergy. Winchelsey was also an opponent of the king's treasurer [[Walter Langton]] as well as other clergy. On one occasion he rebuked an abbot so sternly that the abbot suffered a fatal heart attack.\n\nFollowing the election of a former royal clerk as Pope [[Pope Clement V|Clement V]] in 1305, the king was able to secure the archbishop's exile that same year. Upon the succession of Edward's son, [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], Winchelsey was allowed to return to England after the new king petitioned the pope to allow his return. Winchelsey soon joined the king's enemies, however, and was the only bishop to object to the return of the king's favourite, [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]]. Winchelsey died in 1313. Although miracles were alleged to have happened at his tomb, an attempt to have him declared a saint was unsuccessful.\n\n==Early life==\n[[Image:Laurentius de Voltolina 001.jpg|thumb|right|Medieval lecturer from a painting by [[Laurentius de Voltolina]], second half of the 14th century.

Options for the future of the wall include recreating the wall in the atrium of the new Windmill Lane building, giving the wall to Dublin City Council, U2 or any other interested party for reconstruction or reuse in an alternative setting. Another possibility is donating the wall to a charity so that they can auction pieces of it to U2 fans around the world.\n\n==History of current location==\n{{COI|section|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Windmill Lane Studio One .jpg|alt=|thumb|492x492px|Studio One Control Room]]\nIn 1990, Windmill Lane Studios relocated from its original base on Windmill Lane to its current location on Ringsend Road, Dublin 4.<ref name=\"about\"/>\n\nOrchestras regularly record their music at Windmill Lane Recording Studios, as Studio One is the only recording room in Ireland that can record an 80-piece orchestra apart from [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]].<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\" /> The scores to many movies have been recorded there: ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission Impossible]]'', ''[[Sing Street|Syng Street]]'', ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'' and ''[[The Tailor of Panama (film)|The Tailor of Panama]]''<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\" />'', [[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', ''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' (both by [[Elmer Bernstein]]), ''[[In America (film)|In America]]'', and ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]''.<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\" />\n\nStudio Two is known for being responsible for a high number of number-one albums, recorded by artists such as [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]], [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[The Spice Girls]].<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\"/> [[Kate Bush]] partially recorded her 1985 album ''Hounds of Love'' at Windmill Lane Studios.<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\"/> [[The Waterboys]] recorded their 1988 album ''Fisherman's Blues'' at Windmill Lane Studios.<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\"/>\n\nThe studio remained empty from 2006 onwards, although reports circulated which linked Van Morrison with purchasing the studio for his own personal use that August.<ref name=\"Ghostly echoes as U2 studio is revived\"/><ref name=\"Van Morrison buys Windmill Lane Studios\"/> Morrison had previously recorded several albums there, including ''[[Back on Top (Van Morrison album)|Back on Top]]'', ''[[Magic Time (Van Morrison album)|Magic Time]]'' and ''[[Pay the Devil]]''.<ref name=\"Van Morrison buys Windmill Lane Studios\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/2878631.html|title=Van Morrison buys Windmill Lane Studios|date=2006-08-11|accessdate=2009-06-20|magazine=[[Hot Press]]}}</ref> In January 2008, the studio was used to record \"[[The Ballad of Ronnie Drew]]\".<ref name=\"Cream of Irish music in tribute to Dubliner as he battles with cancer\">{{cite news|author=Richie Taylor|url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/cream-of-irish-music-in-tribute-to-dubliner-as-he-battles-with-cancer-1268435.html|title=Cream of Irish music in tribute to Dubliner as he battles with cancer|date=2008-01-18|accessdate=2009-08-21|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Dale Entertainments Ltd. took over Windmill Lane Recording Studios and updated the studios.

Some progress had been made by 1942 when the program was cancelled as the threat of German air attack dwindled. Further research was directed at a dedicated air-to-air design, [[Artemis (missile)|Artemis]].\n\n==Spaniel SAMs==\nDevelopment of cast [[solid fuel rocket]]s began at the [[Royal Arsenal|Woolwich Arsenal]] in the years immediately before the opening of [[World War II]]. This research was moved to the newly-formed [[Ministry of Supply]] Projectile Development Establishment at [[Fort Halstead]]. Three designs were initially developed under the name [[Unrotated Projectile]], a {{convert|2|inch|mm|abbr=on}} diameter short-range weapon, a {{convert|7|inch|abbr=on}} short-range weapon that carried a large warhead or a wire intended to snag aircraft, and the {{convert|3|inch|abbr=on}} anti-bomber weapon that triggered by a [[photoelectric cell]] intended to fire when it lost illumination by a [[searchlight]] as it passed the target.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=11}}\n\nAs the development of the UP series continued, in 1941 the idea was raised that the same photoelectric system could be used to guide the rocket, not just trigger it.

In an era when several thousand [[anti-aircraft artillery]] rounds had to be fired to get a single \"kill\", the idea that a small number of rockets could achieve the same seemed like an enormous advantage, and at a predicted price of \u00a3130 per round, the concept seemed to be dramatically less expensive as well.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=11}}\n\nFor manoeuvering, the basic 3-inch UP was modified by adding long wings running along the fuselage from just behind the nose to just in front of the tail-mounted fins. Those fins, initially triangular and fixed in position on the UP-3, were replaced by rectangular ones that rotated for control. Two guidance systems were developed. The first, PE Spaniel, used the original photoelectric guidance system. The cell was mounted in a pod at the end of one of the wings and sent control inputs to the movable rear-mounted fins. The second, RDF Spaniel, used [[beam riding]] using the signal from the [[GL Mark III radar]] sets.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=11}}\n\nIn testing, it was found that the energy needed to manoeuvre the rocket in flight greatly limited its range, to the point where it was no longer able to effectively reach target altitudes.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]]. Both were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that devoloped at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>   \n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not devolop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its contitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the devolopment of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existance of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some atleast relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Scince and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching univesity which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accomodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accomodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October of 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27th March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers. \n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their choosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914. <ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet inspite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]]. He announced his discovery on February 28, 1928 and was awarded the Noble Prize in Physics, the day widely celebrated as [[National Science Day|the National Science Day]] in India.

A galaxy of Indian scientists joined the Chairs set up with the income of the endowments of nearly '''thirty seven and half lakhs rupees''' donated by [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]] and [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]]. Both were associated with the National Education Movement in Bengal since the Indian Universities Act of 1904-5 and the partition of Bengal in 1905.\n\nThe first group of faculties included [[Acharya Prafulla Chandra Ray]], [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]], [[Ganesh Prasad]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra]] and the legendary 1915 M.Sc. batch comprising [[Satyendranath Bose]], [[Meghnad Saha]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Jnanendra Nath Mukherjee]] among others.<ref name=\"caluniv-ucsta1\"/> The holders of the Chairs often worked under great financial constraints and with whatever apparatus was locally available in Calcutta. Yet their scientific research was soon to put Calcutta University on the map of World Recognition. The science that devoloped at Calcutta University in colonial India was not a colonial science, as it was hardly supported by any large scale imperial funds and was solely meant for ''\"The promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education for the cultivation and advancement of science, both pure and applied among Indians\".''<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>   \n\n===Science in Calcutta University before 1914===\n\nOne reason why Calcutta University could not devolop a research programme in science earlier than 1914 was partly because of a great handicap inherent in its contitution and partly because of the paucity of funds needed for the devolopment of such an institute at the post-graduation level. Till the end of 19th century Calcutta University remained mainly an examination body fed by a number of affiliated colleges which actually did teaching and which were dispersed from [[Shimla]] and [[Mussorie]] to [[Indore]] and [[Jaipur]], and from [[Jaffna]] and [[Batticaloa]] to [[Sylhet]] and [[Chittagong]]. In these colleges there was hardly any provision for teaching of science courses with the exception of three colleges each in Civil Engineering and Medicine, all the 85 colleges in British India by 1882 were teaching courses in liberal arts leading to matriculation, F.A., B.A., Honours and M.A. Career in India was never virtually open to talents, through the principle had been asserted time and again allay fear in the Charter Act of 1883 and the Queen's Proclamation of 1858 after the Mutiny to allay fear, suspecion and distrust. In those days agriculture, manufacturing and commerce offered little to no incentives and was almost impossible to initiate without proper skills, capital and equality of terms with which it could compete with the European industry. Such discontenment among the educated unemployed gave rise to militant nationalism threatening the existance of very British Raj in India. Higher education in India was singled out as the root for all evils. So to curb this growing distress, [[Lord Curzon]] (then Viceroy of India) passed the Indian University Act in 1904 based on the recommendation of the Indian University Commission in 1902. While the various recommendations of the Commission to enable the Raj to control higher education in India were not strictly relevant here, some atleast relating to the creation of new courses in science became important. The commission for the first time suggested the creation of the Faculty of Scince and Technology in addition to the faculties of Arts, Law, Medicine and Civil Engineering previously offered by Calcutta University. Thus Bachelor of Science(B.Sc.) and Master of Science(M.Sc.) courses were introduced for first time in India. The commission also recommended the award of Doctor of Science(D.Sc.) degree which is to be given to a M.Sc. after some years spent in original investigations.\n\nWhen [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Ashutosh Mookerjee]] became the Vice Chancellor of Calcutta University in 1906, seized the Indian University Act of 1904-5 and converted the university from an examination body to a teaching univesity which will not only start post graduate degrees in Humnanities, English, Sanskrit, Pali, Arabic, Persian, Mental & Moral Phyilosophy, History, Economics and Mathematics but also establish chairs in some of them with financial support from the government by 1912. But for seven years, Mookerjee struggled hard to establish postgraduate teaching and research in Science and Technology despite his best intentions. The paucity of funds and accomodations were deplorable which meant that even if there were men, there was no accomodation laboratories, workshops, museums, equipments etc. In Presidency College a small room measuring 35'6\" by 25'6\" was available to be used as a laboratory room, preparation room and as well as a practical room for biology and physiology classes, whereas a large number of B.A. students did not get the opportunity of having a regular course of practical training.<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n\n===Establishment of the University College of Science and Technology===\n\nIn these circumstances, [[Calcutta University]] was pleasantly surprised to receive the princely gifts of [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], an eminent barrister and advocate of national education during the Anti-Partition movement(1905). In June and October of 1912, he donated total assets of fourteen and a half lakh rupees which included his own dwelling house. His donations were made over to the university for the advancement of Science and Technology and were used to maintain the income of endowment of Physics and Chemistry Chair and also to institute scholarships to distinguished graduates of Calcutta University for higher studies. The university had to provide \"from its own funds\" suitable lecture rooms, libraries, museums, laboratories, workshops and other facilities for teaching and research. As the funds provided by the University was not fully adequate, Mookerjee approached the Government of India for financial support. which was rejected by [[Henry Sharp]] who was the joint secretary in department of education. The opposition of Sharp mainly emanated from his dislike of Calcutta University which he considered will become a non-political body with strong prejudice against the white men and the Europeans. He said, \"To give this money to this place is to give money to the cause which will embarrass ourselves. The money will go to political ends rather than to truly educational ends.\"\n\nIn August 1913, [[Rash Behari Ghosh|Sir Rashbehari Ghosh]], an eminent jurist and scholar, in a letter to Asutosh Mookerjee placed in the hands of the University \"a sum of ten lakh rupees\" as per the conditions of his gift, there were to be established four chairs - one each for Applied Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Botany, with special reference to Agriculture, and eight studentships to be awarded to the distinguished graduates of this University \"to carry on investigation\" under the guidance of a professor. Both Palit and Ghosh wanted promotion and diffusion of scientific and technical education among their countrymen by indigenous agency and with the money now available through their endowments, Mookerjee could now launch his projected dream. Thus four days before the expiry of the fourth term of his Vice-Chancellorship, Mookerjee laid the founding stone of the University College of Science and Technology on 27th March 1914 hoping fervently that \"although the College of Science and Technology is an integral part of the University of Calcutta, it will be regarded not as a provincial but as an all-India college of Science and Technology to which students will flock from every corner of the Indian Empire, attracted by the excellence of the instruction imparted and of the facilities  provided for research.\"\n\nThe influence of the teachings of [[Raja Rammohan Roy]]  on the importance of education broadly based on science and technology impressed a group of newly graduated scientists [[S.N. Bose]], [[Jnan Chandra Ghosh]], [[Meghnad Saha|M.N. Saha]], [[N.R. Sen]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis|P.C. Mahalanobis]], [[Sisir Kumar Mitra|S.K. Mitra]] and [[Jnanendranath Mukherjee]]. [[Ashutosh Mukherjee|Sir Asutosh Mukherjee]] believed in young talents, selected promising young men and appointed them straightaway  as lecturers in post graduate classes of newly formed Sc. College and provided them research facilities also. He was the first and perhaps the last to establish a centre of academic studies at the University stage with distinct atmosphere of learning and scholarships and appointed some of the best men available in the country as University Professor or Lecturers. \n\nThe establishment of the Calcutta University College of Science and Technology signals the beginning of outstanding research in some branches of science and applied science, which put India on the map of World Recognnition. A galaxy of Indian Scientists joined the departments set up with the income of edowments donated by Palit and Ghosh and began their work in Science with whatever apparatus available in India and soon made their mark in their choosen fields. Palit Chairs in Physics and Chemistry and Ghosh Chairs in Applied Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics and Botany were soon filled up after the formal establishment of the University College of Science and Technology in March 1914. <ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n\n===Keys to the Start of Outstanding Research in \"Non-Colonial\" Science in Colonial India===\n\nThe establishment of Chairs in Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Zoology and Botany was the start of outstanding research and teaching by dedicated Indian Scientists. [[Asutosh Mookerjee|Sir Asutosh Mookerjee]] who became the first president of the first session of the Indian Science Congress at Calcutta, where nearly a hundred scientist met in 26 January 1914, took great care to identify the right talent for the right post from different parts of India in science as in humanities and was able to attribute to the \"University College of Science and Technology\" as a true national character. No nation could live solely upon the achievements of its past or upon its borrowing from others, and at the same time hoped to retain its place among the great people of the Earth. Besides advancing the frontiers of knowledge, the work by the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology not only helped in increasing the wealth of the country but also succeeded in drawing attention of the scientific world. The dedication and devotion with which the Indian Scientists at the University College of Science and Technology began their work to explain the many unknown phenomena can only remind us of the zeal and enthusiasm with which William Jones and his choice band of thirty elite Englishmen in 1783-84 had began their investigations into \"the history and antiquities, arts, sciences and literature of Asia.\"\n\nDespite the fact that the University College of Science and Technology was a department of Calcutta University set up as a part of the colonial educational despatch of 1854. there had been no substantial financial support from the British Raj to encourage the Indian Scientists in their works presumably under the idea that Indian brains were not suitable for scientific research despite great promise shown by [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] at the [[Presidency College]] years before the foundation of the University College of Science and Technology. Of the total expenditure of rupees 18, 13, 959 of the University College of Science and Technology between March 1914 and March 1922, the Government of India's contributions from public funds was a meagre rupees 1, 20, 000 only. Yet inspite of these financial contraints and difficulties none of the scientists left for better position in imperial organisations. Instead classic example was provided by [[Prafulla Chandra Ray]] who when re-appointed Palit Professor for 5 years after reaching the age of superannuation donated his full monthly salary for the entire period for the special benefit of his department which was \"proud to acknowledge him as its leader\". During this difficult time, there had  been \"a steady output of original work rapidly increasing in volume and improving in quality which emanated not from one or two extraordinarily isolated or exceptionally gifted workers blessed with special advantages and facilities, but from a large body of able and devoted scholars\". No doubt, the scientists at the University College of Science and Technology sowed the sowed the seeds of many a promissing project which were to bear fruits in the post-independence years. The University College of Science and Technology was indeed as oasis of scienctific research in India since 1914.<ref>https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol29_1_6_SCGhosh.pdf</ref>\n \n[[Sir C.V. Raman]], A Palit Professor of Sc. College made this revolutionary discovery on the \"Scattering of Light\" which is known as [[Raman Effect|The Raman Effect]].
