He acted as leader of the [[Culper Ring]] during the war, a celebrated network of spies in New York where major British forces were based. He also led a successful raid across [[Long Island]] that culminated in the [[Battle of Fort St. George]]. Following the war, Tallmadge was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nTallmadge was born February 25, 1754, the son of Susannah Smith (1729\u20131768) and Rev.

Benedict Arnold's British contact [[John Andr\u00e9]] was caught and taken to North Castle, where commander Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with Andr\u00e9 to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected Andr\u00e9 to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, and he tried to have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson to send a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and to send the documents to George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. Andr\u00e9 was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.\n\nOn November 21, 1780, Tallmadge and his dragoons rowed across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] to [[Cedar Beach (Brookhaven, New York)|Cedar Beach]] in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The next day, they proceeded to the south shore where they captured and burned down [[Manor St. George]]. On their march back to Mt. Sinai, Tallmadge stopped in [[Coram, New York]] and ordered the burning of 300 tons of hay which the British had been stockpiling for the winter. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:\n<blockquote>I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time. I beg you to accept my thanks for your spirited execution of this business.<ref>Bayles, Thomas R. \"The Early Years in Middle Island, Coram, Yaphank, and Ridge.\" Ed. Suzanne Johnson.

He is best known for his service as an officer in the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He acted as leader of the [[Culper Ring]] during the war, a celebrated network of spies in New York where major British forces were based. He also led a successful raid across [[Long Island]] that culminated in the [[Battle of Fort St. George]]. Following the war, Tallmadge was elected to the United States House of Representatives as a member of the [[Federalist Party]].\n\n==Early life==\nTallmadge was born February 25, 1754, the son of Susannah Smith (1729\u20131768) and Rev. Benjamin Tallmadge Sr. (1725\u20131786), a clergyman in [[Setauket, New York]], a hamlet of the Town of [[Brookhaven, New York]] on [[Long Island]].<ref name=\"Appleton's\">[https://archive.org/stream/appletonscyclop06wilsrich/appletonscyclop06wilsrich_djvu.txt Tallmadue, Benjamin: Soldier] [[Appleton's Cyclopedia of American Biography]], Vol. VI, pg.25,\nD.

Benedict Arnold's British contact [[John Andr\u00e9]] was caught and taken to North Castle, where commander Colonel Jameson ordered lieutenant Allen to take the incriminating documents found with Andr\u00e9 to their commander Benedict Arnold at West Point. Tallmadge suspected Andr\u00e9 to be a spy and Benedict Arnold to be his accomplice, and he tried to have Jameson reverse his orders. He was unsuccessful, but did convince Jameson to send a rider and take Andre to Salem, eight miles east of the Hudson River and to send the documents to George Washington. Allen still reported to Benedict Arnold with Jameson's note outlining the events. Later, Jameson was chastised by Washington for warning Arnold and allowing his escape. Andr\u00e9 was placed in Tallmadge's custody awaiting execution.\n\nOn November 21, 1780, Tallmadge and his dragoons rowed across Long Island Sound from [[Fairfield, Connecticut]] to [[Cedar Beach (Brookhaven, New York)|Cedar Beach]] in [[Mount Sinai, New York]]. The next day, they proceeded to the south shore where they captured and burned down [[Manor St. George]]. On their march back to Mt. Sinai, Tallmadge stopped in [[Coram, New York]] and ordered the burning of 300 tons of hay which the British had been stockpiling for the winter. George Washington, on hearing the news, sent the following letter to Tallmadge:\n<blockquote>I have received with much pleasure the report of your successful enterprise upon fort St. George, and was pleased with the destruction of the hay at Coram, which must be severely felt by the enemy at this time. I beg you to accept my thanks for your spirited execution of this business.<ref>Bayles, Thomas R. \"The Early Years in Middle Island, Coram, Yaphank, and Ridge.\" Ed. Suzanne Johnson.
