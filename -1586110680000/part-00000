{"title_page": "History of Icelandic nationality", "text_new": "This article is about the '''history of Icelandic nationality'''.\n\n== Icelandic constitution ==\nIn 930 AD, the constitution of [[Iceland]] was instituted which made Iceland a self-governing country with a people's assembly called the [[Althing]] (''al\u00feingi''). The Althing represented the people and met once a year to make laws and judge important cases. Matters of lesser importance were dealt with by local spring assemblies, regulated by local chiefs. The Althing was an important part of Icelandic culture and would be integral in their struggle to become an independent nation.<ref name=\"Hastrup_40\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=40}}</ref>\n\n== Iceland under Norway and Denmark ==\nIn 1262 Iceland swore allegiance to the king of [[Norway]], and in 1380 was under the rule of the newly united kingdom of Norway and [[Denmark]]. Nevertheless, the Althing continued to control the national politics of Iceland due to the indifference of the monarch to its remote population. In 1660, Denmark became an absolutist state and the power of the Althing was diminished significantly. It now held mainly judicial functions, without any legislative power, but was finally abolished in 1800.<ref name=\"Hastrup_40\"/>\n\n== Nationalist movements in Iceland ==\nThe nationalist movement in Iceland sprang from the romantic literary ideas of the Enlightenment such that nationalistic ideas were originally expressed in the literature of the period and were only later to be involved in the political events of the country.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=44}}</ref>\n\nThe abolition of the Althing was a shock to the identity of Iceland. It had not only served as a legislative and judicial body but also had brought the Icelandic communities together annually which served as a unifying force in society. It had become an important part of Icelandic culture and tradition. In 1843, the Althing was successfully re-established as an advisory board to the Danish government, which was a great victory for Icelandic nationalism after what the Althing had come to symbolize for the community.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\"/>\n\nIn 1851, the Althing proposed a separate constitution for Iceland, which resulted in the attempt of the Danish representatives to end the meeting, to the protest of the Icelanders. This was Iceland's first national conflict with Denmark in the political domain.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\"/>\n\nBy 1871, Iceland was still part of the Danish kingdom; however, by this point in time nationalists had managed to pass a law allowing Iceland to trade with all nations (1854) and had liberalized its election laws (1857). Iceland as such had control over much of its own affairs, although still under Danish rule.\n\nA demand for their own constitution, giving legislative power to the Althing was granted in 1874, giving Iceland control of all internal affairs and in 1903 an Icelandic cabinet minister replaced the Danish governors.<ref>{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=19}}</ref><ref name=\"Hastrup_45\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=45}}</ref> By 1918 Iceland became a sovereign state in union with Denmark, and in 1944 Iceland was declared a sovereign republic.<ref name=\"Hastrup_45\"/>\n\nImportance was placed on the idea that the new nation must be based on Icelandic ideas, and not imported ones from [[Europe]].<ref>{{harvp|Thorhallson|2004|p=131}}</ref> The traditions of the Icelandic people were to be used to guide the new republic, which hoped to develop independently from [[Europe]], with emphasis on its distinctive culture and history.\n\n==Nationality laws==\n{{main|Icelandic nationality law}}\nAncestry is considered by Icelandic nationality law to be the important factor in attaining citizenship, rather than place of birth. Therefore, one is not an Icelandic citizen just by being born in Iceland, but must be born of Icelandic parents.\n\n==Emigration==\nIn the late 19th century Iceland was faced with a series of natural disasters that forced one fifth of the population to emigrate to North America by 1914. The volcanic eruption of Askja left the North East of Iceland covered in ash, where the largest number of people were forced to leave the country. Poor harvests, due to harsh winters and cold summers, throughout the country also forced large populations to leave Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |author=Valgeir Thorvaldsson |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |title=Why emigrate? |publisher=Icelandic Emigration Center |url=http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224071008/http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> Those descendants born outside of Iceland, or who acquired citizenship from the country they emigrated to would lose their Icelandic citizenship. Before 2003, dual citizenship was not permitted, therefore naturalizing in a foreign country would mean losing your Icelandic citizenship. Those people who lost their citizenship in this manner, however, were given the chance to reclaim Icelandic citizenship after 2003, but only until July 1, 2007. At present, those born outside of Iceland will lose their Icelandic citizenship by age twenty two if they do not live in Iceland before this time or do not apply to retain their citizenship. They do not need to give up their citizenship in their country of residence.\n\n==Rights==\n\n===Education===\nPublic education is funded by the Icelandic government and is compulsory for students fifteen years and younger. Education is free for all citizens from the primary to the university level providing all citizens with the right to education.<ref name=\"BDHRL\">{{harvp|Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|2006}}</ref> Children of refugees can be enrolled in public school after residing in the country for three months, providing education as a right not only for all citizens but also for all children in the country.\n\n===Health care===\nPrenatal and infant medical care is provided without cost to all citizens, while health care for children is highly subsidized. Refugees also have access to the health care services provided by the state.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> Law provides the right of access to health care for all people who have been residing in the country for six months, regardless of nationality. Hospitalisation is free of charge, as well as long-term care of the sick or elderly. Medication and treatment outside of hospitals requires the payment of specific fees, which are regulated by law.<ref name=\"MIC\">{{cite web |author=Multicultural and Information Center |title=Health |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |url=http://www.mcc.is/page.asp?Id=544&sid=259&topid=0}}</ref>\n\n==Women's rights==\nIn Iceland, women hold equal rights as men under judicial and family law. Men, however, are still paid more than women working in the same field.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> The Icelandic government helps to finance a variety of organizations and facilities to help women that are victims of violence. This aid is not restricted to citizens alone, but is open to all women, including immigrants who suffer from abuse.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> With regards to political representation, in 2005, there were 23 women sitting in parliament out of 63 seats, and 4 women in the cabinet, which has 12 members. 2 out of the 9 Supreme Court members were women so that in government office, women hold roughly one third of the seats.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/>\n\n==Freedom of speech and religion==\nFreedom of speech is provided for by law, but public slander based on religion, race, nationality, sexual orientation or skin color is illegal and punishable by fines and imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Citizens, therefore, are provided the right to free speech, as long as it does not endanger or demean other people. The right to peaceful assembly and associations are also protected by the constitution, as well as freedom of religion. However, Lutheranism, the state religion, is provided with more funding than other religions and more priority in school curricula.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Taxation==\nThe main obligation to the state in Iceland is paying taxes. Anyone who lives in Iceland for six months or longer is considered a resident and is, therefore, subject to the states income taxes, as well as municipal taxes. This applies for both citizens and non-citizens. All permanent residents over the age of sixteen are considered taxpayers and are provided a tax card, which is used to calculate their contributions. If someone is planning on leaving the country, they must submit their tax return one month before their departure.<ref name=\"MIC\"/>\n\n==Icelandic resistance to American involvement==\nIn 1946, Iceland joined the [[UN]] and as such became more involved in international affairs. Due to its strategic location for Trans-Atlantic flights, the United States took an interest in establishing an airbase in [[Keflav\u00edk]], for the needs of post war occupation of Germany. Keflav\u00edk was located only 50 kilometers from the capital, [[Reykjav\u00edk]], and as such there was fear that Icelandic culture would be compromised by this base.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=51}}</ref> The attempts to establish a 99-year control of this base by the Americans were met with great political outcry, as many saw this base as selling Iceland and its independence.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the American Defense Force were given permission to operate the first television station in Iceland. This station was intended for use by the American base only, but by 1959, there were already concerns since Icelandic citizens were able to receive the television signals. By 1964 the resistance to this station increased as many intellectuals feared that exposure to American television would be destructive to Icelandic language and culture as children became more influenced by American media.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=83}}</ref> Politically it was seen as opposition to Icelandic sovereignty to allow a foreign country to operate an influential television station in Iceland, especially since it was in a foreign language. The American television station, as well as radio station, were therefore confined to the base and Icelandic radio stations and television stations became more numerous.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=84}}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, a curfew was placed on the American servicemen requiring them to be in their base by ten o'clock, as a way to prevent their presence in the capital.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=95}}</ref> American presence was seen as a threat to Icelandic culture and independence.\n\n==Culture==\nIcelandic culture plays an important part in the national identity of the country and as such there have been several attempts to preserve it. One of the most important parts of this traditional culture are its sagas, which were passed down from the early Viking settlement of the island, and hold a strong significance towards national identity.<ref name=\"Grondal_13\">{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=13}}</ref> In 1946, Halldor Laxness's novel ''Atom Station'', the theme was of American presence damaging the culture in the south as compared to the pure saga culture of the north, as well as the use of Iceland as a base for an atomic war.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=55}}</ref>\n\nThe Althing was also viewed as a part of Icelandic culture due to its long tradition in Iceland and its use as a unifying force for the citizens of the country, as well as its status as the oldest parliament in the world.<ref name=\"Hastrup_40\"/><ref name=\"Grondal_13\"/>\n\nAnother aspect of culture held dear by many Icelanders is their history of non violence and neutrality. The idea of Iceland as an unarmed nation with no military force became a tradition which shaped the idea the population held about itself.<ref>{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=37}}</ref><ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=48}}</ref> It was this pacifism which stopped Iceland from joining the [[United Nations]] in 1944, and although it made contributions to the Allies, it would not declare war. When it did join the UN in 1946, the terms were that there would be no military bases in the country.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=49}}</ref> The importance placed on pacifism was a significant part of Icelandic national identity. When Iceland decided to join [[NATO]] in 1949, it resulted in a riot outside the Althing as this decision broke the historical tradition of neutrality that was viewed as important to Icelandic heritage.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=62}}</ref>\n\nLanguage was also an important factor in Icelandic nationality, where an emphasis was placed on making laws in their native language. A common language served as a unifying factor for Icelanders, as well as a way to distinguish themselves from the Danish and the laws of Denmark.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=38}}</ref> The modern Icelandic language is very similar to that of the Middle Ages, not having changed drastically, making it a source of historical continuity and part of an ongoing perception of the nation.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=104}}</ref> There has also been an attempt since the seventeenth century to keep the language free from influence of foreign words, which continued as a means to reassert independence. Foreign words were associated with foreign domination, creating a need to preserve the Icelandic language in while under Danish rule.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=105}}</ref> New vocabulary brought in by the [[Denmark|Danish]] or through [[Christianity]], therefore, were originally met with distrust, and seen as a threat to their autonomy. A national flag was also essential to the image of Iceland as an independent nation, asserting its distinctiveness from [[Denmark]].\n\n==Nordic Council==\nIn 1952 Iceland became part of the [[Nordic Council]],an organization between [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]] which consists of a governing body and five national secretariats, that meet annually and is attended by parliament members of the five countries. The council does not have any formal authority, but instead serves as an advisory council to the various governments.<ref>{{harvp|\u00d8rvik|1974|p=62}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, [[Sweden]] gave the right to vote in local elections to foreigners from countries within the [[Nordic Council]]. [[Denmark]] allowed the same right in 1977, followed by [[Norway]] in 1978 and [[Finland]] in 1981. In 1986. [[Iceland]] also granted members of the [[Nordic Council]] the right to vote in local elections but only after 3 years of residence in the country.<ref>{{cite web |author=Ronald Hayduk |title=Noncitizen voting around the world: an overview |publisher=Immigrant Voting Project |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |url=http://www.immigrantvoting.org/material/TIMELINE.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316090403/http://www.immigrantvoting.org/material/TIMELINE.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010}}</ref> Therefore, Icelandic citizens were given the right to vote in local elections in all other countries who were part of the [[Nordic Council]] by 1981, providing its citizens with some political rights if they emigrated to these countries, even if they had not become citizens. Also after, three years, non-citizens in Iceland could vote if they came from a [[Nordic Country]].\n\n==Membership of the European Union==\nSince May 2006, Iceland has opened its borders to workers that are part of the [[European Union]], who are now able to enter Iceland without the need of a work permit.<ref name=\"Veal\">{{cite web |author=Lowana Veal |date=November 22, 2006 |title=Iceland: migration appears here too |publisher=IPS |accessdate=November 23, 2007 |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901230526/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=35572 |archive-date=September 1, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> These workers are permitted to stay in Iceland for six months while looking for a job but once a job is found, the employer must inform the Directorate of Labour of the employment of a foreigner. Because of this policy, the population of foreigners in Iceland has risen from 1.4% in 1985 to almost 7% in 2006.\n\nThese workers are paid the same as the Icelandic population in jobs with fixed rates, but in jobs such as trades, they are commonly paid less. These foreigners are mostly males looking for employment, and 64% of the recent immigrants work in construction.<ref name=\"Veal\"/>\n\nPreference is given to [[European Union|EU]] members over non-Europeans and therefore it is more difficult for non-Europeans to find work in Iceland as employers must prove that the job was advertised in the [[European Union|EU]] before a work permit can be given to a non-European. This causes a problems for non-Europeans already residing in Iceland, who are faced with more difficulty when attempting to bring family into the country.<ref name=\"Veal\"/> Non-Europeans must find jobs for their family members before they would be allowed to enter the country, and since preference is given to members of the [[European Union]], finding jobs becomes more problematic.\n\n== Passports and visas ==\n[[Nordic Country]] members do not require any form of travel document or work permit to enter the country and are also provided the right to remain in Iceland for more than six months by providing a Nordic change of residence certificate.<ref name=\"MIC\"/>\n\nCitizens of countries from the [[European Union|EU]] also do not require a visa and are able to stay in Iceland for six months while looking for work.

When applying for residence the person must provide proof that they have health insurance and have the means to support themselves, as well as proof of a place of residence for their stay in Iceland. They must also provide their criminal record, proving they are not a criminal, before they will be permitted in the country.<ref name=\"MIC\"/> It is, therefore, more difficult for members outside of the EU and the Nordic Countries to gain entrance into Iceland.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|21em}}\n\n===References===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite web |author=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |year=2006 |title=Iceland: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2006/78817.htm |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Corgan |first=Michael T. |year=2002 |title=Iceland and its Alliances: Security for a Small State |location=Lewinton, NY |publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Grondal |first=Benedikt |year=1971 |title=Iceland: from Neutrality to NATO Membership |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=Universitetsforlaget |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book |last=Hastrup |first=Kirsten |year=1998 |title=A Place Apart: an Anthropological Study of the Icelandic World |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |isbn= |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last=\u00d8rvik |first=Nils |year=1974 |title=Nordic cooperation and high politics |journal=International Organization |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=61\u201388 |jstor=2706120 |ref=harv |doi=10.1017/s0020818300004367}}\n*{{cite book |editor-last=Thorhallson |editor-first=Baldur |year=2004 |title=Iceland and European Integration: On the Edge |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415282529 |ref=harv}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:History of nationality|Iceland]]\n[[Category:Icelandic society]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Iceland]]\n", "text_old": "This article is about the '''history of Icelandic nationality'''.\n\n== Icelandic constitution ==\nIn 930 AD, the constitution of [[Iceland]] was instituted which made Iceland a self-governing country with a people\u2019s assembly called the [[Althing]] (''al\u00feingi''). The Althing represented the people and met once a year to make laws and judge important cases. Matters of lesser importance were dealt with by local spring assemblies, regulated by local chiefs. The Althing was an important part of Icelandic culture and would be integral in their struggle to become an independent nation.<ref name=\"Hastrup_40\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=40}}</ref>\n\n== Iceland under Norway and Denmark ==\nIn 1262 Iceland swore allegiance to the king of [[Norway]], and in 1380 was under the rule of the newly united kingdom of Norway and [[Denmark]]. Nevertheless, the Althing continued to control the national politics of Iceland due to the indifference of the monarch to its remote population. In 1660, Denmark became an absolutist state and the power of the Althing was diminished significantly. It now held mainly judicial functions, without any legislative power, but was finally abolished in 1800.<ref name=\"Hastrup_40\"/>\n\n== Nationalist movements in Iceland ==\nThe nationalist movement in Iceland sprang from the romantic literary ideas of the Enlightenment such that nationalistic ideas were originally expressed in the literature of the period and were only later to be involved in the political events of the country.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=44}}</ref>\n\nThe abolition of the Althing was a shock to the identity of Iceland. It had not only served as a legislative and judicial body but also had brought the Icelandic communities together annually which served as a unifying force in society. It had become an important part of Icelandic culture and tradition. In 1843, the Althing was successfully re-established as an advisory board to the Danish government, which was a great victory for Icelandic nationalism after what the Althing had come to symbolize for the community.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\"/>\n\nIn 1851, the Althing proposed a separate constitution for Iceland, which resulted in the attempt of the Danish representatives to end the meeting, to the protest of the Icelanders. This was Iceland's first national conflict with Denmark in the political domain.<ref name=\"Hastrup_44\"/>\n\nBy 1871, Iceland was still part of the Danish kingdom; however, by this point in time nationalists had managed to pass a law allowing Iceland to trade with all nations (1854) and had liberalized its election laws (1857). Iceland as such had control over much of its own affairs, although still under Danish rule.\n\nA demand for their own constitution, giving legislative power to the Althing was granted in 1874, giving Iceland control of all internal affairs and in 1903 an Icelandic cabinet minister replaced the Danish governors.<ref>{{harvp|Grondal|1971|p=19}}</ref><ref name=\"Hastrup_45\">{{harvp|Hastrup|1998|p=45}}</ref> By 1918 Iceland became a sovereign state in union with Denmark, and in 1944 Iceland was declared a sovereign republic.<ref name=\"Hastrup_45\"/>\n\nImportance was placed on the idea that the new nation must be based on Icelandic ideas, and not imported ones from [[Europe]].<ref>{{harvp|Thorhallson|2004|p=131}}</ref> The traditions of the Icelandic people were to be used to guide the new republic, which hoped to develop independently from [[Europe]], with emphasis on its distinctive culture and history.\n\n==Nationality laws==\n{{main|Icelandic nationality law}}\nAncestry is considered by Icelandic nationality law to be the important factor in attaining citizenship, rather than place of birth. Therefore, one is not an Icelandic citizen just by being born in Iceland, but must be born of Icelandic parents.\n\n==Emigration==\nIn the late 19th century Iceland was faced with a series of natural disasters that forced one fifth of the population to emigrate to North America by 1914. The volcanic eruption of Askja left the North East of Iceland covered in ash, where the largest number of people were forced to leave the country. Poor harvests, due to harsh winters and cold summers, throughout the country also forced large populations to leave Iceland.<ref>{{cite web |author=Valgeir Thorvaldsson |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |title=Why emigrate? |publisher=Icelandic Emigration Center |url=http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224071008/http://www.hofsos.is/emigr.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2008}}</ref> Those descendants born outside of Iceland, or who acquired citizenship from the country they emigrated to would lose their Icelandic citizenship. Before 2003, dual citizenship was not permitted, therefore naturalizing in a foreign country would mean losing your Icelandic citizenship. Those people who lost their citizenship in this manner, however, were given the chance to reclaim Icelandic citizenship after 2003, but only until July 1, 2007. At present, those born outside of Iceland will lose their Icelandic citizenship by age twenty two if they do not live in Iceland before this time or do not apply to retain their citizenship. They do not need to give up their citizenship in their country of residence.\n\n==Rights==\n\n===Education===\nPublic education is funded by the Icelandic government and is compulsory for students fifteen years and younger. Education is free for all citizens from the primary to the university level providing all citizens with the right to education.<ref name=\"BDHRL\">{{harvp|Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|2006}}</ref> Children of refugees can be enrolled in public school after residing in the country for three months, providing education as a right not only for all citizens but also for all children in the country.\n\n===Health care===\nPrenatal and infant medical care is provided without cost to all citizens, while health care for children is highly subsidized. Refugees also have access to the health care services provided by the state.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> Law provides the right of access to health care for all people who have been residing in the country for six months, regardless of nationality. Hospitalisation is free of charge, as well as long term care of the sick or elderly. Medication and treatment outside of hospitals requires the payment of specific fees, which are regulated by law.<ref name=\"MIC\">{{cite web |author=Multicultural and Information Center |title=Health |accessdate=November 25, 2007 |url=http://www.mcc.is/page.asp?Id=544&sid=259&topid=0}}</ref>\n\n==Women's rights==\nIn Iceland, women hold equal rights as men under judicial and family law. Men, however, are still paid more than women working in the same field.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> The Icelandic government helps to finance a variety of organizations and facilities to help women that are victims of violence. This aid is not restricted to citizens alone, but is open to all women, including immigrants who suffer from abuse.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/> With regards to political representation, in 2005, there were 23 women sitting in parliament out of 63 seats, and 4 women in the cabinet, which has 12 members. 2 out of the 9 Supreme Court members were women so that in government office, women hold roughly one third of the seats.<ref name=\"BDHRL\"/>\n\n==Freedom of speech and religion==\nFreedom of speech is provided for by law, but public slander based on religion, race, nationality, sexual orientation or skin color is illegal and punishable by fines and imprisonment.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Citizens, therefore, are provided the right to free speech, as long as it does not endanger or demean other people. The right to peaceful assembly and associations are also protected by the constitution, as well as freedom of religion. However, Lutheranism, the state religion, is provided with more funding than other religions and more priority in school curricula.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Taxation==\nThe main obligation to the state in Iceland is paying taxes. Anyone who lives in Iceland for six months or longer is considered a resident and is, therefore, subject to the states income taxes, as well as municipal taxes. This applies for both citizens and non-citizens. All permanent residents over the age of sixteen are considered taxpayers and are provided a tax card, which is used to calculate their contributions. If someone is planning on leaving the country, they must submit their tax return one month before their departure.<ref name=\"MIC\"/>\n\n==Icelandic resistance to American involvement==\nIn 1946, Iceland joined the [[UN]] and as such became more involved in international affairs. Due to its strategic location for Trans-Atlantic flights, the United States took an interest in establishing an airbase in [[Keflav\u00edk]], for the needs of post war occupation of Germany. Keflav\u00edk was located only 50 kilometers from the capital, [[Reykjav\u00edk]], and as such there was fear that Icelandic culture would be compromised by this base.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=51}}</ref> The attempts to establish a 99-year control of this base by the Americans were met with great political outcry, as many saw this base as selling Iceland and its independence.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, the American Defense Force were given permission to operate the first television station in Iceland. This station was intended for use by the American base only, but by 1959, there were already concerns since Icelandic citizens were able to receive the television signals. By 1964 the resistance to this station increased as many intellectuals feared that exposure to American television would be destructive to Icelandic language and culture as children became more influenced by American media.<ref>{{harvp|Corgan|2002|p=83}}</ref> Politically it was seen as opposition to Icelandic sovereignty to allow a foreign country to operate an influential television station in Iceland, especially since it was in a foreign language.

After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson\u2019s 'complete' 'three major' philosophical works are: ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d\u2019Aristote'' [Vol. 1 & Vol. 2] (1837 and 1846); ''De l\u2019habitude'' (''On Habit'', 1838); and ''Rapport sur la philosophie en France au XIXeme si\u00e8cle'' (1867).<ref name=\"SinclairBI-6\">\"Sinclair (2019), p. 6</ref><ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-4-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), pp. 4-5</ref> Ravaisson also produced a number of other 'noteworthy essays' such as \"La Philosophie contemporaine\" (\"Contemporary Philosophy\", 1840); \"La Philosophie de Pascale\" (\"Pascal\u2019s Philosophy\", 1887), and \"M\u00e9taphysique et Morale\" (\"Metaphysics and Morals\", 1893).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref> Upon his death he also 'left unfinished fragments of a major work, which were published posthumously', first as \"Testament philosophique\" in ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale'' (\"Philosophical Testament\", 1901), then later in extended form as ''Testament philosophique'' (''Philosophical Testament'', 1933).<ref name=\"Carlisle&Sinclair-5\">\"Carlisle & Sinclair (2008), p. 5</ref><ref name=\"SinclairI-vii\">\"Sinclair (2016), p. vii</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border:none\"\n|-\n!

The title is a play on \"hair trigger\", referring to any weapon or other device with a sensitive trigger.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter opening credits underscored by a lively instrumental of \"[[Cheyenne (1906 song)|Cheyenne]]\", an old-fashioned train is seen rolling along through the desert. It passes another train going around a utility pole, and voices are heard repeating \"[[Bread and butter (superstition)|Bread and Butter]]\" with the engine blowing its whistle to a tune called \"Yankee Doodle\".\n\nBugs is riding in the mail car of a train, singing a nonsense song called [http://www.kididdles.com/lyrics/g002.html \"Go Get the Axe\"], when a pint-sized bandit attempts to rob the train (with the underscore playing stereotypical \"villain music\"), only to have it pass clear over his head. He then calls for his horse, which he needs a rolling step-stair to mount. He catches up and boards the train and begins to rob it while the mail clerk wraps himself in a package marked ''DON'T OPEN 'TIL [[XMAS]]''. The bandit accidentally throws Bugs Bunny in his sack. Bugs assumes he's [[Jesse James]]. The bandit scoffs and tells him (and the audience), \"I'm Yosemite Sam, the meanest, toughest, rip-roarin'-est, [[Edward Everett Horton]]-est ''hombre'' what ever packed a six-shooter!\" (This pattern of Sam introducing himself to Bugs and the audience continued in other cartoons.) Bugs tells Sam that there is another tough guy in the train packing a \"seven-shooter\", and Sam goes looking for him \u2013 and it's Bugs in disguise.\n\nVarious fights ensue, as each character temporarily gets the upper hand for a while. In one scene, Bugs dumps red ink on Sam, compelling him to think he's been shot; he collapses but eventually gets the joke. Sam pushes his face furiously into Bugs', then pulls back and with a quiet, offended tone asks, \"Why did you pour ink on mah haid?\"  After another skirmish, Bugs tricks Sam into dashing into a lounge car in which a horrific fight is occurring. Stock film footage of a stereotypical western saloon fight (taken from the Warner Bros. western film ''[[Dodge City (film)|Dodge City]]'', was used here). With the sounds of crashes and bangs in the background, Bugs calmly sings \"[[Sweet Georgia Brown]]\" to himself. Sam emerges tottering, banged and bruised, to a comical instrumental of \"[[Battle Cry of Freedom|Rally 'Round the Flag]]\", and a gag occurs where Bugs affects the stereotyped voice of an African-American train porter, and has the dazed Sam convinced he's supposed to disembark the train, piling him up with luggage; Sam even hands Bugs a silver coin as a tip, and Bugs says, \"Thank you, suh!\" As Sam steps off the moving train, the mail-drop hook grabs him and temporarily whisks him off the train. Bugs thinks he has vanquished Sam, and yells, \"So long, screwy, see ya in [[St. Louis|Saint Louie]]!\" a line that will be echoed in ''[[Wild and Woolly Hare]]'' and ''[[A Feather in His Hare]]''. But Sam gets back on board somehow. Bugs and Sam start a fight on top of the passenger carriages.\n\nFinally, Sam has Bugs tied up, dangling from a rope, weighted down by an anvil, and fiendishly cutting through the rope, while the train is passing over a gorge.

Will he be rendered [[non compos mentis]]?\").

The rink was called the [[North Avenue Ice Palace]], which was located in Baltimore, Maryland. A few years later, in 1896, the first ice hockey league in the United States was formed called The U.S. Amateur Hockey League. It was founded in New York City around the same time as the second artificial ice rink was opened in New York, New York, called the [[St. Nicholas Rink|St. Nicholas Arena]]. The U.S. Amateur Hockey League then became a member of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] in 1904. There were five teams from the United States and Ontario that formed the International Ice Hockey Federation. This league only lasted three seasons but it was the first professional ice hockey league that the United States participated in.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, teams in western Canada formed the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in 1911. This league created new designs and rules that helped ice hockey evolve into the game it is today. Some of these new innovations that were created were blue lines that were painted under the ice which divided the ice into three sections, goaltenders are allowed to fall and slide on the ice to help prevent the other team from scoring a goal, forward passing is permitted in the neutral zone, and the game was split into three periods of 20 minutes. In 1912, the game changed again reducing the number of on-ice players to six players from the previous seven.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\n==National Hockey League==\n{{Main article|History of the National Hockey League}}\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]] is the major professional hockey league in North America, with 24 U.S.-based teams and 7 Canadian-based teams competing for the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Xn7jMx1RYC&pg=PA912 |title=The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia |editor1-first=Andrew R.

[[Lord Stanley of Preston]] was appointed by [[Queen Victoria]] to be the Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888. While governor, Ice hockey was still just forming in Canada. He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival. During the carnival he watched the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. Since then he and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey. His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship. This trophy was a silver bowl inlaid with gold.  The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy was later changed to the famous name, The Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1914 the [[Portland Rosebuds (ice hockey)|Portland Rosebuds]], an American-based team, joined the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]].

Canada took the gold medal, with the United States getting the silver. The Canadians went on to claim three consecutive golds after the sport was permanently transferred to the newly established Winter Olympics in 1924. In 1936, their streak was ended by the British team that went on to beat the Canadians and tie the Americans, claiming the gold. Canada reclaimed gold in 1948 and defended it in 1952. However, the Soviet Union ended Canadian dominance in 1956, winning gold, and went on to win all Olympic tournaments until 1992 with 1960 and 1980, when the Americans were victorious, being lone exceptions. Much of this has to do with the fact that, unlike the Soviets, the Canadians were unable to use their best players. After 1992, four nations won gold medals: Canada (7th, 8th, and 9th titles), Sweden (1st and 2nd title), Czech Republic (1st title), and, the most recent champions, Russia (9th title). From 1998 to 2014, NHL players participated in the Olympics. In 1994 and 2018, players from all professional leagues except the NHL and AHL competed. Prior to 1947 there was no nationally recognized national governing body for ice hockey in the United States. The Amateur Hockey Association of the United States or AHAUS, which later became [[USA Hockey]], was created that year and has remained the governing body of ice hockey in the United States since then.

Four of the league's five teams are owned and operated by the league itself; the lone exception is the Whitecaps. In 2019, a player strike led to two of the NHL partnerships being severed and one of the teams, the [[Buffalo Beauts]], being placed into legal limbo after [[Pegula Sports and Entertainment]] (which had purchased the team in 2017) surrendered the NWHL franchise back to the league but not the intellectual property or arena lease. The player strike was brought on by a disconnect between the demands of the NWHL's players to be paid and treated more professionally than they have been, and the NWHL's inability to enter into the agreements necessary for those demands to be met.\n\n==Television coverage==\n{{main article|History of the National Hockey League on United States television}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1957, [[NHL on CBS|CBS]] was the first U.S. television network to carry NHL games.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1957/10/28/605545/the-hockey-rebellion\n|title=The Hockey Rebellion|date=October 28, 1957|first=Dan|last=Parker|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Later, the television network NBC also started carrying some NHL games.

The rink was called the [[North Avenue Ice Palace]], which was located in Baltimore, Maryland. A few years later, in 1896, the first ice hockey league in the United States was formed called The U.S. Amateur Hockey League. It was founded in New York City around the same time as the second artificial ice rink was opened in New York, New York, called the [[St. Nicholas Rink|St. Nicholas Arena]]. The U.S. Amateur Hockey League then became a member of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] in 1904. There were five teams from the United States and Ontario that formed the International Ice Hockey Federation. This league only lasted three seasons but it was the first professional ice hockey league that the United States participated in.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\nMeanwhile, teams in western Canada formed the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] in 1911. This league created new designs and rules that helped ice hockey evolve into the game it is today. Some of these new innovations that were created were blue lines that were painted under the ice which divided the ice into three sections, goaltenders are allowed to fall and slide on the ice to help prevent the other team from scoring a goal, forward passing is permitted in the neutral zone, and the game was split into three periods of 20 minutes. In 1912, the game changed again reducing the number of on-ice players to six players from the previous seven.{{fact|date=March 2018}}\n\n==National Hockey League==\n{{Main article|History of the National Hockey League}}\nThe [[National Hockey League|NHL]] is the major professional hockey league in North America, with 24 U.S.-based teams and 7 Canadian-based teams competing for the [[Stanley Cup]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n3Xn7jMx1RYC&pg=PA912 |title=The American Midwest: An Interpretive Encyclopedia |editor1-first=Andrew R.

[[Lord Stanley of Preston]] was appointed by [[Queen Victoria]] to be the Governor General of Canada on June 11, 1888. While governor, Ice hockey was still just forming in Canada. He first got to see the game of hockey played at Montreal's 1889 Winter Carnival. During the carnival he watched the Montreal Victorias play the Montreal Hockey Club. Since then he and his family became very involved in the game of ice hockey. His two sons, Arthur and Algernon, convinced their father to donate a trophy that would be considered to be a visible sign of the ice hockey championship. This trophy was a silver bowl inlaid with gold.  The trophy was first presented in 1893 and was called the Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup. The name of the trophy was later changed to the famous name, The Stanley Cup.\n\nIn 1914 the [[Portland Rosebuds (ice hockey)|Portland Rosebuds]], an American-based team, joined the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]].

However, the Soviet Union ended Canadian dominance in 1956, winning gold, and went on to win all Olympic tournaments until 1992 with 1960 and 1980, when the Americans were victorious, being lone exceptions. Much of this has to do with the fact that, unlike the Soviets, the Canadians were unable to use their best players. After 1992, four nations won gold medals: Canada (7th, 8th, and 9th titles), Sweden (1st and 2nd title), Czech Republic (1st title), and, the most recent champions, Russia (9th title). From 1998 to 2014, NHL players participated in the Olympics. In 1994 and 2018, players from all professional leagues except the NHL and AHL competed. Prior to 1947 there was no nationally recognized national governing body for ice hockey in the United States. The Amateur Hockey Association of the United States or AHAUS, which later became [[USA Hockey]], was created that year and has remained the governing body of ice hockey in the United States since then. The [[United States men's national ice hockey team|United States men's team]] has won two gold medals ([[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960]], [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|1980]]), eight silver medals ([[Ice hockey at the 1920 Winter Olympics|1920]], [[Ice hockey at the 1924 Winter Olympics|1924]], [[Ice hockey at the 1932 Winter Olympics|1932]], [[Ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics|1952]], [[Ice hockey at the 1956 Winter Olympics|1956]], [[Ice hockey at the 1972 Winter Olympics|1972]], [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002]], [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010]]) and one bronze medal ([[Ice hockey at the 1936 Winter Olympics|1936]]). The 1980 gold medal victory is still remembered as one of the greatest upsets in sporting history, with team USA beating four-time defending champions the USSR in the medal round. The [[United States women's national ice hockey team|women's team]] has won two gold medals ([[Ice hockey at the 1998 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|1998]], [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2018]]), three silver medals ([[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2002]], [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2010]], [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014]]), and one bronze medal ([[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|2006]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xdV_JV1fbZMC&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=Race%20and%20Ethnicity%20in%20the%20NHL&source=bl&ots=fiJmB3dwQJ&sig=LYuNSG2GvZD-I06xrvl7-0v8LUY&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH_76T_PLQAhUMLcAKHQM6Cys4ChDoAQgmMAI#v=snippet&q=ahaus&f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Ethnicity and Sports in the United States|first1=George B.|last1=Kirsch|first2=Othello|last2=Harris|first3=Claire Elaine|last3=Nolte|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=14 December 2016|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/olympics/story/_/id/12360850/miracle-ice-1980-us-olympic-hockey-team-reunites-lake-placid|title=All living 'Miracle' members reunite|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=22 February 2015|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/hockey/u-s-shocks-russians-4-3-article-1.2014732|title=Miracle on Ice!

Four of the league's five teams are owned and operated by the league itself; the lone exception is the Whitecaps. In 2019, a player strike led to two of the NHL partnerships being severed and one of the teams, the [[Buffalo Beauts]], being placed into legal limbo after [[Pegula Sports and Entertainment]] (which had purchased the team in 2017) surrendered the NWHL franchise back to the league but not the intellectual property or arena lease. The player strike was brought on by a disconnect between the demands of the NWHL's players to be paid and treated more professionally than they have been, and the NWHL's inability to enter into the agreements necessary for those demands to be met.\n\n==Television coverage==\n{{main article|History of the National Hockey League on United States television}}\n{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}\n\nIn 1957, [[NHL on CBS|CBS]] was the first U.S. television network to carry NHL games.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1957/10/28/605545/the-hockey-rebellion\n|title=The Hockey Rebellion|date=October 28, 1957|first=Dan|last=Parker|journal=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Later, the television network NBC also started carrying some NHL games.

With a population of over 3 million, it is the third most populous city in [[Nigeria]] after [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]]; it is the country's largest city by [[geographical area]]. At the time of Nigeria's independence in 1960, Ibadan was the largest and most populous city in the country, and the second most populous in Africa behind [[Cairo]].\n\nIbadan is located in south-western Nigeria, {{convert|128|km|mi}} inland northeast of Lagos and {{convert|530|km|mi}} southwest of [[Abuja]], the federal capital, and is a prominent [[Public transport|transit]] point between the coastal region and the areas in the hinterland of the country. Ibadan had been the centre of administration of the old [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] since the days of the [[British Empire|British]] colonial rule, and parts of the city's ancient protective walls still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]], as well as various communities from other parts of the country.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ibadan}}\nIbadan, coined from the phrase \"Eba Odan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Eba+Odan|title=Ibadan: How it was defined|last=|first=|date=|website=Ibadan name|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> which literally means 'by the edge of the plains', came into existence in 1829, during a period of turmoil that characterized [[Yorubaland]] at the time.<ref>Toyin Falola, Ann Genova, Matthew M. Heaton, ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 189</ref> It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as Abeokuta, new Oyo (Oyo atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them.<ref name=\"thecity\" /> According to local historians, [[Lagelu]] founded the city, and was initially intended to be a war camp for warriors coming from Oyo, [[Ife]] and [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ibadan-history/|title=Ibadan History|date=2016-02-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 metres, the location of the camp offered strategic defence opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a marketing centre for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas. \n[[File:Anna hinderer church and mission house at ibadan pic2.jpg|thumb|The church and mission in Ibadan]]\nIn 1852 the [[Church Missionary Society]] sent David and [[Anna Hinderer]] to found a mission. They decided to build the mission and a church in Ibadan when they arrived in 1853.<ref name=anna>Martin Lynn, \u2018Hinderer , Anna (1827\u20131870)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48961, accessed 18 March 2017]</ref>\n\nIbadan thus had initially begun as a military state and remained so until the last decade of the 19th century. The city-state also succeeded in building a large empire from the 1860s to the 1890s which extended over much of northern and eastern Yorubaland. It was appropriately nicknamed ''idi Ibon'' or \u201cgun base\u201d, because of its unique military character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/Global_Report/pdfs/Ibadan.pdf |title=Ibadan-FINAL_Anna2_XX.qxd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2019-02-17}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other Yoruba cities with traditional kingship institutions however, In Ibadan, the warrior class became the rulers of the city as well as the most important economic group.  \n \nIbadan grew into an impressive and sprawling [[Urban area|urban]] center so much that by the end of 1829, Ibadan dominated the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 region militarily, [[politically]] and [[economically]]. The military [[sanctuary]] expanded even further when [[refugees]] began arriving in large numbers from northern Oyo following raids by [[Fula people|Fulani]] warriors. After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding [[Fulani]]s, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs. The [[Fulani]] Caliphate attempted to expand further into the southern region of modern-day Nigeria, but was decisively defeated by the [[armies of Ibadan]] in 1840, which eventually halted their progress. The colonial period reinforced the position of the city in the Yoruba urban network. After a small boom in rubber business (1901-1913), cocoa became the main produce of the region and attracted European and [[Levant]]ine firms, as well as southern and northern traders from Lagos, Ijebu-Ode and Kano among others. The city became a major point of bulk trade. Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of [[Lagos]] were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939) which ranged from the northernmost areas of [[Oyo State]] to [[Ekeremor]], [[Bomadi]] and Patani, which were regions transferred from the old Delta province in the Old Western region and later Mid-west to the old Rivers state and later Bayelsa, in the redistricting of Nigeria carried out by the [[Yakubu Gowon]] administration shortly before the Nigerian civil war\n\n=== Colonial Ibadan ===\nIn 1893, Ibadan area became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Protectorate]] after a treaty signed by Fijabi, the Baale of Ibadan with the British acting Governor of [[Lagos Colony]], George C. Denton on 15 August.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtAkDl3OrQgC&pg=PA236&dq=awolowo+1954#v=onepage&q=awolowo%201954&f=false|title=Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s|author=Olufemi Vaughan|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> By then, the [[population]] had swelled to 120,000. The British developed the new colony to facilitate their [[commerce|commercial]] activities in the area, and Ibadan shortly grew into the major [[Trade|trading]] center that it is today.\n\n== Geography ==\nIbadan is located in south-western Nigeria in the southeastern part of [[Oyo State]] at about {{convert|119|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Lagos]] and {{convert|120|km|abbr=off}} east of the Nigerian international border with the [[Republic of Benin]]. It lies completely within the tropical forest zone but close to the boundary between the forest and the derived savanna. The city ranges in elevation from 150 m in the valley area, to 275 m above [[sea level]] on the major north\u2013south ridge which crosses the central part of the city. The city covers a total area of {{convert|3080|km2}}, the largest in Nigeria.\n\nThe city of Ibadan is naturally drained by four rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; [[Ogunpa River]] flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. [[Ogunpa River]], a third-order [[stream]] with a channel length of 12.76&nbsp;km and a catchment area of 54.92&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Lake Eleyele is located at the northwestern part of the city, while the [[Osun River]] and the [[Asejire Reservoir|Asejire Lake]] bounds the city to the east.\n\n=== Climate ===\nIbadan has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Aw''), with a lengthy [[wet season]] and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Ibadan's wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull nearly divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. November to February forms the city's [[dry season]], during which Ibadan experiences the typical [[West Africa]]n [[harmattan]]. The mean total rainfall for Ibadan is 1420.06&nbsp;mm, falling in \napproximately 109 days. There are two peaks for rainfall, June and September. The mean maximum temperature is 26.46 C, minimum 21.42 C and the relative humidity is 74.55%.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ibadan\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 37.2\n|Feb record high C = 38.9\n|Mar record high C = 38.3\n|Apr record high C = 37.2\n|May record high C = 35.0\n|Jun record high C = 33.3\n|Jul record high C = 31.7\n|Aug record high C = 31.7\n|Sep record high C = 35.6\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 33.9\n|Dec record high C = 35.6\n|year record high C = 38.9\n|Jan high C = 32.3\n|Feb high C = 34.0\n|Mar high C = 33.5\n|Apr high C = 32.3\n|May high C = 31.2\n|Jun high C = 29.6\n|Jul high C = 27.8\n|Aug high C = 27.2\n|Sep high C = 28.5\n|Oct high C = 29.7\n|Nov high C = 31.3\n|Dec high C = 31.9\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 25.7\n|Feb mean C = 26.9\n|Mar mean C = 26.9\n|Apr mean C = 26.3\n|May mean C = 25.6\n|Jun mean C = 25.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.6\n|Aug mean C = 23.1\n|Sep mean C = 23.9\n|Oct mean C = 24.3\n|Nov mean C = 25.6\n|Dec mean C = 25.5\n|year mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 20.9\n|Feb low C = 21.9\n|Mar low C = 22.5\n|Apr low C = 22.0\n|May low C = 21.7\n|Jun low C = 21.6\n|Jul low C = 21.2\n|Aug low C = 20.7\n|Sep low C = 21.8\n|Oct low C = 21.7\n|Nov low C = 21.6\n|Dec low C = 20.7\n|year low C = 21.5\n|Jan record low C = 10.0\n|Feb record low C = 11.1\n|Mar record low C = 15.0\n|Apr record low C = 18.3\n|May record low C = 17.8\n|Jun record low C = 17.8\n|Jul record low C = 16.1\n|Aug record low C = 15.6\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 17.8\n|Nov record low C = 15.6\n|Dec record low C = 11.1\n|year record low C = 10.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 10\n|Feb rain mm = 25\n|Mar rain mm = 91\n|Apr rain mm = 135\n|May rain mm = 152\n|Jun rain mm = 188\n|Jul rain mm = 155\n|Aug rain mm = 86\n|Sep rain mm = 175\n|Oct rain mm = 160\n|Nov rain mm = 46\n|Dec rain mm = 10\n|year rain mm = 1233\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 73\n|Mar humidity = 77\n|Apr humidity = 82\n|May humidity = 85\n|Jun humidity = 87\n|Jul humidity = 89\n|Aug humidity = 88\n|Sep humidity = 88\n|Oct humidity = 87\n|Nov humidity = 83\n|Dec humidity = 79\n|year humidity = 83\n|unit rain days = 0.3 mm\n|Jan rain days = 1\n|Feb rain days = 3\n|Mar rain days = 7\n|Apr rain days = 9\n|May rain days = 14\n|Jun rain days = 17\n|Jul rain days = 15\n|Aug rain days = 13\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 7\n|Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days = 123\n|Jan sun = 198.4\n|Feb sun = 197.8\n|Mar sun = 186.0\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 195.3\n|Jun sun = 147.0\n|Jul sun = 86.8\n|Aug sun = 65.1\n|Sep sun = 93.0\n|Oct sun = 164.3\n|Nov sun = 207.0\n|Dec sun = 220.1\n|year sun = 1940.8\n|Jand sun = 6.4\n|Febd sun = 7.0\n|Mard sun = 6.0\n|Aprd sun = 6.0\n|Mayd sun = 6.3\n|Jund sun = 4.9\n|Juld sun = 2.8\n|Augd sun = 2.1\n|Sepd sun = 3.1\n|Octd sun = 5.3\n|Novd sun = 6.9\n|Decd sun = 7.1\n|yeard sun = 5.3\n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_652080_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Ibadan / Nigeria\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 14 July 2016}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Administration ==\nThere are eleven (11) [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local Governments]] in Ibadan Metropolitan area consisting of five urban local governments in the city and six semi-urban local governments in the less city.

Filani, F.O. Akintola and C.O. Ikporukpo edited Ibadan Region, Rex\nCharles Publication, Ibadan, 1994 page 99.</ref> However, only 36.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was built up. This meant that the remaining 67&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were devoted to non-urban uses, such as farmlands, river floodplains, forest reserves and water bodies. These \u201cnon-urban land uses\u201d disappeared in the 1960s: an aerial photograph in 1973 revealed that the urban landscape had completely spread over about 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The land area increased from 136&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1981 to 210\u2013240&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1988-89 (Areola, 1994: 101).

In the 1980s, the Ibadan-Lagos expressway generated the greatest urban sprawl (east and north of the city), followed by the Eleiyele expressway (west of the city).

most populous city of [[Oyo State]], [[Nigeria]]. With a population of over 3 million, it is the third most populous city in [[Nigeria]] after [[Lagos]] and [[Kano]]; it is the country's largest city by [[geographical area]]. At the time of Nigeria's independence in 1960, Ibadan was the largest and most populous city in the country, and the second most populous in Africa behind [[Cairo]].\n\nIbadan is located in south-western Nigeria, {{convert|128|km|mi}} inland northeast of Lagos and {{convert|530|km|mi}} southwest of [[Abuja]], the federal capital, and is a prominent [[Public transport|transit]] point between the coastal region and the areas in the hinterland of the country. Ibadan had been the centre of administration of the old [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] since the days of the [[British Empire|British]] colonial rule, and parts of the city's ancient protective walls still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the [[Yoruba people|Yorubas]], as well as various communities from other parts of the country.\n\n== History ==\n{{see also|Timeline of Ibadan}}\nIbadan, coined from the phrase \"Eba Odan\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Eba+Odan|title=Ibadan: How it was defined|last=|first=|date=|website=Ibadan name|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> which literally means 'by the edge of the plains', came into existence in 1829, during a period of turmoil that characterized [[Yorubaland]] at the time.<ref>Toyin Falola, Ann Genova, Matthew M. Heaton, ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 189</ref> It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as Abeokuta, new Oyo (Oyo atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them.<ref name=\"thecity\" /> According to local historians, [[Lagelu]] founded the city, and was initially intended to be a war camp for warriors coming from Oyo, [[Ife]] and [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ibadan-history/|title=Ibadan History|date=2016-02-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04|language=en-US}}</ref> As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 metres, the location of the camp offered strategic defence opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a marketing centre for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas. \n[[File:Anna hinderer church and mission house at ibadan pic2.jpg|thumb|The church and mission in Ibadan]]\nIn 1852 the [[Church Missionary Society]] sent David and [[Anna Hinderer]] to found a mission. They decided to build the mission and a church in Ibadan when they arrived in 1853.<ref name=anna>Martin Lynn, \u2018Hinderer , Anna (1827\u20131870)\u2019, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48961, accessed 18 March 2017]</ref>\n\nIbadan thus had initially begun as a military state and remained so until the last decade of the 19th century. The city-state also succeeded in building a large empire from the 1860s to the 1890s which extended over much of northern and eastern Yorubaland. It was appropriately nicknamed ''idi Ibon'' or \u201cgun base\u201d, because of its unique military character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/Global_Report/pdfs/Ibadan.pdf |title=Ibadan-FINAL_Anna2_XX.qxd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2019-02-17}}</ref>\n\nUnlike other Yoruba cities with traditional kingship institutions however, In Ibadan, the warrior class became the rulers of the city as well as the most important economic group.  \n \nIbadan grew into an impressive and sprawling [[Urban area|urban]] center so much that by the end of 1829, Ibadan dominated the Yor\u00f9b\u00e1 region militarily, [[politically]] and [[economically]]. The military [[sanctuary]] expanded even further when [[refugees]] began arriving in large numbers from northern Oyo following raids by [[Fula people|Fulani]] warriors. After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding [[Fulani]]s, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs. The [[Fulani]] Caliphate attempted to expand further into the southern region of modern-day Nigeria, but was decisively defeated by the [[armies of Ibadan]] in 1840, which eventually halted their progress. The colonial period reinforced the position of the city in the Yoruba urban network. After a small boom in rubber business (1901-1913), cocoa became the main produce of the region and attracted European and [[Levant]]ine firms, as well as southern and northern traders from Lagos, Ijebu-Ode and Kano among others. The city became a major point of bulk trade. Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of [[Lagos]] were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939) which ranged from the northernmost areas of [[Oyo State]] to [[Ekeremor]], [[Bomadi]] and Patani, which were regions transferred from the old Delta province in the Old Western region and later Mid-west to the old Rivers state and later Bayelsa, in the redistricting of Nigeria carried out by the [[Yakubu Gowon]] administration shortly before the Nigerian civil war\n\n=== Colonial Ibadan ===\nIn 1893, Ibadan area became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Protectorate]] after a treaty signed by Fijabi, the Baale of Ibadan with the British acting Governor of [[Lagos Colony]], George C. Denton on 15 August.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtAkDl3OrQgC&pg=PA236&dq=awolowo+1954#v=onepage&q=awolowo%201954&f=false|title=Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s|author=Olufemi Vaughan|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=}}</ref> By then, the [[population]] had swelled to 120,000. The British developed the new colony to facilitate their [[commerce|commercial]] activities in the area, and Ibadan shortly grew into the major [[Trade|trading]] center that it is today.\n\n== Geography ==\nIbadan is located in south-western Nigeria in the southeastern part of [[Oyo State]] at about {{convert|119|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Lagos]] and {{convert|120|km|abbr=off}} east of the Nigerian international border with the [[Republic of Benin]]. It lies completely within the tropical forest zone but close to the boundary between the forest and the derived savanna. The city ranges in elevation from 150 m in the valley area, to 275 m above [[sea level]] on the major north-south ridge which crosses the central part of the city. The city covers a total area of {{convert|3080|km2}}, the largest in Nigeria.\n\nThe city of Ibadan is naturally drained by four rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; [[Ogunpa River]] flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. [[Ogunpa River]], a third-order [[stream]] with a channel length of 12.76&nbsp;km and a catchment area of 54.92&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Lake Eleyele is located at the northwestern part of the city, while the [[Osun River]] and the [[Asejire Reservoir|Asejire Lake]] bounds the city to the east.\n\n=== Climate ===\nIbadan has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Aw''), with a lengthy [[wet season]] and relatively constant temperatures throughout the course of the year. Ibadan\u2019s wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull nearly divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. November to February forms the city\u2019s [[dry season]], during which Ibadan experiences the typical [[West Africa]]n [[harmattan]]. The mean total rainfall for Ibadan is 1420.06&nbsp;mm, falling in \napproximately 109 days. There are two peaks for rainfall, June and September. The mean maximum temperature is 26.46 C, minimum 21.42 C and the relative humidity is 74.55%.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Ibadan\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 37.2\n|Feb record high C = 38.9\n|Mar record high C = 38.3\n|Apr record high C = 37.2\n|May record high C = 35.0\n|Jun record high C = 33.3\n|Jul record high C = 31.7\n|Aug record high C = 31.7\n|Sep record high C = 35.6\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 33.9\n|Dec record high C = 35.6\n|year record high C = 38.9\n|Jan high C = 32.3\n|Feb high C = 34.0\n|Mar high C = 33.5\n|Apr high C = 32.3\n|May high C = 31.2\n|Jun high C = 29.6\n|Jul high C = 27.8\n|Aug high C = 27.2\n|Sep high C = 28.5\n|Oct high C = 29.7\n|Nov high C = 31.3\n|Dec high C = 31.9\n|year high C = 30.8\n|Jan mean C = 25.7\n|Feb mean C = 26.9\n|Mar mean C = 26.9\n|Apr mean C = 26.3\n|May mean C = 25.6\n|Jun mean C = 25.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.6\n|Aug mean C = 23.1\n|Sep mean C = 23.9\n|Oct mean C = 24.3\n|Nov mean C = 25.6\n|Dec mean C = 25.5\n|year mean C = 25.2\n|Jan low C = 20.9\n|Feb low C = 21.9\n|Mar low C = 22.5\n|Apr low C = 22.0\n|May low C = 21.7\n|Jun low C = 21.6\n|Jul low C = 21.2\n|Aug low C = 20.7\n|Sep low C = 21.8\n|Oct low C = 21.7\n|Nov low C = 21.6\n|Dec low C = 20.7\n|year low C = 21.5\n|Jan record low C = 10.0\n|Feb record low C = 11.1\n|Mar record low C = 15.0\n|Apr record low C = 18.3\n|May record low C = 17.8\n|Jun record low C = 17.8\n|Jul record low C = 16.1\n|Aug record low C = 15.6\n|Sep record low C = 17.2\n|Oct record low C = 17.8\n|Nov record low C = 15.6\n|Dec record low C = 11.1\n|year record low C = 10.0\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 10\n|Feb rain mm = 25\n|Mar rain mm = 91\n|Apr rain mm = 135\n|May rain mm = 152\n|Jun rain mm = 188\n|Jul rain mm = 155\n|Aug rain mm = 86\n|Sep rain mm = 175\n|Oct rain mm = 160\n|Nov rain mm = 46\n|Dec rain mm = 10\n|year rain mm = 1233\n|Jan humidity = 76\n|Feb humidity = 73\n|Mar humidity = 77\n|Apr humidity = 82\n|May humidity = 85\n|Jun humidity = 87\n|Jul humidity = 89\n|Aug humidity = 88\n|Sep humidity = 88\n|Oct humidity = 87\n|Nov humidity = 83\n|Dec humidity = 79\n|year humidity = 83\n|unit rain days = 0.3 mm\n|Jan rain days = 1\n|Feb rain days = 3\n|Mar rain days = 7\n|Apr rain days = 9\n|May rain days = 14\n|Jun rain days = 17\n|Jul rain days = 15\n|Aug rain days = 13\n|Sep rain days = 18\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 7\n|Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days = 123\n|Jan sun = 198.4\n|Feb sun = 197.8\n|Mar sun = 186.0\n|Apr sun = 180.0\n|May sun = 195.3\n|Jun sun = 147.0\n|Jul sun = 86.8\n|Aug sun = 65.1\n|Sep sun = 93.0\n|Oct sun = 164.3\n|Nov sun = 207.0\n|Dec sun = 220.1\n|year sun = 1940.8\n|Jand sun = 6.4\n|Febd sun = 7.0\n|Mard sun = 6.0\n|Aprd sun = 6.0\n|Mayd sun = 6.3\n|Jund sun = 4.9\n|Juld sun = 2.8\n|Augd sun = 2.1\n|Sepd sun = 3.1\n|Octd sun = 5.3\n|Novd sun = 6.9\n|Decd sun = 7.1\n|yeard sun = 5.3\n|source 1 = [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]]<ref name = DWD>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_652080_kt.pdf\n| title = Klimatafel von Ibadan / Nigeria\n| work = Baseline climate means (1961-1990) from stations all over the world\n| publisher = Deutscher Wetterdienst\n| language = German\n| accessdate = 14 July 2016}}</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n== Administration ==\nThere are eleven (11) [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local Governments]] in Ibadan Metropolitan area consisting of five urban local governments in the city and six semi-urban local governments in the less city.

It is also available on TalkTalk TV [[IPTV]] and Freesat. ITV3 came about when ITV took full control of [[Granada Sky Broadcasting]], and ceased broadcasting the [[Granada Plus]] channel, thereby allowing ITV3 to take the channel number and bandwidth, meaning all platforms could receive the channel from launch. ITV3 was also the only channel in the ITV brand not to simulcast [[CITV]] breakfast, until ITV launched two channels in 2014, [[ITVBe]] and [[ITV Encore]].\n\nThe channel had been available from launch on UPC Ireland, but was withdrawn on 22 March 2006.

The company are hoping to use it, and extra investment into its ITV2 channel, to triple non-terrestrial revenue within five years and this has led to the network purchasing the exclusive terrestrial television rights to a number of newer and in some cases popular US drama series, such as ''[[Numbers (TV series)|NUMB3RS]]'' and more recently ''[[Law & Order: Trial by Jury]]''.\n\nDuring the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], ITV3 broadcast some of the matches while ITV1 (now ITV) and ITV4 were showing live European football matches which were being played at the same time and in the days when [[ITV4]] was an evenings only service, ITV3 broadcast live weekend coverage of the [[Tour de France]], and more recently, the [[ITV Racing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/itv3/posts/1500525653323055|title=ITV3|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=16 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Current programming===\n<!-- Please keep this section tidy.
