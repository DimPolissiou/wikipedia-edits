March 16, 2004: Quote: \"(9)Assessments made on the basis of the information submitted have not demonstrated that it may be expected that, under the proposed conditions of use, plant protection products containing atrazine satisfy in general the requirements laid down in Article 5(1)(a) and (b) of Directive 91/414/EEC. In particular, available monitoring data were insufficient to demonstrate that in large areas concentrations of the active substance and its breakdown products will not exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l in groundwater. Moreover it cannot be assured that continued use in other areas will permit a satisfactory recovery of groundwater quality where concentrations already exceed 0,1 \u03bcg/l in groundwater. These levels of the active substance exceed the limits in Annex VI to Directive 91/414/EEC and would have an unacceptable effect on groundwater.\" (10) Atrazine should therefore not be included in Annex I to Directive 91/414/EEC. (11) Measures should be taken to ensure that existing authorisations for plant protection products containing atrazine are withdrawn within a prescribed period and are not renewed and that no new authorisations for such products are granted.\"</ref><ref name=NYT2004>Danny Hakimfeb for the New York Times.

Though the two alkyl moieties readily support growth of certain microorganisms, the atrazine ring is a poor energy source due to the oxidized state of ring carbon.

Though the two alkyl moieties readily support growth of certain microorganisms, the atrazine ring is a poor energy source due to the oxidized state of ring carbon.

The climate receives its name from the [[Mediterranean Basin]], where this climate type is most common. Mediterranean climate zones are typically located along the western sides of continents, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees north and south of the [[equator]]. The main cause of Mediterranean, or dry summer climate, is the [[Horse latitudes|subtropical ridge]] which extends northwards during the summer and migrates south during the winter due to increasing north-south temperature differences. \n\nThe resulting [[vegetation]] of Mediterranean climates are the [[garrigue]] or [[maquis shrubland|maquis]] in the Mediterranean Basin, the [[chaparral]] in California, the [[fynbos]] in South Africa, the [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] in Australia, and the [[matorral]] in Chile. Areas with this climate are where the so-called \"Mediterranean trinity\" of agricultural products have traditionally developed: [[wheat]], [[Grape|grapes]] and [[olive|olives]].\n\nMost large, historic cities of the Mediterranean basin lie within Mediterranean climatic zones, including [[Algiers]], [[Athens]], [[Barcelona]], [[Beirut]], [[\u0130zmir]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Marseille]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Tunis]], and [[Valencia]]. Major cities with Mediterranean climates outside of the Mediterranean basin include [[Adelaide]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dushanbe]], [[Lisbon]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Perth]], [[Porto]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Santiago]], [[Tashkent]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].\n\n==K\u00f6ppen climate classification==\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], \"hot dry-summer\" climates (classified as ''Csa'') and \"cool dry-summer\" climates (classified as ''Csb'') are often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". Under the K\u00f6ppen climate system, the first letter indicates the climate group (in this case temperate climates). Temperate climates or \"''C''\" zones have an average temperature above {{convert|0|C|F}} (or {{convert|-3|C|F}}), but below {{convert|18|C|F}}, in their coolest months. The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern (\"''s''\" represents dry summers). K\u00f6ppen has defined a dry summer month as a month with less than {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation and as a month within the high-sun months of April to September, in the case of the Northern Hemisphere and October to March, in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it also must contain exactly or less than one-third that of the wettest winter month. Some, however, use a {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |first=Markus |last=Kottek |first2=J\u00fcrgen |last2=Grieser |first3=Christoph |last3=Beck |first4=Bruno |last4=Rudolf |first5=Franz |last5=Rube |title=World Map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |date=June 2006 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013263 |accessdate=2011-02-27 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/4/439/2007/hessd-4-439-2007.pdf |first=M.

''Csb'' zones in the K\u00f6ppen system include areas normally not associated with Mediterranean climates but with [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] climates, such as much of the [[Pacific Northwest]], much of southern [[Chile]], parts of west-central [[Argentina]], and parts of [[New Zealand]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/11/1633/2007/hess-11-1633-2007.html |first=M.

Under Trewartha's system, at least eight months must have average temperatures of {{convert|10|C}} or higher ([[subtropical]]), and the average annual precipitation must not exceed {{convert|900|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Thus, under this system, many ''Csb'' zones in the K\u00f6ppen system become ''Do'' (temperate oceanic), and the rare ''Csc'' zones become ''Eo'' (subpolar oceanic), with only the classic dry-summer to warm winter, low annual rainfall locations included in the Mediterranean type climate.\n\nUnder [[Holdridge life zones]] classification, the Mediterranean climates are either temperate or subtropical climates. They are frequently found within the Warm Temperate region as defined by [[Leslie Holdridge]] with a mean annual [[biotemperature]] between 12\u00b0C and the frost line or critical temperature line, 16\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C (depending on locations in the world<ref>[http://reddcr.go.cr/sites/default/files/centro-de-documentacion/holdridge_1966_-_life_zone_ecology.pdf ''LIFE ZONE ECOLOGY by L.

The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. On the warmer side of the line, the majority of the plants are sensitive to low temperatures. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total flora is adapted to survive periods of variable length of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants which can withstand the cold. Only the warmest Mediterranean climates with a biotemperature between 16\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C are subtropical climates in Holdridge classification.\n\n==Precipitation==\n{{rquote|right|It [Chile] has six, months of winter, no more, and in them, except when there is a quarter moon, when it rains one or two days, all the other days have such beautiful suns...|[[First relation letter from Pedro de Valdivia to emperor Charles V|Pedro de Valdivia to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]}}\nDuring summer, regions of Mediterranean climate are strongly influenced by the subtropical ridge which keeps atmospheric conditions very dry with minimal cloud coverage. In some areas, such as coastal [[California]], the cold [[California Current|current]] has a stabilizing effect on the surrounding air, further reducing the chances for rain, but often causing thick layers of marine [[fog]] that usually evaporates by mid-day. Similar to [[desert]] climates, in many Mediterranean climates there is a strong [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] character to daily temperatures in the warm summer months due to strong heating during the day from sunlight and rapid cooling at night.\n\nIn winter, the subtropical ridge migrates towards the equator, making rainfall much more likely. As a result, areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter and spring seasons, and may go anywhere from 3 to 6 months during the summer and early fall without having any significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. In the lower latitudes, precipitation usually decreases in both the winter and summer. Toward the polar latitudes, total moisture usually increases, for instance, the Mediterranean climate in [[Southern Europe]] has more rain. The rainfall also tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the year in Southern Europe, while in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], and in [[Southern California]], the summer is nearly or completely dry. In places where [[evapotranspiration]] is higher, steppe climates tend to prevail, but still follow the weather pattern of the Mediterranean climate. ye\n\n== Temperature ==\nThe majority of the regions with Mediterranean climates have relatively mild winters and very warm summers.  However winter and summer temperatures can vary greatly between different regions with a Mediterranean climate. For instance, in the case of winters, [[Barcelona]] and [[Los Angeles]] experience mild temperatures in the winter, with frost and snowfall almost unknown, whereas [[Tashkent]] has colder winters with annual frosts and snowfall. Or to consider summer, [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] experiences rather high temperatures in that season ({{convert|48|C|F}} has been measured in nearby [[Eleusis]]). In contrast, [[San Francisco]] has cool summers with daily highs around {{convert|21|C|F}} due to the continuous [[upwelling]] of cold subsurface waters along the coast.\nBecause most regions with a Mediterranean climate are near large bodies of water, [[temperature]]s are generally moderate with a comparatively small range of temperatures between the winter low and summer high (although the daily range of temperature during the summer is large due to dry and clear conditions, except along the immediate coasts). Temperatures during winter only occasionally fall below the freezing point and [[snow]] is generally seldom seen. In the summer, the temperatures range from mild to very hot, depending on distance from a large body of water, elevation, and latitude. Even in the warmest locations with a Mediterranean-type climate, however, temperatures usually do not reach the highest readings found in adjacent [[desert]] regions because of cooling from water bodies, although strong winds from inland desert regions can sometimes boost summer temperatures, quickly increasing the risk of [[wildfires]].\n\nAs in every climatologic domain, the highland locations of the Mediterranean domain can present cooler temperatures in winter than the lowland areas, temperatures which can sometimes prohibit the growth of typical Mediterranean plants. Some Spanish authors opt to use the term \"Continental Mediterranean climate\" for some regions with lower temperature in winter than the coastal areas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.es/espmap/graficos_clima_bach/Clima_Graf_05.htm|title=Espa\u00f1a a Trav\u00e9s de los Mapas|website=www.ign.es}}</ref> (direct translation from {{lang|es|Clima Mediterr\u00e1neo Continentalizado}}), but most climate classifications (including K\u00f6ppen's ''Cs'' zones) show no distinction.\n\nAdditionally, the temperature and rainfall pattern for a ''Csa'' or even a ''Csb'' climate can exist as a microclimate in some high-altitude locations adjacent to a rare tropical ''As'' ([[tropical savanna climate]] with dry summers, typically in a rainshadow region as in Hawaii).\nThese have a favourable climate with mild wet winters and fairly warm, dry summers.\n\n==Mediterranean biome==\n[[File:Ionian sea islands, pic8.JPG|thumb|The Ionian Sea, view from the island [[Lefkada]], Greece]]\n[[File:Makarska riviera.jpg|thumb|[[Makarska Riviera|Makarska]] in [[Dalmatia]], Croatia]]\nThe [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]] is closely associated with Mediterranean climate zones, as are unique freshwater communities. Particularly distinctive of the climate are [[sclerophyll]] shrublands, called [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] in the Mediterranean Basin, [[chaparral]] in California, [[Chilean Matorral|matorral]] in Chile, [[fynbos]] in South Africa, and [[mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] and [[kwongan]] shrublands in Australia. Aquatic communities in Mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which [[abiotic]] (environmental) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods, [[biotic components]] (e.g. competition and predation) controls become increasingly important as the discharge declines, and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh (i.e. hot and dry); as a result, these communities are well suited to recover from [[droughts]], [[floods]], and [[fires]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gasith, A. and V.H.

In places such as the [[Sacramento Valley]] and [[Oxnard Plain]] in [[California]], draining marshes and estuaries combined with supplemental irrigation has led to a century of intensive agriculture. Much of the [[Overberg]] in the southern Cape of [[South Africa]], once covered with [[renosterveld]], has likewise been largely converted to agriculture, mainly [[wheat]]. In hillside and mountainous areas, away from [[urban sprawl]], ecosystems and habitats of native vegetation are more sustained.\n\nThe [[fynbos]] vegetation in the South-western Cape in South Africa is famed for its high floral diversity, and includes such plant types as members of the [[Restionaceae]], [[Erica]]s (Heaths) and [[Protea]]s. Representatives of the [[Proteaceae]] also grow in Australia, such as [[Banksia]]s.\nThe palette of [[California native plants]] is also renowned for its [[species]] and [[cultivar]] diversity.\n\n=={{anchor|Hot-summer_mediterranean_climate}}Hot-summer Mediterranean climate==\n[[File:Koppen World Map Csa.png|upright=1.8|thumb|{{legend|#FFFF00|Hot-summer mediterranean climate (''Csa'')}}]]\nThis subtype of the Mediterranean climate (''Csa'') is the most common form of the Mediterranean climate, therefore it is also known as a \u201ctypical Mediterranean climate\u201d. As stated earlier, regions with this form of a Mediterranean climate experience average monthly temperatures in excess of {{convert|22.0|C|F}} during its warmest month and an average in the coldest month between {{convert|18|and|\u22123|C|F}} or, in some applications, between {{convert|18|and|0|C|F}}. Also, at least four months must average above {{convert|10|C|F}}. Regions with this form of the Mediterranean climate typically experience hot, sometimes very hot and dry summers and mild, wet winters. In a number of instances, summers here can closely resemble summers seen in [[desert climate|arid]] and [[semi-arid climate]]s. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water. All areas with this subtype have wet winters. However, some areas with a hot Mediterranean subtype can actually experience very chilly winters, with occasional snowfall. \n\n''Csa'' climates are mainly found around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], southwestern [[Australia]], southwestern [[South Africa]], sections of [[Central Asia]], northern sections of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], the interior of northern [[California]] west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and inland areas of southern [[Oregon]] west of the [[Cascade Mountains]].  Southern California's coasts also experience hot summers due to the shielding effect of the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]]. However, unshielded areas of that coastline can have warm-summer Mediterranean climates with hot-summer areas just a few kilometres inland.\n{{climate chart\n| [[Valencia, Spain]]\n| 5 | 16 | 37.0\n| 6 | 17 | 36.0\n| 7 | 19 | 33.0\n| 10 | 21 | 38.0\n| 13 | 23 | 39.0\n| 17 | 27 | 22.0\n| 20 | 30 | 8.0\n| 22 | 30 | 20.0\n| 17 | 28 | 70.0\n| 12 | 24 | 77.0\n| 11 | 19 | 47.0\n| 8 | 17 | 48.0\n|float  = left\n|clear  = none\n|source= [[Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aemet.es/es/serviciosclimaticos/datosclimatologicos/valoresclimatologicos?l=8416&k=val|title=Valores climatol\u00f3gicos normales: Valencia - Agencia Estatal de Meteorolog\u00eda - AEMET.

This type is characterized by cool summers, with fewer than four months with a mean temperature at or above {{convert|10|C}}, as well as with mild winters, with no winter month having a mean temperature below {{convert|0|C}} (or {{convert|-3|C|disp=sqbr}}), depending on the isotherm used).

The climate receives its name from the [[Mediterranean Basin]], where this climate type is most common. Mediterranean climate zones are typically located along the western sides of continents, between roughly 30 and 45 degrees north and south of the [[equator]]. The main cause of Mediterranean, or dry summer climate, is the [[Horse latitudes|subtropical ridge]] which extends northwards during the summer and migrates south during the winter due to increasing north-south temperature differences. \n\nThe resulting [[vegetation]] of Mediterranean climates are the [[garrigue]] or [[maquis shrubland|maquis]] in the Mediterranean Basin, the [[chaparral]] in California, the [[fynbos]] in South Africa, the [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] in Australia, and the [[matorral]] in Chile. Areas with this climate are where the so-called \"Mediterranean trinity\" of agricultural products have traditionally developed: [[wheat]], [[Grape|grapes]] and [[olive|olives]].\n\nMost large, historic cities of the Mediterranean basin lie within Mediterranean climatic zones, including [[Algiers]], [[Athens]], [[Barcelona]], [[Beirut]], [[\u0130zmir]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Marseille]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Tunis]], and [[Valencia]]. Major cities with Mediterranean climates outside of the Mediterranean basin include [[Adelaide]], [[Cape Town]], [[Casablanca]], [[Dushanbe]], [[Lisbon]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Perth]], [[Porto]], [[San Francisco]], [[San Diego]], [[Santiago]], [[Tashkent]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].\n\n==K\u00f6ppen climate classification==\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], \"hot dry-summer\" climates (classified as ''Csa'') and \"cool dry-summer\" climates (classified as ''Csb'') are often referred to as \"Mediterranean\". Under the K\u00f6ppen climate system, the first letter indicates the climate group (in this case temperate climates). Temperate climates or \"''C''\" zones have an average temperature above {{convert|0|C|F}} (or {{convert|-3|C|F}}), but below {{convert|18|C|F}}, in their coolest months. The second letter indicates the precipitation pattern (\"''s''\" represents dry summers). K\u00f6ppen has defined a dry summer month as a month with less than {{convert|30|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation and as a month within the high-sun months of April to September, in the case of the Northern Hemisphere and October to March, in the case of the Southern Hemisphere, and it also must contain exactly or less than one-third that of the wettest winter month. Some, however, use a {{convert|40|mm|abbr=on}} level.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |first=Markus |last=Kottek |first2=J\u00fcrgen |last2=Grieser |first3=Christoph |last3=Beck |first4=Bruno |last4=Rudolf |first5=Franz |last5=Rube |title=World Map of the K\u00f6ppen-Geiger climate classification updated |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |date=June 2006 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=259\u2013263 |accessdate=2011-02-27 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130|bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/4/439/2007/hessd-4-439-2007.pdf |first=M.

Under Trewartha's system, at least eight months must have average temperatures of {{convert|10|C}} or higher ([[subtropical]]), and the average annual precipitation must not exceed {{convert|900|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Thus, under this system, many ''Csb'' zones in the K\u00f6ppen system become ''Do'' (temperate oceanic), and the rare ''Csc'' zones become ''Eo'' (subpolar oceanic), with only the classic dry-summer to warm winter, low annual rainfall locations included in the Mediterranean type climate.\n\nUnder [[Holdridge life zones]] classification, the Mediterranean climates are either temperate or subtropical climates. They are frequently found within the Warm Temperate region as defined by [[Leslie Holdridge]] with a mean annual [[biotemperature]] between 12\u00b0C and the frost line or critical temperature line, 16\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C (depending on locations in the world<ref>[http://reddcr.go.cr/sites/default/files/centro-de-documentacion/holdridge_1966_-_life_zone_ecology.pdf ''LIFE ZONE ECOLOGY by L.

The frost line separates the warm temperate region from the subtropical region. It represents the dividing line between two major physiological groups of evolved plants. On the warmer side of the line, the majority of the plants are sensitive to low temperatures. They can be killed back by frosts as they have not evolved to withstand periods of cold. On the colder temperate side of the line, the total flora is adapted to survive periods of variable length of low temperatures, whether as seeds in the case of the annuals or as perennial plants which can withstand the cold. Only the warmest Mediterranean climates with a biotemperature between 16\u00b0C to 18\u00b0C and 24\u00b0C are subtropical climates in Holdridge classification.\n\n==Precipitation==\n{{rquote|right|It [Chile] has six, months of winter, no more, and in them, except when there is a quarter moon, when it rains one or two days, all the other days have such beautiful suns...|[[First relation letter from Pedro de Valdivia to emperor Charles V|Pedro de Valdivia to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]}}\nDuring summer, regions of Mediterranean climate are strongly influenced by the subtropical ridge which keeps atmospheric conditions very dry with minimal cloud coverage. In some areas, such as coastal [[California]], the cold [[California Current|current]] has a stabilizing effect on the surrounding air, further reducing the chances for rain, but often causing thick layers of marine [[fog]] that usually evaporates by mid-day. Similar to [[desert]] climates, in many Mediterranean climates there is a strong [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] character to daily temperatures in the warm summer months due to strong heating during the day from sunlight and rapid cooling at night.\n\nIn winter, the subtropical ridge migrates towards the equator, making rainfall much more likely. As a result, areas with this climate receive almost all of their precipitation during their winter and spring seasons, and may go anywhere from 3 to 6 months during the summer and early fall without having any significant [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. In the lower latitudes, precipitation usually decreases in both the winter and summer. Toward the polar latitudes, total moisture usually increases, for instance, the Mediterranean climate in [[Southern Europe]] has more rain. The rainfall also tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the year in Southern Europe, while in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], and in [[Southern California]], the summer is nearly or completely dry. In places where [[evapotranspiration]] is higher, steppe climates tend to prevail, but still follow the weather pattern of the Mediterranean climate.\n\n== Temperature ==\nThe majority of the regions with Mediterranean climates have relatively mild winters and very warm summers.  However winter and summer temperatures can vary greatly between different regions with a Mediterranean climate. For instance, in the case of winters, [[Barcelona]] and [[Los Angeles]] experience mild temperatures in the winter, with frost and snowfall almost unknown, whereas [[Tashkent]] has colder winters with annual frosts and snowfall. Or to consider summer, [[Athens, Greece|Athens]] experiences rather high temperatures in that season ({{convert|48|C|F}} has been measured in nearby [[Eleusis]]). In contrast, [[San Francisco]] has cool summers with daily highs around {{convert|21|C|F}} due to the continuous [[upwelling]] of cold subsurface waters along the coast.\nBecause most regions with a Mediterranean climate are near large bodies of water, [[temperature]]s are generally moderate with a comparatively small range of temperatures between the winter low and summer high (although the daily range of temperature during the summer is large due to dry and clear conditions, except along the immediate coasts). Temperatures during winter only occasionally fall below the freezing point and [[snow]] is generally seldom seen. In the summer, the temperatures range from mild to very hot, depending on distance from a large body of water, elevation, and latitude. Even in the warmest locations with a Mediterranean-type climate, however, temperatures usually do not reach the highest readings found in adjacent [[desert]] regions because of cooling from water bodies, although strong winds from inland desert regions can sometimes boost summer temperatures, quickly increasing the risk of [[wildfires]].\n\nAs in every climatologic domain, the highland locations of the Mediterranean domain can present cooler temperatures in winter than the lowland areas, temperatures which can sometimes prohibit the growth of typical Mediterranean plants. Some Spanish authors opt to use the term \"Continental Mediterranean climate\" for some regions with lower temperature in winter than the coastal areas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.es/espmap/graficos_clima_bach/Clima_Graf_05.htm|title=Espa\u00f1a a Trav\u00e9s de los Mapas|website=www.ign.es}}</ref> (direct translation from {{lang|es|Clima Mediterr\u00e1neo Continentalizado}}), but most climate classifications (including K\u00f6ppen's ''Cs'' zones) show no distinction.\n\nAdditionally, the temperature and rainfall pattern for a ''Csa'' or even a ''Csb'' climate can exist as a microclimate in some high-altitude locations adjacent to a rare tropical ''As'' ([[tropical savanna climate]] with dry summers, typically in a rainshadow region as in Hawaii).\nThese have a favourable climate with mild wet winters and fairly warm, dry summers.\n\n==Mediterranean biome==\n[[File:Ionian sea islands, pic8.JPG|thumb|The Ionian Sea, view from the island [[Lefkada]], Greece]]\n[[File:Makarska riviera.jpg|thumb|[[Makarska Riviera|Makarska]] in [[Dalmatia]], Croatia]]\nThe [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] [[biome]] is closely associated with Mediterranean climate zones, as are unique freshwater communities. Particularly distinctive of the climate are [[sclerophyll]] shrublands, called [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]] in the Mediterranean Basin, [[chaparral]] in California, [[Chilean Matorral|matorral]] in Chile, [[fynbos]] in South Africa, and [[mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee]] and [[kwongan]] shrublands in Australia. Aquatic communities in Mediterranean climate regions are adapted to a yearly cycle in which [[abiotic]] (environmental) controls of stream populations and community structure dominate during floods, [[biotic components]] (e.g. competition and predation) controls become increasingly important as the discharge declines, and environmental controls regain dominance as environmental conditions become very harsh (i.e. hot and dry); as a result, these communities are well suited to recover from [[droughts]], [[floods]], and [[fires]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gasith, A. and V.H.

In places such as the [[Sacramento Valley]] and [[Oxnard Plain]] in [[California]], draining marshes and estuaries combined with supplemental irrigation has led to a century of intensive agriculture. Much of the [[Overberg]] in the southern Cape of [[South Africa]], once covered with [[renosterveld]], has likewise been largely converted to agriculture, mainly [[wheat]]. In hillside and mountainous areas, away from [[urban sprawl]], ecosystems and habitats of native vegetation are more sustained.\n\nThe [[fynbos]] vegetation in the South-western Cape in South Africa is famed for its high floral diversity, and includes such plant types as members of the [[Restionaceae]], [[Erica]]s (Heaths) and [[Protea]]s. Representatives of the [[Proteaceae]] also grow in Australia, such as [[Banksia]]s.\nThe palette of [[California native plants]] is also renowned for its [[species]] and [[cultivar]] diversity.\n\n=={{anchor|Hot-summer_mediterranean_climate}}Hot-summer Mediterranean climate==\n[[File:Koppen World Map Csa.png|upright=1.8|thumb|{{legend|#FFFF00|Hot-summer mediterranean climate (''Csa'')}}]]\nThis subtype of the Mediterranean climate (''Csa'') is the most common form of the Mediterranean climate, therefore it is also known as a \u201ctypical Mediterranean climate\u201d. As stated earlier, regions with this form of a Mediterranean climate experience average monthly temperatures in excess of {{convert|22.0|C|F}} during its warmest month and an average in the coldest month between {{convert|18|and|\u22123|C|F}} or, in some applications, between {{convert|18|and|0|C|F}}. Also, at least four months must average above {{convert|10|C|F}}. Regions with this form of the Mediterranean climate typically experience hot, sometimes very hot and dry summers and mild, wet winters. In a number of instances, summers here can closely resemble summers seen in [[desert climate|arid]] and [[semi-arid climate]]s. However, high temperatures during summers are generally not quite as high as those in arid or semiarid climates due to the presence of a large body of water. All areas with this subtype have wet winters. However, some areas with a hot Mediterranean subtype can actually experience very chilly winters, with occasional snowfall. \n\n''Csa'' climates are mainly found around the [[Mediterranean Sea]], southwestern [[Australia]], southwestern [[South Africa]], sections of [[Central Asia]], northern sections of [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], the interior of northern [[California]] west of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], and inland areas of southern [[Oregon]] west of the [[Cascade Mountains]].  Southern California's coasts also experience hot summers due to the shielding effect of the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]].

This is why it rarely occurs on the Mediterranean Sea shores, as it is a warm sea, from 3 to 6\u00b0C above the theoric value according to Jean Demangeot.<ref>http://ddata.over-blog.com/xxxyyy/2/32/25/79/Leroux-Climats-Mediteraneens-2.pdf</ref>\n\nThe other main reason of this cooler type is the altitude. For instance [[Menton]] on the French coast has a Csa climate while [[Castellar, Alpes-Maritimes]], the adjacent town just north of Menton, with an altitude between 100 m and 1,382 m, has a Csb climate.<ref>https://fr.climate-data.org/europe/france/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/castellar-325714</ref>\n\nWinters are rainy and can be mild to chilly.

This type is characterized by cool summers, with fewer than four months with a mean temperature at or above {{convert|10|C}}, as well as with mild winters, with no winter month having a mean temperature below {{convert|0|C}} (or {{convert|-3|C|disp=sqbr}}), depending on the isotherm used). Regions with this climate are influenced by the dry-summer trend that extends considerably poleward along the west coast of the Americas, as well as the moderating influences of high altitude and relative proximity to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nIn North America, areas with ''Csc'' climate can be found in the [[Olympic Mountains|Olympic]], [[Cascade Range|Cascade]], [[Klamath Mountains|Klamath]], and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] ranges in Washington, Oregon and California. These locations are found at high altitude nearby lower altitude regions characterized by a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (''Csb'') or hot-summer Mediterranean climate (''Csa''). A rare instance of this climate occurs in the tropics, on [[Haleakal\u0101|Haleakal\u0101 Summit]] in Hawaii.\n\nIn South America, ''Csc'' regions can be found along the [[Andes]] in Chile and Argentina.
