Created by [[Walt Disney]] and produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], the program was first televised for four seasons, from 1955 to 1959, by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This original run featured a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958\u20131959 season, airing right after ''[[American Bandstand]]''. The show was revived three times after its initial 1955\u20131959 run on ABC, first from 1977 to 1979 for [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] as '''''The New Mickey Mouse Club''''', then from 1989 to 1996 as '''''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club''''' (also known to fans as '''''MMC''''' from 1993 to 1996) airing exclusively on [[cable television]]'s [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]], and again in 2017 with the moniker '''''Club Mickey Mouse''''' airing exclusively on internet social media.\n\n[[Mickey Mouse]] himself appeared in every show, not only in vintage cartoons originally made for theatrical release, but also in the opening, interstitial, and closing segments made especially for the show. In both the vintage cartoons and new animated segments, Mickey was voiced by his creator [[Walt Disney]]. (Disney had previously voiced the character theatrically from 1928 to 1947 before being replaced by [[sound effects]] artist [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]].)\n\n==Before the TV series==\nThe first official theater-based Mickey Mouse Club began on January 11, 1930, at the Fox Dome Theater in [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Ocean Park]], [[California]], with 60 theaters hosting clubs by March 31.

Dallas' brother John Lee replaced him, while Dodd and Steiner were hired as replacements for the Rooney brothers.\n\nFor the show's fourth season, only a small amount of new footage was filmed and was interspliced with material from previous seasons. It is believed{{whom|date=February 2019}} that only six of the Mouseketeers&mdash; Funicello, Gillespie, Tracey, Burgess, Pendleton, and O'Brien&mdash; were called back for the filming of new material, while Cole and Baird were merely used for some publicity material.\n\n===Adult co-hosts===\n\n* [[Jimmie Dodd]]\n* [[Roy Williams (artist)|Roy Williams]]\n* [[Bob Amsberry]] (seasons 1\u20132)\n\nOther notable non-Mouseketeer performers appeared in several dramatic segments:<ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n* [[Tim Considine]]\n* [[Tommy Kirk]]\n* [[Roberta Shore]] (Jymme Shore)\n* [[David Stollery]]\n* [[Judy Nugent]]\n* [[Kevin Corcoran]], a.k.a.

A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments throughout the series.\n\n===Show themes===\nEach day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the several segments. The themes were:\n* Monday&nbsp;\u2013 Fun with Music Day\n* Tuesday&nbsp;\u2013 Guest Star Day\n* Wednesday&nbsp;\u2013 Anything Can Happen Day\n* Thursday&nbsp;\u2013 Circus Day\n* Friday&nbsp;\u2013 Talent Round-up Day\n\n===Scheduling and air times===\nThe series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955\u20131956 and 1956\u20131957 seasons (from 5:00 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET), and only a half-hour weekdays (5:30 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET) in 1957\u20131958, the final season to feature new programming.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|title=Mickey the Magnificent|date=May 1957|publisher=TV-Radio Mirror|page=21|access-date=12 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716020651/http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|archivedate=16 July 2014}}</ref> Although the show returned for the 1958\u20131959 season (5:30 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET), these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, recut into a half-hour format. ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and ''Walt Disney's Adventure Time'', featuring reruns of ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' serials and several re-edited segments from ''[[Disneyland]]'' and ''[[Walt Disney Presents]]'', appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\n===Cancellation===\nAlthough the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel it after its fourth season ended, because Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for its renewal.<ref name=Cotter/> The cancellation of the show in September 1959 was attributed to several factors: the Disney studios did not realize high-profit margins from merchandise sales, the sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed to pay for the show. After canceling ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billcotter.com/zorro/hour-episodes.htm|title=Zorro - The Hour-Long Episodes|website=www.billcotter.com}}</ref> Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement; however, he had to agree that both the ''Mickey Mouse Club'' and ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' could not be aired on any major network. This left ''Walt Disney Presents'' (initially titled ''Disneyland'', later retitled the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' when it moved to NBC) as the only Disney series which was left on [[prime time]] until 1972 when ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' went on the air. The prohibition which prevented major American broadcast networks from playing the original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' (or any later version of it) was disputed when Disney acquired ABC in 1996. Although it would not air on ABC again, Disney ran it on the Disney Channel's \"Vault Disney\" block from 1998-2002.\n\n===Australian tour===\nAlthough the series had been ended in the United States, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the young cast with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956, so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalog expired.\n\n===Syndication===\nIn response to continuing audience demand, the original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. (Because of its popularity in some markets, a few stations continued to carry it into 1968 before the series was finally withdrawn from syndication.) Some new features were added such as ''Fun with Science'' or \"Professor Wonderful\" (with scientist [[Julius Sumner Miller]]) and ''Marvelous Marvin'' in the 1964\u20131965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Many markets stretched the program back to an hour's daily run time during the 1960s rerun cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike ''[[Romper Room]]''.\n\nIn response to an upsurge in demand from [[baby boomers]] entering adulthood, the show again went into syndicated reruns from January 20, 1975, until January 14, 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cotter |first1=Bill |title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television: A Complete History |date=1997 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0786863594 |page=195}}</ref> It has since been rerun on cable specialty channels Disney in the United States and [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family]] in Canada. The original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' films aired five days a week on [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] from its launch in 1983 until the third version of the series began in 1989. The last airing of the edited 1950s material was on Disney Channel's ''Vault Disney'' from 1997 to September 2002. During the baseball seasons in 1975 and 1976, WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, aired the show on a delayed basis due to Cubs ballgame coverages.\n\n===Reunions===\nAnnette Funicello and Tim Considine were reunited on ''The New Mickey Mouse Club'' in 1977. Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on another episode of the same series.\n\n31 out of the 39 original Mouseketeers were reunited for a TV special, which aired on ''[[Disney anthology television series|Disney's Wonderful World]]'' in November 1980.\n\nCast members Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode of ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club'', during the show's third season in 1991.\n \nMouseketeers Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, Sherry Alberoni, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, Cheryl Holdridge, Bobby Burgess, Karen Pendleton, Tommy Cole, and Mary Espinosa performed together at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in the fall of 2005, in observance of Disneyland's 50th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the TV premiere of ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.\n\n===Streaming===\nIn early 2020, the first week of the Mickey Mouse Club and the first Spin and Marty serial have been added to Disney's new streaming platform Disney+.\n\n==Talent Round-Up Stars==\n* Larry Ashurst\n* Janice Crowe\n* Peter Lee Palmer\n* Mark Sutherland\n* Bo Wagner\n* [[Pamela Beaird]]\n* Mary Sartori\n* John F.

The sets were brightly colored and simpler than the detailed black and white artwork of the original. Like the original, nearly every day's episode included a vintage cartoon, though usually in color from the late 1930s onward. The 1977 Mouseketeers were part of the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XI]] on January 9, 1977.\n\n===Serials===\nSerials were usually old Disney movies, cut into segments for twice-weekly inclusion. Movies included ''[[Third Man on the Mountain]]'', ''[[The Misadventures of Merlin Jones]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Monkey's Uncle]]'' (both starring [[Tommy Kirk]]), ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1964 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]'' (retitled ''The Three Skrinks''), ''[[Tonka (film)|Tonka]]'' (retitled ''A Horse Called Comanche''), ''The Horse Without a Head'' (about a toy horse), and ''[[Toby Tyler]]'' (starring [[Kevin Corcoran]]). In addition, one original serial was produced, ''The Mystery of Rustler's Cave'', starring [[Kim Richards]] and [[Robbie Rist]]. Often shown were scenes from animated Disney films, from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' to ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' billed as \"Mouseka Movie Specials\".\n\n===Theme days===\nTheme days were:\n* Monday: Who, What, Why, Where, When and How\n* Tuesday: Let's Go\n* Wednesday: Surprise\n* Thursday: Discovery\n* Friday: Showtime (at Disneyland, with performers usually at Plaza Gardens)\n\n===Syndication===\nThe series debuted on January 17, 1977, on 38 local [[television station]]s in the United States, and by June of that same year, when the series was discontinued, about 70 stations in total had picked up the series. Additional stations picked up the canceled program, which continued to run until January 12, 1979; 130 new episodes, with much of the original material repackaged and a bit of new footage added, and a shortened version of the theme song, was produced to start airing September 5, 1977. Since the 1970s, the series has aired only briefly in reruns, unlike its 1950s predecessor, and while both the 1950s and 1989/1990s series had DVD releases of select episodes in July 2005, the 1970s series has been largely forgotten by many, including the generation of youthful viewers who made it their club. On November 20, 1977, \"The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World\" was shown on ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''. WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, also aired this version on a delayed basis in 1977 and 1978 during the Cubs baseball season due to game coverages. [[Action for Children's Television]] successfully got the show canceled because of their objections to the types of commercials that aired during the program.\n\n===Cast===\nThe cast of twelve (five boys and seven girls) had a more diverse multiethnic background than the 1950s version. Several 1977\u20131978 cast members went on to become TV stars and other notable icons.\n\nThe show's most notable alumnus was [[Lisa Whelchel]] (born in 1963, in [[Littlefield, Texas]]), who later starred in the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' which ran from 1979 to 1988 before becoming a well-known Christian author, and most recently, overall runner-up, and winner of the $100,000 viewers' choice award, on the [[Survivor: Philippines|fall 2012 season]] of the [[CBS]] television reality series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''. Mouseketeer [[Julie Piekarski]] (born in 1963 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].) also appeared with Lisa Whelchel on the first season of ''The Facts of Life''. [[Kelly Parsons]] (born in 1964, in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]) went on to become a [[beauty queen]] and runner-up to [[Miss USA]].\n\nOther Mouseketeers (from seasons 1\u20132) from the 1977 show:<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n* '''William \"Billy\"/\"Pop\" Attmore:''' born at US military base in Landstuhl, West Germany, 1965; appeared in a few movies before and after the series, a final season episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' (\"Kelly's Kids\"), and as a streetwise hood in the short-lived ''[[Eischied]]'' crime drama.\n* '''Scott Craig:''' born in [[Van Nuys, California]], in 1964; lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, died December 30, 2003 from a respiratory illness.\n* '''Benita \"Nita Dee\" DiGiampaolo:''' born in [[Long Beach, California]] in 1966; appeared at the last end of an episode in 1981 of ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as Elena. Nita appeared in ''ABC Family Weekends'' in 1978 as Nita and 1978 as Maria. Nita also starred in Upbeat Aesop (ABC) produced by Ron Miziker (A Disney executive).\n* '''Mindy Feldman:''' born in [[Burbank, California]] in 1968; sister of Hollywood actor [[Corey Feldman]].\n* '''Angel Florez:''' born in [[Stockton, California]] in 1963; died April 25, 1995 from an [[AIDS]]-related illness.\n* '''[[Allison Fonte]]:''' born in [[Buena Park, California]] in 1964.\n* '''Shawnte Northcutte''' born in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1965; appeared on an episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', as Madge.\n* '''Todd Turquand:''' born in [[Hollywood, California]] in 1964.\n* '''Curtis Wong:''' born in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in 1962; appeared on an episode of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', as an assistant [[karate]] instructor under [[Soon-Tek Oh]].\n\nDisney [[voice actor]] and sound effects editor [[Wayne Allwine]] voiced Mickey Mouse in the animated lead-ins for the show, replacing Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had replaced Walt Disney as the voice of Mickey for theatrical short cartoons. Walt Disney had been the original voice of Mickey and for the original 1954\u20141959 run provided the voice for animated introductions to the original TV show but had died in 1966. Allwine kept providing the voice for the character up to his death in 2009.\n\nFuture rock musician [[Courtney Love]] (wife of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] lead singer [[Kurt Cobain]]) claims to have auditioned for a part on the show, reading a poem by [[Sylvia Plath]]; she was not selected.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Selby|first1=Jenn|title=Happy 50th birthday, Courtney Love.

([[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Disney]] since regained only distribution rights.)\n\n==<!-- Other articles link here. -->1989\u20131994 revival, ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club''==\nReruns of the original ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' began airing on [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] with the channel's 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, the Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly as it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new version of the club, one aimed toward contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new \"club-members\" would wear Mouseketeer varsity jackets without the iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club'' (also known as \"MMC\" to fans).\n\nThis version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to achieve global success in music and acting, including [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[JC Chasez]], [[Keri Russell]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Deedee Magno Hall|Deedee Magno]], [[Rhona Bennett]], [[Nikki DeLoach]], and [[Chase Hampton]]. [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] was selected to join the program at age twelve, however, he decided to join the developing boy band, [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Moraski|first=Lauren|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nick-carter-relives-his-backstreet-boys-audition_n_5952a192e4b05c37bb79eb75|title=Nick Carter Relives His Backstreet Boys Audition|date=June 29, 2017|publisher=huffpost.com}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the run, [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] was the main adult co-host from the beginning of the series until season 6. In the first season, Newman was joined by other co-host Mowava Pryor. She was then replaced by Terri Eoff from the fourth season until the sixth season. By the show's final season, two original members [[Chase Hampton]] and Tiffini Hale became the co-hosts. \n\nThis was the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a fairly small group.\n\nFormer Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred in the show's first season finale. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the show's third season. Funicello later appeared on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer [[Lindsey Alley]].\n\n===Scheduling and air times===\nFrom the first through fifth seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30 pm. Through season 6, the show aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00 pm (later moved a half hour later, to 7:30 pm). The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes (55, each season). Seasons 4 and 6 were shorter, having about 35 episodes (36 in season 6) each. The remaining seasons were a standard 45 episodes (44 in season 7) each.\n\n===Skits===\nThe show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off well-known movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences experienced by teens, often teaching viewers a lesson on how to handle real-life situations.\n\n===Music videos===\nThe series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. This became one of the most popular segments.\n\n===Live concerts and performances===\nA unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on different days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when the kids had more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.\n\n===Theme days===\nThis version maintained the \"theme day\" format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after canceling the series once season 7 production had ended, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first-run episodes into early 1996. The final season premiered in May 1995, almost a year after production had started and more than 6 months after the series finale was taped.\n\nTheme days were:\n* Music Day&nbsp;\u2013 Mondays (seasons 1\u20135), Tuesdays (season 6)\n* Guest Day&nbsp;\u2013 Tuesdays (seasons 1\u20135), Mondays (season 6)\n* Anything Can Happen Day&nbsp;\u2013 Wednesdays (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Party Day&nbsp;\u2013 Thursdays (seasons 1\u20134, 6), Fridays (season 5)\n* Hall of Fame Day&nbsp;\u2013 Fridays (seasons 1\u20134), Thursdays (season 5), Wednesdays (season 6)\n\n===Mouseketeer roster===\nThe adult co-hosts for the show were [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] (1989\u20131993, seasons 1-6), Mowava Pryor (1989\u20131990, seasons 1\u20133), Terri Misner Eoff (1991\u20131993 (seasons 4\u20136), [[Tiffini Hale]] (1994, season 7), and [[Chase Hampton]] (1994, season 7).\n\nThe 35 Mouseketeers and the seasons in which they were featured are:<!--listed with season numbers rather than years to avoid controversy over series ending dates.

Created by [[Walt Disney]] and produced by [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]], the program was first televised for four seasons, from 1955 to 1959, by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. This original run featured a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958\u20131959 season, airing right after ''[[American Bandstand]]''. The show was revived three times after its initial 1955\u20131959 run on ABC, first from 1977 to 1979 for [[Broadcast syndication#First-run syndication in the U.S.|first-run syndication]] as '''''The New Mickey Mouse Club''''', then from 1989 to 1996 as '''''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club''''' (also known to fans as '''''MMC''''' from 1993 to 1996) airing exclusively on [[cable television]]'s [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]], and again in 2017 with the moniker '''''Club Mickey Mouse''''' airing exclusively on internet social media.\n\n[[Mickey Mouse]] himself appeared in every show, not only in vintage cartoons originally made for theatrical release, but also in the opening, interstitial, and closing segments made especially for the show. In both the vintage cartoons and new animated segments, Mickey was voiced by his creator [[Walt Disney]]. (Disney had previously voiced the character theatrically from 1928 to 1947 before being replaced by [[sound effects]] artist [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]].)\n\n==Before the TV series==\nThe first official theater-based Mickey Mouse Club began on January 11, 1930, at the Fox Dome Theater in [[Santa Monica neighborhoods#Ocean Park Neighborhood|Ocean Park]], [[California]], with 60 theaters hosting clubs by March 31.

Other Mouseketeers were also featured in some of the serials, particularly Annette Funicello and Darlene Gillespie.\n\n===Major serials===\nMajor serials included:<ref name=\"Cotter\" />\n* ''[[Spin and Marty]]'' (three serials, starring [[Tim Considine]] and [[David Stollery]] in the title roles)\n* ''[[The Hardy Boys#Television|The Hardy Boys]]'' (two serials, starring [[Tim Considine]] and [[Tommy Kirk]])\n* ''Corky and White Shadow'', starring Darlene Gillespie\n* ''[[Walt Disney Presents: Annette]]'', starring Annette Funicello\n* ''[[Adventure in Dairyland]]'', featuring Funicello and Sammy Ogg, and introducing Kevin Corcoran as Moochie\n* ''[[List of Jiminy Cricket educational serials|Jiminy Cricket educational serials]]'' (four animated serials educating kids on different topics)\n* ''[[The Adventures of Clint and Mac]]'' (starring Neil Wolfe as Clint Rogers and Jonathan Bailey as Alastair \"Mac\" MacIntosh)\n* ''Boys of the Western Sea'' (English language-dubbed Danish film broken into nine 10-minute segments)\n<!-- \"Border Collie\"\n -->\n===Music===\nThe opening theme, \"The [[Mickey Mouse March]]\", was written by the show's primary adult host, Jimmie Dodd.<ref name=\"Cotter\" /> It was also reprised at the end of each episode, with the slower \"it's-time-to-say-goodbye\" verse. A shorter version of the opening title was used later in the series, in syndication, and on Disney Channel reruns. Dodd also wrote many other songs used in individual segments throughout the series.\n\n===Show themes===\nEach day of the week had a special show theme, which was reflected in the several segments. The themes were:\n* Monday&nbsp;\u2013 Fun with Music Day\n* Tuesday&nbsp;\u2013 Guest Star Day\n* Wednesday&nbsp;\u2013 Anything Can Happen Day\n* Thursday&nbsp;\u2013 Circus Day\n* Friday&nbsp;\u2013 Talent Round-up Day\n\n===Scheduling and air times===\nThe series ran on ABC Television for an hour each weekday in the 1955\u20131956 and 1956\u20131957 seasons (from 5:00 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET), and only a half-hour weekdays (5:30 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET) in 1957\u20131958, the final season to feature new programming.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|title=Mickey the Magnificent|date=May 1957|publisher=TV-Radio Mirror|page=21|access-date=12 February 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716020651/http://www.otrr.org/FILES/Magz_pdf/TV_Radio_Mirror/TV%20Radio%20Mirror%205705.pdf|archivedate=16 July 2014}}</ref> Although the show returned for the 1958\u20131959 season (5:30 to 6:00&nbsp;pm ET), these programs were repeats from the first two seasons, recut into a half-hour format. ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' was featured on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and ''Walt Disney's Adventure Time'', featuring reruns of ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' serials and several re-edited segments from ''[[Disneyland]]'' and ''[[Walt Disney Presents]]'', appeared on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\n===Cancellation===\nAlthough the show remained popular, ABC decided to cancel it after its fourth season ended, because Disney and the ABC network could not come to terms for its renewal.<ref name=Cotter/> The cancellation of the show in September 1959 was attributed to several factors: the Disney studios did not realize high-profit margins from merchandise sales, the sponsors were uninterested in educational programming for children, and many commercials were needed to pay for the show. After canceling ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', ABC also refused to let Disney air the show on another network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billcotter.com/zorro/hour-episodes.htm|title=Zorro - The Hour-Long Episodes|website=www.billcotter.com}}</ref> Walt Disney filed a lawsuit against ABC, and won the damages in a settlement; however, he had to agree that both the ''Mickey Mouse Club'' and ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' could not be aired on any major network. This left ''Walt Disney Presents'' (initially titled ''Disneyland'', later retitled the ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color]]'' when it moved to NBC) as the only Disney series which was left on [[prime time]] until 1972 when ''[[The Mouse Factory]]'' went on the air. The prohibition which prevented major American broadcast networks from playing the original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' (or any later version of it) was disputed when Disney acquired ABC in 1996. Although it would not air on ABC again, Disney ran it on the Disney Channel's \"Vault Disney\" block from 1998-2002.\n\n===Australian tour===\nAlthough the series had been ended in the United States, many members of the cast assembled for highly successful tours of Australia in 1959 and 1960. The television series was very successful in Australia and was still running on Australian television. The cast surprised Australian audiences, as by then they had physically matured and in some cases, bore little resemblance to the young cast with whom Australians were so familiar. Mainstream television did not reach Australia until 1956, so the series screened well into the 1960s when the back catalog expired.\n\n===Syndication===\nIn response to continuing audience demand, the original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' went into edited syndicated half-hour reruns that enjoyed wide distribution starting in the fall of 1962, achieving strong ratings especially during its first three seasons in syndicated release. (Because of its popularity in some markets, a few stations continued to carry it into 1968 before the series was finally withdrawn from syndication.) Some new features were added such as ''Fun with Science'' or \"Professor Wonderful\" (with scientist [[Julius Sumner Miller]]) and ''Marvelous Marvin'' in the 1964\u20131965 season; Jimmie Dodd appeared in several of these new segments before his death in November 1964. Many markets stretched the program back to an hour's daily run time during the 1960s rerun cycle by adding locally produced and hosted portions involving educational subjects and live audience participation of local children, in a manner not unlike ''[[Romper Room]]''.\n\nIn response to an upsurge in demand from [[baby boomers]] entering adulthood, the show again went into syndicated reruns from January 20, 1975, until January 14, 1977.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cotter |first1=Bill |title=The Wonderful World of Disney Television: A Complete History |date=1997 |publisher=Hyperion |isbn=978-0786863594 |page=195}}</ref> It has since been rerun on cable specialty channels Disney in the United States and [[Family Channel (Canadian TV network)|Family]] in Canada. The original ''Mickey Mouse Club'' films aired five days a week on [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] from its launch in 1983 until the third version of the series began in 1989. The last airing of the edited 1950s material was on Disney Channel's ''Vault Disney'' from 1997 to September 2002. During the baseball seasons in 1975 and 1976, WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, aired the show on a delayed basis due to Cubs ballgame coverages.\n\n===Reunions===\nAnnette Funicello and Tim Considine were reunited on ''The New Mickey Mouse Club'' in 1977. Darlene Gillespie and Cubby O'Brien were also reunited on another episode of the same series.\n\n31 out of the 39 original Mouseketeers were reunited for a TV special, which aired on ''[[Disney anthology television series|Disney's Wonderful World]]'' in November 1980.\n\nCast members Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode of ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club'', during the show's third season in 1991.\n \nMouseketeers Doreen Tracey, Cubby O'Brien, Sherry Alberoni, Sharon Baird, Don Grady, Cheryl Holdridge, Bobby Burgess, Karen Pendleton, Tommy Cole, and Mary Espinosa performed together at [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]] in the fall of 2005, in observance of Disneyland's 50th birthday, and the 50th anniversary of the TV premiere of ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.\n\n===Streaming===\nIn early 2020, the first week of the Mickey Mouse Club and the first Spin and Marty serial have been added to Disney's new streaming platform Disney+.\n\n==Talent Round-Up Stars==\n* Larry Ashurst\n* Janice Crowe\n* Peter Lee Palmer\n* Mark Sutherland\n* Bo Wagner\n* [[Pamela Beaird]]\n* Mary Sartori\n* John F. Smith\n* Maxine Grossman\n* Linda Hughes\n* Cheryl Weinberg\n* Ronnie Wilson\n* Riley Wilson\n* Jimmie Fields\n* [[Donna Loren]]\n* Ray Little\n\n==<!-- Other articles link here. -->1977 revival, ''The New Mickey Mouse Club''==\nIn 1977, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] revived the concept, but modernized the show cosmetically, with a [[disco]] re-recording of the theme song and a more ethnically diverse group of young cast members. The sets were brightly colored and simpler than the detailed black and white artwork of the original. Like the original, nearly every day's episode included a vintage cartoon, though usually in color from the late 1930s onward. The 1977 Mouseketeers were part of the halftime show of [[Super Bowl XI]] on January 9, 1977.\n\n===Serials===\nSerials were usually old Disney movies, cut into segments for twice-weekly inclusion. Movies included ''[[Third Man on the Mountain]]'', ''[[The Misadventures of Merlin Jones]]'' and its sequel ''[[The Monkey's Uncle]]'' (both starring [[Tommy Kirk]]), ''[[Emil and the Detectives (1964 film)|Emil and the Detectives]]'' (retitled ''The Three Skrinks''), ''[[Tonka (film)|Tonka]]'' (retitled ''A Horse Called Comanche''), ''The Horse Without a Head'' (about a toy horse), and ''[[Toby Tyler]]'' (starring [[Kevin Corcoran]]). In addition, one original serial was produced, ''The Mystery of Rustler's Cave'', starring [[Kim Richards]] and [[Robbie Rist]]. Often shown were scenes from animated Disney films, from ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' to ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' billed as \"Mouseka Movie Specials\".\n\n===Theme days===\nTheme days were:\n* Monday: Who, What, Why, Where, When and How\n* Tuesday: Let's Go\n* Wednesday: Surprise\n* Thursday: Discovery\n* Friday: Showtime (at Disneyland, with performers usually at Plaza Gardens)\n\n===Syndication===\nThe series debuted on January 17, 1977, on 38 local [[television station]]s in the United States, and by June of that same year, when the series was discontinued, about 70 stations in total had picked up the series. Additional stations picked up the canceled program, which continued to run until January 12, 1979; 130 new episodes, with much of the original material repackaged and a bit of new footage added, and a shortened version of the theme song, was produced to start airing September 5, 1977. Since the 1970s, the series has aired only briefly in reruns, unlike its 1950s predecessor, and while both the 1950s and 1989/1990s series had DVD releases of select episodes in July 2005, the 1970s series has been largely forgotten by many, including the generation of youthful viewers who made it their club. On November 20, 1977, \"The Mouseketeers at Walt Disney World\" was shown on ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''. WGN-TV in Chicago, Illinois, also aired this version on a delayed basis in 1977 and 1978 during the Cubs baseball season due to game coverages. [[Action for Children's Television]] successfully got the show canceled because of their objections to the types of commercials that aired during the program.\n\n===Cast===\nThe cast of twelve (five boys and seven girls) had a more diverse multiethnic background than the 1950s version. Several 1977\u20131978 cast members went on to become TV stars and other notable icons.\n\nThe show's most notable alumnus was [[Lisa Whelchel]] (born in 1963, in [[Littlefield, Texas]]), who later starred in the [[NBC]] television sitcom ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'' which ran from 1979 to 1988 before becoming a well-known Christian author, and most recently, overall runner-up, and winner of the $100,000 viewers' choice award, on the [[Survivor: Philippines|fall 2012 season]] of the [[CBS]] television reality series ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]''. Mouseketeer [[Julie Piekarski]] (born in 1963 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].) also appeared with Lisa Whelchel on the first season of ''The Facts of Life''. [[Kelly Parsons]] (born in 1964, in [[Coral Gables, Florida]]) went on to become a [[beauty queen]] and runner-up to [[Miss USA]].\n\nOther Mouseketeers (from seasons 1\u20132) from the 1977 show:<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n* '''William \"Billy\"/\"Pop\" Attmore:''' born at US military base in Landstuhl, West Germany, 1965; appeared in a few movies before and after the series, a final season episode of ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' (\"Kelly's Kids\"), and as a streetwise hood in the short-lived ''[[Eischied]]'' crime drama.\n* '''Scott Craig:''' born in [[Van Nuys, California]], in 1964; lived in Las Vegas, Nevada, died December 30, 2003 from a respiratory illness.\n* '''Benita \"Nita Dee\" DiGiampaolo:''' born in [[Long Beach, California]] in 1966; appeared at the last end of an episode in 1981 of ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' as Elena. Nita appeared in ''ABC Family Weekends'' in 1978 as Nita and 1978 as Maria. Nita also starred in Upbeat Aesop (ABC) produced by Ron Miziker (A Disney executive).\n* '''Mindy Feldman:''' born in [[Burbank, California]] in 1968; sister of Hollywood actor [[Corey Feldman]].\n* '''Angel Florez:''' born in [[Stockton, California]] in 1963; died April 25, 1995 from an [[AIDS]]-related illness.\n* '''[[Allison Fonte]]:''' born in [[Buena Park, California]] in 1964.\n* '''Shawnte Northcutte''' born in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1965; appeared on an episode of ''[[The Facts of Life (TV series)|The Facts of Life]]'', as Madge.\n* '''Todd Turquand:''' born in [[Hollywood, California]] in 1964.\n* '''Curtis Wong:''' born in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]] in 1962; appeared on an episode of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', as an assistant [[karate]] instructor under [[Soon-Tek Oh]].\n\nDisney [[voice actor]] and sound effects editor [[Wayne Allwine]] voiced Mickey Mouse in the animated lead-ins for the show, replacing Jimmy MacDonald, who in 1947 had replaced Walt Disney as the voice of Mickey for theatrical short cartoons. Walt Disney had been the original voice of Mickey and for the original 1954\u20141959 run provided the voice for animated introductions to the original TV show but had died in 1966. Allwine kept providing the voice for the character up to his death in 2009.\n\nFuture rock musician [[Courtney Love]] (wife of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] lead singer [[Kurt Cobain]]) claims to have auditioned for a part on the show, reading a poem by [[Sylvia Plath]]; she was not selected.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Selby|first1=Jenn|title=Happy 50th birthday, Courtney Love.

([[Disney-ABC Domestic Television|Disney]] since regained only distribution rights.)\n\n==<!-- Other articles link here. -->1989\u20131994 revival, ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club''==\nReruns of the original ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' began airing on [[Disney Channel|The Disney Channel]] with the channel's 1983 launch. While the show was popular with younger audiences, the Disney Channel executives felt it had become dated over the years, particularly as it was aired in black-and-white. Their answer was to create a brand-new version of the club, one aimed toward contemporary audiences. Notably, the all-new \"club-members\" would wear Mouseketeer varsity jackets without the iconic Mickey Mouse ears. This show was called ''The All-New Mickey Mouse Club'' (also known as \"MMC\" to fans).\n\nThis version of the series is notable for featuring a number of cast members who went on to achieve global success in music and acting, including [[Britney Spears]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[JC Chasez]], [[Keri Russell]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Deedee Magno Hall|Deedee Magno]], [[Rhona Bennett]], [[Nikki DeLoach]], and [[Chase Hampton]]. [[Nick Carter (musician)|Nick Carter]] was selected to join the program at age twelve, however, he decided to join the developing boy band, [[Backstreet Boys]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Moraski|first=Lauren|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nick-carter-relives-his-backstreet-boys-audition_n_5952a192e4b05c37bb79eb75|title=Nick Carter Relives His Backstreet Boys Audition|date=June 29, 2017|publisher=huffpost.com}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the run, [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] was the main adult co-host from the beginning of the series until season 6. In the first season, Newman was joined by other co-host Mowava Pryor. She was then replaced by Terri Eoff from the fourth season until the sixth season. By the show's final season, two original members [[Chase Hampton]] and Tiffini Hale became the co-hosts. \n\nThis was the first version of the club to have any studio audience, though a fairly small group.\n\nFormer Mouseketeer Don Grady guest-starred in the show's first season finale. Grady, along with fellow Mouseketeers Annette Funicello, Bobby Burgess, Tommy Cole, Sharon Baird, and Sherry Alberoni were reunited on the 100th episode, during the show's third season. Funicello later appeared on the show again, in an interview with the Mouseketeer [[Lindsey Alley]].\n\n===Scheduling and air times===\nFrom the first through fifth seasons, the series aired Monday through Friday at 5:30 pm. Through season 6, the show aired Monday to Thursday. In its final season, it aired Thursdays only at 7:00 pm (later moved a half hour later, to 7:30 pm). The series premiered Monday, April 24, 1989, ended production in October 1994, and aired its last original episode in 1996. Seasons 3 and 5 had the most episodes (55, each season). Seasons 4 and 6 were shorter, having about 35 episodes (36 in season 6) each. The remaining seasons were a standard 45 episodes (44 in season 7) each.\n\n===Skits===\nThe show was known for its sketch comedy. Some of the sketches played off well-known movies, musicals, and even cartoons, as well as holiday-related skits. During the final season, some of the skits showed everyday occurrences experienced by teens, often teaching viewers a lesson on how to handle real-life situations.\n\n===Music videos===\nThe series featured music videos of the Mouseketeers singing their versions of popular songs in front of a live studio audience or the [[Walt Disney World Resort]]. This became one of the most popular segments.\n\n===Live concerts and performances===\nA unique feature of the show was the Mouseketeers performing concerts on different days (which were usually taped the day before or in the summer, when the kids had more time). During the final season, the concerts were replaced primarily by live performances that featured singing and dancing in front of the audience.\n\n===Theme days===\nThis version maintained the \"theme day\" format from the previous two versions. When Disney decided to revamp the show for its final season, the show was reduced to a single weekly airing, shown only on Thursdays. Although still produced as a daily series during the final season taping in 1994, The Disney Channel, after canceling the series once season 7 production had ended, decided to air the final season in a weekly format, therefore stretching the first-run episodes into early 1996. The final season premiered in May 1995, almost a year after production had started and more than 6 months after the series finale was taped.\n\nTheme days were:\n* Music Day&nbsp;\u2013 Mondays (seasons 1\u20135), Tuesdays (season 6)\n* Guest Day&nbsp;\u2013 Tuesdays (seasons 1\u20135), Mondays (season 6)\n* Anything Can Happen Day&nbsp;\u2013 Wednesdays (seasons 1\u20135)\n* Party Day&nbsp;\u2013 Thursdays (seasons 1\u20134, 6), Fridays (season 5)\n* Hall of Fame Day&nbsp;\u2013 Fridays (seasons 1\u20134), Thursdays (season 5), Wednesdays (season 6)\n\n===Mouseketeer roster===\nThe adult co-hosts for the show were [[Fred Newman (actor)|Fred Newman]] (1989\u20131993, seasons 1-6), Mowava Pryor (1989\u20131990, seasons 1\u20133), Terri Misner Eoff (1991\u20131993 (seasons 4\u20136), [[Tiffini Hale]] (1994, season 7), and [[Chase Hampton]] (1994, season 7).\n\nThe 35 Mouseketeers and the seasons in which they were featured are:<!--listed with season numbers rather than years to avoid controversy over series ending dates.

{"title_page": "Florigen", "text_new": "'''Florigen''' (or '''flowering hormone''') is the hypothesized [[hormone]]-like molecule responsible for controlling and/or triggering [[flowering]] in plants. Florigen is produced in the [[leaf|leaves]], and acts in the [[shoot apical meristem]] of [[bud]]s and growing tips. It is known to be graft-transmissible, and even functions between species. However, despite having been sought since the 1930s, the exact nature of florigen is still disputed.\n\n==Mechanism ==\n\nCentral to the hunt for florigen is an understanding of how plants use seasonal changes in day length to mediate flowering\u2014a mechanism known as [[photoperiodism]]. Plants which exhibit photoperiodism may be either 'short day' or 'long day' plants, which in order to flower require short days or long days respectively, although plants in fact distinguish day length from night length.<ref name=\"Garner1920\">{{cite journal|author1=Garner W.W. |author2=Allard H.A. |year= 1920 |title=Effect of the relative length of day and night and other factors of the environment on growth and reproduction in plants |journal= Monthly Weather Review|volume=18 |pages=553\u2013606 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1920)48<415b:EOTRLO>2.0.CO;2| issue=7|bibcode=1920MWRv...48..415G |doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe current model suggests the involvement of multiple different factors.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\"Distinct roles of GIGANTEA\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

His special duties during that period included community relations with the large island population and labor relations, including negotiating contracts with several different unions.\n\nGracey served in a number of [[Flag officer|flag officer]] assignments prior to becoming commandant, including commander of the [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-based [[Ninth Coast Guard District]], with responsibility for the Great Lakes area; commander of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]-based [[Twelfth Coast Guard District]] and Pacific Area, with responsibility for the [[Pacific Ocean]] area; and commander of the [[Governors Island]], New York-based Third Coast Guard District and Atlantic Area, with responsibility for the U.S. Eastern seaboard and Gulf Coast.\n\nGracey passed away on Sunday, 05 April 2020, in Falls Church, VA, at the age of 92.\n\n==Dates of rank==\n:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n![[Ensign (rank)#United States|Ensign]]\n![[Lieutenant, Junior Grade]]\n!Lieutenant\n![[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]]\n![[Commander (United States)|Commander]]\n![[Captain (U.S. Coast Guard)|Captain]]\n|-\n!O-1\n!O-2\n!O-3\n!O-4\n!O-5\n!O-6\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:USCG O-1 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:USCG O-2 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O3 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:USCG O-4 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O5 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O6 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!June 3, 1949\n!~1951\n!~1954\n!~1959\n!~1965\n!July 1969\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; width:100%;\"\n|-\n![[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]]\n![[Rear Admiral]]\n![[Vice Admiral (United States)|Vice Admiral]]\n![[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]]\n|-\n!O-7\n!O-8\n!O-9\n!O-10\n|-\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O7 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O8 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:US CG O9 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|  style=\"text-align:center; width:16%;\"| [[File:USCG O-10 insignia.svg|60px]]\n|-\n!Never held\n!October 1, 1974\n!July 1, 1978\n!May 28, 1982\n|}\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-mil}}\n{{succession box | before = [[John B.

{"title_page": "List of Ratchet & Clank characters", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Ratchet & Clank'' characters}}\nThis is a '''list of characters from the ''Ratchet & Clank'' video game series'''. ''[[Ratchet & Clank]]'' is a series of [[Platform game|platform video games]] developed by [[Insomniac Games]] and [[High Impact Games]]. The series features a large cast of characters voiced by veteran voice actors.\n\nThe series centers on the exploits of Ratchet (a [[bobcat]]-like creature known as a Lombax that is very handy with tools) and Clank (a diminutive sentient [[robot]] that befriends Ratchet) as they save the galaxy from several evil forces.\n\n==Protagonists==\n\n===Ratchet===\n{{main|Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)}}\n'''Ratchet''' (voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]] in the first game, [[James Arnold Taylor]] in all later appearances) is a [[Ratchet & Clank#Lombaxes|Lombax]] who is first shown in the first game, seen in the opening cutscene working as a mechanic, living by himself on the planet Veldin. Longing for adventure, Ratchet's life changes when he meets the diminutive robot fugitive named Clank. From there on, he and the small robot begin to keep the universe protected from threats.\n\n===Clank===\n{{main|Clank (Ratchet & Clank)}}\n'''Clank''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) is a small robot who is initially created in a Blargian war-robot factory. After escaping, he is found by Ratchet and becomes his partner in stopping the Blarg and many other threats to the universe.\n\n==Major Characters==\n\n===Captain Qwark===\n{{main|Captain Qwark}}\n'''Captain Copernicus Leslie Qwark''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the Solana Galaxy's self-proclaimed superhero, though he is in reality a cowardly blowhard whose egotistical actions frequently cause more trouble for Ratchet and Clank than they prevent.\n\n===The Plumber===\n'''The Plumber''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]] in the first three games, [[Jess Harnell]] in later appearances) is a staple the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series. He almost always appears with his rear end sticking out of whatever he is working on, and surprisingly is always a reliable ally whenever he appears. In ''Ratchet & Clank'' and ''Going Commando'', the Plumber is an NPC that appears on separate occasions.  Once later in Going Commando, he sells Ratchet an item to exchange for another. In ''Up Your Arsenal'', he returns to ask Ratchet to search for Sewer Crystals, which he will trade bolts for.\n\nThe Plumber does not appear in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''; although the credits state that he had been called away to deal with a \"sump pump emergency in the Rygylian Nebula\". He appears with a non-speaking role as a memory in part of a dream-state world level in ''Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters'', and also appears in ''Secret Agent Clank'' to fix the showers at the prison in which Ratchet is incarcerated, returning them to their typical freezing cold temperature.\n\nThe Plumber returns in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction'', with a new updated design, wearing glasses and having a more detailed outfit. He provides Ratchet with a spare part for the Dimensionator that proves valuable in the game's climax. He then appears once again in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'' in Clank's memory banks. When Clank shows up, The Plumber states that he \"must've taken a wrong turn somewhere\" and mistook it for Qwark's mind because of the \"emptiness\". He then tells Clank \"I wouldn't risk any more than six minutes\", a piece of advice that ultimately allows Clank to save Ratchet from death by reversing time.\n\nHe appears in ''All 4 One'' when he fixes a transport that allows Ratchet and his allies to travel to Uzo City, but when Ratchet asks for some \"cryptic advice\" that can used to stop Nevo, the Plumber admits that he does not have any. In ''Full Frontal Assault'', Stuart Zurgo hologuises as him to damage the Starship Phoenix II. The real Plumber later contacts Ratchet, Clank and Qwark for assistance since he is stuck on a planet. After Ratchet repairs the Plumber's ride, he is confused as he had seen him on the starship. It is after the Plumber leaves that Ratchet and the other two realize that they had been fooled by Stuart.\n\nThe Plumber appears again in \"Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus\" as the apparent creator of the game's version of the RYNO super weapon, the RYNO VII. He split up the blueprints for it in order to prevent misuse. The player can collect the pieces of the blueprint and have the Plumber build it for them.\n\nHe reprises his original position in the 2016 ''Ratchet & Clank'' in the Novalis sewers, only this time, his last words to Ratchet and Clank before leaving the scene are, \"See you in the next reboot.\"\n\nThe plumber makes a cameo appearance in the [[post-credits scene]] of the ''Ratchet & Clank'' film. He berates the viewing audience for watching the credits, stating that there is no bonus scene and orders them to leave.\n\n===Big Al===\nA recurring character who first appears in the original ''[[Ratchet & Clank]]'', '''Big Al''' (voiced by Chris Hatfield) is the stereotypical computer geek from the planet Kerwan with interests in electronics and all things Captain Qwark. Ratchet frequently gets baffled over Al's \"techno-speak\" and usually relies on Clank to translate. He owns \"Big Al's Robo Shack\" and supplies Clank with a Heli-Pack. His siblings Bob and Edwina also own similar Robo Shacks that provide further upgrades for Clank.\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal]]'', Big Al is chosen to join Captain Qwark's \"Q-Force\" for his mastery of electronics, though his involvement in the plot is minimal. Al plays a more significant role during the events of ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'', in which he is captured and made to serve as part of Ratchet's DreadZone support crew. At one point, Al is shot by Ace Hardlight as a warning to Ratchet not to overstep his bounds, but he later returns (with cybernetic parts to cover his wounds) to aid Ratchet in escaping DreadZone. He has not appeared in the series since, though he is occasionally mentioned during ''Tools of Destruction'' and can be heard during a radio advertisement for his Robo Shack in ''A Crack in Time''. Al has a minor role in the comic series, he works on returning Veldin back to its normal orbit after Artemis Zogg removes it for his own galaxy.\n\n===Angela Cross (a.k.a. The Mysterious Thief)===\n'''Angela Cross''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) is a female Lombax who appears in ''Going Commando''. She shares Ratchet's affinity for gadgets and devices, though is frequently clumsy and scatterbrained. Despite her shortcomings, Angela was employed by Megacorp and worked in its genetics division on a secret project to create an artificial \"Protopet\", until she quit when her boss, Mr. Fizzwidget pushed the release date of the creation before she could correct its flaws (namely, its large appetite and savage nature). Angela then disguised herself and stole the prototype creature to get rid of it for good. When Megacorp recruits Ratchet to get it back from her, she hires the mercenary/crime organization Thugs-4-Less to protect her, and tries to get Ratchet out of the way by using his partner Clank as bait. Unfortunately, both tactics fail, and when Thugs-4-Less is bought out of their contract by a third party, Angela (after her identity was revealed) allies herself with Ratchet and Clank to stop Megacorp from releasing the still-highly dangerous Protopet all over the galaxy.\n\nDespite being confirmed as a Lombax in ''A Crack in Time'', Angela has not appeared in any games since ''Going Commando''. During a Polaris News broadcast in ''A Crack in Time'', Angela was confirmed as being a Lombax, that she had fled Bogon in Max Apogee's ship during the earlier phases of Tachyon's invasion, and had been missing along with Apogee for over three years, suggesting both she and Apogee used the Dimensionator to escape Tachyon. The report also confirms her species as a female Lombax, claiming that female Lombaxes do not have tails. In a [[Full Moon Show]] Podcast, it was stated that Angela may be brought back if [[Insomniac Games|Insomniac]] makes another [[Ratchet & Clank|Ratchet & Clank game]].\n\n===Talwyn Apogee===\n'''Talwyn Apogee''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]] in ''Tools of Destruction'' and ''Quest for Booty'', [[Ali Hillis]] in ''Into the Nexus'') is a Markazian and the daughter of Max Apogee, a famous explorer known for his research into the Lombax culture. When Max vanished, Talwyn continued her father's work in finding the \"Lombax Secret\", a device said to have been used to eliminate the evil Cragmites from the galaxy. Her main base of operations is a space station in the Nundac asteroid ring, where she is accompanied by her guardian warbots Cronk and Zephyr.\n\nIn ''Tools of Destruction'', Ratchet is led to Talwyn after intercepting a message from Emperor Tachyon calling for her death. After explaining his situation, Talwyn agrees to help Ratchet in finding the Lombax Secret and overthrowing Tachyon. In ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]'', Talwyn journeys alongside Ratchet in his search for Clank. She does not physically appear in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'', but is seen in Clank's subconscious and is occasionally mentioned on the radio as having requested songs for Ratchet to listen to while flying through space. She also appears in the comic book mini-series, as well as ''Full Frontal Assault'' as a skin and a full appearance in ''Into the Nexus''. In the reimanging movie and game a character named  Cora Veralux seems to be Talwyn's counterpart.\n\n====Cronk and Zephyr====\n'''Cronk and Zephyr''' (voiced by [[Daniel Hagen]] and [[Paul Eiding]] respectively) are a pair of war-robots who frequently accompany Talwyn in her adventures. Heavily rusted and senile from many years of combat, the pair are often heard bickering to each other and rambling about their past experiences but nonetheless serve as reliable allies in Ratchet and Talwyn's search for the Lombax Secret. The pair first appear in ''Tools of Destruction'' and make a voice-only cameo in ''A Crack in Time'' as they bicker during the credits. In ''All 4 One'', Cronk and Zephyr serve as Ratchet's support team by selling him and his allies weapons. The both of them are destroyed by Vendra Prog in ''Into the Nexus'', though their ghosts make one final appearance in the post-credit ending.\n\n===Alister Azimuth===\nNotably prominent in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'', '''General Alister Azimuth''' (voiced by [[Joey D'Auria]]) is a Lombax and serves as a mentor to Ratchet. He has white and red fur, unlike Ratchet and Angela who have yellow and brown/orange fur.  This is not due to age, because although Alister is much older than Ratchet, his fur has been this color since his youth. He uses a double-headed Praetorian Omniwrench as his weapon of choice. In his youth, Azimuth was close friends with Ratchet's father, Kaden, and carries a pocketwatch that holds a photo of the two of them standing together. Azimuth was indirectly responsible for Emperor Tachyon's rise to power and the deaths of Ratchet's parents, as he gave Tachyon full access to Lombax technology in the hopes that he would be able to help them. For his crimes, he was forbidden to join the Lombaxes as they left to another dimension, and has lived in exile ever since.\n\nWhen Ratchet first finds Azimuth, the general initially mistakes him for a Hologuised assassin (sent by either Lord Vorselon or Nefarious) but soon recognizes Ratchet as being Kaden's son and requests forgiveness about the misunderstanding. General Azimuth explains to Ratchet about Clank's presumed connection with the Zoni and how he and Kaden were both aware of the Great Clock's very existence. He then teaches Ratchet on using hoverboots which would come in handy in stopping Dr. Nefarious from taking control of the Great Clock. After Nefarious reminds Azimuth on how he shamed the Lombax race, Azimuth explains to Ratchet how he fell to Tachyon's trickery, and how he plans to use the Great Clock himself, so that he and Ratchet can prevent Tachyon's rise to power and stop the Lombaxes from having to leave for their new dimension. Ratchet initially goes along with the plan, but changes his mind after saving Clank who informs him and Azimuth that the Great Clock could destroy all of existence if misused. Unable to accept Ratchet's change of decision, General Azimuth leaves him.\n\nHe later appears to rescue Ratchet and Clank after they defeat Dr. Nefarious and takes them to the Great Clock. Despite Azimuth's insistence, Ratchet still refuses to risk using the Great Clock, causing the elder Lombax to kill Ratchet by blasting him with his wrench out of anger. Azimuth then tries to enter the Orvus Chamber, but Clank locks him out and uses the Great Clock to reverse time by six minutes (as previously hinted by the Plumber) so that he can save Ratchet. Azimuth, now blinded by his own selfish desire to save all the Lombaxes, breaks into the chamber and locks the Clock into turning back time to Tachyon's rise to power, before engaging both Ratchet and Clank in a bloody duel as the game's final boss. Once defeated, Azimuth finally realizes his mistake and stops the time shift he created, though at the cost of his own life. Ratchet takes Azimuth's possessions, a pocketwatch and his own Praetorian wrench, as reminders of his mentor.\n\nAzimuth makes a small cameo in the first issue of the six-part comic series, where Ratchet is looking at the pocketwatch in memory. Ratchet later uses Azimuth's Praetorian Wrench in the following issues to stop Artemis Zogg in his plans.\n\nA Red Team skin based on Azimuth, appears in ''Full Frontal Assault''. ''Into The Nexus'' features a statue of Azimuth on display in the Museum of Intergalactic History.\n\n===Kaden===\n'''Kaden''' is the father of [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]] and the keeper of the Dimensionator. When the Lombaxes were driven to use the device to escape to another dimension following Percival Tachyon's overrunning of Fastoon, Kaden refused to follow them in order to protect the device. Kaden managed to survive Tachyon's ravaging of Fastoon and was able to hide his infant son (Ratchet) from the Cragmite by sending him to Veldin, but Kaden was eventually found and executed by Tachyon.\n\n===Orvus===\nAppearing in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]'', '''Orvus''' (voiced by [[Charles Martinet]]) is the unique Zoni who created the Great Clock as its original Caretaker and is also Clank's \"father\", as he is responsible for Clank's possession of a [[soul]]. After he is captured by Dr. Nefarious, Orvus teleports to somewhere unknown, and Clank is brought to the Great Clock by the Zoni to become its new Caretaker in his absence. As Clank is trained by the Clock's Junior Caretaker Sigmund (another robot that Orvus possibly granted a soul to) in his new duties, Orvus communicates with him through a series of simulated programs stored in his memory banks.\n\nAt the end of the game, Clank chooses to continue his adventures with Ratchet and leaves Sigmund in charge of the Great Clock as the Caretaker, and Orvus's final message proclaims that his greatest desire is for Clank to be happy with whatever life he chooses.\n\n===Sasha Phyronix===\n'''Sasha Phyronix''' (voiced by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]]) is a Cazar who is the captain of the Starship Phoenix and the daughter of the Galactic President. During the events of ''Up Your Arsenal'', she is in charge of coordinating the Galactic Rangers to combat the growing threat of Dr. Nefarious. Both her and Ratchet appear to have feelings for each other. In ''Deadlocked'', she briefly appears in the opening to inform Ratchet, Clank and Big Al about the death of Captain Starshield during his service to Dreadzone as a contestant. Sasha is also about to warn the three about various galactic heroes being captured when she is cut off. She appears a third time in the six issue comic series (set between ''A Crack in Time'' and ''All 4 One''), where she assists Ratchet and Clank in stopping Artemis Zogg in his plans to create his own artificial galaxy. In ''Full Frontal Assault'', Ratchet still kept the Starship Phoenix, which means that he still cares about Sasha.\n\n===Skid McMarx===\n'''Skid McMarx''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]] in the first game and ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Jess Harnell]] in the 2016 game) is a professional [[hoverboard]]er whose name is also spelled Skidd McMarxx. In ''Ratchet & Clank'', he and his agent are attacked by missiles from the Blarg and end up crashing their ship on Planet Aridia while en route to a big hover-board race, they end up being separated after the crash. Ratchet and Clank eventually find him he tells the duo that he is unable to return to his ship because of the Sand Sharks in the area. After Ratchet disposes of the creatures, Skid rewards him with a hover-board and tells Ratchet and Clank about seeing them at the hover-board race on Rilgar.\n\nIn ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'', Skidd is recruited into Captain Qwark's Q-Force for his \"nerves of steel\". Calling himself \"ShaddowDude\", Skidd helps Ratchet and Clank on their assigned mission on Aquatos, despite frequently chickening out and letting Ratchet do all the fighting. He later gets kidnapped by Courtney Gears and is taken to Obani Draco, where he is used as a test dummy for the Biobliterator and turned into a robot. Despite this, Skidd is back to normal by the end of the game (how he was changed back is not revealed, though Big Al mentions that it is possible). Following ''Up Your Arsenal'' Skidd is mentioned as having been picked up by Courtney Gears' old record label.<ref name=news>[http://insomniacgames.com/comics/newsupdate.php?copy=5 Insomniac Games' Galactic News Update #5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507093235/http://www.insomniacgames.com/comics/newsupdate.php?copy=5 |date=2006-05-07 }}</ref>\n\n===Helga von Streissenburgen===\n'''Helga von Streissenburgen''' (voiced by [[Mona Marshall]] in a German accent) is a robot who is Captain Qwark's portly, brutish fitness [[athletic trainer|trainer]]. In ''Ratchet & Clank'', Ratchet runs through a fitness course to meet up with Helga in order to claim the reward, a Swingshot, though she also demands that Ratchet must pay for the gadget after stating that his run was \"the most pathetic display I has ever seen on that Obstacle course!\". Helga is chosen to join the Q-Force for her \"sensual powers of seduction\" in ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal''. Despite her tough appearance, she showed genuine sadness when Qwark \"died\", stating \"Und... we vould frollock in ze fitness course... under ze wee hours of za morning!\" Her full name is revealed in a promotional poster for ''Tools of Destruction'' as '''Helga von Streissenburgen'''.\n\nDouglass C. Perry of IGN commented positively in the \"quirkier\" voices in the supporting cast of ''Ratchet & Clank'' and cited Helga (describing her as \"the weird athletic woman at the end of the stunt course\") as an example.<ref name=RnCIGN>{{cite web |author=Douglass C. Perry |authorlink= |title=IGN: ''Ratchet & Clank'' Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/376/376261p4.html |date=2002-11-04 |work= |publisher=[[IGN]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=The voice acting is solid, if not familiar, too. While Ratchet strives for that perfect dude-like teenager vibe, the voice actor generally hits the mark. Clank is also quite engaging, and in some cases, charming, especially when he finishes a level or gains a weapon. Many of the supporting characters offer the same kind of commercial quality voices found in ''Jak and Daxter'', and some of the times they're quite funny. Other times they just sound commercial. The quirkier ones are best (such as the weird athletic woman at the end of the stunt course), but few stand above the standard and obvious stereotypes.}}</ref>\n\n===Skrunch===\n'''Skrunch''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is Captain Qwark's [[Cyclops|cycloptic]] monkey sidekick. Being a monkey, he loves [[banana]]s. He's also seen running around the Starship Phoenix's bridge. Skrunch joins Clank during some of Clank's missions in ''Up Your Arsenal'' to activate out-of-range buttons or distract powerful enemies and is a gunner for Ratchet on Tyrranosis. Skrunch also makes an appearance in ''Size Matters''. He speaks to Clank twice in the game, first on planet Metalis and again at the end of the game on Quadrona. Not to be confused with the backyard wrestler of the same name.\n\n===Grimroth Razz===\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Grimroth Razz''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film, [[Travis Willingham]] in the 2016 game), or '''Grim''' for short, is a [[mechanic]] from the Polaris Galaxy who became the mentor and legal guardian of Ratchet ever since he found him as an infant. He owns a garage on the planet Veldin where he and Ratchet repair ships.\n\nIn the 2016 video game, Grimroth is revealed to have a twin brother named Felton. Grimroth states that they don't talk much because Grimroth considers Felton to be a slacker.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Chairman Drek===\n'''Chairman Alonzo Drek''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the first game, [[Paul Giamatti]] in the film,<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/13/ratchet-clank-animated-movie-lines-up-star-studded-voice-cast</ref> [[Eric Bauza]] in the 2016 game), eventually retitled to '''Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek''', is the leader of the Blarg and the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank''. With his own homeworld of Orxon overpolluted and overpopulated to the point of being uninhabitable, Drek announces to the Solana Galaxy that he intends to carve out giant chunks of land from other planets and assemble them into a new Blarg planet. To help protect his interests, he hires Captain Qwark to be his spokesman and personal hitman for when Ratchet and Clank start interfering with his operations.\n\nAt the end of the game, Drek attacks Ratchet's homeworld of Veldin with the intent to destroy it and put his piecemeal planet in its former orbit. Confronting the Lombax in a giant robot, Drek then admits to him that the new planet is all part of a larger money-making scheme: once it is complete, Drek intends to pollute it until the Blarg pay him to build another planet, just like he did with Orxon. Drek is killed when he loses control over the robot and crashes into his piecemeal planet, which is then destroyed with a single shot of his own Deplanetizer laser. Drek later appears as an downloadable skin in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault]]'', appears in a Ratchet's dream in [[Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters]], and has a statue of him in the hall of villainy in the Imperial Museum in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''.\n\nIn his review of ''Ratchet & Clank'', Jeff Gerstmann of [[GameSpot]] compared Chairman Drek, an \"evil corporate suit who ... is the leader of a dead, polluted world\", to the antagonistic President Skroob in the film ''[[Spaceballs]]''.<ref name=\"RnCGSpot\">{{cite web |author=Jeff Gerstmann |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetclank/review.html |date=2002-11-02 |work= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=Clank relays a tale of a world in peril, hops onto Ratchet's back, and the duo set off to save the world from Drek, an evil corporate suit who, like President Skroob in the Mel Brooks classic ''Spaceballs'', is the leader of a dead, polluted world.}}</ref> Gavin Frankle of Allgame stated that Chairman Drek's scenes (along with Captain Qwark's) proved to be more entertaining than those of the main characters.<ref name=\"RnCallgame\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=38850&tab=review |title=''Ratchet & Clank'' |last=Frankle |first=Gavin |work=[[Allgame]] | publisher=[[Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Nich Maragos of [[1UP.com]] noted that the final [[boss (video games)|boss fight]] against Chairman Drek was \"overly punishing\".\n\nDrek is one of the two primary antagonists of the [[Ratchet & Clank (film)|''Ratchet & Clank'' film]]. The other one is Dr. Nefarious ([[Armin Shimerman]]).\n\n===Thugs-4-Less===\nA mercenary company in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]'' and ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''. Thugs-4-Less is willing to do anything for a price, no matter how morally questionable it may be.\n\nIn ''Going Commando'', Thugs-4-Less is initially hired by Angela (under the guise of the Mysterious Thief) to stop Ratchet from retrieving it and are later hired by Megacorp to stop him from foiling the company's plan to market the Protopet. In ''Into the Nexus'', Thugs-4-Less is employed by Neftin Prog to provide the added manpower in rescuing his sister Vendra.\n\n====Thug Leader====\nThe '''Thug Leader''' (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) leads Thugs-4-Less. He first appears on planet Endako to fight Ratchet during his rescue mission involving Clank and is encountered several times before finally being defeated on the Thugs' homeworld of Snivelak. In ''Secret Agent Clank'', the Thug Leader meets Ratchet while he's in prison and has his men pick a fight with the Lombax as payback for the previous defeats.\n\n===Protopets===\nThe '''Protopets''' are the main threat in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]''. Devised as the \"perfect pet\", they appear as small, fuzzy blue creatures with large eyes, but they are very vicious, have large appetites, and reproduce rapidly. Megacorp had created the original Protopet and Angela was close to correcting its flaws until CEO Abercrombie Fizzwidget pushed up the release date, putting the Bogon Galaxy at risk from the still dangerous product. Angela Cross attempted to prevent this by stealing the Protopet, but Ratchet unknowingly hand-delivered it back to Megacorp where it was quickly mass-produced and shipped out. Soon, entire planets were overwhelmed by the furry swarm of Protopets.\n\nUnknown to everybody, \"Fizzwidget\" was actually Captain Qwark in disguise, who had orchestrated the entire Protopet crisis so that he could appear and \"save\" the Bogon Galaxy with a device he had stolen from Angela: the Helix-O-Morph. His plan backfires when the Helix-O-Morph instead causes the original Protopet to mutate and eat Qwark whole. After the Mutant Protopet is defeated by Ratchet and Clank, Angela fixes the device (as it turned out, the batteries were in backwards) and turns the Protopet back to its normal size and rendering it completely safe.\n\nNich Maragos of 1UP.com noted that the final boss fight against the Protopet was \"a pushover\".<ref name=\"RnCUYA1UP\">{{cite web |author=Nich Maragos |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review from 1UP.com |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136116&did=1 |date=2004-11-02 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=The fact that it's also the best-balanced of the three helps -- the endgame is neither overly punishing, like the Chairman Drek fight, or a pushover, like the Proto-Pet from ''Going Commando''. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105124516/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136116&did=1 |archivedate=5 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Doctor Nefarious===\n{{main|Doctor Nefarious}}\n'''Doctor Nefarious''' (voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]) is a stereotypical robotic [[mad scientist]] who has a hatred for all [[Organism|organic life forms]] (or \"squishies\", as he calls them). He is the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' and ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time''. In addition, he has several cameo appearances in ''Deadlocked'', ''Size Matters'', ''Quest for Booty'', ''Secret Agent Clank'' and ''Into the Nexus'' as well as a playable appearance in ''All 4 One''.\n\nHe also appears in the ''[[Ratchet & Clank (film)|Ratchet & Clank]]'' film as the true main antagonist in a new, re-imagined organic form before becoming his iconic robot form in the end.\n\n====Lawrence====\n'''Lawrence''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is Doctor Nefarious's robotic butler, noticeably similar to the character [[Jeeves]]. His duties usually consist of \"dirty laundry and whatnot\" and other menial tasks, though he enjoys playing the [[bass guitar]] as a personal hobby (and playing a song in particular called \"Bass Odyssey\"). He has a clear dislike for his boss, often pummeling him with subtle insults or purposely doing a bad job, though he seems to be scornful of essentially most around him. Despite this, Nefarious, who either cannot fend for himself or does not catch on to Lawrence's true nature, still keeps him by his side.\n\nLawrence first appears in ''Up Your Arsenal'', where he serves Dr. Nefarious in his plan to transform all organic life in the Solana Galaxy into robots. When all of Nefarious's plans are foiled due to Ratchet and Clank, Lawrence suggests that he name a destination to escape to via teleporter, but Nefarious doesn't bother and the two of them are teleported onto an asteroid in deep space, where they aimlessly drift in isolation. In ''Deadlocked'''s ending, the asteroid is seen passing through the already-destroyed DreadZone Station. When Nefarious complains that they're not getting rescued, Lawrence tells him that he didn't know the station would be destroyed by the time they arrived. Eventually, the asteroid wanders into the Polaris Galaxy and lands on Zanifar. After spending time with the planet's Fongoids, Nefarious discovers the Great Clock and begins his plan to take control of it.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Lawrence continues to serve Nefarious in his usual sarcastic way. While Clank explores the Great Clock and learns about its functions, Lawrence secretly follows him and reports to Nefarious on his progress. After Clank enters the Orvus Chamber, Lawrence ambushes him and sends Clank to the Valkyries to be used as bait for Ratchet. During the battle with Nefarious, Lawrence provides support from a laser-equipped UFO, but he escapes before it and Nefarious crash into their own space station.\n\nTwo years later in ''All 4 One'', Nefarious appears before Ratchet, Clank and Qwark and has Lawrence reanimate a Light-Eating Z'grute from cryosleep in the intent to have it kill the three. The plan backfires when it drains the electricity on Lawrence's hovercraft, resulting in Lawrence and Nefarious falling to the floor. After the doctor demands Lawrence to help him out, Lawrence \"tends his resignation\" and leaves. He does not return until the end of the game where he helps Cronk and Zephyr in landing their ship on Magnus to retrieve Ratchet and his allies. Lawrence asks Nefarious for his employ again and the two take the ship, flying off into space.\n\n===Courtney Gears===\nA clear parody of [[Britney Spears]], '''Courtney Gears''' (voiced by [[Melissa Disney]] in ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'') is a female [[Celebrity|pop star]] robot who occasionally gives out prizes on the show, ''Annihilation Nation''. Her music and videos are popular in the Solana Galaxy. As Ratchet tells Clank about Courtney being famous for her physical appearance rather than her singing voice (\"She's not the hottest pop star in the galaxy because of her singing.\"). Courtney is initially interested in Clank and the star power she can gain from playing a role on his ''Secret Agent Clank'' Holo Vid series. At Holostar Studios, she knocks Clank out and takes him to Doctor Nefarious, whom she is working for and apparently in love with (possibly because of his idea of robot freedom). When Skid gets himself kidnapped, Ratchet travels to Obani Draco and defeats Courtney in direct combat.\n\nCourtney later recovered and is mentioned in ''Deadlocked'' as having made a \"miraculous recovery after her attack by two psychotic fans\" (Ratchet and Clank). As part of her new contract with Vox, Courtney appears in the trailer for ''Reactor: Rise of the Sociopathic Bloodlust'', where she plays the role of girlfriend to the DreadZone Exterminator Reactor. In the trailer, Courtney dumps Reactor because of his pathetic High School math teacher persona, but runs right back to him as soon as he becomes a \"homicidal popstar\".<ref name=\"news\"/> What happened to Courtney after the destruction of the DreadZone Station is unknown, though a similar character (with the same voice) appears in ''Secret Agent Clank''.\n\nJeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised Courtney Gears' music video sequence as \"a spot-on parody of recent [[pop music]]\", citing the video's \"synchronized dance moves\", \"epic pop production\" and \"incredible devotion to extreme overuse of an [[Pitch correction|autotuner]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Jeff Gerstmann |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetclankiii/review.html |date=2004-11-03 |work= |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=One sequence is the latest music video from a female robot called Courtney Gears, and everything, from the synchronized dance moves to the song's epic pop production and incredible devotion to extreme overuse of an autotuner, is a spot-on parody of recent pop music.}}</ref>\n\n===Klunk===\n'''Klunk''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) is a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Clank that Doctor Nefarious uses to learn what Ratchet and the Q-Force are planning. Klunk's eyes are naturally red, but turn green when in disguise as Clank. Unlike the well-mannered Clank, Klunk is evil and nearly swears at one point.\n\nIn ''Up Your Arsenal'', Klunk is secretly replaces the captured Clank and meets up with Ratchet when Clank is imprisoned by Nefarious. Klunk continues to aid Ratchet, but his true identity is not revealed until the real Clank is found in Metropolis, after which he transforms into his Giant Klunk form and attacks. After being defeated, Klunk falls on the hovertrain and explodes.\n\nKlunk is later revealed to be the main villain in the non-canon ''Secret Agent Clank''. Since his first encounter with the heroic duo, Klunk found work making high-tech toilet seats, but promptly quit upon hearing about Otto Destruct's defeat. As part of his revenge plan, Klunk frames Ratchet by using a mind control helmet to make him steal \"The Eye of Infinity\", causing the Lombax to be arrested while the evil robot uses the Eye to power a planet-destroying superlaser. After his defeat at the hands of Clank (and, to a lesser extent, Captain Qwark), Klunk is turned into Ratchet's new vacuum cleaner as payback for all the trouble he caused, though it is hinted that Klunk may yet return. A Klunk skin can also be purchased in ''Secret Agent Clank'' for two Titanium Bolts.\n\nThere was some debate whether or not he appeared in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters]]''. During the dream world two identical doors appear where Clank emerges from the door on the left lamenting about a bad decision he made previously. In the other doorway another robot with glowing red eyes, said to probably be Klunk, appears, tempting Ratchet to follow him into that doorway. However, during that cinematic, Ratchet chooses the door with the true Clank and the other robot is never seen again.\n\nHe is referenced in ''A Crack in Time'', in which a segment of Galactic Trivia states that Dr. Nefarious was originally going to name the Tombli Outpost on Zanifar \"Klunk Memorial Outpost and Day Spa\" but was prevented from doing so due to Klunk's estate lawyers.\n\n===Gleeman Vox===\n'''Gleeman Vox''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is the main villain in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''. A media mogul with no sense of morality, Vox has his forces kidnap Ratchet, Clank and Al for his [[reality show]] ''DreadZone'', where heroes must participate in life-threatening challenges or else risk certain death (since all \"contestants\" are fitted with Deadlock Collars that will detonate at Vox's command). Throughout the game, Vox slanders Ratchet's name and reputation with fraudulent holovision broadcasts and outrageous claims while also trying to market the failing reputation of his top Exterminator Ace Hardlight.\n\nAfter Ratchet defeats Ace in battle, Vox attempts to talk Ratchet into becoming the new face of DreadZone with an endorsement deal. When Ratchet refuses to agree, Vox sends the Lombax to the \"mathematically proven to be unbeatable\" Gauntlet of Doom. Ratchet later infiltrates the DreadZone Station to rescue the other captured heroes along with the fans and staff of Dreadzone as well as Clank and Al after Vox announces his plans to blow it up (calling it \"the biggest ratings-booster I've ever had\"), Ratchet destroys the containers and everyone is freed, Vox confronts Ratchet to kill him but is defeated and left behind to die within the exploding station when Ratchet takes the last escape shuttle out of DreadZone. In ''Into the Nexus'', he is among the villains on display in the Museum of Intergalactic History.\n\n===Emperor Percival Tachyon===\n'''Emperor Percival Tachyon''' (voiced by Andy Morris) is the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction''. He is the last-known member of the Cragmites, a dangerous race of aliens that once devastated the Polaris Galaxy until the Lombaxes banished them to another dimension. For this, Tachyon desires to wipe out every Lombax in the universe, which automatically makes Ratchet his main target.<ref>Matt, \"Review of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, ''Game Informer'' 176 (December 2008): 147.</ref>\n\nAfter Ratchet initially escapes Tachyon's forces on Kerwan by taking the Cragmite's spaceship, he and Clank find themselves in the Polaris Galaxy, most of which Tachyon rules over. As Ratchet learns of the Lombaxes and their history, he discovers the existence of the Dimensionator, a device which can be used to travel between dimensions; and which Tachyon seeks to obtain so he can return the Cragmites from the dimension they were banished to. Tachyon believes that the Cragmite's were imprisoned rather than transferred to another dimension. During their final battle on planet Fastoon, the Dimensionator malfunctions and pulls Tachyon and Ratchet into a dimensional rift, where their battle continues until the ground they fight on crumbles and causes the Cragmite to plummet into a black hole, ending his evil reign for good.\n\nIronically, Tachyon owes his conquest of the Polaris Galaxy to the Lombaxes, as they had found him when he was an unhatched egg on the Krelii Comet and raised him as one of their own out of pity. When Tachyon learned of his true origins and the fate of the Cragmites, he turned against his adoptive species. ''A Crack in Time'' further elaborates on Tachyon's retaliation and rise to power: prior to his attack, he attempted to convince a council of Lombaxes to grant him full access to their technology. A single Lombax, Alister Azimuth, worked with Tachyon under the belief that it was the right thing to do, a choice that he would forever regret when the Cragmite used the Lombax technology to create an army and destroy the Lombaxes out of vengeance. While most of the survivors escaped to another dimension, a single Lombax named Kaden remained behind and was able to send his son, Ratchet into the Solana Galaxy before eventually being caught and executed by Tachyon.\n\nTachyon is mentioned in ''Quest for Booty'' and ''All 4 One'', along with a few mentions and a cameo appearance in the comic series. Tachyon appears as a downloadable skin in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault]]'' and a statue in the hall of villainy in the Imperial Museum in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''.\n\n===Captain Slag===\n'''Captain Romulus Slag''' (voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]) is the secondary villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction'' who leads the Space Pirates of the Polaris Galaxy. He tends to enter scenes singing \"pirate tunes\" with Rusty Pete, his loyal first mate. His pirates, including himself, pursues Ratchet and Clank while they are traveling to other planets which leads to [[dogfight]]s. He is also after the \"Lombax Secret\" and is an enemy of Emperor Tachyon. Slag would eventually battle Ratchet face-to-face only to be defeated and completely reduced to a head, Slag then dies in Pete's hands.\n\nCaptain Slag again appears as the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty''. Even though his body is destroyed, Rusty Pete carries around his revived head on a stick. They initially help Ratchet on one of his early missions, but after finding Darkwater's body, Rusty Pete betrays Ratchet and completely revives Slag by putting his head into Darkwater's body, unleashing the curse and bringing Darkwater and his crew all back to life, though Slag and Darkwater have to share one body together due to the curse. Slag and Darkwater are later defeated by Ratchet & Talwyn, and though Slag-on-a-Stick is saved by Rusty Pete, Darkwater is seemingly destroyed. They are last seen stranded in the middle of the sea, where an angry Slag is ordering Pete to row towards a nearby island.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Slag (still only a head) and Rusty Pete host their own radio station, \"Pirate Radio\", to raise money with which to have a new body built for Slag. Over the course of the game, Slag can be heard bickering with Pete, plugging an advertisement for \"Rusty Pete's School of Piracy\", and at one point sobbing over his ruined reputation. Slag is also advertised on the radio for his role as the main villain in Captain Qwark's new movie \"My Blaster Runs Hot\".\n\nIn ''Into the Nexus'', Slag is mentioned as having retired from piracy and living as a semi-professional beat-boxer in Stratus City.\n\n====Rusty Pete====\n'''Rusty Pete''' (voiced by [[Wally Wingert]]) is the first mate of Captain Slag. He refers to Slag as his best friend even though he is put through a lot of verbal abuse. Rusty Pete is a heavy [[alcoholic]] from his grog drinking and is constantly hiccuping because of this. In ''Quest for Booty'' Rusty Pete helps Ratchet and Talwyn to find Darkwater's body in Morrow Caverns only to betray them by connecting Slag's head to Darkwater's body. He is last seen on a crate with Captain Slag's head, being yelled at to row to shore.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Pete hosts the Pirate Radio station with Captain Slag, and is mentioned as co-starring with Qwark in the movie \"My Blaster Runs Hot\". In the playable mini-game based on the movie, Pete can be played as the Player Two character.\n\n===Captain Darkwater===\n'''Captain Angstrom Darkwater''' (voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]) is the secondary villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]''. A vicious pirate known on the planet Merdegraw for his merciless and cost-cutting methods (such as telling his men to use their swords as much as possible so as to limit spending for ammunition), Darkwater discovered the Zoni and befriended them as part of his plan to loot their home dimension. To this end, he constructed an Obsidian Eye, an interdimensional communication device powered by a Fulcrum Star that the Zoni gave him. Darkwater was later slain by his first mate Romulus Slag, but not before he used an ancient Terachnoid incantation (and a coupon for \"One Free Curse\" at a local magic emporeum) to bind his soul to his treasure and protect it from all who would steal it.\n\nRatchet began searching for Darkwater's treasure after discovering that the Obsidian Eye would allow him to find the location of the missing Clank. Rusty Pete and the bodiless Captain Slag initially appears to help Ratchet find the treasure's location, but this ends up being a ruse which allows Pete to plug Slag's head into Darkwater's headless body. This trigger the \"Curse of Darkwater\", bringing Slag, Darkwater, and all of his deceased crewmates back from the dead.\n\nThough Darkwater is forced to share his body with Slag and despises his former murderer's presence, they both agree on invading and looting the Zoni dimension. Ratchet eventually defeats the pirate pair, banishing Darkwater's soul and reducing Slag back to a helpless head.\n\n===Lord Flint Vorselon===\n'''Lord Flint Vorselon''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat]]) is a Terraklon assassin; his disembodied head is contained in a jar connected to a robot body he had stolen from GrummelNet HQ in Meridian City (although no one knows how a severed head was able to accomplish this). In the past, Vorselon was sentenced to life in Zordoom Prison for kidnapping Kerchu Ambassador Boogoh, but he escaped and joined forces with Dr. Nefarious under the promise that he would get his original body back once Nefarious gained control of the Great Clock.\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]'', Ratchet fights Vorselon at several points throughout the game, the first time to rescue Captain Qwark and several Fongoids from his ship, and later to free Azimuth after he is captured. After the defeat of Nefarious and Azimuth's death, Vorselon demands that Ratchet come to his ship for one final battle. Once defeated, Vorselon's robot body explodes, allowing Ratchet to finish off his bouncing head with ease. Upon detecting his death, Vorselon's ship activates its \"Sore Loser Protocol\" and self-destructs.\n\n===Cassiopeia===\n'''Cassiopeia''' (voiced by [[Kathryn Cressida]]) appears in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time''. She along with her partners Carina and Libra are Valkyries, a mercenary band of female space pilots who work for Dr. Nefarious so he can use the Great Clock to bring back the rest of their colony, which was destroyed by the Erebus supernova decades ago. Cassiopeia also has a romantic crush on Nefarious, which he reciprocates.\n\nAfter Libra and Carina are destroyed by Ratchet in deep-space, Cassiopeia eventually lures him and General Azimuth to the Valkyrie citadel on the planet Vapedia by sending out a distress beacon from her prisoner Clank. Ratchet battles his way through the Valkyrie training courses and many Valkyrie units before he finds Cassiopeia and defeats her, sending the Valkyrie leader falling to her presumed death.\n\n===Commander Argos===\n'''Commander Argos''' is an Agorian leader, mostly known for his defeat of Fongoid Chief Zahn and destruction of Gimlick Valley on planet Morklon. When Ratchet and Clank learn about this event from a lone Fongoid on the planet, they use a time shift to travel back in time ten years ago and help the Fongoids defeat the Agorians. Angered, Argos attempts to blow up the village's dam, but is defeated by Ratchet and Clank. Argos's humiliating defeat is reenacted ten years later.\n\n===Artemis Zogg===\n'''Artemis Zogg''' is a Markazian and the former Polaris Minister of Defense, and the main villain of the comic book mini-series. Zogg was originally a kind, caring man that wanted the best for the galaxy. To this end, he conceived and designed the Helios Project, capable of teleporting entire planets to new places in space in order to protect them from danger. After Dr. Nefarious' defeat, Zogg ran for Galactic President and asked Captain Qwark to endorse his campaign. Instead, Qwark segues the endorsement into his own campaign for the Presidency and wins, leaving Zogg utterly humiliated. As his first Presidential order, Qwark orders the Helios Project to be shut down, but Zogg refuses to allow this and vanishes with the technology.\n\nSome time later, Zogg (now presumed to have gone completely insane) returns and uses Helios to teleport various planets from the Solana, Bogon, and Polaris galaxies into an empty portion of space. His intention is to create his own \"Artemis Galaxy\", which he plans to rule for himself. When Veldin is among the stolen planets, Ratchet and Clank set out to stop Zogg with help from Talwyn, Sasha, Qwark, the Galactic Rangers and Cronk and Zephyr. He is eventually defeated when Ratchet hits the Suriox Shard with General Azimuth's Praetorian Omniwrench, sending Zogg to another dimension in which he is stuck sharing an asteroid with Percival Tachyon.\n\n===The Loki Master===\nThe '''Loki Master''' is the leader of the Loki, a race of malevolent spirits, and the main villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One]]''. Long ago, their home planet was destroyed by the Cragmites, but they survived by hiding in the remaining pieces as they fell onto the planet Magnus. Unable to live long without a body to inhabit, the Loki were forced to possess the small and harmless creatures in order to survive. One of the planet's inhabitants, Dr. Croid, had his pet Mr. Dinkles possessed by the Loki Master, though Croid remained unaware of the evil spirit living within Mr. Dinkles' body.\n\nStill possessing Mr. Dinkles, the Loki Master tried to steal Dr. Croid's plans for the Protomorphic Energy Extractor to extract the \"energy\" from Mr. Dinkles, but was discovered by the doctor's partner, Dr. Nevo Binklemeyer. Rather than kill him, the Loki Master forced Nevo at gunpoint to aid him in finding the most dangerous species in the galaxy for his kind to possess with the Energy Extractor. When Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious arrive to stop Nevo (believing him to be the villain), the Loki Master uses the technology to free himself from Mr. Dinkles and possess a giant Grivelnox to destroy them. After being removed from its host, the Loki Master attempts to possess Qwark, but is punched aside by Dr. Nefarious and left to die with no host.\n\n===Ephemeris===\n'''Ephemeris''', also called the '''Creature Collector''', is an interstellar machine built by Dr. Croid to find Mr. Dinkles after he goes missing. However, under orders of the Loki Master that possesses Mr. Dinkles, it is reprogrammed by Croid's assistant, Dr. Nevo Binklemeyer, to collect the most dangerous species in the galaxy for the Loki to possess. The story starts when Ephemeris kidnaps Nefarious, Qwark, Ratchet, and Clank, and takes them to the planet Magnus. After the demise of the Loki Master, Ratchet thinks of using the gigantic droid to fly back to Luminopolis after Nefarious and Lawrence steal the ship used by Cronk and Zephyr. What happened to Ephemeris after All 4 One is unknown.\n\n===Stuart Zurgo===\n'''Stuart Zurgo''' (voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]] in ''Going Commando'', [[Richard Steven Horvitz]] in ''Full Frontal Assault'') was once Qwark's biggest fan and was only known as the '''Qwark Fan-Boy''' in his first two appearances of ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal''. Initially living in the Bogon Galaxy during ''Going Commando'', he confronts Ratchet and Clank and blames them for Qwark's fall from glory, though he is appeased when Ratchet offers his a Qwark figurine (albeit one previously pulled out of a sewer pipe by The Plumber).\n\nOver the years, Stuart became more and more embittered at seeing how the galaxy would always forgive Qwark in spite of his many, many scandals and mistakes, and he ultimately lost all faith in his idol. Seeking revenge, he eventually decided to frame Qwark for messing up his childhood and hired an army of Grungarians to aid in his plans. Stuart Zurgo is eventually confronted and defeated by Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark, who all proceed to bring Stuart to Galactic Authorities. In ''Into the Nexus'' he appears a statue in the Museum of Intergalactic History and it is mentions ed that he has been sentenced to a fate worse than Zordoom Prison for his crimes: 50 years of living with his mother Lucille.\n\n===Vendra and Neftin Prog===\n'''Vendra Prog and Neftin Prog''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] and [[Fred Tatasciore]]) are members of a race called Nethers, who exist in an alternate dimension called the Netherverse, and their primary goal is to allow the Nethers to enter into the Polaris Galaxy. Vendra is considered the brains of the pair and primarily uses telekinesis to attack, while her brother Neftin is the muscle who favors brute force. Both\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Vendra is imprisoned for questioning in regards to Neftin's whereabouts, but Neftin breaks Vendra out of prison with the help of Thugs-4-Less. Using a Dimensionator of their own creation, they are then able to allow small numbers of Nethers out of the Netherverse so that they can weaken the dimensional fields enough to let all of them out, including their leader. However, the Nether leader betrays them and throws Vendra into the Netherverse while the Nether hoards attack the galaxy.\n\nUnwilling to leave his sister behind, Neftin begs Ratchet and Clank to save her and agrees to let themselves be arrested in exchange for their help in stopping the Nethers. After retrieving the original Dimensionator from its display at the Museum of Intergalactic History, Clank enters into the Netherverse and rescues Vendra while Ratchet fights and defeats the Nether leader. At the end of the game, Neftin uses the Dimensionator to banish the Nethers back to their dimension, then keeps his word to Ratchet and turns himself and Vendra over to the authorities despite Vendra's protests.\n\nNeftin is referenced in the re-imagined projects where it is stated that he tried twice to render Aridia's population color blind.\n\n===Non-canon villains===\n====Emperor Otto Destruct====\n'''Emperor Otto Destruct''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the main villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters]]''. He is a Technomite, which are said to be the very creatures that made technology possible. However, while he claims that he dislikes how his kind are ignored, his true intentions are purely based on a hunger for power.\n\nOriginally, Otto had created defective technology which killed Qwark's parents, and also sent a fake e-mail to Qwark so he thought that Otto was his real father. Otto's ultimate creation was a device which could transfer another creature's brain cells into him. Before Captain Qwark could use it as revenge (despite not knowing or caring about its function or effects), his pet monkey Skrunch interfered and it resulted in Otto having a monkey mind, to which Clank humorously states that Skrunch \"just added another family member\".\n\n====Luna====\n'''Luna''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]), initially introduced as a young, innocent girl doing a report on heroes who gets kidnapped later on by robots, is in fact a robotic puppet itself, built by the Technomites as bait for Ratchet and Clank and to capture footage of their actions. Normally speaking with a childish lisp as part of its disguise, it is capable of speaking in a normal adult female voice and then in a male Technomite voice. The puppet is later destroyed by Ratchet and Clank on Dayni Moon while using a farming vehicle to attempt to destroy them.\n\n==Other recurring characters==\n\n===Darla Gratch===\n'''Darla Gratch''' (voiced by Sylvia Aimerito) is a female robot works as a news reporter for Channel 2 News (first game only) and later Channel 64 News (in ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal''), she is often seen reporting on planets in rather inconvenient times and does not seem to be aware of the chaos in her surroundings, this leads to her becoming an easy target to any creatures that would sneak up behind her and attack. In the ''Ratchet & Clank'' movie and tie-in game, she has been replaced with Juanita from ''Deadlocked''.\n\n===Abercrombie Fizzwidget===\n'''Abercrombie Fizzwidget''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the CEO of Megacorp, the biggest \"you-name-it-we-make-it\" corporation in the Bogon Galaxy. He is portrayed as a good manager but very absent-minded, and frequently uses [[malapropism]]s or made-up words such as \"imbeciliac\", \"cratefule or \"soretainly\".\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]'', Mr. Fizzwidget hires Ratchet as one of Megacorp's Commandos and tasks him with recovering a stolen Experiment (later called the Protopet). Upon Ratchet's (along with Clank) rescue of it, Fizzwidget meets him and Clank on a desert planet but lands his ship on theirs, although he offers to give them a ride in his ship. As they take off, Fizzwidget \"accidentally\" presses a button that sends Ratchet and Clank up out of the ship and they both fall into a volcanic cavern. With the Experiment back in his hands, Mr. Fizzwidget begins to mass-produce the dangerous creature. At the end of the game, it is revealed that \"Fizzwidget\" is really Captain Qwark in disguise (the malapropisms and made-up words being a mistake on Qwark's part) and is behind all the events of the game. The real Fizzwidget is shown at last following the Mutant Protopet's defeat and thanks Ratchet and Clank for saving the galaxy. Mr. Fizzwidget made a minor non-speaking role in the third game, being shown watching the premiere of Secret Agent Clank.\n\nTom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] said that Fizzwidget \"may not be the Captain Qwark successor fans will be after, but will still raise a smile in all but the angriest of gamers when he presents some of his fascinatingly incoherent but salvageable tirades.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Tom Bramwell |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank 2: Locked & Loaded'' Review // PS2 /// Eurogamer - Games Reviews, News and More |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_ratchetandclank2_ps2 |date=2003-11-12 |work= |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=Cue exaggerated characters, including a new female ally, and some consistently amusing voice acting from the central characters and particularly Fizwidget, who may not quite be the Captain Quark successor fans will be after, but will still raise a smile in all but the angriest of gamers when he presents some of his fascinatingly incoherent but salvageable tirades.}}</ref>\n\n===Female Infobot===\nA small robot with a crush on Clank, the '''Female Infobot''' appears in ''Going Commando'' in her attempts to get Clank's attention. Near the end of the game, she shows Ratchet and Clank the reason why: she was a witness to Captain Qwark as he talked about his plans to \"save\" the Bogon Galaxy by creating a disaster. She is then shot by Fizzwidget, who reveals himself as Qwark. The Infobot is later repaired and appears in the ending, where she gets to spend quality time with Clank.\n\n===President Phyronix===\n'''President Phyronix''' (voiced by Lindsay Schnebly) is a Cazar who is the Galactic President of the Solana Galaxy and Sasha's father. He is shown to be somewhat na\u00efve (such as believing that Clank really is \"Secret Agent Clank\", the Holo-Vid character that Clank plays) and can occasionally act irrationally (such as pretending to be half-robot in anticipation of an all-robot voting turnout), but he truly does care and attempts to keep the galaxy safe in what little way he can. In the comic series, he is kidnapped by his former friend Artemis Zogg and forced to work in his mines on Planet Zaurik. At one point, Zogg boasts of his noble intentions to the President, who responds by calling him a villain worse than Tachyon and Nefarious.\n\nJeremy Dunham of IGN and Johnny Liu of Game Revolution compared the Galactic President to [[Bill Clinton]] (apparent with his voice), with Dunham considering the President to be one of the more endearing characters of the game.<ref name=\"RnCUYAGameRev\">{{cite web |author=Johnny Liu |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' review for the PS2 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/ps2/ratchet-clank-up-yer-arsenal |date=2004-11-13 |work= |publisher=Game Revolution |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=The voice work is spot on, particularly in the Galactic President's Clinton-esque twang and Dr. Nefarious' psychotic babbling, which strikes the right balance between threatening and comical.}}</ref><ref name=\"RnCUYAIGN\">{{cite web |author=Jeremy Dunham |authorlink= |title=IGN: ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/561/561352p4.html |date=2004-10-28 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=Captain Quark in particular is pretty hysterical, with the Bill Clinton-esque Galactic President one of the more endearing characters. Clank's dry sidekick humor is in great contrast to Jak's own sidekick Daxter (for those of you that play both games), while Ratchet's \"Why me?\" delivery is spot on.}}</ref>\n\n===Slim Cognito===\n'''Slim Cognito''' (voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]] in ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Patrick Seitz]] in the 2016 video game) is a [[black market]] arms dealer that made his debut in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]''. In all of his appearances, he is always hiding behind a booth (presumably due to his reputation as a black market salesman), leaving only his eyes visible. In ''Going Commando'', he operates in the Bogon Galaxy where he trades weapon mods (Acid Mods, Shock Mods, & Lock-On Mods) for Platinum Bolts, and ship mods for Raritanium at his space station (the Ship Shack). In ''Up Your Arsenal'', Slim appears on planet Aquatos to hide from the police after \"mistakenly\" selling a Suck Cannon upgrade to a minor (\"I swear, the kid LOOKED eighteen\"), and will sell Megacorp-brand weapons to Ratchet. He is also present in several booths on different planets in ''Size Matters'', selling weapon mods.\n\nSlim Cognito makes another appearance in ''Secret Agent Clank'', where he appears in Prison Planet, having been sent there for all those times he sold black market merchandise to Ratchet. He gives Ratchet a code so that Clank can enter a high-stakes room in Les Paradis des Trechuirs Casino. In return, Slim asks Ratchet to protect him from the other inmates, who \"wanted to see him expire for selling them shoddy merchandise\". He is also mentioned in ''Tools of Destruction'' as an inmate of Zordoom Prison.\n\nIn the 2016 game, Slim's identity is shown. He is a Rilgarian working in the black market who builds Ratchet the illegal and dangerous RYNO superweapon after collecting all the plans.\n\n===The Galactic Rangers===\n'''The Galactic Rangers''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and Chris Hatfield) are robots who fight alongside Ratchet (who they consider their sergeant) in the battlefield missions throughout ''Up Your Arsenal''. They are often cowardly, preferring to let Ratchet take care of the enemies himself. In some missions, they can be heard joking about previous missions over the radio contact. Likewise, they also reward Ratchet with new gadgets for helping them out in their missions. During the final battle with Dr. Nefarious, a number of Galactic Rangers with stronger weapons appear and help take out several enemies, clearing Ratchet's path to the doctor. The Galactic Rangers also appear in the comic series assisting Sasha Phyronix.\n\nThe Galactic Rangers appear with Captain Qwark in the [[Ratchet & Clank (film)|''Ratchet & Clank'' film]].\n\n====Cora Veralux====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Cora Veralux''' (voiced by [[Bella Thorne]]) is a young Markarzian who is the youngest recruit of the Galactic rangers. She was born and raised on the planet Novalis. Cora befriended Ratchet and Clank after they saved her and the Galactic Rangers from Chairman Drek's Warbots.\n\n====Elaris====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Elaris''' (voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]) is of an unspecified species who is a member of the Galactic Rangers. She serves as Captain Qwark's second-in-command and provides support through the comm station.\n\nHer appearance is similar to Hydro Girl from ''Deadlocked'', but in a recolored form.\n\n====Brax Lectrus====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Brax \"Brute\" Lectrus''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]] in the film, [[Mick Wingert]] in the video game) is an unspecified reptilian species who is a member of the Galactic Rangers and the strongest of the group. He became a member of the Galactic Rangers after winning the Dreadzone Challenge known as \"Grapplemania.\"\n\n===Merc and Green===\n'''Merc and Green''' (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] and [[Travis Davis]]) are a pair of DreadZone combat robots that accompany Ratchet during his missions in ''Deadlocked''. Merc is much more gung-ho and combat oriented, and looks for any excuse to blow something up. Green is frequently cowardly and prone to panic, but nonetheless is always dependable in a fight.\n\nOn the cover for the Japanese version of the game, both Merc and Green have legs. This is because midway through development Insomniac decided to remove their legs for unknown reasons. They can be seen with legs in some early gameplay videos.\n\n===Dallas & Juanita===\n'''Dallas Wannamaker and Juanita Alvaro''' (voiced by [[Daran Norris]] and [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Deadlocked'', [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]] and [[Tabitha St. Germain]] in the movie) are the announcers for ''DreadZone'' and reporters for Vox News. Dallas speaks in a sports announcer-like voice while Juanita speaks with a Hispanic lilt. Throughout the game they commentate Ratchet's participation at ''DreadZone'', usually by making him out as a villain on Vox News, telling fabricated stories about Ratchet and Dallas nicknaming him \"The Butcher of Bogon\", and using highly unflattering (and at times fraudulent) pictures and descriptions. Although Dallas will often complement Ratchet's performance, Juanita, the more sadistic and maniacal of the duo, insults him frequently and often hopes that Ratchet dies inevitably. Dallas also constantly flirts with Juanita (one time checking her out from behind while they were not on the air) to which she replies with insults and disgust. The two eventually show respect towards Ratchet after Vox attempts to blow up the entire Dreadzone station and trapping everyone on board. After escaping DreadZone, Dallas and Juanita land their own Holo-vision sitcom in which they portray a married couple, but it is mentioned that Dallas arranged for their marriage to be legitimate, while Juanita spends every episode trying to kill her husband. They later appear in the movie as civil news reporters.\n\nNick Valentino of GameZone said that the commentary provided by the \"hammy male commentator and his blood-thirsty co-anchor woman\" is \"over-the-top hilarious\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Nick Valentino |title=''Ratchet: Deadlocked'' Review - PlayStation 2 |url=http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r26257.htm |date=2005-10-28 |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=The tournament matches have some commentary by a hammy male commentator and his blood-thirsty co-anchor woman that is just over-the-top hilarious. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626062952/http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r26257.htm |archivedate=26 June 2009 }}</ref> Carrie Gouskos of GameSpot added that their commentary about Ratchet, the competition and each other \"persistently adds flavor to the gameplay\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Carrie Gouskos |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet: Deadlocked'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetdeadlocked/review.html |date=2005-10-26 |work= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=Most of the levels are narrated by the two quirky Dreadzone announcers, Dallas, a sleazy egomaniac, and Juanita, a sadistic seductress. Their commentary about Ratchet, the competition, and each other persistently adds flavor to the gameplay.}}</ref>\n\n===Ace Hardlight===\nA former hero who appears in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'', '''Ace Hardlight''' (voiced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]]) brought himself to Gleeman Vox for money and fame, although he wound up being not as popular as he thought he would be.\n\nAce originally started his life as an orphan and was adopted as by a group of superheroes. When that group destroyed his home planet, he left the group and later ended up with Vox as a competitor on DreadZone. After disintegrating Captain Starshield on Catacrom 4, he became DreadZone's Champion and leader of the Exterminator team, consisting of himself, Shellshock, Reactor and the Eviscerator.\n\nDespite Vox's attempts to franchise Ace, the test groups clearly dislike him, with one of the kids in the group even referring to Ace as a \"tool\". About the only ones in DreadZone who like Ace are Juanita, Vox, Dallas, and Ace himself. After being defeated by Ratchet in competition, Ace is briefly moved by the Lombax's heroism and tells Ratchet not to let Vox ruin him like he did to Ace. Later, Ace is announced \"dead\" after his defeat by Ratchet, with Gleeman Vox attempting to sale Ace Hardlight memorial action figures to DreadZone fans.\n\nAce is mentioned in ''Tools of Destruction'' as a prisoner of Zordoom Prison. In ''A Crack in Time'', he is mentioned as having since been released and rehabilitated.\n\n===Captain Starshield===\n'''Captain Starshield''' (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]) is the former number one ranked contestant of the underground combat show DreadZone who is killed by Ace Hardlight. His only appearances is when he destroys three robots and when he is killed.<ref>An official comic of this character can be found [http://insomniacgames.com/comics/ here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507092801/http://www.insomniacgames.com/comics/ |date=2006-05-07 }}.</ref> He is also an unlockable character skin in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''.\n\n===The Smuggler===\n'''The Smuggler''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]), as his name implies, is a smuggler of dubious legality, but he is mostly friendly to Ratchet and Clank in their adventures through the Polaris Galaxy. He appears in ''Tools of Destruction'', ''Quest for Booty'', ''A Crack in Time'', and ''Into the Nexus'' to give Ratchet and Clank equipment and advice in exchange for their help in performing certain services. He is also usually involved in each game's sidequest to assemble the newest model RYNO (\"Rip Ya a New One\") weapon.\n\n===Aphelion===\n'''Aphelion''' (voiced by Rajia Baroudi) is a Lombax-built starship with its own artificial intelligence. In ''Tools of Destruction'', she is rebuilt by Ratchet on the planet Fastoon and becomes his new means of transportation through the Polaris Galaxy. In ''A Crack in Time'', she is initially struck by a wave of time energy and crash-lands, but the Zoni restore her and give her new upgrades. Aphelion briefly appears in ''All 4 One'' when the Light-Eating Z'Grute attacks her.\n\n===Mr. Zurkon===\n'''Mr. Zurkon''' (voiced by Marc Graue in the games, [[Brian Drummond]] in the film) is a synthezoid designed to destroy and trash-talk the enemies it is summoned against. First appearing in ''Tools of Destruction'', it has made consistent appearances in the series as one of Ratchet's most-recurring weapons. Later games introduce '''Mrs. Zurkon''' (voiced by [[Ali Hillis]]) and '''Zurkon Jr.''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Into the Nexus'', [[Sam Riegel]] in the 2016 video game) as his wife and child, all of them as trigger-happy and vocally cruel as he is.\n\n===Sigmund===\n'''Sigmund''' (voiced by [[Nolan North]]) is the Junior Caretaker (eventually Senior Caretaker) of the Great Clock and appears as a supporting character in ''A Crack in Time''. He once lived and worked on Planet Viceron as a cleaner bot until the Zoni Orvus selected Sigmund as the Junior Caretaker for the Great Clock. During Clank's escape from captivity by Dr. Nefarious, Sigmund helps Clank get to safety, and the two of them travel together through the Great Clock. As he learns about Orvus through his pre-recorded messages, Clank tries to get Sigmund to tell him where the real Orvus is, but he is initially unwilling to explain that Orvus went to the planet Zanifar to meet with Dr. Nefarious and never came back. Clank later overhears the truth from Sigmund, and he convinces the Junior Caretaker to help Orvus by sending a time portal to Zanifar in hopes that Ratchet can save him. Later, Sigmund shows Clank to the Orvus Chamber but is ambushed and knocked out by Lawrence.\n\nNear the end of the game, Sigmund bravely throws himself against Alister Azimuth in order to prevent him from reaching the Orvus Chamber. Though overpowered by the Lombax, he buys Clank enough time to enter the Chamber and use it to prevent Ratchet's death. After Azimuth's death, Clank realizes that he can't leave Ratchet and promotes Sigmund to the Great Clock's new Senior Caretaker in his place.\n\n===Chief Alpheus===\n'''Chief Alpheus''' (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) is the leader of a village of Fongoids that is located within Zolar Forest. He first appears looking for Enessa and upon finding her, questions why she is out in the forest. When she tells him that Zyfoids have returned to their planet, Alpheus replies that they must return to the village for their safety. He helps Ratchet and Qwark fight off the Zyfoids to clear the path back to the village. Once there, Alpheus tells Ratchet about a Zoni Vessel that can contain Zoni. It is hidden in the temple of Zahn and has Ratchet go in to find it. As the lombax exits the temple with Qwark and Alpheus, they find that Lord Vorselon has arrived, looking for General Azimuth. Alpheus calls as many Fongoids as he can into the temple for their safety and helps Ratchet to protect the rest of the defending villagers while guiding Ratchet to his ship.\n\n===Vorn Garblak===\n'''Vorn Garblak''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat]]) is a Markazian debuting in the comic series. He works for Artemis Zogg as his assistant and Chief Warmonger, until issue 5 where he betrays Zogg upon freeing Talwyn after she had been captured by Artemis and his forces. Vorn and Talwyn try to flee from Artemis by using an escape pod but Artemis himself, enters it as well. The pod arrives in the Apogee Space Station and after Artemis Zogg attempts to escape with the Suriox Shard, Vorn assists the heroes in stopping the insane Markazian.\n\nAlthough not shown, Vorn can be heard in ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' where it is revealed that he took the job as Minister Of Defense.\n\n===Mr. Klink===\n'''Mr. Klink''' first appears in the second issue, sentencing Ratchet and an Agorian out the airlock for violating the rule of \"Expected Prisoner Behavior\". Unfortunately for the Warden, Ratchet is saved by Clank and the war bots Cronk and Zephyr. Upon reporting to Artemis Zogg about this, Zogg punishes Klink by sucking him out the airlock and into space where he dies not long after.\n\n===Dr. Frumpis Croid===\n'''Dr. Frumpis Croid''' is a Tharpod scientist and colleague of Nevo Binklemeyer. More than a hundred years prior to the events of ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' , Dr. Croid and Nevo planned to construct the Protomorphic Energy Extractor after mistaking the Loki Master to be a strange manifestation inside Croid's creature companion, Mr. Dinkles. However, Dr. Croid awakened the next day and found his lab in severe damage, that the plans for the Protomorphic Energy Extractor had been stolen and that Mr. Dinkles had gone missing, Croid assumed that Nevo had betrayed him and took the plans for his own use. Twenty-two years later, Dr. Croid reprogramed an old drone named Ephemeris to search for Mr. Dinkles, believing that without Mr. Dinkles in his grasp, Nevo's plan would fail. Unfortunately for Dr. Croid, the matrix causing Ephemeris to remain restricted to Magnus ended up deleted because of Nevo. Being unable to wait any longer, Dr Croid headed to Uzo city to explain to the Tharpods living there about everything and to convince them to stop Nevo, although none of them were prepared for the unexpected attack by Commander Spog and Nevo's collector minions. Their invasion left the city in ruins, with Dr Croid unable to shake the feeling that this was because of his work. Dr. Croid then moved his lab to the Phonica moon to avoid Nevo from infiltrating it but over the years, Croid began to lose his sanity. Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Nefarious find Croid who takes a fascination towards Ratchet, as Croid had started to think he was a Lombax Whisperer, and did not take Ratchet seriously. However, Croid returns near the game's ending saving Nevo from being finished off by Mr. Dinkles, under the control of the Loki master, and after the Spirit freed itself from Mr. Dinkles' body and took control of a Rykan V Grithnoux, Dr Croid works with Nevo in assisting the main characters to stopping the Loki Master for good. The master is defeated at last, and the two Tharpod scientists share a happy reunion.\n\n===Nevo Binklemeyer===\n'''Nevo Binklemeyer''' is a friend to Dr. Frumpis Croid. Over a hundred years before ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' took place, the pair planned to create a device called the Protomorphic Energy Extractor with Mr. Dinkles as their supposed first test subject, Unaware to both Croid and Nevo at first, Mr. Dinkles was actually under the control of the leader of the Torunoux Spirits known as the Loki Master. Mr. Dinkles stole the plans to the Energy Extractor and forced Nevo to work for him in building the collector minions and modify Ephemeris at gun point, both their absence fooled Croid into thinking Nevo had turned against him and stole Mr. Dinkles. Ratchet and the other main characters find Nevo, and they learn about him being used as a pawn for Mr. Dinkles, Nevo ends up angering the small creature who attempts to dispose of the scientist. Nevo is saved by Dr. Croid and the Loki Master extracts itself from Mr. Dinkles' body, using an Grithnoux as its new host to battle the main characters.

Ratchet tells it that he is looking for Volgram Pass and is told that any outsiders must find it for themselves.\n* '''Jarvis''' - A Teracnoid and acquaintance of General Azimuth, he works as a data minor for Pollyx Industries. Jarvis first met Azimuth when he saved the Teracnoid from becoming food for the Agorians. Jarvis helps Azimuth and Ratchet to break into the company's building, by having Azimuth hack the defense grid, and allowing Ratchet to activate the switches in Neurox Plaza.\n* '''Mac McKeroy''' (voiced by [[Joey D'Auria]]) - Another Teranoid that works with dozens of other teracnoids in the Agorians Battleplex, Ratchet meets Mac on his mission to assist Qwark in winning the tournament held in the Battleplex. After winning, Ratchet is given a security card by Mac, believing that Ratchet might find a use for it. Compared to other members of his kind, Mac talks and acts in a different manner, being more of a stand-up comedian and is more friendly towards Ratchet. Mac also advertises his Moonlight Lounge show on the radio in space.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One''===\n* '''Tharpod Chief''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) - A elderly Tharpod and leader of Susie's village. He tells Ratchet, Clank and their allies, Qwark and Nefarious about Ephemeris, the Creature Collector and that it has been capturing monsters and bringing them to Magnus for over a century. Even though he does not know who is controlling the machine, he says that Commander Sporg, its emissary had been protecting the machine for a long time. Ratchet mistakes the chief to be Susie's father until he is told that Susie's parents were killed during an invasion on Totem Fi, this left Susie, along with a lot of Tharpod children, an orphan.\n* '''Susie's Friends''' - Two unnamed Tharpod children, their only appearance in the game is the scene where Susie plans out an attack on Ephemeris. It is not known if they are orphans.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault''===\n* '''Barry''' (voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]]) - The A.I. of the Starship Phoenix II.\n* '''Bleep''' (voiced by Andrew Cownden in the film, [[Sam Riegel]] in the 2016 video game) - A tall maintenance robot that is encountered on the Starship Phoenix II. He works with Bloop as the ship's maintenance robots. In ''Into the Nexus'', Bleep attended Destructapalooza. In the 2016 film and video game, he is re-imaged as a small green robot named '''Zed''' who is the attendant of Chairman Drek.\n* '''Bloop''' - A short maintenance robot that is encountered on the Starship Phoenix II.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank'' (2016 video game)===\n* '''Shiv Helix''' (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) - A major criminal who spent time in various prisons. While at Aleero City Penitentiary, he meets his cellmates Captain Qwark, Zed, and Solitary Bill. He listens to Captain Qwark's story about Ratchet and Clank and how Captain Qwark got arrested for double-crossing the Galactic Rangers out of jealousy for Ratchet. By the end of Captain Qwark's story, Shiv and Captain Qwark were cleaning up litter outside the Hall of Heroes when Ratchet and Clank came into view. Shiv takes the opportunity to steal Ratchet's ship and makes his escape with Ratchet, Clank, Captain Qwark, and the Galactic Rangers not far behind. His design is a modified version of Don Wonderstar's character model where he sports a scar across his left eye and has a robotic left hand.\n\n==Species==\nThe alien species in the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series are listed in alphabetical order:\n\n* '''Agorians''' - The Agorians are a proud race of reptilian creatures with an often-changing (and frequently made-up on the spot) Code of Honor, first appearing in ''A Crack in Time''. They have never evolved and love to engage in warrior lifestyle, so far as to create the Agorian Battleplex to fight in contests and invade several peaceful planets. They have both antagonized and allied Ratchet and Clank during their adventures in the Polaris Galaxy.\n* '''Amoeboids''' - The Amoeboids are green slimy creatures that inhabit sewers in at least four planets. They appear attacking Blackwater City in ''Ratchet & Clank'', in the sewers of planet Pokitaru (likely created from the toxic waste that the Blargs were dumping into the ocean), in a secret area on planet Novalis, and in the sewers of Aquatos. In ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' it is revealed in the second episode of the Qwark vid-comics that Dr. Nefarious is actually the one who created the Amoeboids and planned to use them to destroy Blackwater City because its inhabitants called him insane (this has not been confirmed to be canon however). They later return in ''Secret Agent Clank'', thriving in the acid-filled canals of Venantonio. That game also introduced red variants that can explode (Clank says \"Someone must have altered their chemical compositions\") It was also mentioned that there was a self-deodorizing variant being created; whether this was successful is unknown.\n* '''Blarg''' - The Blarg are the main enemies in ''Ratchet & Clank''. Their home planet was once Orxon, but the constant pollution forced them off (though they have apparently tried to clean the planet since the first game). They come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from foot soldiers to monstrous Snagglebeasts. The Blargs are technologically apt, but have really only focused on advanced warfare-technology. They have also built a large space station for research purposes. They are an orange-pink in colour. Their leader is the tyrannical Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek (who is defeated by Ratchet at the end of ''Ratchet & Clank''). They also built the first R.Y.N.O (Rip Ya a New One), the most powerful series of weapons in the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series.\n* '''Cazares''' - The Cazares are humanoids with brown fur and a look that is slightly similar to a fox. Known Cazares are Sasha (who appears in the games ''Up Your Arsenal'' and at the beginning of ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'') and her father President Phyronix (who appears in ''Up Your Arsenal'' and mentioned in the game ''Secret Agent Clank''). Apparently the males are twice as big than the females and Sasha is the same size as Ratchet. There was originally confusion that Sasha was a Lombax like Ratchet, but Insomniac has since cleared it up.\n* '''Cragmites''' - The Cragmites are a brutal race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]]/[[insectoid]] creatures that lost the Great War to the Lombaxes of which Emperor Percival Tachyon is the last. The Cragmites terrorized the Polaris Galaxy, but the Lombaxes fought back and banished the Cragmites into another dimension - effectively ridding the universe of them. Tachyon managed to summon the Cragmites once more with the Dimensionator before having his army stopped by Ratchet. The Cragmites are a deep-purple color, much like the terrain of their barren homeworld. Whilst Tachyon is relatively small, true Cragmites are considerably larger - standing much higher than either Ratchet or Captain Qwark. Cragmites seem to possess teleportation abilities and incredible strength.\n* '''Drophyds''' - The Drophyds are a race of goldfish-like aliens originating from Planet Zaurik. Emperor Tachyon employs them as the main soldiers in his army by bribing them with raritaneum and granting them armor based on Lombax engineering and built from materials scavenged from Space Pirates. Without their armor, their bodies are left to flop around harmlessly on the ground.\n* '''Fongoids''' - The Fongoids are a small mammal-like creatures who were once trusted with the power of time travel by the Zoni. But when a huge space rift is created due to their constant time-travel the Zoni take away all technology and the Fongoids develop into a nature-based culture. The males are characterized by frequent vocal tics, the cause of which is unknown to experts. It is a Fongoid planet, Zanifar, where Dr. Nefarious's asteroid crash lands. He quickly brainwashes the Fongoids there to build the outpost on Planet Zanifar. Their first appearance is in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]''.\n* '''Grummels''' - The Grummels are race of aliens found in the Polaris galaxy. They are the operators of Grummelnet, the leading weapons and armour manufacturer in the Polaris Galaxy (analogous to Gadgetron of Solana and Megacorp in Bogon). Grummels are green-skinned and often fat, with a single antenna on their heads. According to the IRIS supercomputer in ''Tools of Destruction'', an attempt to restore the dying Grummel population through cloning left many of the clones lacking in intelligence. Despite this, they are shown to be very proficient at manufacturing weaponry.\n* '''Kerchu''' - The Kerchu are small, furry creatures that are very skilled in building weapons. Their home planet is Planet Jasindu. According to the Smuggler, the Kerchu are the most dangerous race in Polaris (behind the Cragmites) and there is no being that is not allergic to Kerchu fur.\n* '''Loki''' - The Loki are a race of malevolent spirits that survive by possessing the bodies of other creatures. They were defeated long ago by a Cragmite hero and had since lived on planet Magnus by possessing the small and harmless creatures that inhabit it, though they desire large and powerful beasts with which to terrorize the galaxy.\n* '''Lombaxes''' - The Lombaxes are a race of [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[bobcat]]-like creatures that are known for their natural affinity with [[gadget]]s and machines, though female Lombaxes do not have tails and (at least in Angela's case) are presumed to be noticeably taller, while males are shorter but bulkier. Their home planet is Fastoon in the Polaris Galaxy. The Lombaxes are hailed in the Polaris Galaxy as the saviors of the universe for defeating the Cragmites. However, when Tachyon's Drophyd army attacked Fastoon, the Lombaxes teleported out of the universe to escape them. Ratchet, his father Kaden, Angela Cross, and Alister Azimuth are the only known Lombaxes to have stayed behind. As of the conclusion of ''A Crack in Time'', Kaden and Azimuth are dead and Angela has gone missing, leaving Ratchet as the last-known survivor of his kind.\n* '''Markazian''' - Talwyn Apogee, Max Apogee, Vorn Garblak, Artemis Zogg, and Cora Veralux are Markazians. They resemble humans, only with pointy ears and a tail. Talwyn's species is first mentioned in ''Quest for Booty'': when Ratchet promises to her that they will make it out of the Morrow Caverns together, Rusty Pete mocks Ratchet by singing \"Lombax and Markazian sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-s-i-n.\"\n* '''Nethers''' - Appearing in ''Into The Nexus'', the Nethers are a race of extradimensional entities who exist in the Netherverse and seek to escape. They come in multiple forms, ranging from humanoids like Vendra and Neftin Prog to giant savage beasts like their leader (nicknamed \"Mister Eye\" by Vendra).\n* '''Snagglebeast''' - The Blargian Snagglebeast is a colossal being with the appearance of an ogre. Even though the Snagglebeast was seen in a commercial as an arch-enemy of Captain Qwark, the game reveals that it was actually his trained pet which he sics on Ratchet and Clank. It has many barbaric characteristics and is presumably used by Qwark to devour his unwary enemies. The Snagglebeast's brawn was no match for Ratchet's brain, and the creature met its demise by falling into a pool of lava.\n* '''[[Space pirate|Space Pirates]]''' - A faction of spacefaring robots that terrorize the Polaris Galaxy and serve under Captain Slag and Rusty Pete. According to the IRIS, they were engineered by Emperor Tachyon in order to gather materials for the Drophyds' nanotech armor, but abandoned them when they completed their task. Captain Slag's Space Pirates relentlessly attack any ship that enters their territory, though there seems to be a mutual co-operation between Slag's crew and several other space pirate fleets that Ratchet encounters in ''Tools of Destruction''.\n* '''Technomites''' - The Technomites are tiny intelligent creatures who are responsible for the existence of technology. Because they are nearly microscopic, very few people have seen them and they are considered nothing more than a myth. Led by Emperor Otto Destruct, the Technomites attempted to create an army of Ratchet clones using his DNA. They were also responsible for creating Luna, hacking into Clank, and tricking Qwark into thinking he's Otto's son. According to Clank, Captain Qwark's real parents were killed by defective Technomite technology. Whether this was intentional or not remains undisclosed.\n* '''Terachnoids''' - The Teachnoids are crustacean-like creatures that are described as the most intelligent beings in the known universe, which is owed to their multiple brains of varying number housed in enormous craniums that far exceed the size of their bodies. They think very highly of themselves for their superior intelligence, but are frequently humiliated by other, more physically adept species like Agorians.\n* '''Tyhrranoids''' - The Tyhrranoids are a gullible race of alien warriors who were tricked by Dr. Nefarious to work for him in ''Up Your Arsenal'' to destroy all organic life. The Tyhrranoids, seemingly devoid of a sense of irony, do not realize that they themselves are biological, and carry out his orders. The Tyhrranoids' home planet is planet Tyhrranosis where the \"Momma Tyhrranoid\" lives. The Momma Tyhrranoid was defeated and killed by Ratchet, but Qwark took all the credit for it. The entire Tyhrranoid population was transformed into robots when Dr. Nefarious used his Biobliterator, though the majority (with a few exceptions) are seen as organic again in ''Deadlocked'' and ''Secret Agent Clank''. The more powerful a Tyhrranoid, the bigger it is and the more eyes it has.\n* '''Valkyries''' - The Valkyries are an all-female race of warriors that are hired by Dr. Nefarious to kill Ratchet and Azimuth. They reside on Vapedia after the Erebus supernova destroyed their old home planet, and all the males of their species were exiled because they failed to ask for directions to Vapedia. Ever since the Space Pirates' defeat at the hands of Ratchet, the Valkyries have become the newest threat to travellers in the Polaris Galaxy.\n* '''Vullards''' - The Vullards are reptile-like creatures that live in wastelands on planets Torren IV and Lumos. Their exploit is to gather scrap metal and lots of it (apparently as a black market operation, as one Vullard says \"we like to keep our operation from the prying eyes of galactic authorities\"). Ratchet first meets members of the race on Torren IV where Azimuth's home is located. Ratchet and the general later helps the Vullards on saving their settlement by defeating a fleet of attacking Agorians. Vullards can also be found in the space sectors where Ratchet can do optional side missions for them.\n* '''Zoni''' - The Zoni are a mysterious race of ethereal aliens that are capable of travel through time and space and can choose to let others see and/or hear them. They are neither biological nor mechanical, but are instead beings of pure energy that manifest on the physical [[plane of existence]] by inhabiting metal bodies. They occasionally appear, usually only visible to Clank when he is alone or asleep, to aid Ratchet and Clank on their quest. In the ending cutscene of ''Tools of Destruction'', they make themselves visible to everyone and kidnap Clank leaving the game on a cliffhanger. In ''Quest for Booty'', they regard Dr. Nefarious as a doctor and believe he will be able to repair Clank. In ''A Crack in Time'', Zoni are scattered across the Polaris System due to Nefarious setting the Hypersonic Brainwave Scrambler after them. Ratchet can rescue Zoni during his journey to upgrade his ship, Aphelion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ratchet & Clank}}\n{{Insomniac Games}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Ratchet and Clank Characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional extraterrestrial characters|Ratchet and Clank]]\n[[Category:Lists of video game characters|Ratchet and Clank]]\n[[Category:Ratchet & Clank characters| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Ratchet & Clank'' characters}}\nThis is a '''list of characters from the ''Ratchet & Clank'' video game series'''. ''[[Ratchet & Clank]]'' is a series of [[Platform game|platform video games]] developed by [[Insomniac Games]] and [[High Impact Games]]. The series features a large cast of characters voiced by veteran voice actors.\n\nThe series centers on the exploits of Ratchet (a [[bobcat]]-like creature known as a Lombax that is very handy with tools) and Clank (a diminutive sentient [[robot]] that befriends Ratchet) as they save the galaxy from several evil forces.\n\n==Protagonists==\n\n===Ratchet===\n{{main|Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)}}\n'''Ratchet''' (voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]] in the first game, [[James Arnold Taylor]] in all later appearances) is a [[Ratchet & Clank#Lombaxes|Lombax]] who is first shown in the first game, seen in the opening cutscene working as a mechanic, living by himself on the planet Veldin. Longing for adventure, Ratchet's life changes when he meets the diminutive robot fugitive named Clank. From there on, he and the small robot begin to keep the universe protected from threats.\n\n===Clank===\n{{main|Clank (Ratchet & Clank)}}\n'''Clank''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) is a small robot who is initially created in a Blargian war-robot factory. After escaping, he is found by Ratchet and becomes his partner in stopping the Blarg and many other threats to the universe.\n\n==Major Characters==\n\n===Captain Qwark===\n{{main|Captain Qwark}}\n'''Captain Copernicus Leslie Qwark''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the Solana Galaxy's self-proclaimed superhero, though he is in reality a cowardly blowhard whose egotistical actions frequently cause more trouble for Ratchet and Clank than they prevent.\n\n===The Plumber===\n'''The Plumber''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]] in the first three games, [[Jess Harnell]] in later appearances) is a staple the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series. He almost always appears with his rear end sticking out of whatever he is working on, and surprisingly is always a reliable ally whenever he appears. In ''Ratchet & Clank'' and ''Going Commando'', the Plumber is an NPC that appears on separate occasions.  Once later in Going Commando, he sells Ratchet an item to exchange for another. In ''Up Your Arsenal'', he returns to ask Ratchet to search for Sewer Crystals, which he will trade bolts for.\n\nThe Plumber does not appear in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''; although the credits state that he had been called away to deal with a \"sump pump emergency in the Rygylian Nebula\". He appears with a non-speaking role as a memory in part of a dream-state world level in ''Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters'', and also appears in ''Secret Agent Clank'' to fix the showers at the prison in which Ratchet is incarcerated, returning them to their typical freezing cold temperature.\n\nThe Plumber returns in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction'', with a new updated design, wearing glasses and having a more detailed outfit. He provides Ratchet with a spare part for the Dimensionator that proves valuable in the game's climax. He then appears once again in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'' in Clank's memory banks. When Clank shows up, The Plumber states that he \"must've taken a wrong turn somewhere\" and mistook it for Qwark's mind because of the \"emptiness\". He then tells Clank \"I wouldn't risk any more than six minutes\", a piece of advice that ultimately allows Clank to save Ratchet from death by reversing time.\n\nHe appears in ''All 4 One'' when he fixes a transport that allows Ratchet and his allies to travel to Uzo City, but when Ratchet asks for some \"cryptic advice\" that can used to stop Nevo, the Plumber admits that he does not have any. In ''Full Frontal Assault'', Stuart Zurgo hologuises as him to damage the Starship Phoenix II. The real Plumber later contacts Ratchet, Clank and Qwark for assistance since he is stuck on a planet. After Ratchet repairs the Plumber's ride, he is confused as he had seen him on the starship. It is after the Plumber leaves that Ratchet and the other two realize that they had been fooled by Stuart.\n\nThe Plumber appears again in \"Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus\" as the apparent creator of the game's version of the RYNO super weapon, the RYNO VII. He split up the blueprints for it in order to prevent misuse. The player can collect the pieces of the blueprint and have the Plumber build it for them.\n\nHe reprises his original position in the 2016 ''Ratchet & Clank'' in the Novalis sewers, only this time, his last words to Ratchet and Clank before leaving the scene are, \"See you in the next reboot.\"\n\nThe plumber makes a cameo appearance in the [[post-credits scene]] of the ''Ratchet & Clank'' film. He berates the viewing audience for watching the credits, stating that there is no bonus scene and orders them to leave.\n\n===Big Al===\nA recurring character who first appears in the original ''[[Ratchet & Clank]]'', '''Big Al''' (voiced by Chris Hatfield) is the stereotypical computer geek from the planet Kerwan with interests in electronics and all things Captain Qwark. Ratchet frequently gets baffled over Al's \"techno-speak\" and usually relies on Clank to translate. He owns \"Big Al's Robo Shack\" and supplies Clank with a Heli-Pack. His siblings Bob and Edwina also own similar Robo Shacks that provide further upgrades for Clank.\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal]]'', Big Al is chosen to join Captain Qwark's \"Q-Force\" for his mastery of electronics, though his involvement in the plot is minimal. Al plays a more significant role during the events of ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'', in which he is captured and made to serve as part of Ratchet's DreadZone support crew. At one point, Al is shot by Ace Hardlight as a warning to Ratchet not to overstep his bounds, but he later returns (with cybernetic parts to cover his wounds) to aid Ratchet in escaping DreadZone. He has not appeared in the series since, though he is occasionally mentioned during ''Tools of Destruction'' and can be heard during a radio advertisement for his Robo Shack in ''A Crack in Time''. Al has a minor role in the comic series, he works on returning Veldin back to its normal orbit after Artemis Zogg removes it for his own galaxy.\n\n===Angela Cross (a.k.a. The Mysterious Thief)===\n'''Angela Cross''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) is a female Lombax who appears in ''Going Commando''. She shares Ratchet's affinity for gadgets and devices, though is frequently clumsy and scatterbrained. Despite her shortcomings, Angela was employed by Megacorp and worked in its genetics division on a secret project to create an artificial \"Protopet\", until she quit when her boss, Mr. Fizzwidget pushed the release date of the creation before she could correct its flaws (namely, its large appetite and savage nature). Angela then disguised herself and stole the prototype creature to get rid of it for good. When Megacorp recruits Ratchet to get it back from her, she hires the mercenary/crime organization Thugs-4-Less to protect her, and tries to get Ratchet out of the way by using his partner Clank as bait. Unfortunately, both tactics fail, and when Thugs-4-Less is bought out of their contract by a third party, Angela (after her identity was revealed) allies herself with Ratchet and Clank to stop Megacorp from releasing the still-highly dangerous Protopet all over the galaxy.\n\nDespite being confirmed as a Lombax in ''A Crack in Time'', Angela has not appeared in any games since ''Going Commando''. During a Polaris News broadcast in ''A Crack in Time'', Angela was confirmed as being a Lombax, that she had fled Bogon in Max Apogee's ship during the earlier phases of Tachyon's invasion, and had been missing along with Apogee for over three years, suggesting both she and Apogee used the Dimensionator to escape Tachyon. The report also confirms her species as a female Lombax, claiming that female Lombaxes do not have tails. In a [[Full Moon Show]] Podcast, it was stated that Angela may be brought back if [[Insomniac Games|Insomniac]] makes another [[Ratchet & Clank|Ratchet & Clank game]].\n\n===Talwyn Apogee===\n'''Talwyn Apogee''' (voiced by [[Tara Strong]] in ''Tools of Destruction'' and ''Quest for Booty'', [[Ali Hillis]] in ''Into the Nexus'') is a Markazian and the daughter of Max Apogee, a famous explorer known for his research into the Lombax culture. When Max vanished, Talwyn continued her father's work in finding the \"Lombax Secret\", a device said to have been used to eliminate the evil Cragmites from the galaxy. Her main base of operations is a space station in the Nundac asteroid ring, where she is accompanied by her guardian warbots Cronk and Zephyr.\n\nIn ''Tools of Destruction'', Ratchet is led to Talwyn after intercepting a message from Emperor Tachyon calling for her death. After explaining his situation, Talwyn agrees to help Ratchet in finding the Lombax Secret and overthrowing Tachyon. In ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]'', Talwyn journeys alongside Ratchet in his search for Clank. She does not physically appear in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'', but is seen in Clank's subconscious and is occasionally mentioned on the radio as having requested songs for Ratchet to listen to while flying through space. She also appears in the comic book mini-series, as well as ''Full Frontal Assault'' as a skin and a full appearance in ''Into the Nexus''. In the reimanging movie and game a character named  Cora Veralux seems to be Talwyn's counterpart.\n\n====Cronk and Zephyr====\n'''Cronk and Zephyr''' (voiced by [[Daniel Hagen]] and [[Paul Eiding]] respectively) are a pair of war-robots who frequently accompany Talwyn in her adventures. Heavily rusted and senile from many years of combat, the pair are often heard bickering to each other and rambling about their past experiences but nonetheless serve as reliable allies in Ratchet and Talwyn's search for the Lombax Secret. The pair first appear in ''Tools of Destruction'' and make a voice-only cameo in ''A Crack in Time'' as they bicker during the credits. In ''All 4 One'', Cronk and Zephyr serve as Ratchet's support team by selling him and his allies weapons. The both of them are destroyed by Vendra Prog in ''Into the Nexus'', though their ghosts make one final appearance in the post-credit ending.\n\n===Alister Azimuth===\nNotably prominent in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time'', '''General Alister Azimuth''' (voiced by [[Joey D'Auria]]) is a Lombax and serves as a mentor to Ratchet. He has white and red fur, unlike Ratchet and Angela who have yellow and brown/orange fur.  This is not due to age, because although Alister is much older than Ratchet, his fur has been this color since his youth. He uses a double-headed Praetorian Omniwrench as his weapon of choice. In his youth, Azimuth was close friends with Ratchet's father, Kaden, and carries a pocketwatch that holds a photo of the two of them standing together. Azimuth was indirectly responsible for Emperor Tachyon's rise to power and the deaths of Ratchet's parents, as he gave Tachyon full access to Lombax technology in the hopes that he would be able to help them. For his crimes, he was forbidden to join the Lombaxes as they left to another dimension, and has lived in exile ever since.\n\nWhen Ratchet first finds Azimuth, the general initially mistakes him for a Hologuised assassin (sent by either Lord Vorselon or Nefarious) but soon recognizes Ratchet as being Kaden's son and requests forgiveness about the misunderstanding. General Azimuth explains to Ratchet about Clank's presumed connection with the Zoni and how he and Kaden were both aware of the Great Clock's very existence. He then teaches Ratchet on using hoverboots which would come in handy in stopping Dr. Nefarious from taking control of the Great Clock. After Nefarious reminds Azimuth on how he shamed the Lombax race, Azimuth explains to Ratchet how he fell to Tachyon's trickery, and how he plans to use the Great Clock himself, so that he and Ratchet can prevent Tachyon's rise to power and stop the Lombaxes from having to leave for their new dimension. Ratchet initially goes along with the plan, but changes his mind after saving Clank who informs him and Azimuth that the Great Clock could destroy all of existence if misused. Unable to accept Ratchet's change of decision, General Azimuth leaves him.\n\nHe later appears to rescue Ratchet and Clank after they defeat Dr. Nefarious and takes them to the Great Clock. Despite Azimuth's insistence, Ratchet still refuses to risk using the Great Clock, causing the elder Lombax to kill Ratchet by blasting him with his wrench out of anger. Azimuth then tries to enter the Orvus Chamber, but Clank locks him out and uses the Great Clock to reverse time by six minutes (as previously hinted by the Plumber) so that he can save Ratchet. Azimuth, now blinded by his own selfish desire to save all the Lombaxes, breaks into the chamber and locks the Clock into turning back time to Tachyon's rise to power, before engaging both Ratchet and Clank in a bloody duel as the game's final boss. Once defeated, Azimuth finally realizes his mistake and stops the time shift he created, though at the cost of his own life. Ratchet takes Azimuth's possessions, a pocketwatch and his own Praetorian wrench, as reminders of his mentor.\n\nAzimuth makes a small cameo in the first issue of the six-part comic series, where Ratchet is looking at the pocketwatch in memory. Ratchet later uses Azimuth's Praetorian Wrench in the following issues to stop Artemis Zogg in his plans.\n\nA Red Team skin based on Azimuth, appears in ''Full Frontal Assault''. ''Into The Nexus'' features a statue of Azimuth on display in the Museum of Intergalactic History.\n\n===Kaden===\n'''Kaden''' is the father of [[Ratchet (Ratchet & Clank)|Ratchet]] and the keeper of the Dimensionator. When the Lombaxes were driven to use the device to escape to another dimension following Percival Tachyon's overrunning of Fastoon, Kaden refused to follow them in order to protect the device. Kaden managed to survive Tachyon's ravaging of Fastoon and was able to hide his infant son (Ratchet) from the Cragmite by sending him to Veldin, but Kaden was eventually found and executed by Tachyon.\n\n===Orvus===\nAppearing in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]'', '''Orvus''' (voiced by [[Charles Martinet]]) is the unique Zoni who created the Great Clock as its original Caretaker and is also Clank's \"father\", as he is responsible for Clank's possession of a [[soul]]. After he is captured by Dr. Nefarious, Orvus teleports to somewhere unknown, and Clank is brought to the Great Clock by the Zoni to become its new Caretaker in his absence. As Clank is trained by the Clock's Junior Caretaker Sigmund (another robot that Orvus possibly granted a soul to) in his new duties, Orvus communicates with him through a series of simulated programs stored in his memory banks.\n\nAt the end of the game, Clank chooses to continue his adventures with Ratchet and leaves Sigmund in charge of the Great Clock as the Caretaker, and Orvus's final message proclaims that his greatest desire is for Clank to be happy with whatever life he chooses.\n\n===Sasha Phyronix===\n'''Sasha Phyronix''' (voiced by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]]) is a Cazar who is the captain of the Starship Phoenix and the daughter of the Galactic President. During the events of ''Up Your Arsenal'', she is in charge of coordinating the Galactic Rangers to combat the growing threat of Dr. Nefarious. Both her and Ratchet appear to have feelings for each other. In ''Deadlocked'', she briefly appears in the opening to inform Ratchet, Clank and Big Al about the death of Captain Starshield during his service to Dreadzone as a contestant. Sasha is also about to warn the three about various galactic heroes being captured when she is cut off. She appears a third time in the six issue comic series (set between ''A Crack in Time'' and ''All 4 One''), where she assists Ratchet and Clank in stopping Artemis Zogg in his plans to create his own artificial galaxy. In ''Full Frontal Assault'', Ratchet still kept the Starship Phoenix, which means that he still cares about Sasha.\n\n===Skid McMarx===\n'''Skid McMarx''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]] in the first game and ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Jess Harnell]] in the 2016 game) is a professional [[hoverboard]]er whose name is also spelled Skidd McMarxx. In ''Ratchet & Clank'', he and his agent are attacked by missiles from the Blarg and end up crashing their ship on Planet Aridia while en route to a big hover-board race, they end up being separated after the crash. Ratchet and Clank eventually find him he tells the duo that he is unable to return to his ship because of the Sand Sharks in the area. After Ratchet disposes of the creatures, Skid rewards him with a hover-board and tells Ratchet and Clank about seeing them at the hover-board race on Rilgar.\n\nIn ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'', Skidd is recruited into Captain Qwark's Q-Force for his \"nerves of steel\". Calling himself \"ShaddowDude\", Skidd helps Ratchet and Clank on their assigned mission on Aquatos, despite frequently chickening out and letting Ratchet do all the fighting. He later gets kidnapped by Courtney Gears and is taken to Obani Draco, where he is used as a test dummy for the Biobliterator and turned into a robot. Despite this, Skidd is back to normal by the end of the game (how he was changed back is not revealed, though Big Al mentions that it is possible). Following ''Up Your Arsenal'' Skidd is mentioned as having been picked up by Courtney Gears' old record label.<ref name=news>[http://insomniacgames.com/comics/newsupdate.php?copy=5 Insomniac Games' Galactic News Update #5] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507093235/http://www.insomniacgames.com/comics/newsupdate.php?copy=5 |date=2006-05-07 }}</ref>\n\n===Helga von Streissenburgen===\n'''Helga von Streissenburgen''' (voiced by [[Mona Marshall]] in a German accent) is a robot who is Captain Qwark's portly, brutish fitness [[athletic trainer|trainer]]. In ''Ratchet & Clank'', Ratchet runs through a fitness course to meet up with Helga in order to claim the reward, a Swingshot, though she also demands that Ratchet must pay for the gadget after stating that his run was \"the most pathetic display I has ever seen on that Obstacle course!\". Helga is chosen to join the Q-Force for her \"sensual powers of seduction\" in ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal''. Despite her tough appearance, she showed genuine sadness when Qwark \"died\", stating \"Und... we vould frollock in ze fitness course... under ze wee hours of za morning!\" Her full name is revealed in a promotional poster for ''Tools of Destruction'' as '''Helga von Streissenburgen'''.\n\nDouglass C. Perry of IGN commented positively in the \"quirkier\" voices in the supporting cast of ''Ratchet & Clank'' and cited Helga (describing her as \"the weird athletic woman at the end of the stunt course\") as an example.<ref name=RnCIGN>{{cite web |author=Douglass C.

While Ratchet strives for that perfect dude-like teenager vibe, the voice actor generally hits the mark. Clank is also quite engaging, and in some cases, charming, especially when he finishes a level or gains a weapon. Many of the supporting characters offer the same kind of commercial quality voices found in ''Jak and Daxter'', and some of the times they're quite funny. Other times they just sound commercial. The quirkier ones are best (such as the weird athletic woman at the end of the stunt course), but few stand above the standard and obvious stereotypes.}}</ref>\n\n===Skrunch===\n'''Skrunch''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is Captain Qwark's [[Cyclops|cycloptic]] monkey sidekick. Being a monkey, he loves [[banana]]s. He's also seen running around the Starship Phoenix's bridge. Skrunch joins Clank during some of Clank's missions in ''Up Your Arsenal'' to activate out-of-range buttons or distract powerful enemies and is a gunner for Ratchet on Tyrranosis. Skrunch also makes an appearance in ''Size Matters''. He speaks to Clank twice in the game, first on planet Metalis and again at the end of the game on Quadrona. Not to be confused with the backyard wrestler of the same name.\n\n===Grimroth Razz===\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Grimroth Razz''' (voiced by [[John Goodman]] in the film, [[Travis Willingham]] in the 2016 game), or '''Grim''' for short, is a [[mechanic]] from the Polaris Galaxy who became the mentor and legal guardian of Ratchet ever since he found him as an infant. He owns a garage on the planet Veldin where he and Ratchet repair ships.\n\nIn the 2016 video game, Grimroth is revealed to have a twin brother named Felton. Grimroth states that they don't talk much because Grimroth considers Felton to be a slacker.\n\n==Antagonists==\n\n===Chairman Drek===\n'''Chairman Alonzo Drek''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in the first game, [[Paul Giamatti]] in the film,<ref>http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/13/ratchet-clank-animated-movie-lines-up-star-studded-voice-cast</ref> [[Eric Bauza]] in the 2016 game), eventually retitled to '''Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek''', is the leader of the Blarg and the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank''. With his own homeworld of Orxon overpolluted and overpopulated to the point of being uninhabitable, Drek announces to the Solana Galaxy that he intends to carve out giant chunks of land from other planets and assemble them into a new Blarg planet. To help protect his interests, he hires Captain Qwark to be his spokesman and personal hitman for when Ratchet and Clank start interfering with his operations.\n\nAt the end of the game, Drek attacks Ratchet's homeworld of Veldin with the intent to destroy it and put his piecemeal planet in its former orbit. Confronting the Lombax in a giant robot, Drek then admits to him that the new planet is all part of a larger money-making scheme: once it is complete, Drek intends to pollute it until the Blarg pay him to build another planet, just like he did with Orxon. Drek is killed when he loses control over the robot and crashes into his piecemeal planet, which is then destroyed with a single shot of his own Deplanetizer laser. Drek later appears as an downloadable skin in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault]]'', appears in a Ratchet's dream in [[Ratchet and Clank: Size Matters]], and has a statue of him in the hall of villainy in the Imperial Museum in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''.\n\nIn his review of ''Ratchet & Clank'', Jeff Gerstmann of [[GameSpot]] compared Chairman Drek, an \"evil corporate suit who ... is the leader of a dead, polluted world\", to the antagonistic President Skroob in the film ''[[Spaceballs]]''.<ref name=\"RnCGSpot\">{{cite web |author=Jeff Gerstmann |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetclank/review.html |date=2002-11-02 |work= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=Clank relays a tale of a world in peril, hops onto Ratchet's back, and the duo set off to save the world from Drek, an evil corporate suit who, like President Skroob in the Mel Brooks classic ''Spaceballs'', is the leader of a dead, polluted world.}}</ref> Gavin Frankle of Allgame stated that Chairman Drek's scenes (along with Captain Qwark's) proved to be more entertaining than those of the main characters.<ref name=\"RnCallgame\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=38850&tab=review |title=''Ratchet & Clank'' |last=Frankle |first=Gavin |work=[[Allgame]] | publisher=[[Macrovision Corporation]] |accessdate=June 25, 2009}}</ref> Nich Maragos of [[1UP.com]] noted that the final [[boss (video games)|boss fight]] against Chairman Drek was \"overly punishing\".\n\nDrek is one of the two primary antagonists of the [[Ratchet & Clank (film)|''Ratchet & Clank'' film]]. The other one is Dr. Nefarious ([[Armin Shimerman]]).\n\n===Thugs-4-Less===\nA mercenary company in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]'' and ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''. Thugs-4-Less is willing to do anything for a price, no matter how morally questionable it may be.\n\nIn ''Going Commando'', Thugs-4-Less is initially hired by Angela (under the guise of the Mysterious Thief) to stop Ratchet from retrieving it and are later hired by Megacorp to stop him from foiling the company's plan to market the Protopet. In ''Into the Nexus'', Thugs-4-Less is employed by Neftin Prog to provide the added manpower in rescuing his sister Vendra.\n\n====Thug Leader====\nThe '''Thug Leader''' (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) leads Thugs-4-Less. He first appears on planet Endako to fight Ratchet during his rescue mission involving Clank and is encountered several times before finally being defeated on the Thugs' homeworld of Snivelak. In ''Secret Agent Clank'', the Thug Leader meets Ratchet while he's in prison and has his men pick a fight with the Lombax as payback for the previous defeats.\n\n===Protopets===\nThe '''Protopets''' are the main threat in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]''. Devised as the \"perfect pet\", they appear as small, fuzzy blue creatures with large eyes, but they are very vicious, have large appetites, and reproduce rapidly. Megacorp had created the original Protopet and Angela was close to correcting its flaws until CEO Abercrombie Fizzwidget pushed up the release date, putting the Bogon Galaxy at risk from the still dangerous product. Angela Cross attempted to prevent this by stealing the Protopet, but Ratchet unknowingly hand-delivered it back to Megacorp where it was quickly mass-produced and shipped out. Soon, entire planets were overwhelmed by the furry swarm of Protopets.\n\nUnknown to everybody, \"Fizzwidget\" was actually Captain Qwark in disguise, who had orchestrated the entire Protopet crisis so that he could appear and \"save\" the Bogon Galaxy with a device he had stolen from Angela: the Helix-O-Morph. His plan backfires when the Helix-O-Morph instead causes the original Protopet to mutate and eat Qwark whole. After the Mutant Protopet is defeated by Ratchet and Clank, Angela fixes the device (as it turned out, the batteries were in backwards) and turns the Protopet back to its normal size and rendering it completely safe.\n\nNich Maragos of 1UP.com noted that the final boss fight against the Protopet was \"a pushover\".<ref name=\"RnCUYA1UP\">{{cite web |author=Nich Maragos |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review from 1UP.com |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136116&did=1 |date=2004-11-02 |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=The fact that it's also the best-balanced of the three helps -- the endgame is neither overly punishing, like the Chairman Drek fight, or a pushover, like the Proto-Pet from ''Going Commando''. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105124516/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3136116&did=1 |archivedate=5 January 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Doctor Nefarious===\n{{main|Doctor Nefarious}}\n'''Doctor Nefarious''' (voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]) is a stereotypical robotic [[mad scientist]] who has a hatred for all [[Organism|organic life forms]] (or \"squishies\", as he calls them). He is the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' and ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time''. In addition, he has several cameo appearances in ''Deadlocked'', ''Size Matters'', ''Quest for Booty'', ''Secret Agent Clank'' and ''Into the Nexus'' as well as a playable appearance in ''All 4 One''.\n\nHe also appears in the ''[[Ratchet & Clank (film)|Ratchet & Clank]]'' film as the true main antagonist in a new, re-imagined organic form before becoming his iconic robot form in the end.\n\n====Lawrence====\n'''Lawrence''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is Doctor Nefarious's robotic butler, noticeably similar to the character [[Jeeves]]. His duties usually consist of \"dirty laundry and whatnot\" and other menial tasks, though he enjoys playing the [[bass guitar]] as a personal hobby (and playing a song in particular called \"Bass Odyssey\"). He has a clear dislike for his boss, often pummeling him with subtle insults or purposely doing a bad job, though he seems to be scornful of essentially most around him. Despite this, Nefarious, who either cannot fend for himself or does not catch on to Lawrence's true nature, still keeps him by his side.\n\nLawrence first appears in ''Up Your Arsenal'', where he serves Dr. Nefarious in his plan to transform all organic life in the Solana Galaxy into robots. When all of Nefarious's plans are foiled due to Ratchet and Clank, Lawrence suggests that he name a destination to escape to via teleporter, but Nefarious doesn't bother and the two of them are teleported onto an asteroid in deep space, where they aimlessly drift in isolation. In ''Deadlocked'''s ending, the asteroid is seen passing through the already-destroyed DreadZone Station. When Nefarious complains that they're not getting rescued, Lawrence tells him that he didn't know the station would be destroyed by the time they arrived. Eventually, the asteroid wanders into the Polaris Galaxy and lands on Zanifar. After spending time with the planet's Fongoids, Nefarious discovers the Great Clock and begins his plan to take control of it.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Lawrence continues to serve Nefarious in his usual sarcastic way. While Clank explores the Great Clock and learns about its functions, Lawrence secretly follows him and reports to Nefarious on his progress. After Clank enters the Orvus Chamber, Lawrence ambushes him and sends Clank to the Valkyries to be used as bait for Ratchet. During the battle with Nefarious, Lawrence provides support from a laser-equipped UFO, but he escapes before it and Nefarious crash into their own space station.\n\nTwo years later in ''All 4 One'', Nefarious appears before Ratchet, Clank and Qwark and has Lawrence reanimate a Light-Eating Z'grute from cryosleep in the intent to have it kill the three. The plan backfires when it drains the electricity on Lawrence's hovercraft, resulting in Lawrence and Nefarious falling to the floor. After the doctor demands Lawrence to help him out, Lawrence \"tends his resignation\" and leaves. He does not return until the end of the game where he helps Cronk and Zephyr in landing their ship on Magnus to retrieve Ratchet and his allies. Lawrence asks Nefarious for his employ again and the two take the ship, flying off into space.\n\n===Courtney Gears===\nA clear parody of [[Britney Spears]], '''Courtney Gears''' (voiced by [[Melissa Disney]] in ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'') is a female [[Celebrity|pop star]] robot who occasionally gives out prizes on the show, ''Annihilation Nation''. Her music and videos are popular in the Solana Galaxy. As Ratchet tells Clank about Courtney being famous for her physical appearance rather than her singing voice (\"She's not the hottest pop star in the galaxy because of her singing.\"). Courtney is initially interested in Clank and the star power she can gain from playing a role on his ''Secret Agent Clank'' Holo Vid series. At Holostar Studios, she knocks Clank out and takes him to Doctor Nefarious, whom she is working for and apparently in love with (possibly because of his idea of robot freedom). When Skid gets himself kidnapped, Ratchet travels to Obani Draco and defeats Courtney in direct combat.\n\nCourtney later recovered and is mentioned in ''Deadlocked'' as having made a \"miraculous recovery after her attack by two psychotic fans\" (Ratchet and Clank). As part of her new contract with Vox, Courtney appears in the trailer for ''Reactor: Rise of the Sociopathic Bloodlust'', where she plays the role of girlfriend to the DreadZone Exterminator Reactor. In the trailer, Courtney dumps Reactor because of his pathetic High School math teacher persona, but runs right back to him as soon as he becomes a \"homicidal popstar\".<ref name=\"news\"/> What happened to Courtney after the destruction of the DreadZone Station is unknown, though a similar character (with the same voice) appears in ''Secret Agent Clank''\n\nJeff Gerstmann of GameSpot praised Courtney Gears' music video sequence as \"a spot-on parody of recent [[pop music]]\", citing the video's \"synchronized dance moves\", \"epic pop production\" and \"incredible devotion to extreme overuse of an [[Pitch correction|autotuner]]\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Jeff Gerstmann |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetclankiii/review.html |date=2004-11-03 |work= |publisher=GameSpot |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=One sequence is the latest music video from a female robot called Courtney Gears, and everything, from the synchronized dance moves to the song's epic pop production and incredible devotion to extreme overuse of an autotuner, is a spot-on parody of recent pop music.}}</ref>\n\n===Klunk===\n'''Klunk''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) is a [[doppelg\u00e4nger]] of Clank that Doctor Nefarious uses to learn what Ratchet and the Q-Force are planning. Klunk's eyes are naturally red, but turn green when in disguise as Clank. Unlike the well-mannered Clank, Klunk is evil and nearly swears at one point.\n\nIn ''Up Your Arsenal'', Klunk is secretly replaces the captured Clank and meets up with Ratchet when Clank is imprisoned by Nefarious. Klunk continues to aid Ratchet, but his true identity is not revealed until the real Clank is found in Metropolis, after which he transforms into his Giant Klunk form and attacks. After being defeated, Klunk falls on the hovertrain and explodes.\n\nKlunk is later revealed to be the main villain in the non-canon ''Secret Agent Clank''. Since his first encounter with the heroic duo, Klunk found work making high-tech toilet seats, but promptly quit upon hearing about Otto Destruct's defeat. As part of his revenge plan, Klunk frames Ratchet by using a mind control helmet to make him steal \"The Eye of Infinity\", causing the Lombax to be arrested while the evil robot uses the Eye to power a planet-destroying superlaser. After his defeat at the hands of Clank (and, to a lesser extent, Captain Qwark), Klunk is turned into Ratchet's new vacuum cleaner as payback for all the trouble he caused, though it is hinted that Klunk may yet return. A Klunk skin can also be purchased in ''Secret Agent Clank'' for two Titanium Bolts.\n\nThere was some debate whether or not he appeared in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters]]''. During the dream world two identical doors appear where Clank emerges from the door on the left lamenting about a bad decision he made previously. In the other doorway another robot with glowing red eyes, said to probably be Klunk, appears, tempting Ratchet to follow him into that doorway. However, during that cinematic, Ratchet chooses the door with the true Clank and the other robot is never seen again.\n\nHe is referenced in ''A Crack in Time'', in which a segment of Galactic Trivia states that Dr. Nefarious was originally going to name the Tombli Outpost on Zanifar \"Klunk Memorial Outpost and Day Spa\" but was prevented from doing so due to Klunk's estate lawyers.\n\n===Gleeman Vox===\n'''Gleeman Vox''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is the main villain in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''. A media mogul with no sense of morality, Vox has his forces kidnap Ratchet, Clank and Al for his [[reality show]] ''DreadZone'', where heroes must participate in life-threatening challenges or else risk certain death (since all \"contestants\" are fitted with Deadlock Collars that will detonate at Vox's command). Throughout the game, Vox slanders Ratchet's name and reputation with fraudulent holovision broadcasts and outrageous claims while also trying to market the failing reputation of his top Exterminator Ace Hardlight.\n\nAfter Ratchet defeats Ace in battle, Vox attempts to talk Ratchet into becoming the new face of DreadZone with an endorsement deal. When Ratchet refuses to agree, Vox sends the Lombax to the \"mathematically proven to be unbeatable\" Gauntlet of Doom. Ratchet later infiltrates the DreadZone Station to rescue the other captured heroes along with the fans and staff of Dreadzone as well as Clank and Al after Vox announces his plans to blow it up (calling it \"the biggest ratings-booster I've ever had\"), Ratchet destroys the containers and everyone is freed, Vox confronts Ratchet to kill him but is defeated and left behind to die within the exploding station when Ratchet takes the last escape shuttle out of DreadZone. In ''Into the Nexus'', he is among the villains on display in the Museum of Intergalactic History.\n\n===Emperor Percival Tachyon===\n'''Emperor Percival Tachyon''' (voiced by Andy Morris) is the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction''. He is the last-known member of the Cragmites, a dangerous race of aliens that once devastated the Polaris Galaxy until the Lombaxes banished them to another dimension. For this, Tachyon desires to wipe out every Lombax in the universe, which automatically makes Ratchet his main target.<ref>Matt, \"Review of Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, ''Game Informer'' 176 (December 2008): 147.</ref>\n\nAfter Ratchet initially escapes Tachyon's forces on Kerwan by taking the Cragmite's spaceship, he and Clank find themselves in the Polaris Galaxy, most of which Tachyon rules over. As Ratchet learns of the Lombaxes and their history, he discovers the existence of the Dimensionator, a device which can be used to travel between dimensions; and which Tachyon seeks to obtain so he can return the Cragmites from the dimension they were banished to. Tachyon believes that the Cragmite's were imprisoned rather than transferred to another dimension. During their final battle on planet Fastoon, the Dimensionator malfunctions and pulls Tachyon and Ratchet into a dimensional rift, where their battle continues until the ground they fight on crumbles and causes the Cragmite to plummet into a black hole, ending his evil reign for good.\n\nIronically, Tachyon owes his conquest of the Polaris Galaxy to the Lombaxes, as they had found him when he was an unhatched egg on the Krelii Comet and raised him as one of their own out of pity. When Tachyon learned of his true origins and the fate of the Cragmites, he turned against his adoptive species. ''A Crack in Time'' further elaborates on Tachyon's retaliation and rise to power: prior to his attack, he attempted to convince a council of Lombaxes to grant him full access to their technology. A single Lombax, Alister Azimuth, worked with Tachyon under the belief that it was the right thing to do, a choice that he would forever regret when the Cragmite used the Lombax technology to create an army and destroy the Lombaxes out of vengeance. While most of the survivors escaped to another dimension, a single Lombax named Kaden remained behind and was able to send his son, Ratchet into the Solana Galaxy before eventually being caught and executed by Tachyon.\n\nTachyon is mentioned in ''Quest for Booty'' and ''All 4 One'', along with a few mentions and a cameo appearance in the comic series. Tachyon appears as a downloadable skin in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault]]'' and a statue in the hall of villainy in the Imperial Museum in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus]]''.\n\n===Captain Slag===\n'''Captain Romulus Slag''' (voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]) is the secondary villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction'' who leads the Space Pirates of the Polaris Galaxy. He tends to enter scenes singing \"pirate tunes\" with Rusty Pete, his loyal first mate. His pirates, including himself, pursues Ratchet and Clank while they are traveling to other planets which leads to [[dogfight]]s. He is also after the \"Lombax Secret\" and is an enemy of Emperor Tachyon. Slag would eventually battle Ratchet face-to-face only to be defeated and completely reduced to a head, Slag then dies in Pete's hands.\n\nCaptain Slag again appears as the main villain in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty''. Even though his body is destroyed, Rusty Pete carries around his revived head on a stick. They initially help Ratchet on one of his early missions, but after finding Darkwater's body, Rusty Pete betrays Ratchet and completely revives Slag by putting his head into Darkwater's body, unleashing the curse and bringing Darkwater and his crew all back to life, though Slag and Darkwater have to share one body together due to the curse. Slag and Darkwater are later defeated by Ratchet & Talwyn, and though Slag-on-a-Stick is saved by Rusty Pete, Darkwater is seemingly destroyed. They are last seen stranded in the middle of the sea, where an angry Slag is ordering Pete to row towards a nearby island.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Slag (still only a head) and Rusty Pete host their own radio station, \"Pirate Radio\", to raise money with which to have a new body built for Slag. Over the course of the game, Slag can be heard bickering with Pete, plugging an advertisement for \"Rusty Pete's School of Piracy\", and at one point sobbing over his ruined reputation. Slag is also advertised on the radio for his role as the main villain in Captain Qwark's new movie \"My Blaster Runs Hot\".\n\nIn ''Into the Nexus'', Slag is mentioned as having retired from piracy and living as a semi-professional beat-boxer in Stratus City.\n\n====Rusty Pete====\n'''Rusty Pete''' (voiced by [[Wally Wingert]]) is the first mate of Captain Slag. He refers to Slag as his best friend even though he is put through a lot of verbal abuse. Rusty Pete is a heavy [[alcoholic]] from his grog drinking and is constantly hiccuping because of this. In ''Quest for Booty'' Rusty Pete helps Ratchet and Talwyn to find Darkwater's body in Morrow Caverns only to betray them by connecting Slag's head to Darkwater's body. He is last seen on a crate with Captain Slag's head, being yelled at to row to shore.\n\nIn ''A Crack in Time'', Pete hosts the Pirate Radio station with Captain Slag, and is mentioned as co-starring with Qwark in the movie \"My Blaster Runs Hot\". In the playable mini-game based on the movie, Pete can be played as the Player Two character.\n\n===Captain Darkwater===\n'''Captain Angstrom Darkwater''' (voiced by [[Dave B. Mitchell]]) is the secondary villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: Quest for Booty]]''. A vicious pirate known on the planet Merdegraw for his merciless and cost-cutting methods (such as telling his men to use their swords as much as possible so as to limit spending for ammunition), Darkwater discovered the Zoni and befriended them as part of his plan to loot their home dimension. To this end, he constructed an Obsidian Eye, an interdimensional communication device powered by a Fulcrum Star that the Zoni gave him. Darkwater was later slain by his first mate Romulus Slag, but not before he used an ancient Terachnoid incantation (and a coupon for \"One Free Curse\" at a local magic emporeum) to bind his soul to his treasure and protect it from all who would steal it.\n\nRatchet began searching for Darkwater's treasure after discovering that the Obsidian Eye would allow him to find the location of the missing Clank. Rusty Pete and the bodiless Captain Slag initially appears to help Ratchet find the treasure's location, but this ends up being a ruse which allows Pete to plug Slag's head into Darkwater's headless body. This trigger the \"Curse of Darkwater\", bringing Slag, Darkwater, and all of his deceased crewmates back from the dead.\n\nThough Darkwater is forced to share his body with Slag and despises his former murderer's presence, they both agree on invading and looting the Zoni dimension. Ratchet eventually defeats the pirate pair, banishing Darkwater's soul and reducing Slag back to a helpless head.\n\n===Lord Flint Vorselon===\n'''Lord Flint Vorselon''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat]]) is a Terraklon assassin; his disembodied head is contained in a jar connected to a robot body he had stolen from GrummelNet HQ in Meridian City (although no one knows how a severed head was able to accomplish this). In the past, Vorselon was sentenced to life in Zordoom Prison for kidnapping Kerchu Ambassador Boogoh, but he escaped and joined forces with Dr. Nefarious under the promise that he would get his original body back once Nefarious gained control of the Great Clock.\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]'', Ratchet fights Vorselon at several points throughout the game, the first time to rescue Captain Qwark and several Fongoids from his ship, and later to free Azimuth after he is captured. After the defeat of Nefarious and Azimuth's death, Vorselon demands that Ratchet come to his ship for one final battle. Once defeated, Vorselon's robot body explodes, allowing Ratchet to finish off his bouncing head with ease. Upon detecting his death, Vorselon's ship activates its \"Sore Loser Protocol\" and self-destructs.\n\n===Cassiopeia===\n'''Cassiopeia''' (voiced by [[Kathryn Cressida]]) appears in ''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time''. She along with her partners Carina and Libra are Valkyries, a mercenary band of female space pilots who work for Dr. Nefarious so he can use the Great Clock to bring back the rest of their colony, which was destroyed by the Erebus supernova decades ago. Cassiopeia also has a romantic crush on Nefarious, which he reciprocates.\n\nAfter Libra and Carina are destroyed by Ratchet in deep-space, Cassiopeia eventually lures him and General Azimuth to the Valkyrie citadel on the planet Vapedia by sending out a distress beacon from her prisoner Clank. Ratchet battles his way through the Valkyrie training courses and many Valkyrie units before he finds Cassiopeia and defeats her, sending the Valkyrie leader falling to her presumed death.\n\n===Commander Argos===\n'''Commander Argos''' is an Agorian leader, mostly known for his defeat of Fongoid Chief Zahn and destruction of Gimlick Valley on planet Morklon. When Ratchet and Clank learn about this event from a lone Fongoid on the planet, they use a time shift to travel back in time ten years ago and help the Fongoids defeat the Agorians. Angered, Argos attempts to blow up the village's dam, but is defeated by Ratchet and Clank. Argos's humiliating defeat is reenacted ten years later.\n\n===Artemis Zogg===\n'''Artemis Zogg''' is a Markazian and the former Polaris Minister of Defense, and the main villain of the comic book mini-series. Zogg was originally a kind, caring man that wanted the best for the galaxy. To this end, he conceived and designed the Helios Project, capable of teleporting entire planets to new places in space in order to protect them from danger. After Dr. Nefarious' defeat, Zogg ran for Galactic President and asked Captain Qwark to endorse his campaign. Instead, Qwark segues the endorsement into his own campaign for the Presidency and wins, leaving Zogg utterly humiliated. As his first Presidential order, Qwark orders the Helios Project to be shut down, but Zogg refuses to allow this and vanishes with the technology.\n\nSome time later, Zogg (now presumed to have gone completely insane) returns and uses Helios to teleport various planets from the Solana, Bogon, and Polaris galaxies into an empty portion of space. His intention is to create his own \"Artemis Galaxy\", which he plans to rule for himself. When Veldin is among the stolen planets, Ratchet and Clank set out to stop Zogg with help from Talwyn, Sasha, Qwark, the Galactic Rangers and Cronk and Zephyr. He is eventually defeated when Ratchet hits the Suriox Shard with General Azimuth's Praetorian Omniwrench, sending Zogg to another dimension in which he is stuck sharing an asteroid with Percival Tachyon.\n\n===The Loki Master===\nThe '''Loki Master''' is the leader of the Loki, a race of malevolent spirits, and the main villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One]]''. Long ago, their home planet was destroyed by the Cragmites, but they survived by hiding in the remaining pieces as they fell onto the planet Magnus. Unable to live long without a body to inhabit, the Loki were forced to possess the small and harmless creatures in order to survive. One of the planet's inhabitants, Dr. Croid, had his pet Mr. Dinkles possessed by the Loki Master, though Croid remained unaware of the evil spirit living within Mr. Dinkles' body.\n\nStill possessing Mr. Dinkles, the Loki Master tried to steal Dr. Croid's plans for the Protomorphic Energy Extractor to extract the \"energy\" from Mr. Dinkles, but was discovered by the doctor's partner, Dr. Nevo Binklemeyer. Rather than kill him, the Loki Master forced Nevo at gunpoint to aid him in finding the most dangerous species in the galaxy for his kind to possess with the Energy Extractor. When Ratchet, Clank, Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious arrive to stop Nevo (believing him to be the villain), the Loki Master uses the technology to free himself from Mr. Dinkles and possess a giant Grivelnox to destroy them. After being removed from its host, the Loki Master attempts to possess Qwark, but is punched aside by Dr. Nefarious and left to die with no host.\n\n===Ephemeris===\n'''Ephemeris''', also called the '''Creature Collector''', is an interstellar machine built by Dr. Croid to find Mr. Dinkles after he goes missing. However, under orders of the Loki Master that possesses Mr. Dinkles, it is reprogrammed by Croid's assistant, Dr. Nevo Binklemeyer, to collect the most dangerous species in the galaxy for the Loki to possess. The story starts when Ephemeris kidnaps Nefarious, Qwark, Ratchet, and Clank, and takes them to the planet Magnus. After the demise of the Loki Master, Ratchet thinks of using the gigantic droid to fly back to Luminopolis after Nefarious and Lawrence steal the ship used by Cronk and Zephyr. What happened to Ephemeris after All 4 One is unknown.\n\n===Stuart Zurgo===\n'''Stuart Zurgo''' (voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]] in ''Going Commando'', [[Richard Steven Horvitz]] in ''Full Frontal Assault'') was once Qwark's biggest fan and was only known as the '''Qwark Fan-Boy''' in his first two appearances of ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal''. Initially living in the Bogon Galaxy during ''Going Commando'', he confronts Ratchet and Clank and blames them for Qwark's fall from glory, though he is appeased when Ratchet offers his a Qwark figurine (albeit one previously pulled out of a sewer pipe by The Plumber).\n\nOver the years, Stuart became more and more embittered at seeing how the galaxy would always forgive Qwark in spite of his many, many scandals and mistakes, and he ultimately lost all faith in his idol. Seeking revenge, he eventually decided to frame Qwark for messing up his childhood and hired an army of Grungarians to aid in his plans. Stuart Zurgo is eventually confronted and defeated by Ratchet, Clank, and Qwark, who all proceed to bring Stuart to Galactic Authorities. In ''Into the Nexus'' he appears a statue in the Museum of Intergalactic History and it is mentions ed that he has been sentenced to a fate worse than Zordoom Prison for his crimes: 50 years of living with his mother Lucille.\n\n===Vendra and Neftin Prog===\n'''Vendra Prog and Neftin Prog''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] and [[Fred Tatasciore]]) are members of a race called Nethers, who exist in an alternate dimension called the Netherverse, and their primary goal is to allow the Nethers to enter into the Polaris Galaxy. Vendra is considered the brains of the pair and primarily uses telekinesis to attack, while her brother Neftin is the muscle who favors brute force. Both\n\nAt the beginning of the game, Vendra is imprisoned for questioning in regards to Neftin's whereabouts, but Neftin breaks Vendra out of prison with the help of Thugs-4-Less. Using a Dimensionator of their own creation, they are then able to allow small numbers of Nethers out of the Netherverse so that they can weaken the dimensional fields enough to let all of them out, including their leader. However, the Nether leader betrays them and throws Vendra into the Netherverse while the Nether hoards attack the galaxy.\n\nUnwilling to leave his sister behind, Neftin begs Ratchet and Clank to save her and agrees to let themselves be arrested in exchange for their help in stopping the Nethers. After retrieving the original Dimensionator from its display at the Museum of Intergalactic History, Clank enters into the Netherverse and rescues Vendra while Ratchet fights and defeats the Nether leader. At the end of the game, Neftin uses the Dimensionator to banish the Nethers back to their dimension, then keeps his word to Ratchet and turns himself and Vendra over to the authorities despite Vendra's protests.\n\nNeftin is referenced in the re-imagined projects where it is stated that he tried twice to render Aridia's population color blind.\n\n===Non-canon villains===\n====Emperor Otto Destruct====\n'''Emperor Otto Destruct''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the main villain in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Size Matters]]''. He is a Technomite, which are said to be the very creatures that made technology possible. However, while he claims that he dislikes how his kind are ignored, his true intentions are purely based on a hunger for power.\n\nOriginally, Otto had created defective technology which killed Qwark's parents, and also sent a fake e-mail to Qwark so he thought that Otto was his real father. Otto's ultimate creation was a device which could transfer another creature's brain cells into him. Before Captain Qwark could use it as revenge (despite not knowing or caring about its function or effects), his pet monkey Skrunch interfered and it resulted in Otto having a monkey mind, to which Clank humorously states that Skrunch \"just added another family member\".\n\n====Luna====\n'''Luna''' (voiced by [[Nicole Sullivan]]), initially introduced as a young, innocent girl doing a report on heroes who gets kidnapped later on by robots, is in fact a robotic puppet itself, built by the Technomites as bait for Ratchet and Clank and to capture footage of their actions. Normally speaking with a childish lisp as part of its disguise, it is capable of speaking in a normal adult female voice and then in a male Technomite voice. The puppet is later destroyed by Ratchet and Clank on Dayni Moon while using a farming vehicle to attempt to destroy them.\n\n==Other recurring characters==\n\n===Darla Gratch===\n'''Darla Gratch''' (voiced by Sylvia Aimerito) is a female robot works as a news reporter for Channel 2 News (first game only) and later Channel 64 News (in ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal''), she is often seen reporting on planets in rather inconvenient times and does not seem to be aware of the chaos in her surroundings, this leads to her becoming an easy target to any creatures that would sneak up behind her and attack. In the ''Ratchet & Clank'' movie and tie-in game, she has been replaced with Juanita from ''Deadlocked''.\n\n===Abercrombie Fizzwidget===\n'''Abercrombie Fizzwidget''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]) is the CEO of Megacorp, the biggest \"you-name-it-we-make-it\" corporation in the Bogon Galaxy. He is portrayed as a good manager but very absent-minded, and frequently uses [[malapropism]]s or made-up words such as \"imbeciliac\", \"cratefule or \"soretainly\".\n\nIn ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]'', Mr. Fizzwidget hires Ratchet as one of Megacorp's Commandos and tasks him with recovering a stolen Experiment (later called the Protopet). Upon Ratchet's (along with Clank) rescue of it, Fizzwidget meets him and Clank on a desert planet but lands his ship on theirs, although he offers to give them a ride in his ship. As they take off, Fizzwidget \"accidentally\" presses a button that sends Ratchet and Clank up out of the ship and they both fall into a volcanic cavern. With the Experiment back in his hands, Mr. Fizzwidget begins to mass-produce the dangerous creature. At the end of the game, it is revealed that \"Fizzwidget\" is really Captain Qwark in disguise (the malapropisms and made-up words being a mistake on Qwark's part) and is behind all the events of the game. The real Fizzwidget is shown at last following the Mutant Protopet's defeat and thanks Ratchet and Clank for saving the galaxy. Mr. Fizzwidget made a minor non-speaking role in the third game, being shown watching the premiere of Secret Agent Clank.\n\nTom Bramwell of [[Eurogamer]] said that Fizzwidget \"may not be the Captain Qwark successor fans will be after, but will still raise a smile in all but the angriest of gamers when he presents some of his fascinatingly incoherent but salvageable tirades.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Tom Bramwell |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank 2: Locked & Loaded'' Review // PS2 /// Eurogamer - Games Reviews, News and More |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/r_ratchetandclank2_ps2 |date=2003-11-12 |work= |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=21 July 2009 |quote=Cue exaggerated characters, including a new female ally, and some consistently amusing voice acting from the central characters and particularly Fizwidget, who may not quite be the Captain Quark successor fans will be after, but will still raise a smile in all but the angriest of gamers when he presents some of his fascinatingly incoherent but salvageable tirades.}}</ref>\n\n===Female Infobot===\nA small robot with a crush on Clank, the '''Female Infobot''' appears in ''Going Commando'' in her attempts to get Clank's attention. Near the end of the game, she shows Ratchet and Clank the reason why: she was a witness to Captain Qwark as he talked about his plans to \"save\" the Bogon Galaxy by creating a disaster. She is then shot by Fizzwidget, who reveals himself as Qwark. The Infobot is later repaired and appears in the ending, where she gets to spend quality time with Clank.\n\n===President Phyronix===\n'''President Phyronix''' (voiced by Lindsay Schnebly) is a Cazar who is the Galactic President of the Solana Galaxy and Sasha's father. He is shown to be somewhat na\u00efve (such as believing that Clank really is \"Secret Agent Clank\", the Holo-Vid character that Clank plays) and can occasionally act irrationally (such as pretending to be half-robot in anticipation of an all-robot voting turnout), but he truly does care and attempts to keep the galaxy safe in what little way he can. In the comic series, he is kidnapped by his former friend Artemis Zogg and forced to work in his mines on Planet Zaurik. At one point, Zogg boasts of his noble intentions to the President, who responds by calling him a villain worse than Tachyon and Nefarious.\n\nJeremy Dunham of IGN and Johnny Liu of Game Revolution compared the Galactic President to [[Bill Clinton]] (apparent with his voice), with Dunham considering the President to be one of the more endearing characters of the game.<ref name=\"RnCUYAGameRev\">{{cite web |author=Johnny Liu |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' review for the PS2 |url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/ps2/ratchet-clank-up-yer-arsenal |date=2004-11-13 |work= |publisher=Game Revolution |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=The voice work is spot on, particularly in the Galactic President's Clinton-esque twang and Dr. Nefarious' psychotic babbling, which strikes the right balance between threatening and comical.}}</ref><ref name=\"RnCUYAIGN\">{{cite web |author=Jeremy Dunham |authorlink= |title=IGN: ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' Review |url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/561/561352p4.html |date=2004-10-28 |work= |publisher=IGN |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=Captain Quark in particular is pretty hysterical, with the Bill Clinton-esque Galactic President one of the more endearing characters. Clank's dry sidekick humor is in great contrast to Jak's own sidekick Daxter (for those of you that play both games), while Ratchet's \"Why me?\" delivery is spot on.}}</ref>\n\n===Slim Cognito===\n'''Slim Cognito''' (voiced by [[James Horan (actor)|James Horan]] in ''Going Commando'' and ''Up Your Arsenal'', [[Patrick Seitz]] in the 2016 video game) is a [[black market]] arms dealer that made his debut in ''[[Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando]]''. In all of his appearances, he is always hiding behind a booth (presumably due to his reputation as a black market salesman), leaving only his eyes visible. In ''Going Commando'', he operates in the Bogon Galaxy where he trades weapon mods (Acid Mods, Shock Mods, & Lock-On Mods) for Platinum Bolts, and ship mods for Raritanium at his space station (the Ship Shack). In ''Up Your Arsenal'', Slim appears on planet Aquatos to hide from the police after \"mistakenly\" selling a Suck Cannon upgrade to a minor (\"I swear, the kid LOOKED eighteen\"), and will sell Megacorp-brand weapons to Ratchet. He is also present in several booths on different planets in ''Size Matters'', selling weapon mods.\n\nSlim Cognito makes another appearance in ''Secret Agent Clank'', where he appears in Prison Planet, having been sent there for all those times he sold black market merchandise to Ratchet. He gives Ratchet a code so that Clank can enter a high-stakes room in Les Paradis des Trechuirs Casino. In return, Slim asks Ratchet to protect him from the other inmates, who \"wanted to see him expire for selling them shoddy merchandise\". He is also mentioned in ''Tools of Destruction'' as an inmate of Zordoom Prison.\n\nIn the 2016 game, Slim's identity is shown. He is a Rilgarian working in the black market who builds Ratchet the illegal and dangerous RYNO superweapon after collecting all the plans.\n\n===The Galactic Rangers===\n'''The Galactic Rangers''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]] and Chris Hatfield) are robots who fight alongside Ratchet (who they consider their sergeant) in the battlefield missions throughout ''Up Your Arsenal''. They are often cowardly, preferring to let Ratchet take care of the enemies himself. In some missions, they can be heard joking about previous missions over the radio contact. Likewise, they also reward Ratchet with new gadgets for helping them out in their missions. During the final battle with Dr. Nefarious, a number of Galactic Rangers with stronger weapons appear and help take out several enemies, clearing Ratchet's path to the doctor. The Galactic Rangers also appear in the comic series assisting Sasha Phyronix.\n\nThe Galactic Rangers appear with Captain Qwark in the [[Ratchet & Clank (film)|''Ratchet & Clank'' film]].\n\n====Cora Veralux====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Cora Veralux''' (voiced by [[Bella Thorne]]) is a young Markarzian who is the youngest recruit of the Galactic rangers. She was born and raised on the planet Novalis. Cora befriended Ratchet and Clank after they saved her and the Galactic Rangers from Chairman Drek's Warbots.\n\n====Elaris====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Elaris''' (voiced by [[Rosario Dawson]]) is of an unspecified species who is a member of the Galactic Rangers. She serves as Captain Qwark's second-in-command and provides support through the comm station.\n\nHer appearance is similar to Hydro Girl from ''Deadlocked'', but in a recolored form.\n\n====Brax Lectrus====\nExclusive to the re-imaged projects, '''Brax \"Brute\" Lectrus''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]] in the film, [[Mick Wingert]] in the video game) is an unspecified reptilian species who is a member of the Galactic Rangers and the strongest of the group. He became a member of the Galactic Rangers after winning the Dreadzone Challenge known as \"Grapplemania.\"\n\n===Merc and Green===\n'''Merc and Green''' (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]] and [[Travis Davis]]) are a pair of DreadZone combat robots that accompany Ratchet during his missions in ''Deadlocked''. Merc is much more gung-ho and combat oriented, and looks for any excuse to blow something up. Green is frequently cowardly and prone to panic, but nonetheless is always dependable in a fight.\n\nOn the cover for the Japanese version of the game, both Merc and Green have legs. This is because midway through development Insomniac decided to remove their legs for unknown reasons. They can be seen with legs in some early gameplay videos.\n\n===Dallas & Juanita===\n'''Dallas Wannamaker and Juanita Alvaro''' (voiced by [[Daran Norris]] and [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Deadlocked'', [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]] and [[Tabitha St. Germain]] in the movie) are the announcers for ''DreadZone'' and reporters for Vox News. Dallas speaks in a sports announcer-like voice while Juanita speaks with a Hispanic lilt. Throughout the game they commentate Ratchet's participation at ''DreadZone'', usually by making him out as a villain on Vox News, telling fabricated stories about Ratchet and Dallas nicknaming him \"The Butcher of Bogon\", and using highly unflattering (and at times fraudulent) pictures and descriptions. Although Dallas will often complement Ratchet's performance, Juanita, the more sadistic and maniacal of the duo, insults him frequently and often hopes that Ratchet dies inevitably. Dallas also constantly flirts with Juanita (one time checking her out from behind while they were not on the air) to which she replies with insults and disgust. The two eventually show respect towards Ratchet after Vox attempts to blow up the entire Dreadzone station and trapping everyone on board. After escaping DreadZone, Dallas and Juanita land their own Holo-vision sitcom in which they portray a married couple, but it is mentioned that Dallas arranged for their marriage to be legitimate, while Juanita spends every episode trying to kill her husband. They later appear in the movie as civil news reporters.\n\nNick Valentino of GameZone said that the commentary provided by the \"hammy male commentator and his blood-thirsty co-anchor woman\" is \"over-the-top hilarious\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Nick Valentino |title=''Ratchet: Deadlocked'' Review - PlayStation 2 |url=http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r26257.htm |date=2005-10-28 |publisher=GameZone |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=The tournament matches have some commentary by a hammy male commentator and his blood-thirsty co-anchor woman that is just over-the-top hilarious. |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626062952/http://ps2.gamezone.com/gzreviews/r26257.htm |archivedate=26 June 2009 }}</ref> Carrie Gouskos of GameSpot added that their commentary about Ratchet, the competition and each other \"persistently adds flavor to the gameplay\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Carrie Gouskos |authorlink= |title=''Ratchet: Deadlocked'' Review for PlayStation 2 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/ratchetdeadlocked/review.html |date=2005-10-26 |work= |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=22 July 2009 |quote=Most of the levels are narrated by the two quirky Dreadzone announcers, Dallas, a sleazy egomaniac, and Juanita, a sadistic seductress. Their commentary about Ratchet, the competition, and each other persistently adds flavor to the gameplay.}}</ref>\n\n===Ace Hardlight===\nA former hero who appears in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'', '''Ace Hardlight''' (voiced by [[Andr\u00e9 Sogliuzzo]]) brought himself to Gleeman Vox for money and fame, although he wound up being not as popular as he thought he would be.\n\nAce originally started his life as an orphan and was adopted as by a group of superheroes. When that group destroyed his home planet, he left the group and later ended up with Vox as a competitor on DreadZone. After disintegrating Captain Starshield on Catacrom 4, he became DreadZone's Champion and leader of the Exterminator team, consisting of himself, Shellshock, Reactor and the Eviscerator.\n\nDespite Vox's attempts to franchise Ace, the test groups clearly dislike him, with one of the kids in the group even referring to Ace as a \"tool\". About the only ones in DreadZone who like Ace are Juanita, Vox, Dallas, and Ace himself. After being defeated by Ratchet in competition, Ace is briefly moved by the Lombax's heroism and tells Ratchet not to let Vox ruin him like he did to Ace. Later, Ace is announced \"dead\" after his defeat by Ratchet, with Gleeman Vox attempting to sale Ace Hardlight memorial action figures to DreadZone fans.\n\nAce is mentioned in ''Tools of Destruction'' as a prisoner of Zordoom Prison. In ''A Crack in Time'', he is mentioned as having since been released and rehabilitated.\n\n===Captain Starshield===\n'''Captain Starshield''' (voiced by [[Phil Morris (actor)|Phil Morris]]) is the former number one ranked contestant of the underground combat show DreadZone who is killed by Ace Hardlight. His only appearances is when he destroys three robots and when he is killed.<ref>An official comic of this character can be found [http://insomniacgames.com/comics/ here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507092801/http://www.insomniacgames.com/comics/ |date=2006-05-07 }}.</ref> He is also an unlockable character skin in ''Ratchet: Deadlocked''.\n\n===The Smuggler===\n'''The Smuggler''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]), as his name implies, is a smuggler of dubious legality, but he is mostly friendly to Ratchet and Clank in their adventures through the Polaris Galaxy. He appears in ''Tools of Destruction'', ''Quest for Booty'', ''A Crack in Time'', and ''Into the Nexus'' to give Ratchet and Clank equipment and advice in exchange for their help in performing certain services. He is also usually involved in each game's sidequest to assemble the newest model RYNO (\"Rip Ya a New One\") weapon.\n\n===Aphelion===\n'''Aphelion''' (voiced by Rajia Baroudi) is a Lombax-built starship with its own artificial intelligence. In ''Tools of Destruction'', she is rebuilt by Ratchet on the planet Fastoon and becomes his new means of transportation through the Polaris Galaxy. In ''A Crack in Time'', she is initially struck by a wave of time energy and crash-lands, but the Zoni restore her and give her new upgrades. Aphelion briefly appears in ''All 4 One'' when the Light-Eating Z'Grute attacks her.\n\n===Mr. Zurkon===\n'''Mr. Zurkon''' (voiced by Marc Graue in the games, [[Brian Drummond]] in the film) is a synthezoid designed to destroy and trash-talk the enemies it is summoned against. First appearing in ''Tools of Destruction'', it has made consistent appearances in the series as one of Ratchet's most-recurring weapons. Later games introduce '''Mrs. Zurkon''' (voiced by [[Ali Hillis]]) and '''Zurkon Jr.''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] in ''Into the Nexus'', [[Sam Riegel]] in the 2016 video game) as his wife and child, all of them as trigger-happy and vocally cruel as he is.\n\n===Sigmund===\n'''Sigmund''' (voiced by [[Nolan North]]) is the Junior Caretaker (eventually Senior Caretaker) of the Great Clock and appears as a supporting character in ''A Crack in Time''. He once lived and worked on Planet Viceron as a cleaner bot until the Zoni Orvus selected Sigmund as the Junior Caretaker for the Great Clock. During Clank's escape from captivity by Dr. Nefarious, Sigmund helps Clank get to safety, and the two of them travel together through the Great Clock. As he learns about Orvus through his pre-recorded messages, Clank tries to get Sigmund to tell him where the real Orvus is, but he is initially unwilling to explain that Orvus went to the planet Zanifar to meet with Dr. Nefarious and never came back. Clank later overhears the truth from Sigmund, and he convinces the Junior Caretaker to help Orvus by sending a time portal to Zanifar in hopes that Ratchet can save him. Later, Sigmund shows Clank to the Orvus Chamber but is ambushed and knocked out by Lawrence.\n\nNear the end of the game, Sigmund bravely throws himself against Alister Azimuth in order to prevent him from reaching the Orvus Chamber. Though overpowered by the Lombax, he buys Clank enough time to enter the Chamber and use it to prevent Ratchet's death. After Azimuth's death, Clank realizes that he can't leave Ratchet and promotes Sigmund to the Great Clock's new Senior Caretaker in his place.\n\n===Chief Alpheus===\n'''Chief Alpheus''' (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) is the leader of a village of Fongoids that is located within Zolar Forest. He first appears looking for Enessa and upon finding her, questions why she is out in the forest. When she tells him that Zyfoids have returned to their planet, Alpheus replies that they must return to the village for their safety. He helps Ratchet and Qwark fight off the Zyfoids to clear the path back to the village. Once there, Alpheus tells Ratchet about a Zoni Vessel that can contain Zoni. It is hidden in the temple of Zahn and has Ratchet go in to find it. As the lombax exits the temple with Qwark and Alpheus, they find that Lord Vorselon has arrived, looking for General Azimuth. Alpheus calls as many Fongoids as he can into the temple for their safety and helps Ratchet to protect the rest of the defending villagers while guiding Ratchet to his ship.\n\n===Vorn Garblak===\n'''Vorn Garblak''' (voiced by [[Dave Boat]]) is a Markazian debuting in the comic series. He works for Artemis Zogg as his assistant and Chief Warmonger, until issue 5 where he betrays Zogg upon freeing Talwyn after she had been captured by Artemis and his forces. Vorn and Talwyn try to flee from Artemis by using an escape pod but Artemis himself, enters it as well. The pod arrives in the Apogee Space Station and after Artemis Zogg attempts to escape with the Suriox Shard, Vorn assists the heroes in stopping the insane Markazian.\n\nAlthough not shown, Vorn can be heard in ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' where it is revealed that he took the job as Minister Of Defense.\n\n===Mr. Klink===\n'''Mr. Klink''' first appears in the second issue, sentencing Ratchet and an Agorian out the airlock for violating the rule of \"Expected Prisoner Behavior\". Unfortunately for the Warden, Ratchet is saved by Clank and the war bots Cronk and Zephyr. Upon reporting to Artemis Zogg about this, Zogg punishes Klink by sucking him out the airlock and into space where he dies not long after.\n\n===Dr. Frumpis Croid===\n'''Dr. Frumpis Croid''' is a Tharpod scientist and colleague of Nevo Binklemeyer. More than a hundred years prior to the events of ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' , Dr. Croid and Nevo planned to construct the Protomorphic Energy Extractor after mistaking the Loki Master to be a strange manifestation inside Croid's creature companion, Mr. Dinkles. However, Dr. Croid awakened the next day and found his lab in severe damage, that the plans for the Protomorphic Energy Extractor had been stolen and that Mr. Dinkles had gone missing, Croid assumed that Nevo had betrayed him and took the plans for his own use. Twenty-two years later, Dr. Croid reprogramed an old drone named Ephemeris to search for Mr. Dinkles, believing that without Mr. Dinkles in his grasp, Nevo's plan would fail. Unfortunately for Dr. Croid, the matrix causing Ephemeris to remain restricted to Magnus ended up deleted because of Nevo. Being unable to wait any longer, Dr Croid headed to Uzo city to explain to the Tharpods living there about everything and to convince them to stop Nevo, although none of them were prepared for the unexpected attack by Commander Spog and Nevo's collector minions. Their invasion left the city in ruins, with Dr Croid unable to shake the feeling that this was because of his work. Dr. Croid then moved his lab to the Phonica moon to avoid Nevo from infiltrating it but over the years, Croid began to lose his sanity. Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Nefarious find Croid who takes a fascination towards Ratchet, as Croid had started to think he was a Lombax Whisperer, and did not take Ratchet seriously. However, Croid returns near the game's ending saving Nevo from being finished off by Mr. Dinkles, under the control of the Loki master, and after the Spirit freed itself from Mr. Dinkles' body and took control of a Rykan V Grithnoux, Dr Croid works with Nevo in assisting the main characters to stopping the Loki Master for good. The master is defeated at last, and the two Tharpod scientists share a happy reunion.\n\n===Nevo Binklemeyer===\n'''Nevo Binklemeyer''' is a friend to Dr. Frumpis Croid. Over a hundred years before ''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One'' took place, the pair planned to create a device called the Protomorphic Energy Extractor with Mr. Dinkles as their supposed first test subject, Unaware to both Croid and Nevo at first, Mr. Dinkles was actually under the control of the leader of the Torunoux Spirits known as the Loki Master. Mr. Dinkles stole the plans to the Energy Extractor and forced Nevo to work for him in building the collector minions and modify Ephemeris at gun point, both their absence fooled Croid into thinking Nevo had turned against him and stole Mr. Dinkles. Ratchet and the other main characters find Nevo, and they learn about him being used as a pawn for Mr. Dinkles, Nevo ends up angering the small creature who attempts to dispose of the scientist. Nevo is saved by Dr. Croid and the Loki Master extracts itself from Mr. Dinkles' body, using an Grithnoux as its new host to battle the main characters. After Nefarious destroys the Loki, Croid and Nevo embrace in a friendly manner, reunited at last.\n\n==Minor characters==\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank''===\n* '''Skid McMarx's Agent''' (voiced by Chad Einbinder in the first game, [[Scott Whyte]] in the 2016 game) - A Rilgerian who is Skid's agent.

Appears in the third game where he is shown watching the premiere of Secret Agent Clank for an unexplained reason. He later becomes known as '''Victor von Ion''' in the re-imaged game and movie. Clank defeated him by exposing him to water.\n* '''Jowaii Resort Owner''' (voiced by Chad Einbinder in the first appearance, [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the 2016 video game) - An owner of Pokitaru's Jowaii Resort. Ratchet and Clank meet him on Pokitaru to get the O2 Mask, a headgear that Ratchet would need if he were to explore underwater, in space and on Planet Orxon since the atmosphere is deadly to him. The owner tells them that because of the Blarg dumping toxic waste into the sea, the wildlife became mutated and ate some of the tourists (although some managed leave the resort) leaving the owner no choice but to close the place down, but he still has one last O2 Mask in his percussion. He asks them to get rid of the ships and he will hand the Mask to them. Once this request is done, he gives Ratchet the O2 Mask. The owner was also seen in ''Up Your Arsenal'' watching the Secret Agent Premiere. In the 2016 video game, the Jowaii Resort Owner was redesigned and renamed to '''Felton Razz''' where he is the twin brother of Grimroth Razz. Grimroth claims to Ratchet that he and Felton don't talk much due to Felton being considered a slacker.\n* '''Miner''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]]) - A Solanaian who works on the icy planet of Hoven who has a situation with his drill as the rock he was trying to drill into kept damaging it, Clank sees that the rock he is holding is Raritanium. After Ratchet sorts up the drill's problem, the miner heads over the Raritanium to Ratchet in thanks.\n* '''Qwark's Bouncer''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) - The bodyguard of Qwark. He has a dislike towards his employer's fans as they always keep bugging Qwark for autographs and other things. To get him to let them see Qwark, Ratchet and Clank pay the Bouncer in bolts.\n* '''Robot Scrap Merchant''' (voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]]) - First seen screaming hysterically in the background of Darla's news report in Gorda City. The merchant later greets Ratchet at his shop, but has a problem with hearing the lombax as the attack on the planet, possibly left him with permanent problems with his hearing.\n* '''Ultra-Mech Scientist''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]]) - The inventor of the Ultra-Mech Unlimited robots, he had built the robots unaware of their purposes and decides to dismantle the pad that was used to increase the size of the Mechs. Ratchet and Clank meet him on planet Quartu, and he has Clank use the pad to enlarge so he can destroy the robots in the area. Once the robots are taken care of, the scientist has Clank re-step on the pad to change back to his normal size.\n* '''Gadgetron CEO''' (voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]] in the first game, [[Patrick Seitz]] in the 2016 game) - The head of the Gadgetron Corporation. Ratchet and Clank head to the company's headquarters on Planet Kelebo III to look for a hologuise that Ratchet can use to sneak past robot guards on planet Quartu, they met the CEO who offers to have Ratchet in his new commercial if he can beat the test bots in a Hoverboard race. Ratchet agrees and wins the race, however he is surprised about being filmed immediately and is very unprepared, however Clank does a better job at this. The CEO makes an awkward comment about his act, believing he got the wrong guy. After Ratchet asks if he now gets a discount on gadgets, the CEO explains that he needs to be a part of Gadgetron for two years before getting a discount (which he does get in ''Up Your Arsenal'' if save data for the first game is detected), but he allows Ratchet to have the gadget he come for, the Hologuise. He later becomes known as '''Wendall Lumos''' in the 2016 video game.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando''===\n* '''Billy''' (voiced by [[Chad Einbinder]]) - A young boy who was used for the Protopet Commercial. He was clearly terrified of the Protopet that he was supposed to play with as it was too violent towards him. After all the Protpets in the Bogon galaxy were rendered harmless, Billy got one of his own and they are both shown at the premiere of Secret Agent Clank at the end of ''Up Your Arsenal''.\n* '''Desert Riders''' - The Desert Riders are an elite group of hoverbike riders who are sponsored by Thugs-4-Less. They later made a cameo in ''Deadlock'' being seen in a picture alongside Ratchet in a Vox news report.\n** '''Desert Rider One''' (voiced by [[Steven Blum]]) - A large wolf-like hoverbike rider who appears on Planet Barlow. Upon Ratchet and Clank meeting him, the rider tells Ratchet to leave or he would harm Clank. After Ratchet threatens him with violence, the desert rider breaks down in tears upon hearing Ratchet's words and attempts to ignore him when he supposedly tries to apologize. Clank reassures him that they have just simply come to compete in the Hoverbike race, comforting the rider. He lets Ratchet borrow his hoverbike as soon after Ratchet repaired it. Once Ratchet wins the race, the desert rider awards Ratchet with a hoverbike helmet.\n** '''Desert Rider Two''' (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) - Another rider with a muscular physique. Ratchet and Clank meet him on Planet Joba. After Ratchet wins the Hoverbike race, the rider expresses his disappointment in losing because he really wanted the prize: a pair of Chargeboots.\n* '''New Age Mystic''' (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]) - The New Age Mystic is a bizarre hippie who fixes up Ratchet's ship with crystals. He shows up later on Angela's home planet where he offers to move a big boulder for Ratchet and Clank then give them a piece of the Hypnomatic in exchange for Moonstones. Any further crystals or Moonstones given to him afterwards would be traded for bolts. The New Age mystic later appeared in ''Up Your Arsenal'' attending the ''Secret Agent Klank'' film following Doctor Nefarious' defeat.\n* '''Protopet Scientists''' - The Protopet's handlers that both were shown in a recording. They were examining its reflexes when it grew much bigger and apparently ate one of the handlers before going for the other one. However the two were shown near the end of ''Up Your Arsenal'', implying that they survived the Protopet's attack somehow.\n* '''Tractor Beam Scientist''' - A scientist who constructed a Tractor Beam gadget that allows whoever uses it to move columns and bombs provided that they have a special symbol. Ratchet meets the scientist on Planet Oozla and buys the beam off him.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal''===\n* '''Clank's Director''' (voiced by [[Chris Haftield]]) - Directs the episodes of the Secret Agent Clank Holo-Vid show. He appears to dislike Ratchet, who is cast as the chuffer on the show because he always messes up during the filming. After a screw up by Ratchet, the director; having put up with Ratchet's clumsiness too many times, fires him.\n* '''Supernova Taxi Driver''' (voiced by [[Neil Flynn]]) - A taxicab driver who gets a call from Qwark disguised as a lady, asking to be picked up from Planet Zeldrin after escaping from the explosion of Dr. Nefarious' starcruiser. Falling for Qwark's rather poor disguise, the taxi driver tries to ask Qwark on a date, disgusting him.\n\n===''Ratchet: Deadlocked''===\n* '''Venus''' - A robot who works on the operation level in the DreadZone Station. She begins a relationship with Clank and helps him with figuring out how to remove the Deadlock collars.\n* '''Hydro Girl and Kid Nova''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] and [[Travis Davis]]) - Two of the superheroes that were captured by the Vox Empire and made to compete in DreadZone. They appear in the ending to thank Ratchet for freeing them.\n* '''Vernon, Eugene, and Lucy''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]] and [[Mona Marshall]]) - Three children that are shown with each other throughout various scenes in ''Ratchet Deadlocked'', they are often used in DreadZone commercials and as part of Vox's test-market for DreadZone merchandise.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time''===\n* '''Enessa''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Darling]]) - A Fongoid mother who Ratchet and Qwark meet after they crash land on Quantos. She asks them to save her children after they ran into danger by the Zyfoids. Ratchet is able to recue all three of the children and bring them to their mother. With her children safe and sound, Enessa and her children are then escorted by Ratchet and Qwark as they return to their village.\n* '''Enessa's children''' (voiced by [[Amber Hood]] and [[Becky Boxer]]) - Three Fongoid children that got separated from their mother by the Zyfoids' attack. Two of them, are found stuck on ledges with Zyfoids below, leaving Ratchet to dispose of the creatures away so they can come down. The third one, presumed to be a girl, is stuck in an area struck by a time anomaly, requiring Ratchet to open the bridge for the Fongoid child to get across and reunite with Enessa. As soon as the three children are back with their mother, they follow her back home as Ratchet and Qwark, with assistance by Chief Alpheus, take out more Zyfoids.\n* '''The Guardian''' (voiced by [[Paul Eiding]]) - A giant robotic head used by Vullards to keep their operation on Torren IV quiet. Ratchet tells it that he is looking for Volgram Pass and is told that any outsiders must find it for themselves.\n* '''Jarvis''' - A Teracnoid and acquaintance of General Azimuth, he works as a data minor for Pollyx Industries. Jarvis first met Azimuth when he saved the Teracnoid from becoming food for the Agorians. Jarvis helps Azimuth and Ratchet to break into the company's building, by having Azimuth hack the defense grid, and allowing Ratchet to activate the switches in Neurox Plaza.\n* '''Mac McKeroy''' (voiced by [[Joey D'Auria]]) - Another Teranoid that works with dozens of other teracnoids in the Agorians Battleplex, Ratchet meets Mac on his mission to assist Qwark in winning the tournament held in the Battleplex. After winning, Ratchet is given a security card by Mac, believing that Ratchet might find a use for it. Compared to other members of his kind, Mac talks and acts in a different manner, being more of a stand-up comedian and is more friendly towards Ratchet. Mac also advertises his Moonlight Lounge show on the radio in space.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One''===\n* '''Tharpod Chief''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) - A elderly Tharpod and leader of Susie's village. He tells Ratchet, Clank and their allies, Qwark and Nefarious about Ephemeris, the Creature Collector and that it has been capturing monsters and bringing them to Magnus for over a century. Even though he does not know who is controlling the machine, he says that Commander Sporg, its emissary had been protecting the machine for a long time. Ratchet mistakes the chief to be Susie's father until he is told that Susie's parents were killed during an invasion on Totem Fi, this left Susie, along with a lot of Tharpod children, an orphan.\n* '''Susie's Friends''' - Two unnamed Tharpod children, their only appearance in the game is the scene where Susie plans out an attack on Ephemeris. It is not known if they are orphans.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank: Full Frontal Assault''===\n* '''Barry''' (voiced by [[Mikey Kelley]]) - The A.I. of the Starship Phoenix II.\n* '''Bleep''' (voiced by Andrew Cownden in the film, [[Sam Riegel]] in the 2016 video game) - A tall maintenance robot that is encountered on the Starship Phoenix II. He works with Bloop as the ship's maintenance robots. In ''Into the Nexus'', Bleep attended Destructapalooza. In the 2016 film and video game, he is re-imaged as a small green robot named '''Zed''' who is the attendant of Chairman Drek.\n* '''Bloop''' - A short maintenance robot that is encountered on the Starship Phoenix II.\n\n===''Ratchet & Clank'' (2016 video game)===\n* '''Shiv Helix''' (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) - A major criminal who spent time in various prisons. While at Aleero City Penitentiary, he meets his cellmates Captain Qwark, Zed, and Solitary Bill. He listens to Captain Qwark's story about Ratchet and Clank and how Captain Qwark got arrested for double-crossing the Galactic Rangers out of jealousy for Ratchet. By the end of Captain Qwark's story, Shiv and Captain Qwark were cleaning up litter outside the Hall of Heroes when Ratchet and Clank came into view. Shiv takes the opportunity to steal Ratchet's ship and makes his escape with Ratchet, Clank, Captain Qwark, and the Galactic Rangers not far behind. His design is a modified version of Don Wonderstar's character model where he sports a scar across his left eye and has a robotic left hand.\n\n==Species==\nThe alien species in the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series are listed in alphabetical order:\n\n* '''Agorians''' - The Agorians are a proud race of reptilian creatures with an often-changing (and frequently made-up on the spot) Code of Honor, first appearing in ''A Crack in Time''. They have never evolved and love to engage in warrior lifestyle, so far as to create the Agorian Battleplex to fight in contests and invade several peaceful planets. They have both antagonized and allied Ratchet and Clank during their adventures in the Polaris Galaxy.\n* '''Amoeboids''' - The Amoeboids are green slimy creatures that inhabit sewers in at least four planets. They appear attacking Blackwater City in ''Ratchet & Clank'', in the sewers of planet Pokitaru (likely created from the toxic waste that the Blargs were dumping into the ocean), in a secret area on planet Novalis, and in the sewers of Aquatos. In ''Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal'' it is revealed in the second episode of the Qwark vid-comics that Dr. Nefarious is actually the one who created the Amoeboids and planned to use them to destroy Blackwater City because its inhabitants called him insane (this has not been confirmed to be canon however). They later return in ''Secret Agent Clank'', thriving in the acid-filled canals of Venantonio. That game also introduced red variants that can explode (Clank says \"Someone must have altered their chemical compositions\") It was also mentioned that there was a self-deodorizing variant being created; whether this was successful is unknown.\n* '''Blarg''' - The Blarg are the main enemies in ''Ratchet & Clank''. Their home planet was once Orxon, but the constant pollution forced them off (though they have apparently tried to clean the planet since the first game). They come in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from foot soldiers to monstrous Snagglebeasts. The Blargs are technologically apt, but have really only focused on advanced warfare-technology. They have also built a large space station for research purposes. They are an orange-pink in colour. Their leader is the tyrannical Ultimate Supreme Executive Chairman Drek (who is defeated by Ratchet at the end of ''Ratchet & Clank''). They also built the first R.Y.N.O (Rip Ya a New One), the most powerful series of weapons in the ''Ratchet & Clank'' series.\n* '''Cazares''' - The Cazares are humanoids with brown fur and a look that is slightly similar to a fox. Known Cazares are Sasha (who appears in the games ''Up Your Arsenal'' and at the beginning of ''Ratchet: Deadlocked'') and her father President Phyronix (who appears in ''Up Your Arsenal'' and mentioned in the game ''Secret Agent Clank''). Apparently the males are twice as big than the females and Sasha is the same size as Ratchet. There was originally confusion that Sasha was a Lombax like Ratchet, but Insomniac has since cleared it up.\n* '''Cragmites''' - The Cragmites are a brutal race of [[Reptilian humanoid|reptilian]]/[[insectoid]] creatures that lost the Great War to the Lombaxes of which Emperor Percival Tachyon is the last. The Cragmites terrorized the Polaris Galaxy, but the Lombaxes fought back and banished the Cragmites into another dimension - effectively ridding the universe of them. Tachyon managed to summon the Cragmites once more with the Dimensionator before having his army stopped by Ratchet. The Cragmites are a deep-purple color, much like the terrain of their barren homeworld. Whilst Tachyon is relatively small, true Cragmites are considerably larger - standing much higher than either Ratchet or Captain Qwark. Cragmites seem to possess teleportation abilities and incredible strength.\n* '''Drophyds''' - The Drophyds are a race of goldfish-like aliens originating from Planet Zaurik. Emperor Tachyon employs them as the main soldiers in his army by bribing them with raritaneum and granting them armor based on Lombax engineering and built from materials scavenged from Space Pirates. Without their armor, their bodies are left to flop around harmlessly on the ground.\n* '''Fongoids''' - The Fongoids are a small mammal-like creatures who were once trusted with the power of time travel by the Zoni. But when a huge space rift is created due to their constant time-travel the Zoni take away all technology and the Fongoids develop into a nature-based culture. The males are characterized by frequent vocal tics, the cause of which is unknown to experts. It is a Fongoid planet, Zanifar, where Dr. Nefarious's asteroid crash lands. He quickly brainwashes the Fongoids there to build the outpost on Planet Zanifar. Their first appearance is in ''[[Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time]]''.\n* '''Grummels''' - The Grummels are race of aliens found in the Polaris galaxy. They are the operators of Grummelnet, the leading weapons and armour manufacturer in the Polaris Galaxy (analogous to Gadgetron of Solana and Megacorp in Bogon). Grummels are green-skinned and often fat, with a single antenna on their heads. According to the IRIS supercomputer in ''Tools of Destruction'', an attempt to restore the dying Grummel population through cloning left many of the clones lacking in intelligence. Despite this, they are shown to be very proficient at manufacturing weaponry.\n* '''Kerchu''' - The Kerchu are small, furry creatures that are very skilled in building weapons. Their home planet is Planet Jasindu. According to the Smuggler, the Kerchu are the most dangerous race in Polaris (behind the Cragmites) and there is no being that is not allergic to Kerchu fur.\n* '''Loki''' - The Loki are a race of malevolent spirits that survive by possessing the bodies of other creatures. They were defeated long ago by a Cragmite hero and had since lived on planet Magnus by possessing the small and harmless creatures that inhabit it, though they desire large and powerful beasts with which to terrorize the galaxy.\n* '''Lombaxes''' - The Lombaxes are a race of [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[bobcat]]-like creatures that are known for their natural affinity with [[gadget]]s and machines, though female Lombaxes do not have tails and (at least in Angela's case) are presumed to be noticeably taller, while males are shorter but bulkier. Their home planet is Fastoon in the Polaris Galaxy. The Lombaxes are hailed in the Polaris Galaxy as the saviors of the universe for defeating the Cragmites. However, when Tachyon's Drophyd army attacked Fastoon, the Lombaxes teleported out of the universe to escape them. Ratchet, his father Kaden, Angela Cross, and Alister Azimuth are the only known Lombaxes to have stayed behind. As of the conclusion of ''A Crack in Time'', Kaden and Azimuth are dead and Angela has gone missing, leaving Ratchet as the last-known survivor of his kind.\n* '''Markazian''' - Talwyn Apogee, Max Apogee, Vorn Garblak, Artemis Zogg, and Cora Veralux are Markazians. They resemble humans, only with pointy ears and a tail. Talwyn's species is first mentioned in ''Quest for Booty'': when Ratchet promises to her that they will make it out of the Morrow Caverns together, Rusty Pete mocks Ratchet by singing \"Lombax and Markazian sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-s-i-n.\"\n* '''Nethers''' - Appearing in ''Into The Nexus'', the Nethers are a race of extradimensional entities who exist in the Netherverse and seek to escape. They come in multiple forms, ranging from humanoids like Vendra and Neftin Prog to giant savage beasts like their leader (nicknamed \"Mister Eye\" by Vendra).\n* '''Snagglebeast''' - The Blargian Snagglebeast is a colossal being with the appearance of an ogre. Even though the Snagglebeast was seen in a commercial as an arch-enemy of Captain Qwark, the game reveals that it was actually his trained pet which he sics on Ratchet and Clank. It has many barbaric characteristics and is presumably used by Qwark to devour his unwary enemies. The Snagglebeast's brawn was no match for Ratchet's brain, and the creature met its demise by falling into a pool of lava.\n* '''[[Space pirate|Space Pirates]]''' - A faction of spacefaring robots that terrorize the Polaris Galaxy and serve under Captain Slag and Rusty Pete. According to the IRIS, they were engineered by Emperor Tachyon in order to gather materials for the Drophyds' nanotech armor, but abandoned them when they completed their task. Captain Slag's Space Pirates relentlessly attack any ship that enters their territory, though there seems to be a mutual co-operation between Slag's crew and several other space pirate fleets that Ratchet encounters in ''Tools of Destruction''.\n* '''Technomites''' - The Technomites are tiny intelligent creatures who are responsible for the existence of technology. Because they are nearly microscopic, very few people have seen them and they are considered nothing more than a myth. Led by Emperor Otto Destruct, the Technomites attempted to create an army of Ratchet clones using his DNA. They were also responsible for creating Luna, hacking into Clank, and tricking Qwark into thinking he's Otto's son. According to Clank, Captain Qwark's real parents were killed by defective Technomite technology. Whether this was intentional or not remains undisclosed.\n* '''Terachnoids''' - The Teachnoids are crustacean-like creatures that are described as the most intelligent beings in the known universe, which is owed to their multiple brains of varying number housed in enormous craniums that far exceed the size of their bodies. They think very highly of themselves for their superior intelligence, but are frequently humiliated by other, more physically adept species like Agorians.\n* '''Tyhrranoids''' - The Tyhrranoids are a gullible race of alien warriors who were tricked by Dr. Nefarious to work for him in ''Up Your Arsenal'' to destroy all organic life. The Tyhrranoids, seemingly devoid of a sense of irony, do not realize that they themselves are biological, and carry out his orders. The Tyhrranoids' home planet is planet Tyhrranosis where the \"Momma Tyhrranoid\" lives. The Momma Tyhrranoid was defeated and killed by Ratchet, but Qwark took all the credit for it. The entire Tyhrranoid population was transformed into robots when Dr. Nefarious used his Biobliterator, though the majority (with a few exceptions) are seen as organic again in ''Deadlocked'' and ''Secret Agent Clank''. The more powerful a Tyhrranoid, the bigger it is and the more eyes it has.\n* '''Valkyries''' - The Valkyries are an all-female race of warriors that are hired by Dr. Nefarious to kill Ratchet and Azimuth. They reside on Vapedia after the Erebus supernova destroyed their old home planet, and all the males of their species were exiled because they failed to ask for directions to Vapedia. Ever since the Space Pirates' defeat at the hands of Ratchet, the Valkyries have become the newest threat to travellers in the Polaris Galaxy.\n* '''Vullards''' - The Vullards are reptile-like creatures that live in wastelands on planets Torren IV and Lumos. Their exploit is to gather scrap metal and lots of it (apparently as a black market operation, as one Vullard says \"we like to keep our operation from the prying eyes of galactic authorities\"). Ratchet first meets members of the race on Torren IV where Azimuth's home is located. Ratchet and the general later helps the Vullards on saving their settlement by defeating a fleet of attacking Agorians. Vullards can also be found in the space sectors where Ratchet can do optional side missions for them.\n* '''Zoni''' - The Zoni are a mysterious race of ethereal aliens that are capable of travel through time and space and can choose to let others see and/or hear them. They are neither biological nor mechanical, but are instead beings of pure energy that manifest on the physical [[plane of existence]] by inhabiting metal bodies. They occasionally appear, usually only visible to Clank when he is alone or asleep, to aid Ratchet and Clank on their quest. In the ending cutscene of ''Tools of Destruction'', they make themselves visible to everyone and kidnap Clank leaving the game on a cliffhanger. In ''Quest for Booty'', they regard Dr. Nefarious as a doctor and believe he will be able to repair Clank. In ''A Crack in Time'', Zoni are scattered across the Polaris System due to Nefarious setting the Hypersonic Brainwave Scrambler after them. Ratchet can rescue Zoni during his journey to upgrade his ship, Aphelion.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Ratchet & Clank}}\n{{Insomniac Games}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:List Of Ratchet and Clank Characters}}\n[[Category:Lists of fictional extraterrestrial characters|Ratchet and Clank]]\n[[Category:Lists of video game characters|Ratchet and Clank]]\n[[Category:Ratchet & Clank characters| ]]\n", "name_user": "Belanal", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCourtney Gears", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ratchet_%26_Clank_characters"}

It was broadcast on [[BBC One]] on 16 June 2007.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Doctor Who UK airdate announced |work=News |publisher=[[Dreamwatch]] |date=27 February 2007 |url=http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312164215/http://www.dwscifi.com/articles/show/227 |archivedate=12 March 2007}}</ref> It is the first of three episodes that form a linked narrative, followed by \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\" and \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\". The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.

The episode serves to re-introduce [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] ([[John Simm]]), an alien villain of the show's original run who previously appeared in the 1996 television movie ''[[Doctor Who (film)|Doctor Who]]''.\n\nSet close to the [[Heat death of the universe|end of the universe]] 100 trillion years in the future, the episode involves Professor Yana ([[Derek Jacobi]]) attempting to send the last of humanity in a rocket to a place called \"Utopia\".\n\n==Plot==\n[[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], [[Tenth Doctor|the Doctor]]'s former [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]], is stranded on Earth and has based himself in 21st-century Cardiff to wait for the Doctor, knowing the Doctor would eventually land there to refuel with the [[Cardiff Rift]]. The Doctor lands the [[TARDIS]] in Cardiff to refuel. The Doctor sees Jack racing towards the TARDIS and dematerialises. Jack grabs on to the outer shell, causing the TARDIS to fly to the end of the universe trying to shake him off. Jack dies on the journey but revives seconds later as he cannot stay dead. As they explore the planet Malcassairo, the Doctor, Jack, and the Doctor's companion [[Martha Jones|Martha]] encounter Padra, a lone human running for his life from cannibalistic humanoids called the Futurekind.\n\nThe Doctor, Jack, and Martha help Padra reach a missile silo where a rocket intends to transport the last of the human race to \"Utopia\". While there they meet the elderly Professor Yana and his insectoid assistant Chantho. The Professor asks the Doctor to look at their rocket engine to determine why it will not launch, and the Doctor helps him repair it and give it power. During the repairs, the Professor repeatedly hears a rhythmic drumbeat he has heard for as long as he can remember. When the rocket is ready to launch, the refugees board it. One of the Futurekind shorts the system out, filling the room with the rocket couplings with deadly radiation. Jack is enlisted to fix the couplings.\n\nWhile Jack is inside working, the Doctor admits he abandoned Jack purposely because of the immortality [[Rose Tyler|Rose]] granted to Jack. Jack readies the rocket for launch. Martha unintentionally draws attention to the Professor's fob watch, similar to the one which changed the Doctor from a [[Time Lord]] into a human. She rushes to tell the Doctor about the watch as the Professor hears voices coming from it.\n\nThe Doctor initiates the launch sequence of the rocket at the same time that the Professor opens the fob watch. A frantic Doctor runs back to the control room, but the Professor lets the Futurekind inside the silo. Chantho confronts the Professor. He responds that his name is [[The Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]]. Chantho and the Master both fatally injure each other. An injured Master stumbles into the TARDIS and [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regenerates]] into a younger form. The Master begins to dematerialise the TARDIS, stranding the Doctor, Jack, and Martha with the Futurekind.\n\n===Continuity===\n\"Utopia\" explains the [[Face of Boe]]'s cryptic message of \"you are not alone\" (y-a-n-a, the source of the Master's human name in this episode) in the episode \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\". It referred to the Master, another [[Time Lord]]. The concept of using a fob watch to disguise a [[Time Lord]] as a human was introduced in the two-parter \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who episode)|Human Nature]]\" / \"[[The Family of Blood]]\" earlier this series, when the Doctor hides as a human, John Smith. It becomes crucial in the climax of this episode, used as a plot device to reveal the Master's identity,\n\nThis episode features the return of former companion Jack Harkness, who was left behind by the Doctor during \"[[The Parting of the Ways]]\" (2005) and ended up the main protagonist of the spin-off ''[[Torchwood]]'' before learning of the Doctor's presence in the series 1 finale \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\". Harkness uses the Doctor's severed hand from \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\" as a \"Doctor detector\". The hand is encased in a jar that bubbles when the Doctor is near. The hand reappears in the episodes \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[The Last of the Time Lords]]\", \"[[The Doctor's Daughter]]\", \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\", and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\".\n\nThe episode marks the return of the renegade Time lord known as the Master, who last appeared during the 1996 [[Doctor Who (film)|television movie]]. It also references the events of \"[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note01/> \"[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]\",<ref group=Note name=Note02/> \"The Parting of the Ways\",<ref group=Note name=Note03/> \"[[The Christmas Invasion]]\"<ref group=Note name=Note04/> and ''Torchwood'' episode \"[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]\".<ref group=Note name=Note05/> As well, it contains clips from \"The Parting of the Ways\", \"The Christmas Invasion\", \"[[Human Nature (Doctor Who)|Human Nature]]\" and \"[[Gridlock (Doctor Who)|Gridlock]]\" and audio clips of previous Masters when the Professor's watch is beckoning him to open it, including [[Anthony Ainley]]'s laugh and a line [[Roger Delgado]] spoke in ''[[The D\u00e6mons]]''.<ref name=\"Utopia\"/><ref>{{Cite web|title=\"Utopia\" Podcast |url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s311_commentary.mp3 |work= |date=16 June 2007|accessdate=9 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>\n\nDerek Jacobi plays the fifth version of the Master whom the Doctor has encountered on screen, and John Simm is the sixth.<ref name=\"Utopia\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/episodes/2007/facts/fact_311.shtml |title=Doctor Who - Fact File - \"Utopia\" |accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> At least one television pundit speculated whether \"Mister Saxon\" was an intentional anagram of \"Master No. Six\" or was perhaps \"a big [[Red herring (plot device)|red herring]]\".<ref name=\"master_anagram\">{{Cite web|title=Of a Thursday|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a44695/of-a-thursday.html |work=[[Digital Spy]] |date=1 April 2007|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> However, when asked, Russell T Davies stated that it was not deliberate.<ref>''Radio Times'' 30 June\u20136 July 2007: ''Doctor Who'' Watch</ref><ref>''Doctor Who Magazine'' issue 384: ''Return of the Master''</ref> Jacobi also played the Master in the [[Shalka Doctor|alternate Ninth Doctor]] story ''[[Scream of the Shalka]]''.\n\nThe episode marks the first time the Master has been shown undergoing regeneration; previous serials have shown two natural incarnations of the Master (the incarnation played by Roger Delgado opposite [[Jon Pertwee]]'s Doctor, and the final incarnation first seen in ''[[The Deadly Assassin]]'' (1976), and subsequently appearing in ''[[The Keeper of Traken]]''). In ''The Keeper of Traken'' (1981), as a way of extending his life beyond the end of his final natural incarnation, the Master appropriates someone else's body; he does this again in [[Doctor Who (film)|the 1996 TV movie]]. In the following episode, \"[[The Sound of Drums]]\", the Master states that the Time Lords resurrected him to serve as a soldier in the Time War, presumably giving him a new body with a new set of regenerations (which had previously been alluded to in ''[[The Five Doctors]]''). This is the second episode to show a Time Lord other than the Doctor regenerating on screen (and the first of the revived series), the first being the regeneration of K'anpo in ''[[Planet of the Spiders]]'' (1974); although [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] regenerated in the first episode of ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' (1979), this process was depicted off screen.\n\nThe Master continually hears the sound of drums throughout this episode; this continues through \"[[The Sound of Drums (Doctor Who)|The Sound of Drums]]\", \"[[Last of the Time Lords]]\" and becomes a plot point in \"[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]\".\n\n==Production==\nThis episode was announced as the first of a three-part story in ''[[Totally Doctor Who]]'', broadcast the day before. Prior to this, only the following two instalments had been linked.  Later reference material, including ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'''s season poll, treated the three episodes as a single three-part story.  Russell T Davies has said that he regards \"Utopia\" as a separate story, but notes that the determination is arbitrary.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Davies |first=Russell T |authorlink=Russell T Davies |date=4 March 2009|title=Production Notes |magazine=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=406 |page=4 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]]|location=[[Royal Tunbridge Wells]], [[Kent]] |quote=And I certainly feel the Series Three climax was two stories, no matter what the '''DWM''' season poll says.
