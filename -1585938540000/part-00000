He is most renowned for creating the [[Mercator 1569 world map|1569 world map]] based on a new [[Mercator projection|projection]] which represented sailing courses of constant bearing ([[rhumb line]]s) as straight lines\u2014an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts.\n\nMercator was one of the pioneers of cartography and is widely considered the most notable figure of the school in [[History of cartography|its golden age]] (approximately 1570s\u20131670s). In his own day, he was a notable as maker of globes and scientific instruments. In addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and [[geomagnetism]]. He was also an accomplished [[engraving|engraver]] and [[Calligraphy|calligrapher]].\nUnlike other great scholars of the age he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but in the second half of his life, he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his [[Atlas]] of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in reference to a book of maps. However, Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (''Cosmologia'') on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of the [[Atlas (mythology)|Titan Atlas]], \"King of Mauretania\", whom he considered to be the first great geographer.\n\nA large part of Mercator's income came from sales of his terrestrial and celestial globes. For sixty years they were considered the finest in the world, and were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving the manufacture of the spheres, printing the [[Globe#Manufacture|gores]], building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his [[astrolabe]]s and [[astronomical rings]] used to study the [[geometry]] of [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]].\n\nMercator wrote on geography, philosophy, [[chronology]] and theology. All of the wall maps were engraved with copious text on the region concerned. As an example the [[Mercator 1569 world map|famous world map of 1569]] is inscribed with over five thousand words in [[Mercator 1569 world map#Summary of the legends|fifteen legends]]. The 1595 Atlas has about 120 pages of maps and illustrated title pages but a greater number of pages are devoted to his account of the creation of the [[universe]] and descriptions of all the countries portrayed. His table of chronology ran to some 400 pages fixing the dates (from the time of creation) of earthly [[Dynasty|dynasties]], major political and military events, [[volcano|volcanic]] [[eruption]]s, [[earthquakes]] and [[eclipse]]s. He also wrote on the [[gospels]] and the [[Old Testament]].\n\nMercator was a devout [[Christians|Christian]] born into a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family at a time when [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestantism]] was gaining ground. He never declared himself as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] but he was clearly sympathetic and he was accused of heresy by Catholic authorities; after six months in prison he was released unscathed. This period of persecution is probably the major factor in his move from Catholic [[Leuven]] (Louvain) to a more tolerant [[Duisburg]], in the Holy Roman Empire, where he lived for the last thirty years of his life. Walter Ghim, Mercator's friend and first biographer, describes him as sober in his behaviour, yet cheerful and witty in company, and never more happy than in debate with other scholars. Above all he was pious and studious until his dying days.<ref>The full text of Ghim's biography is translated in {{harvtxt|Sullivan|2000}} pages 7\u201324 of the atlas text, pdf pages 77\u201394.</ref>\n\n==Mercator's life==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Dorpsgezicht Rupelmonde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Rupelmonde]] from ''[[Flandria illustrata]]'', 1641]]\nGerardus Mercator was born Geert or Gerard (de) Kremer (or Cremer), the seventh child of Hubert (de) Kremer and his wife Emerance in [[Rupelmonde]], Flanders, a small village to the southwest of [[Antwerp]], all of which lied in the fiefdom of [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. His parents came from [[Gangelt]] in the Holy Roman [[Duchy of J\u00fclich]] (present-day Germany). At the time of the birth they were visiting Hubert's brother (or uncle<ref>There is some doubt about the relationship of Hubert and Gisbert. Gisbert was either the brother or uncle of Hubert.</ref>) Gisbert de Kremer.<ref>People in both locations at the time spoke an [[Modern Dutch|Early Modern Dutch dialects]] and there probably was close to no language barrier.</ref> Hubert was a poor artisan, a shoemaker by trade, but Gisbert, a priest, was a man of some importance in the community. Their stay in Rupelmonde was brief and within six months they returned to Gangelt and there Mercator spent his earliest childhood until the age of six.<ref>The evidence for Mercator's place of birth is in his letter to Wollfgang Haller ({{harvtxt|Averdunk|1914|}}, Letter26, and {{harvtxt|Durme|1959}}, Letter 152) and in the biography by his personal friend {{harvtxt|Ghim|1595}}.</ref> In 1518, the Kremer family moved back to Rupelmonde,<ref>From 1518 the Kremers are mentioned in the archived records of Rupelmonde.</ref> possibly motivated by the deteriorating conditions in Gangelt\u2014famine, plague and lawlessness.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 1, pp10\u201313.</ref> Mercator would have attended the local school in Rupelmonde from the age of seven, when he arrived from Gangelt, and there he would have been taught the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and Latin.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 2, pp14.</ref>\n\n===School at 's-Hertogenbosch 1526\u20131530===\n[[File:Portret Macropedius, Philips Galle-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Macropedius]]|thumb|upright=0.72|[[Macropedius]]]]\nAfter Hubert's death in 1526, Gisbert became Mercator's guardian. Hoping that Mercator might follow him into the priesthood, he sent the 15-year-old Geert to the famous school of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] at [['s-Hertogenbosch]]<ref>'s-Hertogenbosch (Duke's Forest) is Bois-le-Duc in French and Herzogenbusch in German, colloquially Le Bois or Den Bosch. In the sixteenth century it was the second largest town in the Low Countries.</ref> in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. The Brotherhood and the school had been founded by the charismatic [[Geert Groote]] who placed great emphasis on study of the Bible and, at the same time, expressed disapproval of the dogmas of the church, both facets of the new \"heresies\" of [[Martin Luther]] propounded only a few years earlier in 1517. Mercator would follow similar precepts later in life\u2014with problematic outcomes.\n\nDuring his time at the school the headmaster was [[Macropedius|Georgius Macropedius]], and under his guidance Geert would study the Bible, the [[trivium]] ([[Latin]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]]) and classics such as the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], the natural history of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and the geography of [[Ptolemy]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 3.</ref> All teaching at the school was in Latin and he would read, write and converse in Latin\u2014and give himself a new Latin name, Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus, Mercator being the Latin translation of Kremer, which means \"merchant\".

Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and it is quite possible that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities:<ref>The university statutes declared that contradiction of Aristotle was heresy {{harv|Crane|2003}}, p47</ref> fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp,<ref>There is uncertainty as to whether he was away in Antwerp for a single long period or whether he simply made a number of visits.

Later he would say, ''\"Since my youth, geography has been for me the primary subject of study.

Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon become adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.\n\n[[File:Gemma Frisius terrestrial globe (4).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|The terrestrial globe of Gemma Frisius<ref>Ten images of the terrestrial globe may be inspected on [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gemma_Frisius Wikipedia Commons].

The globe was a combined effort: Gemma researched the content, Van der Heyden engraved the geography and Mercator engraved the text, including the cartouche which exhibited his own name in public for the first time. The globe was finished in 1536 and its celestial counterpart appeared one year later. These widely admired globes were costly and their wide sales provided Mercator an income which, together with that from mathematical instruments and from teaching, allowed him to marry and establish a home. His marriage to Barbara Schellekens was in September 1536 and Arnold, the first of their six children, was born a year later.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 8, pp 86,91.</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Mercator on the cartographic scene would have been noted by the cognoscenti who purchased Gemma's globe\u2014the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide an important source of income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of [[Arras]], and Antoine's father, [[Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle|Nicholas Perrenot]], the Chancellor of Charles V.\n\nWorking alongside Gemma whilst they were producing the globes, Mercator would have witnessed the process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents to work in a burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a [[#palestine1537|map of the Holy Land]] which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 9.</ref>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Mercator Palestine 1537.jpeg|<small>Palestine (west at the top), 1537</small>\nFile:Mercator Palestine 1837 Red sea divided.jpg|<small>Detail: the Red Sea parted</small>\n</gallery>\nA year later, in 1538, he produced his first [[#world1538|map of the world]], usually referred to as ''Orbis Imago''.<ref>''Orbis Imago'' is a reference to the text in the legend (cartouche) at the top centre of the map.

All four works were received with acclaim<ref>{{harvtxt|Ghim|1595}} and {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 9.</ref> and they sold in large numbers. The dedications of three of these works witness Mercator's access to influential patrons: the Holy Land was dedicated to [[:nl:Franciscus van Cranevelt|Franciscus van Cranevelt]] who sat on the [[Great Council of Mechelen]], the map of Flanders was dedicated to the Emperor himself and the globe was dedicated to Nicholas Perrenot, the emperor's chief advisor. The dedicatee of the world map was more surprising: Johannes Drosius, a fellow student who, as an unorthodox priest, may well have been suspected of Lutheran heresy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 14, p149.</ref> Given that the symbolism of the Orbis Imago map also reflected a Lutheran view point, Mercator was exposing himself to criticism by the hardline theologians of Leuven .<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 10, p110.</ref>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:World Map on Double Cordiform Projection WDL6766.png|<small>World map, 1538</small>\nFile:Mercator map of Flanders 1539.tiff|<small>Flanders, 1540</small>\nFile:Erdglobus Mercator 1541 stitched.jpg|<small>Globe, 1541</small>\nFile:Mercator Globe 1541 SA.jpg|<small>Globe with rhumb lines</small>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Mercator title page of Literarum Latinarum.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The title page of Literarum Latinarum]]\nIn between these works he found time to write ''Literarum latinarum'', a small instruction manual on the [[italic script]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mercator|1540}}.</ref> The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522.<ref>{{harvtxt|Osley|1969}}, p28.</ref> It was much favoured by [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or [[Blackletter|gothic script]]). Mercator first applied the italic script to the globe of Gemma Frisius and thereafter to all his works, with ever-increasing elegance.

As a child, called Geert, he was surrounded by adults who were possibly followers of [[Geert Groote]], who placed meditation, contemplation and biblical study over ritual and liturgy\u2014and who also founded the school of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] at 's-Hertogenbosch. As an adult Mercator had family connections to [[Molanus]], a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also he was a close friend and correspondent of [[Philip Melanchthon]], one of the principal Lutheran reformers.<ref>Some of the correspondence of Mercator and [[Philip Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] has been preserved. See {{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}}</ref> Study of the Bible was something that was central to Mercator's life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days, doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the [[Faculty of Theology, Old University of Leuven|theologians at the university]], amongst whom were two senior figures of the [[Inquisition]], [[Jacobus Latomus]] and [[Ruard Tapper]]. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time:<ref>The persecution of heretics is discussed in {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 14, 9149.</ref>\n<blockquote>''It is no great matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or innocent, provided we terrify the people by these examples; which generally succeeds best, when persons eminent for learning, riches, nobility or high stations, are thus sacrificed.''<ref>{{harvtxt|Brandt|Chamberlayne|1740}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Kasteel Rupelmonde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Rupelmonde]] castle from ''[[Flandria Illustrata]]'' (1641)]] \nIt may well have been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p155.</ref> His name appeared on a list of 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p154.</ref>\n\nMercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde and imprisoned in the castle. He was accused of suspicious correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf,<ref>It is known that [[:nl:Pieter de Corte|Pieter de Corte]], an ex-rector of the university, wrote to [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Maria of Hungary]], governor of the province. See {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p156.</ref> but whether his friend Antoine Perrenot was helpful is unknown: Perrenot, as a bishop, would have to support the activities of the Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===Leuven 1543\u20131552===\nMercator never committed any of his prison experiences to paper; all he would say<ref name=durme>{{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}} p15. Letter to Antoine Perrenot</ref> was that he had suffered an \"unjust persecution\". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for [[globe]]s, [[compass]]es, [[astrolabe]] and [[astronomical rings]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Karrow|1993}} p383.</ref> They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed in the course of the Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 16, p167.</ref> He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed [[#europe1554|wall map of Europe]]<ref name=durme/> which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.\n\n[[File:John Dee Ashmolean.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[John Dee]]]]\nIn 1547 Mercator was visited by the young (nineteen year old) [[John Dee]] who, on completion of his undergraduate studies in Cambridge (1547), \"''went beyond the seas to speak and confer with some learned men''\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} p.165 ch.16, {{harvtxt|Dee|1592}}</ref> Dee and Mercator were both passionately interested in the same topics and they quickly established a close rapport which lasted throughout their lives. In 1548 Dee returned to Leuven (Louvain in Dee's text) and registered as a student: for three years he was constantly in Mercator's company.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dee|1568}}</ref> Apart from a possible short visit to Duisberg in 1562<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} p.197 ch.19</ref> the two men did not meet but they corresponded frequently and by good fortune a number of their letters are preserved.<ref>{{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}}</ref> Dee took maps, globes and astronomical instruments back to England and in return furnished Mercator with the latest English texts and new geographical knowledge arising from the English explorations of the world. Forty years later they were still co-operating, Dee using Mercator's maps to convince the English court to finance [[Martin Frobisher]]'s expeditions and Mercator still avidly seeking information of new territories.\n\nThe final success in Leuven was the 1551 celestial globe, the partner of his terrestrial globe of 1541. The records of the [[Plantin Press]] show that several hundred<ref>{{harvtxt|Imhof|2012}}</ref> pairs of globes were sold before the end of the century despite their high price\u2014in 1570 they sold at 25 carolus guilders for a pair.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martens|2012}}</ref> Celestial globes were a necessary adjunct to the intellectual life of rich patrons<ref>Note the globes in [[Hans Holbein the Younger#England, 1532\u20131540|Holbein's ambassadors]]</ref> and academics alike, for both astronomical and astrological studies, two subjects which were strongly entwined in the sixteenth century.

He never gave his reasons for the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic intolerance of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; there was to be a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 16, p173</ref> He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.<ref>Other refugees in Duisburg included Johannes Oeste (or Otho), Georg Cassander and Cornelius Wouters.

There is no precise definition of this term other than that it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy but at that time it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the [[County of Mark]] and the [[Duchy of Westphalia]].<ref name=\"Crane 2003\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, p194</ref>\n\n[[File:Baldewein astronomical clock 1561 Kassel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|[[Astronomical clock]] with rotating globes]]\nAround this time Mercator also received and executed a very special order for the Holy Roman Emperor a pair of small globes, the inner (\"fist-size\") Earth was made of wood and the outer celestial sphere was made of blown crystal glass engraved with diamond and inlaid with gold.<ref name=\"Ghim 1595\"/> He presented them to the Emperor in Brussels who awarded him the title ''Imperatoris domesticus'' (a member of the Imperial household).

He then shows how to calculate the position of the pole if the deviation is known at two known positions (Leuven and Corvo in the Azores): he finds that it must be at latitude 73\u00b02' and longitude 169\u00b034'. Remarkably, he also calculates the longitude difference between the pole and an arbitrary position: he had solved the longitude problem\u2014if his theory had been correct. Further comments on magnetism may be found in an earlier letter to Perrenot<ref>Mercator's [[:q:gerardus Mercator#perrenot|letter to Perrenot]] is available on wikiquote (along with an introduction by Harradon).</ref> and on the later world map.<ref>For magnetism on the world map see [[Mercator 1569 world map#Prime meridian and magnetic pole]].

His sons were now growing to manhood and he encouraged them to embark on his own profession. Arnold, the eldest, had produced his first map (of Iceland) in 1558 and would later take over the day-to-day running of Mercator's enterprises.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, p193</ref> Bartholemew, his second son, showed great academic promise and in 1562 (aged 22) he took over the teaching of his father's three-year-long lecture course\u2014after Mercator had taught it once only!

He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: \"''The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement as a result of his terrifying experiences.''\"<ref name=\"Ghim 1595\"/> Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map was published at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 21, p212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mercator Chronologia title page 1569.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Chronologia'' title page<ref>For the title see {{harvtxt|Mercator|1569}}. The text over the illustration is ''in via virtuti nulla est via,'' meaning ''no way is impassable to virtue'' (Ovid).</ref>]]\nThe trip to Lorraine in 1564 was a set back for his health but he soon recovered and embarked on his greatest project yet, a project which would extend far beyond his cartographic interests. The first element was the ''Chronologia'',<ref>{{harv|Mercator|1569}}</ref> a list of all significant events since the beginning of the world compiled from his literal reading of the Bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapters 23, pp223\u2013228. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 17 p185.</ref> Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to [[Julian day|Julian dates]] calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded. The time origin was fixed from the genealogies of the Bible as 3,965 years before the birth of Christ.<ref>See the [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.532025807x;view=1up;seq=262 page showing the birth of Christ].</ref> This huge volume (400 pages) was greeted with acclaim by scholars throughout Europe and Mercator himself considered it to be his greatest achievement up to that time. On the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] placed the work on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of [[Martin Luther]]. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.<ref>In the two online copies of the Chronologia listed under {{harvtxt|Mercator|1569}} only one includes [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00001232/images/index.html?id=00001232&groesser=&fip=qrsxdsydsdaswfsdreayaxdsydsdas&no=6&seite=226 the Luther reference] whilst in the other all mention of Luther [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.532025807x;view=1up;seq=454 has been erased].</ref>\n\nThe Chronologia developed into an even wider project, the ''Cosmographia'', a description of the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapters 22 and 23, pp217\u2013228. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 17 p185.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mercator 1569.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The 1569 Mercator map of the world [[Mercator 1569 world map|(Higher-resolution images)]]]]\nAs the Chronologia was going to press in 1569, Mercator also published what was to become his most famous map: [[Mercator 1569 world map|''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata'']] ('A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation').<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 24. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 21.</ref> As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the [[Age of Discovery]] the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a [[rhumb line]]) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars<ref>{{harvtxt|Gaspar|Leit\u00e3o|2016}}</ref> suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by [[Pedro Nunes]].<ref>{{harv|De Graeve|2012a}} has shown that Mercator's library contained a copy of the Theory of the Loxodrome by Pedro Nu\u00f1ez. This was published in 1566, three years before Mercator completed the map on the new projection.</ref> The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the [[Mercator projection]] became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. On the other hand, the projection is clearly unsuitable as a description of the land masses on account of its manifest distortion at high latitudes and its use is now deprecated: other projections are more suitable.<ref>See the discussion at [[Mercator projection#Uses|Mercator projection]].</ref> Although several hundred copies of the map were produced<ref name=sales /> it soon became out of date as new discoveries showed the extent of Mercator's inaccuracies (of poorly known lands) and speculations (for example, on the arctic and the southern continent).<ref>For further comments on the inaccuracies of the 1569 map see [[Mercator 1569 world map#Geography]]. For a discussion of the southern continent in particular see {{harvtxt|Zuber|2011}}.</ref>\n\nAround this time the [[marshal]]l of J\u00fclich approached Mercator and asked him to prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the [[John William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|crown prince Johannes]]. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the [[British Library]] under the title [[#europe1570|Atlas of Europe]] (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of Abraham Ortelius.<ref>A facsimile of the Mercator contributions in the Atlas of Europe has been published by {{harvtxt|Watelet|1997}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Africa North 1578, Gerardus Mercator (4154597-recto).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Mauretania in the 1578 Ptolemy]] \nApart from a revision of the map of Europe in 1572 there would be no more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia. The first of these was a new definitive version of [[#ptolemy|Ptolemy's maps]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 26.</ref> That he should wish to do so may seem strange given that, at the same time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend [[Abraham Ortelius]], had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years. It was accepted by scholars as the \"last word\", literally and metaphorically, in a chapter of geography which was closed for good.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 26. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerardus Mercator 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The [[Frans Hogenberg]] portrait of 1574, showing Mercator pointing at the [[North magnetic pole]].<ref>The text around and below the Hogenberg portrait translates as \"Great thanks are owed to the Pelusian (ie Ptolemaic) charts, and great thanks to you, Mercator, for having at last surpassed that ancient labour, and for having shown new stretches of the earth and sea, and the great, all-containing heavens.

In 1585 he issued a [[#atlas1585|collection of 51 maps]] covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, the time he had available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation<ref>For an (online) exegesis of the Harmonisation see {{Harvtxt|Jonge|1990}}.</ref> of the Gospels<ref>See {{harvtxt|Mercator|1592}}</ref> as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.\n\nIn 1589, at the age of 77, Mercator had a new lease of life. He took a new wife, Gertrude Vierlings, the wealthy widow of a former mayor of Duisburg (and at the same time he arranged the marriage of Rumold to her daughter). A [[#atlas1589|second collection of 22 maps]] was published covering Italy, Greece and the [[Balkans]]. This volume has a noteworthy preface for it includes mention of Atlas as a mythical king of [[Mauretania]]. \"I have set this man Atlas,\" explained Mercator, \"so notable for his erudition, humaneness, and wisdom as a model for my imitation.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 30, p308.</ref> A year later, Mercator had a stroke which left him greatly incapacitated. He struggled with the assistance of his family trying to complete the remaining maps, the ongoing theological publications and a new treatise on the Creation of the World. This last work, which he did succeed in finishing, was the climax of his life's activities, the work which, in his own opinion, surpassed all his other endeavours and provided a framework and rationale for the [[#atlas1595|complete atlas]]. It was also his last work in a literal sense for he died after two further strokes in 1594.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 31, p318</ref>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===Epitaph and legacy===\n[[File:Mercator epitaph pic.jpg|thumb|200px|Mercator epitaph in the church of St Salvator, Duisburg]]\nMercator was buried in the church of [[:de:Salvatorkirche (Duisburg)|St. Salvatore]] in Duisburg where a memorial was erected about fifty years after his death. The [[q:Gerardus Mercator#epitaph01|main text]] of the epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as ''the foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing the heaven from the inside and the Earth from the outside ... greatly respected for his wide erudition, particularly in theology, and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life.'' In addition, on the base of the memorial, there is an epigram:<ref>The text of Mercator's memorial is given in {{harvtxt|Raemdonck|1868}} p227 and a translation may be found at [[q:Gerardus Mercator#epitaph01|Wikisource]].</ref> \n<blockquote>\n''To the reader: whoever you are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies heavily on the buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden for a man who had the whole weight of her lands on his shoulders and carried her as an Atlas.''</blockquote>\nFollowing Mercator's death his family prepared the Atlas for publication\u2014in four months. It was hoped for source of the income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of the 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator's account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim's biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator's definition of a new meaning for the word \"Atlas\": ''Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura'' which may be translated as \"Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the fabric of the world and the figure of the fabrick'd,'' or, more colloquially, as ''Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Sullivan|2000}} pdf p2.</ref><ref>See {{harvtxt|Karrow|2000}} for a discussion of concept of the term atlas.</ref> Over the years Mercator's definition of ''atlas'' has become simply ''A collection of maps in a volume.''<ref>[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary].</ref>\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Mercator Atlas 1595 page 5 main frontispiece.jpg|<small>Mercator Atlas title page</small>\nFile:Mercator World Map.jpg|<small>The world map of Rumold Mercator</small>\nFile:Mercator Atlas 1595 page 107 Galliae.jpg|<small>The title page for the maps of Gaul</small>\n</gallery>\nThe atlas was not an immediate success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Epilogue, p320.</ref> Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Epilogue p323</ref>\n\nThe family was clearly in some financial difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1,000 books was sold at a public auction in [[Leiden]] (Netherlands). The only known copy of the sale catalogue<ref>{{harvtxt|Basson|1604}}</ref> perished in the war but fortunately a manuscript copy had been made by Van Raemdonck in 1891 and this was rediscovered in 1987.<ref>{{harvtxt|Penneman|1994}}</ref> Of the titles identified there are 193 on theology (both Catholic and Lutheran), 217 on history and geography, 202 on mathematics (in its widest sense), 32 on medicine and over 100 simply classified (by Basson) as rare books.

Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son [[Henricus Hondius II|Henricus]], and son-in-law [[Jan Janssonius|Johannes Janssonius]]) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor,<ref>The Atlas Minor may be viewed online at the [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11062214_00005.html Bavarian State Library]</ref> which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the atlas became out-of-date and by the middle of the seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as [[Joan Blaeu]] and [[Frederik de Wit]] took over.\n\n[[File:Bruxels April 2012-3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Statue of Mercator, Jardin du Petit Sablon, Brussels]]\nMercator's editions of Ptolemy and his theological writings were in print for many years after the demise of the atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Epilogue p325.</ref> His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] who first clarified the method in his book ''Certaine Errors'' (1599)\u2014the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on [[Equirectangular projection|conventional charts]] corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout the first half of the seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes.<ref>The distortions of Mercator's map are discussed in the article on the [[Mercator projection]].</ref> Recently Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world<ref>See the critique of the Mercator and other projections in [[Gall\u2013Peters projection]]</ref> but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany cities have a statue of Mercator.<ref>: Statues in [[:File:Gerardus Mercator statue.jpg|Rupelmonde]], [[:File:Duisburg Mercatorbrunnen 2.jpg|Duisburg]], [[:File:Square du Petit Sablon - Gerard Mercator.JPG|Brussels]], [[:File:Mercator in Leuven.JPG|Louvain]].</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His name has been attached to ships,<ref>The [[Mercator (ship)|Mercator]] was a training vessel for the Belgian navy.

This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who had spent much of his working life in [[London]]. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.<ref>Projections used in the 1585 atlas: see{{harvtxt|Keuning|1947}}</ref>\n\n::Less than half the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not supporting it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans for the rest of the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, ''De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber'' (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.\n\n::The second part of the Atlas contains the maps but each section has its own title page, dedication and preface, and every country is succinctly supplemented by text describing a mixture of history, royal genealogy, ecclesiastical hierarchies, list of universities and occasionally facets of contemporary economy.

He is most renowned for creating the [[Mercator 1569 world map|1569 world map]] based on a new [[Mercator projection|projection]] which represented sailing courses of constant bearing ([[rhumb line]]s) as straight lines\u2014an innovation that is still employed in nautical charts.\n\nMercator was one of the pioneers of cartography and is widely considered the most notable figure of the school in [[History of cartography|its golden age]] (approximately 1570s\u20131670s). In his own day, he was a notable as maker of globes and scientific instruments. In addition, he had interests in theology, philosophy, history, mathematics and [[geomagnetism]]. He was also an accomplished [[engraving|engraver]] and [[Calligraphy|calligrapher]].\nUnlike other great scholars of the age he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from his vast correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but in the second half of his life, he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his [[Atlas]] of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in reference to a book of maps. However, Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (''Cosmologia'') on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of the [[Atlas (mythology)|Titan Atlas]], \"King of Mauretania\", whom he considered to be the first great geographer.\n\nA large part of Mercator's income came from sales of his terrestrial and celestial globes. For sixty years they were considered the finest in the world, and were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving the manufacture of the spheres, printing the [[Globe#Manufacture|gores]], building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for his scientific instruments, particularly his [[astrolabe]]s and [[astronomical rings]] used to study the [[geometry]] of [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]].\n\nMercator wrote on geography, philosophy, [[chronology]] and theology. All of the wall maps were engraved with copious text on the region concerned. As an example the [[Mercator 1569 world map|famous world map of 1569]] is inscribed with over five thousand words in [[Mercator 1569 world map#Summary of the legends|fifteen legends]]. The 1595 Atlas has about 120 pages of maps and illustrated title pages but a greater number of pages are devoted to his account of the creation of the [[universe]] and descriptions of all the countries portrayed. His table of chronology ran to some 400 pages fixing the dates (from the time of creation) of earthly [[Dynasty|dynasties]], major political and military events, [[volcano|volcanic]] [[eruption]]s, [[earthquakes]] and [[eclipse]]s. He also wrote on the [[gospels]] and the [[old testament]].\n\nMercator was a devout [[Christians|Christian]] born into a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family at a time when [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Protestantism]] was gaining ground. He never declared himself as a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] but he was clearly sympathetic and he was accused of heresy by Catholic authorities; after six months in prison he was released unscathed. This period of persecution is probably the major factor in his move from Catholic [[Leuven]] (Louvain) to a more tolerant [[Duisburg]], in the Holy Roman Empire, where he lived for the last thirty years of his life. Walter Ghim, Mercator's friend and first biographer, describes him as sober in his behaviour, yet cheerful and witty in company, and never more happy than in debate with other scholars. Above all he was pious and studious until his dying days.<ref>The full text of Ghim's biography is translated in {{harvtxt|Sullivan|2000}} pages 7\u201324 of the atlas text, pdf pages 77\u201394.</ref>\n\n==Mercator's life==\n===Early years===\n[[File:Dorpsgezicht Rupelmonde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Rupelmonde]] from ''[[Flandria illustrata]]'', 1641]]\nGerardus Mercator was born Geert or Gerard (de) Kremer (or Cremer), the seventh child of Hubert (de) Kremer and his wife Emerance in [[Rupelmonde]], Flanders, a small village to the southwest of [[Antwerp]], all of which lied in the fiefdom of [[Habsburg Netherlands]]. His parents came from [[Gangelt]] in the Holy Roman [[Duchy of J\u00fclich]] (present-day Germany). At the time of the birth they were visiting Hubert's brother (or uncle<ref>There is some doubt about the relationship of Hubert and Gisbert. Gisbert was either the brother or uncle of Hubert.</ref>) Gisbert de Kremer.<ref>People in both locations at the time spoke an [[Modern Dutch|Early Modern Dutch dialects]] and there probably was close to no language barrier.</ref> Hubert was a poor artisan, a shoemaker by trade, but Gisbert, a priest, was a man of some importance in the community. Their stay in Rupelmonde was brief and within six months they returned to Gangelt and there Mercator spent his earliest childhood until the age of six.<ref>The evidence for Mercator's place of birth is in his letter to Wollfgang Haller ({{harvtxt|Averdunk|1914|}}, Letter26, and {{harvtxt|Durme|1959}}, Letter 152) and in the biography by his personal friend {{harvtxt|Ghim|1595}}.</ref> In 1518, the Kremer family moved back to Rupelmonde,<ref>From 1518 the Kremers are mentioned in the archived records of Rupelmonde.</ref> possibly motivated by the deteriorating conditions in Gangelt\u2014famine, plague and lawlessness.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 1, pp10\u201313.</ref> Mercator would have attended the local school in Rupelmonde from the age of seven, when he arrived from Gangelt, and there he would have been taught the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic and Latin.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 2, pp14.</ref>\n\n===School at 's-Hertogenbosch 1526\u20131530===\n[[File:Portret Macropedius, Philips Galle-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Macropedius]]|thumb|upright=0.72|[[Macropedius]]]]\nAfter Hubert's death in 1526, Gisbert became Mercator's guardian. Hoping that Mercator might follow him into the priesthood, he sent the 15-year-old Geert to the famous school of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] at [['s-Hertogenbosch]]<ref>'s-Hertogenbosch (Duke's Forest) is Bois-le-Duc in French and Herzogenbusch in German, colloquially Le Bois or Den Bosch. In the sixteenth century it was the second largest town in the Low Countries.</ref> in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. The Brotherhood and the school had been founded by the charismatic [[Geert Groote]] who placed great emphasis on study of the Bible and, at the same time, expressed disapproval of the dogmas of the church, both facets of the new \"heresies\" of [[Martin Luther]] propounded only a few years earlier in 1517. Mercator would follow similar precepts later in life\u2014with problematic outcomes.\n\nDuring his time at the school the headmaster was [[Macropedius|Georgius Macropedius]], and under his guidance Geert would study the Bible, the [[trivium]] ([[Latin]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]]) and classics such as the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], the natural history of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] and the geography of [[Ptolemy]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 3.</ref> All teaching at the school was in Latin and he would read, write and converse in Latin\u2014and give himself a new Latin name, Gerardus Mercator Rupelmundanus, Mercator being the Latin translation of Kremer, which means \"merchant\". The Brethren were renowned for their [[scriptorium]]<ref>A [[scriptorium]] was where manuscripts were copied by hand. In 1512 such endeavours had not been completely overtaken by printing.</ref> and here Mercator might have encountered the [[italic script]] which he employed in his later work. The brethren were also renowned for their thoroughness and discipline, well attested by [[Erasmus]] who had attended the school forty years before Mercator.<ref>The letters of Erasmus quoted in {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, p33.</ref>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===University of Leuven 1530\u20131532===\nFrom a famous school, Mercator moved to the famous [[Old University of Leuven|University of Leuven]], where his full Latin name appears in the matriculation records for 1530.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 4.</ref> He lived in one of the teaching colleges, the Castle College, and, although he was classified as a pauper, he rubbed shoulders with richer students, amongst whom were the anatomist [[Andreas Vesalius]], the statesman [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Antoine Perrenot]], and the theologian [[George Cassander]], all destined to fame and all lifelong friends of Mercator.\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Vesalius Portrait pg xii - c.png|<small>[[Andreas Vesalius]]</small>\nBemberg fondation Toulouse - Portrait of Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle - Frans Floris inv.1019.jpg|<small>[[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle|Antoine Perrenot]]</small>\nFile:Georg-Cassander.jpg|alt3=[[George Cassander]]|<small>[[George Cassander]]</small>\n</gallery>\nThe general first degree (for [[Magister degree|Magister]]) centred on the teaching of philosophy, theology and Greek under the conservative [[Scholasticism]] which gave prime place to the authority of [[Aristotle]].<ref>The university statutes stated explicitly that to disbelieve the teaching of Aristotle was heretical and would be punished by expulsion.

Mercator graduated Magister in 1532.<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=119164|title=Gerardus (Gerard de Kremer) Mercator}}</ref>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===Antwerp 1532\u20131534===\nThe normal progress for an able Magister was to go on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, [[Canon Law]] and [[Roman Law]]. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and it is quite possible that he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities:<ref>The university statutes declared that contradiction of Aristotle was heresy {{harv|Crane|2003}}, p47</ref> fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print.

These encounters may well have provided the stimulus to put aside his problems with theology and commit himself to geography. Later he would say, ''\"Since my youth, geography has been for me the primary subject of study.

Gemma had designed some of the mathematical instruments used in these studies and Mercator soon become adept in the skills of their manufacture: practical skills of working in brass, mathematical skills for calculation of scales and engraving skills to produce the finished work.\n\n[[File:Gemma Frisius terrestrial globe (4).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.72|The terrestrial globe of Gemma Frisius<ref>Ten images of the terrestrial globe may be inspected on [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Gemma_Frisius Wikipedia Commons]. The fifth image shows the inscription listing the joint makers to the left of the cartouche containing the dedication to Charles V.</ref>]]Gemma and Gaspar Van der Heyden had completed a terrestrial [[globe]] in 1529 but by 1535 they were planning a new globe embodying the latest geographical discoveries.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapters 7 and 8.</ref> The [[Gore (segment)|gores]] were to be engraved on copper, instead of wood, and the text was to be in an elegant italic script instead of the heavy Roman lettering of the early globes. The globe was a combined effort: Gemma researched the content, Van der Heyden engraved the geography and Mercator engraved the text, including the cartouche which exhibited his own name in public for the first time. The globe was finished in 1536 and its celestial counterpart appeared one year later. These widely admired globes were costly and their wide sales provided Mercator an income which, together with that from mathematical instruments and from teaching, allowed him to marry and establish a home. His marriage to Barbara Schellekens was in September 1536 and Arnold, the first of their six children, was born a year later.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 8, pp 86,91.</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Mercator on the cartographic scene would have been noted by the cognoscenti who purchased Gemma's globe\u2014the professors, rich merchants, prelates, aristocrats and courtiers of the emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] at nearby Brussels. The commissions and patronage of such wealthy individuals would provide an important source of income throughout his life. His connection with this world of privilege was facilitated by his fellow student Antoine Perrenot, soon to be appointed Bishop of [[Arras]], and Antoine's father, [[Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle|Nicholas Perrenot]], the Chancellor of Charles V.\n\nWorking alongside Gemma whilst they were producing the globes, Mercator would have witnessed the process of progressing geography: obtaining previous maps, comparing and collating their content, studying geographical texts and seeking new information from correspondents, merchants, pilgrims, travellers and seamen. He put his newly learned talents to work in a burst of productivity. In 1537, aged only 25, he established his reputation with a [[#palestine1537|map of the Holy Land]] which was researched, engraved, printed and partly published by himself.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 9.</ref>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Mercator Palestine 1537.jpeg|<small>Palestine (west at the top), 1537</small>\nFile:Mercator Palestine 1837 Red sea divided.jpg|<small>Detail: the Red Sea parted</small>\n</gallery>\nA year later, in 1538, he produced his first [[#world1538|map of the world]], usually referred to as ''Orbis Imago''.<ref>''Orbis Imago'' is a reference to the text in the legend (cartouche) at the top centre of the map. The first sentence contains the phrase ''hic vides orbis imaginem'' which translates as ''this image of the globe that you see''. [[q:Gerardus Mercator#orbisimago|Text]]</ref> In 1539/40 he made a [[#flanders1540|map of Flanders]] and in 1541 a terrestrial globe. All four works were received with acclaim<ref>{{harvtxt|Ghim|1595}} and {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 9.</ref> and they sold in large numbers. The dedications of three of these works witness Mercator's access to influential patrons: the Holy Land was dedicated to [[:nl:Franciscus van Cranevelt|Franciscus van Cranevelt]] who sat on the [[Great Council of Mechelen]], the map of Flanders was dedicated to the Emperor himself and the globe was dedicated to Nicholas Perrenot, the emperor's chief advisor. The dedicatee of the world map was more surprising: Johannes Drosius, a fellow student who, as an unorthodox priest, may well have been suspected of Lutheran heresy.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 14, p149.</ref> Given that the symbolism of the Orbis Imago map also reflected a Lutheran view point, Mercator was exposing himself to criticism by the hardline theologians of Leuven .<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 10, p110.</ref>\n<gallery perrow=\"2\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:World Map on Double Cordiform Projection WDL6766.png|<small>World map, 1538</small>\nFile:Mercator map of Flanders 1539.tiff|<small>Flanders, 1540</small>\nFile:Erdglobus Mercator 1541 stitched.jpg|<small>Globe, 1541</small>\nFile:Mercator Globe 1541 SA.jpg|<small>Globe with rhumb lines</small>\n</gallery>\n[[File:Mercator title page of Literarum Latinarum.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The title page of Literarum Latinarum]]\nIn between these works he found time to write ''Literarum latinarum'', a small instruction manual on the [[italic script]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Mercator|1540}}.</ref> The italic script (or chancery cursive) reached the Low Countries from Italy at the beginning of the sixteenth century and it is recorded as a form of typescript in Leuven in 1522.<ref>{{harvtxt|Osley|1969}}, p28.</ref> It was much favoured by [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars who enjoyed its elegance and clarity as well as the rapid fluency that could be attained with practice, but it was not employed for formal purposes such as globes, maps and scientific instruments (which typically used Roman capitals or [[Blackletter|gothic script]]).

As a child, called Geert, he was surrounded by adults who were possibly followers of [[Geert Groote]], who placed meditation, contemplation and biblical study over ritual and liturgy\u2014and who also founded the school of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] at 's-Hertogenbosch. As an adult Mercator had family connections to [[Molanus]], a religious reformer who would later have to flee Leuven. Also he was a close friend and correspondent of [[Philip Melanchthon]], one of the principal Lutheran reformers.<ref>Some of the correspondence of Mercator and [[Philip Melanchthon|Melanchthon]] has been preserved. See {{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}}</ref> Study of the Bible was something that was central to Mercator's life and it was the cause of the early philosophical doubts that caused him so much trouble during his student days, doubts which some of his teachers would have considered to be tantamount to heresy. His visits to the free thinking Franciscans in Mechelen may have attracted the attention of the [[Faculty of Theology, Old University of Leuven|theologians at the university]], amongst whom were two senior figures of the [[Inquisition]], [[Jacobus Latomus]] and [[Ruard Tapper]]. The words of the latter on the death of heretics convey the atmosphere of that time:<ref>The persecution of heretics is discussed in {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 14, 9149.</ref>\n<blockquote>''It is no great matter whether those that die on this account be guilty or innocent, provided we terrify the people by these examples; which generally succeeds best, when persons eminent for learning, riches, nobility or high stations, are thus sacrificed.''<ref>{{harvtxt|Brandt|Chamberlayne|1740}}</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Kasteel Rupelmonde.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Rupelmonde]] castle from ''[[Flandria Illustrata]]'' (1641)]] \nIt may well have been these Inquisitors who, in 1543, decided that Mercator was eminent enough to be sacrificed.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p155.</ref> His name appeared on a list of 52 Lutheran heretics which included an architect, a sculptor, a former rector of the university, a monk, three priests and many others. All were arrested except Mercator who had left Leuven for Rupelmonde on business concerning the estate of his recently deceased uncle Gisbert. That made matters worse for he was now classified as a fugitive who, by fleeing arrest, had proved his own guilt.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p154.</ref>\n\nMercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde and imprisoned in the castle. He was accused of suspicious correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf,<ref>It is known that [[:nl:Pieter de Corte|Pieter de Corte]], an ex-rector of the university, wrote to [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Queen Maria of Hungary]], governor of the province. See {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 15, p156.</ref> but whether his friend Antoine Perrenot was helpful is unknown: Perrenot, as a bishop, would have to support the activities of the Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===Leuven 1543\u20131552===\nMercator never committed any of his prison experiences to paper; all he would say<ref name=durme>{{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}} p15. Letter to Antoine Perrenot</ref> was that he had suffered an \"unjust persecution\". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he turned back to his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for [[globe]]s, [[compass]]es, [[astrolabe]] and [[astronomical rings]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Karrow|1993}} p383.</ref> They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed in the course of the Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 16, p167.</ref> He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed [[#europe1554|wall map of Europe]]<ref name=durme/> which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.\n\n[[File:John Dee Ashmolean.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.80|[[John Dee]]]]\nIn 1547 Mercator was visited by the young (nineteen year old) [[John Dee]] who, on completion of his undergraduate studies in Cambridge (1547), \"''went beyond the seas to speak and confer with some learned men''\".<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} p.165 ch.16, {{harvtxt|Dee|1592}}</ref> Dee and Mercator were both passionately interested in the same topics and they quickly established a close rapport which lasted throughout their lives. In 1548 Dee returned to Leuven (Louvain in Dee's text) and registered as a student: for three years he was constantly in Mercator's company.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dee|1568}}</ref> Apart from a possible short visit to Duisberg in 1562<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} p.197 ch.19</ref> the two men did not meet but they corresponded frequently and by good fortune a number of their letters are preserved.<ref>{{harvtxt|Van Durme|1959}}</ref> Dee took maps, globes and astronomical instruments back to England and in return furnished Mercator with the latest English texts and new geographical knowledge arising from the English explorations of the world. Forty years later they were still co-operating, Dee using Mercator's maps to convince the English court to finance [[Martin Frobisher]]'s expeditions and Mercator still avidly seeking information of new territories.\n\nThe final success in Leuven was the 1551 celestial globe, the partner of his terrestrial globe of 1541. The records of the [[Plantin Press]] show that several hundred<ref>{{harvtxt|Imhof|2012}}</ref> pairs of globes were sold before the end of the century despite their high price\u2014in 1570 they sold at 25 carolus guilders for a pair.<ref>{{harvtxt|Martens|2012}}</ref> Celestial globes were a necessary adjunct to the intellectual life of rich patrons<ref>Note the globes in [[Hans Holbein the Younger#England, 1532\u20131540|Holbein's ambassadors]]</ref> and academics alike, for both astronomical and astrological studies, two subjects which were strongly entwined in the sixteenth century.

He never gave his reasons for the move but several factors may have been involved: not having been born in Brabant he could never be a full citizen of Leuven; Catholic intolerance of religious dissidents in the Low Countries was becoming ever more aggressive and a man suspected of heresy once would never be trusted; the Erasmian constitution and the religious tolerance of Cleves must have appeared attractive; there was to be a new university in Duisburg and teachers would be required.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 16, p173</ref> He was not alone; over the years to come many more would flee from the oppressive Catholicism of Brabant and Flanders to tolerant cities such as Duisburg.<ref>Other refugees in Duisburg included Johannes Oeste (or Otho), Georg Cassander and Cornelius Wouters. See {{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, p191</ref>\n\nThe peaceful town of Duisburg, untroubled by political and religious unrest, was the perfect place for the flowering of his talent. Mercator quickly established himself as a man of standing in the town: an intellectual of note, a publisher of maps, and a maker of instruments and globes.<ref name=sales>Mercator's workshops produced items such as globes in a steady stream. The records of the [[Plantin Press]] show that they received 1150 maps and globes from Mercator over a thirty year period ({{harvnb|Clair|1971}};  {{harvnb|Voets|1962|pp=171\u2013232}}; {{harvnb|Imhof|2012|pp=103\u2013114}}): in particular they sold 185 copies of the 1569 world map in three years. At the same time Mercator was selling items at the regular international [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] and selling direct from his own workshop.</ref> Mercator never accepted the privileges and voting rights of a [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] for they came with military responsibilities which conflicted with his pacifist and neutral stance. Nevertheless, he was on good terms with the wealthier citizens and a close friend of Walter Ghim, the twelve times mayor and Mercator's future biographer.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 17, p178.</ref>\n\nMercator was welcomed by Duke Wilhelm who appointed him as court [[Cosmography|cosmographer]]. There is no precise definition of this term other than that it certainly comprehends the disciplines of geography and astronomy but at that time it would also include astrology and chronology (as a history of the world from the creation). All of these were among Mercator's accomplishments but his patron's first call on his services was as a mundane surveyor of the disputed boundary between the Duke's territory of the [[County of Mark]] and the [[Duchy of Westphalia]].<ref name=\"Crane 2003\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, p194</ref>\n\n[[File:Baldewein astronomical clock 1561 Kassel.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|right|[[Astronomical clock]] with rotating globes]]\nAround this time Mercator also received and executed a very special order for the Holy Roman Emperor a pair of small globes, the inner (\"fist-size\") Earth was made of wood and the outer celestial sphere was made of blown crystal glass engraved with diamond and inlaid with gold.<ref name=\"Ghim 1595\"/> He presented them to the Emperor in Brussels who awarded him the title ''Imperatoris domesticus'' (a member of the Imperial household). The globes are lost but Mercator describes them in [[q:Gerardus Mercator#melanchthon01|a letter]] to [[Philip Melanchthon]]<ref>Melanchthon is a significant correspondent of Mercator since he was one of the founders of Lutheranism.</ref> in which he declares that the globes were rotated on the top of an [[astronomical clock]] made for Charles V by [[Juanelo Turriano]] (Janellus).<ref>A speculative [http://www.wilhelmkruecken.de/LebenWerk/LW_DuisA.htm#Paradigmenwechsel model of the double globe] was constructed by Wilhelm Kruecken for the Duisburg commemorations of the 400th anniversary of Mercator's death.</ref> The clock was provided with eight dials which showed the positions of the moon, stars and planets.

He then shows how to calculate the position of the pole if the deviation is known at two known positions (Leuven and Corvo in the Azores): he finds that it must be at latitude 73\u00b02' and longitude 169\u00b034'. Remarkably, he also calculates the longitude difference between the pole and an arbitrary position: he had solved the longitude problem\u2014if his theory had been correct. Further comments on magnetism may be found in an earlier letter to Perrenot<ref>Mercator's [[:q:gerardus Mercator#perrenot|letter to Perrenot]] is available on wikiquote (along with an introduction by Harradon).</ref> and on the later world map.<ref>For magnetism on the world map see [[Mercator 1569 world map#Prime meridian and magnetic pole]].

It was another 90 years before Duisburg had its university.<ref>{{harvtxt|Taylor|2004|p=139}}</ref> On the other hand, no papal permit was required to establish the [[:de:Akademisches Gymnasium|Akademisches Gymnasium]] where, in 1559 Mercator was invited to teach mathematics with cosmography.<ref name=\"Crane 2003\"/> One year later, in 1560, he secured the appointment of his friend Jan Vermeulen ([[Molanus]]) as rector and then blessed Vermeulen's marriage to his daughter Emerantia. His sons were now growing to manhood and he encouraged them to embark on his own profession. Arnold, the eldest, had produced his first map (of Iceland) in 1558 and would later take over the day-to-day running of Mercator's enterprises.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, p193</ref> Bartholemew, his second son, showed great academic promise and in 1562 (aged 22) he took over the teaching of his father's three-year-long lecture course\u2014after Mercator had taught it once only! Much to Mercator's grief, Bartholemew died young, in 1568 (aged 28).<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 22, p222</ref> [[Rumold Mercator|Rumold]], the third son, would spend a large part of his life in London's publishing houses providing for Mercator a vital link to the new discoveries of the Elizabethan age.

The circumstances were unusual. It is the only map without a dedicatee and in the text engraved on the map he pointedly denies responsibility for the map's authorship and claims that he is merely engraving and printing it for a \"''very good friend''\". The identity of neither the author nor the friend has been established but it has been suggested that the map was created by a Scottish Catholic priest called John Elder who smuggled it to French clergy known to Antoine Perrenot, Mercator's friend.<ref>{{harv|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 19, pp189\u2013205.</ref><ref>{{harv|Taylor|2004}}.

It was invaluable as an accurate guide for the planned Catholic invasion of England by Phillip II of Spain.\n\n[[File:Atlas Cosmographicae (Mercator) 129.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Lotharingia (Lorraine) as it appeared in the 1595 atlas]]\nAs soon as the map of Britain was published Mercator was invited to undertake the surveying and [[#lorraine1564|mapping of Lorraine]] ([[Lotharingia]]). This was a new venture for him in the sense that never before had he collected the raw data for a new regional map. He was then 52, already an old man by the norms of that century, and he may well have had reservations about the undertaking. Accompanied by his son Bartholemew, Mercator meticulously triangulated his way around the forests, hills and steep sided valleys of Lorraine, difficult terrain as different from the Low Countries as anything could be. He never committed anything to paper but he may have confided in his friend Ghim who would later write: \"''The journey through Lorraine gravely imperiled his life and so weakened him that he came very near to a serious breakdown and mental derangement as a result of his terrifying experiences.''\"<ref name=\"Ghim 1595\"/> Mercator returned home to convalesce, leaving Bartholemew to complete the survey. No map was published at the time but Mercator did provide a single drawn copy for the Duke and later he would incorporate this map into his atlas.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 21, p212.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mercator Chronologia title page 1569.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Chronologia'' title page<ref>For the title see {{harvtxt|Mercator|1569}}.

The first element was the ''Chronologia'',<ref>{{harv|Mercator|1569}}</ref> a list of all significant events since the beginning of the world compiled from his literal reading of the Bible and no less than 123 other authors of genealogies and histories of every empire that had ever existed.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapters 23, pp223\u2013228. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 17 p185.</ref> Mercator was the first to link historical dates of solar and lunar eclipses to [[Julian day|Julian dates]] calculated mathematically from his knowledge of the motions of the sun, moon and Earth. He then fixed the dates of other events in Babylonian, Greek, Hebrew and Roman calendars relative to the eclipses that they recorded.

On the other hand, the [[Catholic Church]] placed the work on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] (List of Prohibited Books) because Mercator included the deeds of [[Martin Luther]]. Had he published such a work in Louvain he would again be laying himself open to charges of heresy.<ref>In the two online copies of the Chronologia listed under {{harvtxt|Mercator|1569}} only one includes [http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00001232/images/index.html?id=00001232&groesser=&fip=qrsxdsydsdaswfsdreayaxdsydsdas&no=6&seite=226 the Luther reference] whilst in the other all mention of Luther [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=ucm.532025807x;view=1up;seq=454 has been erased].</ref>\n\nThe Chronologia developed into an even wider project, the ''Cosmographia'', a description of the whole Universe. Mercator's outline was (1) the creation of the world; (2) the description of the heavens (astronomy and astrology); (3) the description of the earth comprising modern geography, the geography of Ptolemy and the geography of the ancients; (4) genealogy and history of the states; and (5) chronology. Of these the chronology had already been accomplished, the account of the creation and the modern maps would appear in the atlas of 1595, his edition of Ptolemy appeared in 1578 but the ancient geography and the description of the heavens never appeared.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapters 22 and 23, pp217\u2013228. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 17 p185.</ref>\n\n[[File:Mercator 1569.png|thumb|upright=1.5|left|The 1569 Mercator map of the world [[Mercator 1569 world map|(Higher-resolution images)]]]]\nAs the Chronologia was going to press in 1569, Mercator also published what was to become his most famous map: [[Mercator 1569 world map|''Nova et Aucta Orbis Terrae Descriptio ad Usum Navigantium Emendate Accommodata'']] ('A new and more complete representation of the terrestrial globe properly adapted for use in navigation').<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 24. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 21.</ref> As mariners had started to explore the oceans in the [[Age of Discovery]] the problem of accurate navigation had become more pressing. Their locations could be a hundred miles out after a long voyage because a course of constant direction at sea (a [[rhumb line]]) did not correspond to a straight line on their chart. Mercator's solution was to make the scale of his chart increase with latitude in a very special way such that the rhumb lines became straight lines on his new world map. Exactly how he arrived at the required solution is not recorded in any of his own written works but modern scholars<ref>{{harvtxt|Gaspar|Leit\u00e3o|2016}}</ref> suggest that he used the tables of rhumbs devised by [[Pedro Nunes]].<ref>{{harv|De Graeve|2012a}} has shown that Mercator's library contained a copy of the Theory of the Loxodrome by Pedro Nu\u00f1ez. This was published in 1566, three years before Mercator completed the map on the new projection.</ref> The large size of what was a wall map meant that it did not find favour for use on board ship but, within a hundred years of its creation, the [[Mercator projection]] became the standard for marine charts throughout the world and continues to be so used to the present day. On the other hand, the projection is clearly unsuitable as a description of the land masses on account of its manifest distortion at high latitudes and its use is now deprecated: other projections are more suitable.<ref>See the discussion at [[Mercator projection#Uses|Mercator projection]].</ref> Although several hundred copies of the map were produced<ref name=sales /> it soon became out of date as new discoveries showed the extent of Mercator's inaccuracies (of poorly known lands) and speculations (for example, on the arctic and the southern continent).<ref>For further comments on the inaccuracies of the 1569 map see [[Mercator 1569 world map#Geography]]. For a discussion of the southern continent in particular see {{harvtxt|Zuber|2011}}.</ref>\n\nAround this time the [[marshal]]l of J\u00fclich approached Mercator and asked him to prepare a set of European regional maps which would serve for a grand tour by his patron's son, the [[John William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|crown prince Johannes]]. This remarkable collection has been preserved and is now held in the [[British Library]] under the title [[#europe1570|Atlas of Europe]] (although Mercator never used such a title). Many of the pages were assembled from dissected Mercator maps and in addition there are thirty maps from the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of Abraham Ortelius.<ref>A facsimile of the Mercator contributions in the Atlas of Europe has been published by {{harvtxt|Watelet|1997}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Africa North 1578, Gerardus Mercator (4154597-recto).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|right|Mauretania in the 1578 Ptolemy]] \nApart from a revision of the map of Europe in 1572 there would be no more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia. The first of these was a new definitive version of [[#ptolemy|Ptolemy's maps]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 26.</ref> That he should wish to do so may seem strange given that, at the same time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend [[Abraham Ortelius]], had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years. It was accepted by scholars as the \"last word\", literally and metaphorically, in a chapter of geography which was closed for good.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Chapter 26. {{harvtxt|Taylor|2004}}, Chapter 19.</ref>\n\n[[File:Gerardus Mercator 3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|left|The [[Frans Hogenberg]] portrait of 1574, showing Mercator pointing at the [[North magnetic pole]].<ref>The text around and below the Hogenberg portrait translates as \"Great thanks are owed to the Pelusian (ie Ptolemaic) charts, and great thanks to you, Mercator, for having at last surpassed that ancient labour, and for having shown new stretches of the earth and sea, and the great, all-containing heavens.

In 1585 he issued a [[#atlas1585|collection of 51 maps]] covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order had not the misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, the time he had available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation<ref>For an (online) exegesis of the Harmonisation see {{Harvtxt|Jonge|1990}}.</ref> of the Gospels<ref>See {{harvtxt|Mercator|1592}}</ref> as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.\n\nIn 1589, at the age of 77, Mercator had a new lease of life. He took a new wife, Gertrude Vierlings, the wealthy widow of a former mayor of Duisburg (and at the same time he arranged the marriage of Rumold to her daughter). A [[#atlas1589|second collection of 22 maps]] was published covering Italy, Greece and the [[Balkans]]. This volume has a noteworthy preface for it includes mention of Atlas as a mythical king of [[Mauretania]]. \"I have set this man Atlas,\" explained Mercator, \"so notable for his erudition, humaneness, and wisdom as a model for my imitation.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 30, p308.</ref> A year later, Mercator had a stroke which left him greatly incapacitated. He struggled with the assistance of his family trying to complete the remaining maps, the ongoing theological publications and a new treatise on the Creation of the World. This last work, which he did succeed in finishing, was the climax of his life's activities, the work which, in his own opinion, surpassed all his other endeavours and provided a framework and rationale for the [[#atlas1595|complete atlas]]. It was also his last work in a literal sense for he died after two further strokes in 1594.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Chapter 31, p318</ref>{{Back to contents}}\n\n===Epitaph and legacy===\n[[File:Mercator epitaph pic.jpg|thumb|200px|Mercator epitaph in the church of St Salvator, Duisburg]]\nMercator was buried in the church of [[:de:Salvatorkirche (Duisburg)|St. Salvatore]] in Duisburg where a memorial was erected about fifty years after his death. The [[q:Gerardus Mercator#epitaph01|main text]] of the epitaph is a summary of his life lauding him as ''the foremost mathematician of his time who crafted artistic and accurate globes showing the heaven from the inside and the Earth from the outside ... greatly respected for his wide erudition, particularly in theology, and famous on account of his piety and respectability in life.'' In addition, on the base of the memorial, there is an epigram:<ref>The text of Mercator's memorial is given in {{harvtxt|Raemdonck|1868}} p227 and a translation may be found at [[q:Gerardus Mercator#epitaph01|Wikisource]].</ref> \n<blockquote>\n''To the reader: whoever you are, your fears that this small clod of earth lies heavily on the buried Mercator are groundless; the whole Earth is no burden for a man who had the whole weight of her lands on his shoulders and carried her as an Atlas.''</blockquote>\nFollowing Mercator's death his family prepared the Atlas for publication\u2014in four months. It was hoped for source of the income that was needed to support them. This work entailed supplementing the maps of the 1585 and 1589 with 28 unpublished maps of Mercator covering the northern countries, creating four maps of the continents and a world map, the printing of Mercator's account of the creation and finally the addition of eulogies and Walter Ghim's biography of Mercator. The title itself provides Mercator's definition of a new meaning for the word \"Atlas\": ''Atlas Sive Cosmographicae Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricati Figura'' which may be translated as \"Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the fabric of the world and the figure of the fabrick'd,'' or, more colloquially, as ''Atlas or cosmographical meditations upon the creation of the universe, and the universe as created.\"<ref>{{harvtxt|Sullivan|2000}} pdf p2.</ref><ref>See {{harvtxt|Karrow|2000}} for a discussion of concept of the term atlas.</ref> Over the years Mercator's definition of ''atlas'' has become simply ''A collection of maps in a volume.''<ref>[http://www.oed.com/ Oxford English Dictionary].</ref>\n<gallery heights=\"200px\" mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Mercator Atlas 1595 page 5 main frontispiece.jpg|<small>Mercator Atlas title page</small>\nFile:Mercator World Map.jpg|<small>The world map of Rumold Mercator</small>\nFile:Mercator Atlas 1595 page 107 Galliae.jpg|<small>The title page for the maps of Gaul</small>\n</gallery>\nThe atlas was not an immediate success. One reason may have been that it was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. Rumold avowed that a second volume would attend to these deficiencies but it was not forthcoming and the whole project lost momentum; Rumold, who was 55 years old in 1595, was in decline and died in 1599. His family did produce another edition in 1602 but only the text was reset, there were no new maps.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}}, Epilogue, p320.</ref> Another reason for the failure of the Atlas was the strength of the continuing sales of the ''[[Theatrum Orbis Terrarum]]'' of Abraham Ortelius. Alongside the sumptuous maps of that book Mercator's un-ornamented new maps looked very unattractive. Despite the death of Ortelius in 1598 the Theatrum flourished: in 1602 it was in its thirteenth Latin edition as well as editions in Dutch, Italian, French, German and Spanish. The Mercator atlas seemed destined for oblivion.<ref>{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Epilogue p323</ref>\n\nThe family was clearly in some financial difficulty for, in 1604, Mercator's library of some 1,000 books was sold at a public auction in [[Leiden]] (Netherlands).

Almost 40 extra maps were added (including Spain and Portugal) and in 1606 a new edition appeared under his name but with full acknowledgement that most maps were created by Mercator. The title page now included a picture of Hondius and Mercator together although they had never met. Hondius was an accomplished business man and under his guidance the Atlas was an enormous success; he (followed by his son [[Henricus Hondius II|Henricus]], and son-in-law [[Jan Janssonius|Johannes Janssonius]]) produced 29 editions between 1609 and 1641, including one in English. In addition they published the atlas in a compact form, the Atlas Minor,<ref>The Atlas Minor may be viewed online at the [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb11062214_00005.html Bavarian State Library]</ref> which meant that it was readily available to a wide market. As the editions progressed, Mercator's theological comments and his map commentaries disappeared from the atlas and images of King Atlas were replaced by the Titan Atlas. By the final edition the number of his maps in the atlas declined to less than 50 as updated new maps were added. Eventually the atlas became out-of-date and by the middle of the seventeenth century the publications of map-makers such as [[Joan Blaeu]] and [[Frederik de Wit]] took over.\n\n[[File:Bruxels April 2012-3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Statue of Mercator, Jardin du Petit Sablon, Brussels]]\nMercator's editions of Ptolemy and his theological writings were in print for many years after the demise of the atlas but they too eventually disappeared and it was the Mercator projection which emerged as his sole and greatest legacy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvtxt|Crane|2003}} Epilogue p325.</ref> His construction of a chart on which the courses of constant bearing favoured by mariners appeared as straight lines ultimately revolutionised the art of navigation, making it simpler and therefore safer. Mercator left no hints to his method of construction and it was [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] who first clarified the method in his book ''Certaine Errors'' (1599)\u2014the relevant error being the erroneous belief that straight lines on [[Equirectangular projection|conventional charts]] corresponded to constant courses. Wright's solution was a numerical approximation and it was another 70 years before the projection formula was derived analytically. Wright published a new world map based on the Mercator projection, also in 1599. Slowly, but steadily, charts using the projection appeared throughout the first half of the seventeenth century and by the end of that century chart makers all over the world were using nothing but the Mercator projection, with the aim of showing the oceans and the coastlines in detail without concern for the continental interiors. At some stage the projection made the unfortunate leap to portrayal of the continents and it eventually became the canonical description of the world, despite its manifest distortions at high latitudes.<ref>The distortions of Mercator's map are discussed in the article on the [[Mercator projection]].</ref> Recently Mercator's projection has been rejected for representations of the world<ref>See the critique of the Mercator and other projections in [[Gall\u2013Peters projection]]</ref> but it remains paramount for nautical charts and its use stands as his enduring legacy.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nMany cities have a statue of Mercator.<ref>: Statues in [[:File:Gerardus Mercator statue.jpg|Rupelmonde]], [[:File:Duisburg Mercatorbrunnen 2.jpg|Duisburg]], [[:File:Square du Petit Sablon - Gerard Mercator.JPG|Brussels]], [[:File:Mercator in Leuven.JPG|Louvain]].</ref>{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} His name has been attached to ships,<ref>The [[Mercator (ship)|Mercator]] was a training vessel for the Belgian navy.

This collection of maps is dedicated to Queen Elizabeth of England and in the preface Mercator acknowledges the information he received from English mariners through Rumold who had spent much of his working life in [[London]]. The full atlas included all the maps of the previous two collections, making in all 102 new maps by Mercator. His heirs added 5 introductory maps before publication: world map and Europe by Rumold, Africa and Asia by grandson Gerard and America by grandson Michael. Nevertheless the atlas was incomplete: Spain was omitted and there were no detailed maps outside Europe. The maps are in a variety of projections.<ref>Projections used in the 1585 atlas: see{{harvtxt|Keuning|1947}}</ref>\n\n::Less than half the pages in the atlas are maps. The title page shows King Atlas holding a globe, not supporting it, then the portrait of Mercator, a dedication to the Dukes of Cleves (father and son), a eulogy on the portrait, two epitaphs, the biography by Ghim, another epitaph by his grandson, two 'testimonial' letters, an ode on King Atlas by a grandson and Mercators own genealogy of Atlas in which he outlines his intended plans for the rest of the atlas: a description of the creation events, then a description of all that was created in the heavens (astronomy and astrology) and finally a description of the Earth, its geography. Of this grandiose plan all that was completed were the first and last objectives. The first part of the atlas, ''De mundi creatione ac fabrica liber'' (The creation of the world and the structure of the book), consists of 27 pages of text on the theology of creation, the events of creation, the elements created (such as animals, plants, sun, moon, stars, man), the Fall of Man and finally the salvation of creation through Christ.\n\n::The second part of the Atlas contains the maps but each section has its own title page, dedication and preface, and every country is succinctly supplemented by text describing a mixture of history, royal genealogy, ecclesiastical hierarchies, list of universities and occasionally facets of contemporary economy.
