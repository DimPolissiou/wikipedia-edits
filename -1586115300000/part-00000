Each mission had two to three friars and a contingent of up to five soldiers to help keep order in the mission and to help control the natives. Like most indigenous people in California, the natives in the vicinity of Mission San Jose were mostly coerced into joining it, where they were taught [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religion, singing, construction, agricultural trades and herding\u2014the Native Californian people originally had no agriculture and no domestic animals except dogs. Other tribes were coerced into other adjacent missions. The Mission Indians were restricted to the mission grounds where they lived in sexually segregated \"barracks\" that they built themselves with padre instruction. The population of all California missions plunged steeply as new diseases ravaged the Mission Indian populations\u2014they had almost no immunity to these \"new to them\" diseases, and death rates over 50% were not uncommon.<ref>Mission Indian life [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_missions.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221151949/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_missions.html |date=December 21, 2015 }} accessed 15 Jul 2013</ref>\n\nThe Livermore-Amador Valley after 1800 to about 1837 was primarily used as grazing land for some of the Mission San Jose's growing herds of mission cattle, sheep and horses. The herds grew wild with no fences and were culled about once a year for cow hides and [[tallow]]\u2014essentially the only money-making products produced in California then. The dead animals were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which then roamed the region. The secularization and closure of the California missions, as demanded by the government of [[Mexico]], from 1834 to 1837 transferred the land and property the missions claimed on the California coast (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} per mission) to about 600 extensive [[List of ranchos of California|ranchos]]. After the missions were dissolved, most of the surviving Indians went to work on the new ranchos raising crops and herding animals where they were given room and board, a few clothes and usually no pay for the work they did\u2014the same as they had had while working in the missions. Some Indians joined or re-joined some of the few surviving tribes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe about {{convert|48000|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Rancho Las Positas]] grant, which includes most of Livermore, was made to ranchers [[Robert Livermore]] and [[Jose Noriega]] in 1839.<ref>Map of Rancho Los Positas [http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb9x0nb5xv/] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref><ref>There is conflicting information as to the size of Livermore and Noreiga's grant.

Robert Livermore (1799-1858)<ref>Robert Livermore Picture [http://www.elivermore.com/photos/Hist_lvr_robert.htm] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref> was a British citizen who had jumped from a British merchant [[sailing ship]] stopping in [[Monterey, California]], in 1822. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen who had converted to Catholicism in 1823 as was required for citizenship and legal residence. After working for a number of years as a majordomo (ranch foreman), Livermore married on 5 May 1838 the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera (1815\u20131879), daughter of Jose Loreto Higuera, grantee of [[Rancho Los Tularcitos]], at the Mission San Jos\u00e9. Livermore, after he got his rancho in 1839, was as interested in [[viticulture]] and [[horticulture]] as he was in cattle and horses, despite the fact that about the only source of income was the sale of cow hides and tallow. In the early 1840s he moved his family to the Livermore valley to his new rancho as the second non-Indian family to settle in the Livermore valley area, and after building a home he was the first in the area in 1846 to direct the planting of vineyards and orchards of pears and olives. Typical of most early rancho dwellings, the first building on his ranch was an [[adobe]] on Las Positas Creek near the western end of today's Las Positas Road. After the Americans took control of California in 1847 and gold was discovered in 1848, he started making money by selling California [[Texas Longhorn|longhorn cattle]] to the thousands of hungry [[California Gold Rush]] miners who soon arrived. The non-Indian population skyrocketed, and cattle were suddenly worth much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. With his new wealth and with goods flooding into newly rich California, in 1849 Livermore bought a two-story \"Around the Horn\" disassembled house that had been shipped about {{convert|18000|mi|km}} on a sailing ship around [[Cape Horn]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. It is believed to be the first wooden building in the Livermore Tri-Valley.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the Gold Rush, Livermore's ranch became a popular \"first day\" stopping point for prospectors and businessmen leaving San Francisco or San Jose and headed for [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[Mother Lode]] gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of [[Altamont Pass]] just east of Livermore. Robert Livermore was a very accommodating host and welcomed nearly all that stopped by with lodging and meals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nRobert Livermore died in 1858 and was buried at [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jose]] before the establishment of the town that bears his name. His ranch included much of the present-day city. The city of Livermore, named in honor of Robert Livermore, was established in 1869 by William Mendenhall,<ref>William Mendenhall [http://www.elivermore.com/photos/Hist_lvr_mendenhall.htm] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref> who had first met Livermore while marching through the valley with [[John C. Fremont]]'s [[California Battalion]] in 1846 as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering [[Californio]] towns captured by the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Pacific Squadron]].\n\nCalifornia became the 31st state in 1850 when California's non-Indian population jumped from about 8,000 in 1846 to about 120,000 in 1850 as shown in a corrected 1850 U.S. California Census.<ref>\"Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789\u20131945\". The California U.S. Census of 1850 showed 92,597 residents. To this should be added residents from San Francisco (the largest city in the state), Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties whose censuses were burned up or lost and not included in the totals. Newspaper accounts in 1850 (Alta Californian) gives the population of San Francisco at 21,000; the special California state census of 1852 finds 6,158 residents of Santa Clara County and 2,786 residents of Contra Costa County. The corrected California U.S. 1850 Census is over 120,000.

Mendenhall. This made Livermore a \"railroad town\"<ref>CPRR railroad history [http://cprr.org/Museum/index.html] access 28 Mar 2013</ref> and greatly accelerated town growth.

Central Pacific was later acquired by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and then the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], which owns the tracks through town today, although these are primarily the tracks of the \"second\" [[Western Pacific Railroad]] that was founded in 1903 and absorbed into the UP in 1983.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPrivate grade schools were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute was founded in 1870, and the Union High School (later called Livermore High) graduated its first class of students in 1896. [[Petroleum]] was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive [[coal]] deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down, and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad in what is now downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small [[bullring]] on many Sundays, and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was thought then to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank, and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] by the state as a city on April 1, 1876, its original city limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north and Livermore Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east. The part of the west side north of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street, and the part of it south of 5th Street by I Street. The part of the south side east of I Street was bounded by 6th Street, and the part of it west of I Street by 5th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~21426~630040:Livermore,-Mission-San-Jose-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort,Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No&qvq=w4s:/when/1878;q:Livermore;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort,Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=9&trs=11|title=Livermore, Mission San Jose. - David Rumsey Historical Map Collection|website=www.davidrumsey.com|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring Livermore's early years, it was well known for large hotels that graced the downtown street corners, before new buildings replaced them. Livermore after the 1880s is also notable for the [[Wente Vineyards]], [[Concannon Vineyard]], [[Cresta Blanca Winery]] and many other wineries. Since it has a Mediterranean climate, gravelly soil, warm days and cool nights, it was a good location to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the extensive winter wheat and hay crop lands were being replaced by vineyards. Extensive [[chromite]] deposits were found and exploited for a time. In 1885, the [[Remillard Brick Company]] was producing an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men. A telephone line connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886, and electric lights were introduced by 1889.

The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of [[World War II]]. On 5 January 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, [[U.S. Navy]], formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), named after famous physicist [[Ernest O.

Livermore Valley is about {{convert|15|mi}} long (east to west), {{convert|10|mi}} wide (north to south), and surrounded by California coastal range mountains and foothills.\n\nWatercourses draining the city of Livermore include [[Arroyo Mocho]], [[Arroyo Valle]], [[Arroyo Seco (Alameda County)|Arroyo Seco]] and [[Arroyo Las Positas]]. The principal [[aquifer]] underlying the city is the [[Mocho Subbasin]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.2|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land. Several local [[seismic]] areas of activity lie near the city, including the [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault|Greenville Fault]], [[Tesla Fault]] and the [[Livermore Fault]].\n\nThe soil is primarily gravel with excellent drainage. The gravel is used in several gravel extraction sites outside the city. The gravelly soil and Mediterranean climate increases the flavor concentration in the grapes planted in the soil.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Altamont Wind Turbines 7-11-09.JPG|right|thumb|Wind turbines, part of the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm]] near Livermore]]\nLivermore has a [[Mediterranean climate]],<ref>Average Livermore weather [http://weatherspark.com/averages/30789/Livermore-California-United-States] accessed 20 Apr 2013</ref> although it is close to a [[semi-arid climate]] because of its relatively low annual precipitation. It features hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters with occasional rainfall ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Csa). Summer (June\u2013October) daytime temperatures average in the {{convert|75|to|85|\u00b0F}} range, but sometimes reach {{convert|100|\u00b0F}} and can occasionally approach {{convert|110|\u00b0F}}. Summer nights, however, are normally much cooler, with lows in the {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F}} range. The valley's passes direct the normal west to east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. This wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about {{convert|9|mph|kph}} and predictable enough to make the Livermore hills covered with wind turbines mounted in [[Altamont Pass]]. The period from June to September is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies, but in late summer, subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley, bringing high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms.\n\nNearly all of the {{convert|14.6|in}} of annual Livermore rainfall comes in the September to May time period, but about 50% of the days are sunny during this period with no appreciable cloud cover. The peak rainy months are December to March. Most rainstorms are classified as 50% light rain, 32% moderate rain, 11% heavy rain and less than 6% thunder showers.<ref>Livermore rainfall probabilities [http://weatherspark.com/averages/30789/Livermore-California-United-States] accessed 20 Apr 2013</ref> The coldest months are December and January, with a mean high of about {{convert|56|\u00b0F}} and a low of about {{convert|38|\u00b0F}} with some occasional frost possible on clear mornings. The temperature can drop to as low as the {{convert|20|to|25|\u00b0F}} range on an exceptionally cold night. Snow is very rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally in the valley.\n\nThe record high temperature is {{convert|115|\u00b0F}}, recorded on September 3, 1950, and the record low temperature is {{convert|18|\u00b0F}}, recorded on January 5, 1961, and December 9, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca8353|title=SONORA, CALIFORNIA - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> \n{{Clear}}\n{{Weather box\n|width=auto\n|location = Livermore, California (1903-2013)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 80\n|Mar record high F = 88\n|Apr record high F = 96\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 113\n|Jul record high F = 113\n|Aug record high F = 112\n|Sep record high F = 113\n|Oct record high F = 106\n|Nov record high F = 93\n|Dec record high F = 79\n|year record high F= 113\n|Jan high F = 56.8\n|Feb high F = 61.2\n|Mar high F = 65.2\n|Apr high F = 70.5\n|May high F = 76.4\n|Jun high F = 83.1\n|Jul high F = 89.0\n|Aug high F = 88.2\n|Sep high F = 86.0\n|Oct high F = 77.7\n|Nov high F = 66.3\n|Dec high F = 57.5\n|year high F = 73.2\n|Jan low F = 36.7\n|Feb low F = 39.4\n|Mar low F = 41.3\n|Apr low F = 43.6\n|May low F = 47.6\n|Jun low F = 51.7\n|Jul low F = 54.2\n|Aug low F = 54.0\n|Sep low F = 52.5\n|Oct low F = 47.7\n|Nov low F = 41.1\n|Dec low F = 37.0\n|year low F = 45.6\n|Jan avg record high F=66.9\n|Feb avg record high F=71.4\n|Mar avg record high F=77.9\n|Apr avg record high F=85.8\n|May avg record high F=94.3\n|Jun avg record high F=102.0\n|Jul avg record high F=104.3\n|Aug avg record high F=102.8\n|Sep avg record high F=101.2\n|Oct avg record high F=92.6\n|Nov avg record high F=79.0\n|Dec avg record high F=67.8\n|year avg record high F=106.3\n|Jan avg record low F=26.4\t \n|Feb avg record low F=29.5\n|Mar avg record low F=32.1\n|Apr avg record low F=34.9\n|May avg record low F=39.3\n|Jun avg record low F=44.4\n|Jul avg record low F=47.7\n|Aug avg record low F=47.8\n|Sep avg record low F=44.5\n|Oct avg record low F=38.3\n|Nov avg record low F=30.5\n|Dec avg record low F=26.7\n|year avg record low F=24.5\n|Jan record low F = 18\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 22\n|Apr record low F = 29\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 38\n|Jul record low F = 36\n|Aug record low F = 36\n|Sep record low F = 35\n|Oct record low F = 29\n|Nov record low F = 22\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F= 18\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.97\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.15\t\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.00\n|May precipitation inch = .44\t\n|Jun precipitation inch = .11\n|Jul precipitation inch = .02\n|Aug precipitation inch = .04\n|Sep precipitation inch = .22\t\n|Oct precipitation inch = .67\t\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.54\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.56\n|unit precipitation days = .01 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 9\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 6\n|May precipitation days = 3\n|Jun precipitation days = 1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 3\n|Nov precipitation days = 7\n|Dec precipitation days = 9\n|Jan rain days = 6\n|Feb rain days = 6\n|Mar rain days = 5\n|Apr rain days = 3\n|May rain days = 1\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 0\n|Oct rain days = 2\n|Nov rain days = 4\n|Dec rain days = 6\n|unit rain days = 0.1 in\n|year rain days = 34\n| Jan snow days  =trace\n| Feb snow days  =0.0\n| Mar snow days  =0.0\n| Apr snow days  =0.0\n| May snow days  =0.0\n| Jun snow days  =0.0\n| Jul snow days  =0.0\n| Aug snow days  =0.0\n| Sep snow days  =0.0\n| Oct snow days  =0.0\n| Nov snow days  =0.0\n| Dec snow days  =0.1\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|source 1 = WRCC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca4997|title=LIVERMORE, CALIFORNIA - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> and pogodaiklimat.ru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate3/KLVK.htm|title=\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 - \u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442|website=www.pogodaiklimat.ru|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Government ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%; align:right;\"\n|-\n!

Each mission had two to three friars and a contingent of up to five soldiers to help keep order in the mission and to help control the natives. Like most indigenous people in California, the natives in the vicinity of Mission San Jose were mostly coerced into joining it, where they were taught [[Spanish language|Spanish]], the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] religion, singing, construction, agricultural trades and herding\u2014the Native Californian people originally had no agriculture and no domestic animals except dogs. Other tribes were coerced into other adjacent missions. The Mission Indians were restricted to the mission grounds where they lived in sexually segregated \"barracks\" that they built themselves with padre instruction. The population of all California missions plunged steeply as new diseases ravaged the Mission Indian populations\u2014they had almost no immunity to these \"new to them\" diseases, and death rates over 50% were not uncommon.<ref>Mission Indian life [http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_missions.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151221151949/http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_missions.html |date=December 21, 2015 }} accessed 15 Jul 2013</ref>\n\nThe Livermore-Amador Valley after 1800 to about 1837 was primarily used as grazing land for some of the Mission San Jose's growing herds of mission cattle, sheep and horses. The herds grew wild with no fences and were culled about once a year for cow hides and [[tallow]]\u2014essentially the only money-making products produced in California then. The dead animals were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which then roamed the region. The secularization and closure of the California missions, as demanded by the government of [[Mexico]], from 1834 to 1837 transferred the land and property the missions claimed on the California coast (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} per mission) to about 600 extensive [[List of ranchos of California|ranchos]]. After the missions were dissolved, most of the surviving Indians went to work on the new ranchos raising crops and herding animals where they were given room and board, a few clothes and usually no pay for the work they did\u2014the same as they had had while working in the missions. Some Indians joined or re-joined some of the few surviving tribes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nThe about {{convert|48000|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Rancho Las Positas]] grant, which includes most of Livermore, was made to ranchers [[Robert Livermore]] and [[Jose Noriega]] in 1839.<ref>Map of Rancho Los Positas [http://content.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/hb9x0nb5xv/] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref><ref>There is conflicting information as to the size of Livermore and Noreiga's grant.

Robert Livermore (1799-1858)<ref>Robert Livermore Picture [http://www.elivermore.com/photos/Hist_lvr_robert.htm] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref> was a British citizen who had jumped from a British merchant [[sailing ship]] stopping in [[Monterey, California]], in 1822. He became a naturalized Mexican citizen who had converted to Catholicism in 1823 as was required for citizenship and legal residence. After working for a number of years as a majordomo (ranch foreman), Livermore married on 5 May 1838 the widow Maria Josefa de Jesus Higuera (1815\u20131879), daughter of Jose Loreto Higuera, grantee of [[Rancho Los Tularcitos]], at the Mission San Jos\u00e9. Livermore, after he got his rancho in 1839, was as interested in [[viticulture]] and [[horticulture]] as he was in cattle and horses, despite the fact that about the only source of income was the sale of cow hides and tallow. In the early 1840s he moved his family to the Livermore valley to his new rancho as the second non-Indian family to settle in the Livermore valley area, and after building a home he was the first in the area in 1846 to direct the planting of vineyards and orchards of pears and olives. Typical of most early rancho dwellings, the first building on his ranch was an [[adobe]] on Las Positas Creek near the western end of today's Las Positas Road. After the Americans took control of California in 1847 and gold was discovered in 1848, he started making money by selling California [[Texas Longhorn|longhorn cattle]] to the thousands of hungry [[California Gold Rush]] miners who soon arrived. The non-Indian population skyrocketed, and cattle were suddenly worth much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. With his new wealth and with goods flooding into newly rich California, in 1849 Livermore bought a two-story \"Around the Horn\" disassembled house that had been shipped about {{convert|18000|mi|km}} on a sailing ship around [[Cape Horn]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]]. It is believed to be the first wooden building in the Livermore Tri-Valley.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nDuring the Gold Rush, Livermore's ranch became a popular \"first day\" stopping point for prospectors and businessmen leaving San Francisco or San Jose and headed for [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[Mother Lode]] gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of [[Altamont Pass]] just east of Livermore. Robert Livermore was a very accommodating host and welcomed nearly all that stopped by with lodging and meals.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nRobert Livermore died in 1858 and was buried at [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 (California)|Mission San Jose]] before the establishment of the town that bears his name. His ranch included much of the present-day city. The city of Livermore, named in honor of Robert Livermore, was established in 1869 by William Mendenhall,<ref>William Mendenhall [http://www.elivermore.com/photos/Hist_lvr_mendenhall.htm] accessed 28 Mar 2013</ref> who had first met Livermore while marching through the valley with [[John C. Fremont]]'s [[California Battalion]] in 1846 as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering [[Californio]] towns captured by the [[U.S. Navy]]'s [[Pacific Squadron]].\n\nCalifornia became the 31st state in 1850 when California's non-Indian population jumped from about 8,000 in 1846 to about 120,000 in 1850 as shown in a corrected 1850 U.S. California Census.<ref>\"Historical Statistics of the United States, 1789\u20131945\". The California U.S. Census of 1850 showed 92,597 residents. To this should be added residents from San Francisco (the largest city in the state), Santa Clara, and Contra Costa counties whose censuses were burned up or lost and not included in the totals. Newspaper accounts in 1850 (Alta Californian) gives the population of San Francisco at 21,000; the special California state census of 1852 finds 6,158 residents of Santa Clara County and 2,786 residents of Contra Costa County. The corrected California U.S. 1850 Census is over 120,000. See: U.S. Seventh Census 1850: California [https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html] Accessed 14 April 2011</ref> California had enough population and enough wealth in 1850 that they bypassed the territorial status of most other states and were allowed to more or less choose their own (large) boundaries.\n\nThe Livermore Ranch post office, in Robert Livermore's home, operated from 1851 to 1853.<ref name=CGN /> The first significant settlement of Livermore was Laddsville, on what is now Junction Avenue, which grew up around the hotel established by Alphonso Ladd in 1864. The official U.S. post office in Livermore opened in 1869.<ref name=CGN /> The original [[Western Pacific Railroad]] Company in 1869 built its railroad connection from [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] to Sacramento over the nearby Altamont Pass in the east and [[Niles Canyon]] on the west with a stop in Livermore on land donated by William M. Mendenhall. This made Livermore a \"railroad town\"<ref>CPRR railroad history [http://cprr.org/Museum/index.html] access 28 Mar 2013</ref> and greatly accelerated town growth. The population of Livermore in 1869, before the railroad arrived, is thought to have been about 75.<ref>Baker, Joseph Eugene; ''Past and Present of Alameda County, California, Volume 1'';p.441;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cBgVAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA449&ots=65jkZKcYLI&dq=population%20of%20livermore%20california%201870&pg=PA450#v=onepage&q=population%20of%20livermore%20california%201870&f=false]</ref> By 1870 the Western Pacific had been absorbed by the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] as part of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]]. Central Pacific was later acquired by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and then the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], which owns the tracks through town today, although these are primarily the tracks of the \"second\" [[Western Pacific Railroad]] that was founded in 1903 and absorbed into the UP in 1983.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nPrivate grade schools were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute was founded in 1870, and the Union High School (later called Livermore High) graduated its first class of students in 1896. [[Petroleum]] was discovered near Livermore and become a valuable asset. Extensive [[coal]] deposits were mined near Corral Hollow by the Livermore Coal Company. In September 1871 Laddsville mostly burned down, and the people rebuilt their homes and businesses nearer the railroad in what is now downtown Livermore. Until 1875 the townspeople enjoyed bull fights in a small [[bullring]] on many Sundays, and on other occasions a captured grizzly bear might be pitted against a longhorn bull. Apparently, roping a grizzly was thought then to be a great sport. As the town grew there were a fire company, churches, a bank, and a library that were formed by 1876. Livermore was officially [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] by the state as a city on April 1, 1876, its original city limits being the line a block north of 1st Street on the north and Livermore Avenue (then Lizzie Street) on the east. The part of the west side north of 5th Street was bounded by Q Street, and the part of it south of 5th Street by I Street. The part of the south side east of I Street was bounded by 6th Street, and the part of it west of I Street by 5th Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~21426~630040:Livermore,-Mission-San-Jose-?sort=Pub_List_No_InitialSort,Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No&qvq=w4s:/when/1878;q:Livermore;sort:Pub_List_No_InitialSort,Pub_Date,Pub_List_No,Series_No;lc:RUMSEY~8~1&mi=9&trs=11|title=Livermore, Mission San Jose. - David Rumsey Historical Map Collection|website=www.davidrumsey.com|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref>\n\nDuring Livermore's early years, it was well known for large hotels that graced the downtown street corners, before new buildings replaced them. Livermore after the 1880s is also notable for the [[Wente Vineyards]], [[Concannon Vineyard]], [[Cresta Blanca Winery]] and many other wineries. Since it has a Mediterranean climate, gravelly soil, warm days and cool nights, it was a good location to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the extensive winter wheat and hay crop lands were being replaced by vineyards. Extensive [[chromite]] deposits were found and exploited for a time. In 1885, the [[Remillard Brick Company]] was producing an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men. A telephone line connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886, and electric lights were introduced by 1889. By 1890 Livermore had over {{convert|20|mi}} of streets.<ref>Baker, Joseph Eugene; ''Past and Present of Alameda County, California, Volume 1'';p.442;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cBgVAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA449&ots=65jkZKcYLI&dq=population%20of%20livermore%20california%201870&pg=PA450#v=onepage&q=population%20of%20livermore%20california%201870&f=false]</ref> Livermore originally had a [[Boot Hill]] called the Old Knoll Cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.daffodil.org/ncds/dafvistas.htm|title=Locations and Vistas with Daffodils|website=www.daffodil.org|accessdate=June 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819133318/http://www.daffodil.org/ncds/dafvistas.htm|archive-date=August 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1909, the [[Livermore Carnegie Library and Park]] opened after taking advantage of a [[Carnegie library]] grant.

The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of [[World War II]]. On 5 January 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, [[U.S. Navy]], formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) for use by the University of California's Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), named after famous physicist [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], as the site of a second laboratory for the study of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]] like the research being done at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. The laboratory was run by the [[University of California]]. [[Edward Teller]] was a co-founder of LLNL and was both its director and associate director for many years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elivermore.com/photos/Hist_lvr_naval_air1.htm|title=Livermore Naval Air Station - eLivermore.com|website=www.elivermore.com|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> In 1956, the California campus of [[Sandia National Laboratories]] opened across East Avenue from LLNL. Both LLNL and Sandia are technically on U.S. government property just outside the city's jurisdiction limits, but with employment at LLNL at about 6,800 and Sandia/California at about 1,150 they are Livermore's largest employers. In 2004, [[Cornerstone Fellowship]] remodeled and moved into former indoor soccer facility, making it the largest indoor auditorium venue in the Tri-Valley, with weekly attendance in the thousands.\n\nFor pictures of early Livermore, check the Livermore Heritage Guild<ref>Livermore Heritage Guild [http://www.livermorehistory.com/] accessed 3 Apr 2013</ref> photo site.<ref>Livermore Heritage Guild photo site [http://www.livermorehistory.com/Archive%20-%20Photos/_Menu%20Photos%20Archive.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930142642/http://livermorehistory.com/Archive%20-%20Photos/_Menu%20Photos%20Archive.html |date=September 30, 2013 }} accessed 3 Apr 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:IMAG3052-livermore.jpg|thumb|left|upright=2.5|Livermore, California. This picture is taken southwest of the town, looking northeast toward it.]]\nThe Livermore Valley is located  {{convert|10|mi}} east of the first coastal range of foothills that surround the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. The Livermore Valley has an east-west orientation with mountain passes on the west and east connecting the Bay Area and the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. The passes are used by railroads and highways to connect the two regions. Livermore Valley is about {{convert|15|mi}} long (east to west), {{convert|10|mi}} wide (north to south), and surrounded by California coastal range mountains and foothills.\n\nWatercourses draining the city of Livermore include [[Arroyo Mocho]], [[Arroyo Valle]], [[Arroyo Seco (Alameda County)|Arroyo Seco]] and [[Arroyo Las Positas]]. The principal [[aquifer]] underlying the city is the [[Mocho Subbasin]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|25.2|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land. Several local [[seismic]] areas of activity lie near the city, including the [[Clayton-Marsh Creek-Greenville Fault|Greenville Fault]], [[Tesla Fault]] and the [[Livermore Fault]].\n\nThe soil is primarily gravel with excellent drainage. The gravel is used in several gravel extraction sites outside the city. The gravelly soil and Mediterranean climate increases the flavor concentration in the grapes planted in the soil.\n\n==Climate==\n[[File:Altamont Wind Turbines 7-11-09.JPG|right|thumb|Wind turbines, part of the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm]] near Livermore]]\nLivermore has a [[Mediterranean climate]],<ref>Average Livermore weather [http://weatherspark.com/averages/30789/Livermore-California-United-States] accessed 20 Apr 2013</ref> although it is close to a [[semi-arid climate]] because of its relatively low annual precipitation. It features hot, dry summers and mild to cool winters with occasional rainfall ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Csa). Summer (June\u2013October) daytime temperatures average in the {{convert|75|to|85|\u00b0F}} range, but sometimes reach {{convert|100|\u00b0F}} and can occasionally approach {{convert|110|\u00b0F}}. Summer nights, however, are normally much cooler, with lows in the {{convert|50|to|60|\u00b0F}} range. The valley's passes direct the normal west to east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. This wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about {{convert|9|mph|kph}} and predictable enough to make the Livermore hills covered with wind turbines mounted in [[Altamont Pass]]. The period from June to September is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies, but in late summer, subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley, bringing high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms.\n\nNearly all of the {{convert|14.6|in}} of annual Livermore rainfall comes in the September to May time period, but about 50% of the days are sunny during this period with no appreciable cloud cover. The peak rainy months are December to March. Most rainstorms are classified as 50% light rain, 32% moderate rain, 11% heavy rain and less than 6% thunder showers.<ref>Livermore rainfall probabilities [http://weatherspark.com/averages/30789/Livermore-California-United-States] accessed 20 Apr 2013</ref> The coldest months are December and January, with a mean high of about {{convert|56|\u00b0F}} and a low of about {{convert|38|\u00b0F}} with some occasional frost possible on clear mornings. The temperature can drop to as low as the {{convert|20|to|25|\u00b0F}} range on an exceptionally cold night. Snow is very rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally in the valley.\n\nThe record high temperature is {{convert|115|\u00b0F}}, recorded on September 3, 1950, and the record low temperature is {{convert|18|\u00b0F}}, recorded on January 5, 1961, and December 9, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca8353|title=SONORA, CALIFORNIA - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> \n{{Clear}}\n{{Weather box\n|width=auto\n|location = Livermore, California (1903-2013)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 80\n|Mar record high F = 88\n|Apr record high F = 96\n|May record high F = 108\n|Jun record high F = 113\n|Jul record high F = 113\n|Aug record high F = 112\n|Sep record high F = 113\n|Oct record high F = 106\n|Nov record high F = 93\n|Dec record high F = 79\n|year record high F= 113\n|Jan high F = 56.8\n|Feb high F = 61.2\n|Mar high F = 65.2\n|Apr high F = 70.5\n|May high F = 76.4\n|Jun high F = 83.1\n|Jul high F = 89.0\n|Aug high F = 88.2\n|Sep high F = 86.0\n|Oct high F = 77.7\n|Nov high F = 66.3\n|Dec high F = 57.5\n|year high F = 73.2\n|Jan low F = 36.7\n|Feb low F = 39.4\n|Mar low F = 41.3\n|Apr low F = 43.6\n|May low F = 47.6\n|Jun low F = 51.7\n|Jul low F = 54.2\n|Aug low F = 54.0\n|Sep low F = 52.5\n|Oct low F = 47.7\n|Nov low F = 41.1\n|Dec low F = 37.0\n|year low F = 45.6\n|Jan avg record high F=66.9\n|Feb avg record high F=71.4\n|Mar avg record high F=77.9\n|Apr avg record high F=85.8\n|May avg record high F=94.3\n|Jun avg record high F=102.0\n|Jul avg record high F=104.3\n|Aug avg record high F=102.8\n|Sep avg record high F=101.2\n|Oct avg record high F=92.6\n|Nov avg record high F=79.0\n|Dec avg record high F=67.8\n|year avg record high F=106.3\n|Jan avg record low F=26.4\t \n|Feb avg record low F=29.5\n|Mar avg record low F=32.1\n|Apr avg record low F=34.9\n|May avg record low F=39.3\n|Jun avg record low F=44.4\n|Jul avg record low F=47.7\n|Aug avg record low F=47.8\n|Sep avg record low F=44.5\n|Oct avg record low F=38.3\n|Nov avg record low F=30.5\n|Dec avg record low F=26.7\n|year avg record low F=24.5\n|Jan record low F = 18\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 22\n|Apr record low F = 29\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 38\n|Jul record low F = 36\n|Aug record low F = 36\n|Sep record low F = 35\n|Oct record low F = 29\n|Nov record low F = 22\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F= 18\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.97\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.15\t\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.00\n|May precipitation inch = .44\t\n|Jun precipitation inch = .11\n|Jul precipitation inch = .02\n|Aug precipitation inch = .04\n|Sep precipitation inch = .22\t\n|Oct precipitation inch = .67\t\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.54\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.56\n|unit precipitation days = .01 in\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 9\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 6\n|May precipitation days = 3\n|Jun precipitation days = 1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 3\n|Nov precipitation days = 7\n|Dec precipitation days = 9\n|Jan rain days = 6\n|Feb rain days = 6\n|Mar rain days = 5\n|Apr rain days = 3\n|May rain days = 1\n|Jun rain days = 0\n|Jul rain days = 0\n|Aug rain days = 0\n|Sep rain days = 0\n|Oct rain days = 2\n|Nov rain days = 4\n|Dec rain days = 6\n|unit rain days = 0.1 in\n|year rain days = 34\n| Jan snow days  =trace\n| Feb snow days  =0.0\n| Mar snow days  =0.0\n| Apr snow days  =0.0\n| May snow days  =0.0\n| Jun snow days  =0.0\n| Jul snow days  =0.0\n| Aug snow days  =0.0\n| Sep snow days  =0.0\n| Oct snow days  =0.0\n| Nov snow days  =0.0\n| Dec snow days  =0.1\n\n|precipitation colour = green\n|source 1 = WRCC<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?ca4997|title=LIVERMORE, CALIFORNIA - Climate Summary|website=www.wrcc.dri.edu|accessdate=June 5, 2018}}</ref> and pogodaiklimat.ru<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate3/KLVK.htm|title=\u041a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442 \u041b\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043c\u043e\u0440\u0430 - \u041f\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0442|website=www.pogodaiklimat.ru|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Government ==\n{| class=\"toccolours\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 1em; font-size:95%; align:right;\"\n|-\n!

He had a distinguished amateur career, which includes medalist honours at the 2001 [[Australian Amateur]].\n\nBowditch plays on the PGA Tour of Australasia and previously played on its developmental Von Nida Tour. He also plays in the United States, where he has alternated between the [[PGA Tour]] and the Nationwide Tour for varied success. He won the 2005 [[Jacob's Creek Open Championship]], co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Nationwide Tour, on the way to finishing fourth on the Nationwide Tour's money list. This earned Bowditch a PGA Tour card for the first time in 2006. He played in 22 events, but only made two cuts in his debut season and returned to the [[Nationwide Tour]] in 2007.\n\nBowditch won for the second time on the Nationwide Tour in 2010, at the [[Soboba Golf Classic]]. He finished the year 17th on the money list and earned his 2011 PGA Tour card. His second full season on the PGA Tour was a greater success, where he played in 28 events and made 15 cuts, including six top-25 finishes.\n\nOn 30 March 2014, Bowditch won his maiden title on the PGA Tour, at the [[Valero Texas Open]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/tourreport/2014/03/30/steven-bowditch-wins-valero-texas-open.html |title=Wrap-up: Bowditch wins Valero Texas Open |publisher=PGA Tour |date=30 March 2014 |first=Sean |last=Martin}}</ref> He won by a single stroke over [[Will MacKenzie]] and [[Daniel Summerhays]], despite shooting a final four-over-par round of 76, which was the highest round shot by a winner on tour since 2004. The victory came in his 110th tour level start. The win qualified Bowditch to play in the [[Masters Tournament]] and the [[PGA Championship]] for the first time in his career.\n\nOn 31 May 2015, Bowditch won the [[AT&T Byron Nelson]] for his second PGA Tour title. He posted a score of \u221218 to finish four shots ahead of [[Charley Hoffman]], [[Jimmy Walker (golfer)|Jimmy Walker]] and [[Scott Pinckney]] to claim a wire-to-wire victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/12987511/steven-bowditch-shoots-5-64-4-shot-victory-att-byron-nelson |title=Steven Bowditch completes wire-to-wire victory in AT&T Byron Nelson |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=31 May 2015}}</ref> He became the third Australian to win the tournament in eight years, following [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] in 2008 and [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]] in 2010. The victory qualified Bowditch for the [[2015 PGA Championship]] and the [[2016 Masters Tournament]]. His play during the season was good enough to earn a captain's pick for the [[2015 Presidents Cup]] and a career high world ranking of 54th.\n\nBowditch has long had a battle with severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and is a spokesman for [[beyondblue]], an Australian non-profit organisation promoting awareness of depression and related mental disorders.<ref>[http://www.beyondblue.org.au/index.aspx?link_id=59.754 Top young golfer and beyondblue Ambassador Steven Bowditch says: It can happen to anyone]</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 2017, Bowditch

golfer]] who currently plays on the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]].\n\nBowditch was born in [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. He had a distinguished amateur career, which includes medalist honours at the 2001 [[Australian Amateur]].\n\nBowditch plays on the PGA Tour of Australasia and previously played on its developmental Von Nida Tour. He also plays in the United States, where he has alternated between the [[PGA Tour]] and the Nationwide Tour for varied success. He won the 2005 [[Jacob's Creek Open Championship]], co-sanctioned by the PGA Tour of Australasia and the Nationwide Tour, on the way to finishing fourth on the Nationwide Tour's money list. This earned Bowditch a PGA Tour card for the first time in 2006. He played in 22 events, but only made two cuts in his debut season and returned to the [[Nationwide Tour]] in 2007.\n\nBowditch won for the second time on the Nationwide Tour in 2010, at the [[Soboba Golf Classic]]. He finished the year 17th on the money list and earned his 2011 PGA Tour card. His second full season on the PGA Tour was a greater success, where he played in 28 events and made 15 cuts, including six top-25 finishes.\n\nOn 30 March 2014, Bowditch won his maiden title on the PGA Tour, at the [[Valero Texas Open]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pgatour.com/tourreport/2014/03/30/steven-bowditch-wins-valero-texas-open.html |title=Wrap-up: Bowditch wins Valero Texas Open |publisher=PGA Tour |date=30 March 2014 |first=Sean |last=Martin}}</ref> He won by a single stroke over [[Will MacKenzie]] and [[Daniel Summerhays]], despite shooting a final four-over-par round of 76, which was the highest round shot by a winner on tour since 2004. The victory came in his 110th tour level start. The win qualified Bowditch to play in the [[Masters Tournament]] and the [[PGA Championship]] for the first time in his career.\n\nOn 31 May 2015, Bowditch won the [[AT&T Byron Nelson]] for his second PGA Tour title. He posted a score of \u221218 to finish four shots ahead of [[Charley Hoffman]], [[Jimmy Walker (golfer)|Jimmy Walker]] and [[Scott Pinckney]] to claim a wire-to-wire victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/story/_/id/12987511/steven-bowditch-shoots-5-64-4-shot-victory-att-byron-nelson |title=Steven Bowditch completes wire-to-wire victory in AT&T Byron Nelson |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |date=31 May 2015}}</ref> He became the third Australian to win the tournament in eight years, following [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] in 2008 and [[Jason Day (golfer)|Jason Day]] in 2010. The victory qualified Bowditch for the [[2015 PGA Championship]] and the [[2016 Masters Tournament]]. His play during the season was good enough to earn a captain's pick for the [[2015 Presidents Cup]] and a career high world ranking of 54th.\n\nBowditch has long had a battle with severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and is a spokesman for [[beyondblue]], an Australian non-profit organisation promoting awareness of depression and related mental disorders.<ref>[http://www.beyondblue.org.au/index.aspx?link_id=59.754 Top young golfer and beyondblue Ambassador Steven Bowditch says: It can happen to anyone]</ref>\n\nOn 3 February 2017, Bowditch was arrested for extreme [[DUI]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/scottsdale/2017/02/03/pga-tour-player-steven-bowditch-dui-arrest-scottsdale-phoenix-open/97466124/ |title=Pro golfer Steven Bowditch apologizes after extreme DUI arrest |date=3 February 2017 |website=azcentral.com}}</ref>\n\n==Professional wins (7)==\n===PGA Tour wins (2)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runners-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|30 Mar [[2014 PGA Tour|2014]]\n|[[Valero Texas Open]]\n|\u22128 (69-67-68-76=280)\n|1 stroke\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Will MacKenzie]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Daniel Summerhays]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|31 May [[2015 PGA Tour|2015]]\n|[[AT&T Byron Nelson]]\n|\u221218 (62-68-65-64=259)\n|4 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Charley Hoffman]], {{flagicon|USA}} [[Scott Pinckney]],<br>{{flagicon|USA}} [[Jimmy Walker (golfer)|Jimmy Walker]]\n|}\n\n===PGA Tour of Australasia wins (3)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|20 Feb [[2005 PGA Tour of Australasia|2005]]\n|[[Jacob's Creek Open Championship]]<sup>1</sup>\n|\u221211 (67-67-72-71=277)\n|5 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ryan Armour]], {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Nathan Green (golfer)|Nathan Green]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|8 Nov [[2009 PGA Tour of Australasia|2009]]\n|[[Cellarbrations Queensland PGA Championship]]\n|\u221228 (64-64-63-69=260)\n|6 strokes\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Clint Rice]]\n|-\n|align=center|3\n|align=right|8 May [[2010 PGA Tour of Australasia|2010]]\n|[[Cellarbrations New South Wales PGA Championship]]\n|\u221217 (64-68-64-67=263)\n|2 strokes\n|{{flagicon|NZL}} [[Gareth Paddison]]\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>Co-sanctioned by the [[Nationwide Tour]]\n\n'''PGA Tour of Australasia playoff record (0\u20131)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#F2C1D1;\"\n|align=center|1\n|2005\n|[[ING New Zealand PGA Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Peter O'Malley (golfer)|Peter O'Malley]]\n|Lost to birdie on first extra hole\n|}\n\n===Nationwide Tour wins (2)===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.\n!Date\n!Tournament\n!Winning score\n!Margin of<br>victory\n!Runner(s)-up\n|-\n|align=center|1\n|align=right|20 Feb [[2005 Nationwide Tour|2005]]\n|[[Jacob's Creek Open Championship]]<sup>1</sup>\n|\u221211 (67-67-72-71=277)\n|5 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Ryan Armour]], {{flagicon|AUS}} [[Nathan Green (golfer)|Nathan Green]]\n|-\n|align=center|2\n|align=right|3 Oct [[2010 Nationwide Tour|2010]]\n|[[Soboba Golf Classic]]\n|\u221219 (70-64-63-68=265)\n|3 strokes\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Daniel Summerhays]]\n|}\n<sup>1</sup>Co-sanctioned by the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]]\n\n'''Nationwide Tour playoff record (0\u20131)'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n!No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent!!Result\n|-style=\"background:#F08080;\"\n|align=center|1\n|2005\n|[[ING New Zealand PGA Championship]]\n|{{flagicon|AUS}} [[Peter O'Malley (golfer)|Peter O'Malley]]\n|Lost to birdie on first extra hole\n|}\n\n===Other wins (1)===\n*2004 [[Queensland Open (golf)|Queensland Open]] (Von Nida Tour)\n\n==Results in major championships==\n{| cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: #aaa solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;text-align:center;\"\n|- style=\"background:#eeeeee;\"\n!align=\"left\"|Tournament\n!2003 !!

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries.

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill.

gas, which could release toxic gases upon combustion.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190809_coughedblood\"/> The usage of tear gas sparked public health concerns after a reporter was diagnosed with [[chloracne]] in November.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191114_diagnosedclorance\"/> Between June and November, approximately 10,000 volleys of gas had been fired.<ref name=\"rthk_1494810\"/> Chemical residues were found on

a train, were thought to have disregarded public safety by protesters and pro-democrats.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190901_mtrclosed\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190715_policekettling\"/> The police were accused of using disproportionate force<ref name=\"rthk_1483721\"/> after an officer shot two young protesters with live ammunition in [[Tsuen Wan]] and [[Sai Wan Ho]] on 1 October and 11 November respectively.{{efn|For the Tsuen Wan incident, the police defended the officer's actions, saying that the officer and his colleague's lives were at risk as a group of protesters was assaulting another officer at the time.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191001_selfdefence\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1483755\"/> Protesters argued that the officer shooting the man's chest was unnecessary and that he had other less lethal alternatives available at his disposal.<ref name=\"rthk_1483884\"/><ref name=\"nbc_1061086\"/> For the [[Sai Wan Ho]] incident, the police alleged the unarmed young man was trying to grab the

boy in [[Yuen Long]] on 4 October when he was assaulted by protesters who accused him of bumping into people with his car.<ref name=\"scmp_3031706\"/> The siege of PolyU, which was described as a \"humanitarian crisis\" by democrats and medics,<ref name=\"guardian_20191122\"/><ref name=\"asiatimes_20191118_siegecrisis\"/> prompted [[Red Cross]] and [[Medecins Sans Frontieres]] to intervene as

The police was also accused of driving dangerously. A police officer was suspended after he hit one protester and dragged him in the process on 11 November with a motorcycle,<ref name=\"hkfp_20191111_officersupsended\"/><ref name=\"guardian_20191111_policeshoot\"/> while a police van suddenly accelerated into a crowd of protesters, causing a [[stampede]] as STS officers exiting from the van chased after protesters in [[Yau Ma Tei]] on 18 November. The police defended the latter action as an appropriate response by well-trained officers to attacks by protesters, and that \"[driving] fast doesn't mean it is unsafe\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191119_drivingintoprotesters\"/>\n\nThe police have also been accused of locking down Prince Edward Station, thereby preventing medical personnel from treating the wounded inside,<ref name=\"hkfp_20190901_mtrclosed\" /> and of obstructing paramedics from helping Alex Chow Tsz-Lok, thereby delaying treatment, a claim that the police denied.<ref name=\"nyt_20191107_studentdies\"/> Its arrest of voluntary medics during the siege of PolyU was condemned by medical professionals.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191123_policemedics\"/> The police were also accused of using excessive force on already subdued, compliant arrestees.

police sought to counter this development, and suggested that in several instances, verbal abuse by protesters may have led officers to use the term.<ref name=\"wp_20191104_insultsdangerous\"/> An officer was reprimanded by the police for shouting derisive comments to protesters about the [[death of Chow Tsz-lok]].<ref name=\"scmp_3037087\"/> The police's description of a man wearing a yellow vest, who was taken to an alley, surrounded by police officers and apparently physically abused by one of them, as a \"yellow object\" due to supposedly impossible recognition of a person in the video footage, was widely criticised.<ref name=\"standardhk_211952\"/>\n\n===Accountability of the HKPF===\nThe [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) has launched investigations into alleged police misconducts in the protests, although the protesters demand an independent commission of inquiry instead, as the members of the IPCC are mainly pro-establishment and IPCC lacks the power to investigate, make definitive judgements and hand out penalties.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190704_policewatchdog\"/><ref name=\"eji_20190822\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\"/> [[Carrie Lam]] has rejected this demand and insisted that the IPCC was able to fulfill the task.<ref name=\"scmp_3025948\"/><ref name=\"diplomat_20190725_notjust\"/> On 8 November, a five-member expert panel, headed by Sir [[Denis O'Connor (police officer)|Denis O'Connor]] and appointed by Lam in September 2019 to advise the IPCC, concluded that the police watchdog lacked the \"powers, capacity and independent investigative capability necessary\" to fulfill its role as a police watchdog group and suggested the formation of an independent commission of inquiry given the current protest situation.<ref name=\"hkstandard_136821\"/> Members of the panel quit after negotiations to increase the IPCC's powers fell through. The panel reiterated their criticisms of the IPCC, while the IPCC chairman [[Anthony Neoh]] said that the suggestions by the expert panel have exceeded the \"statutory functions\" of the police watchdog.<ref name=\"rthk_1496472\"/><ref name=\"rthk_1497054\"/>\n\nThe police modified the Police General Orders by removing the sentence \"officers will be accountable for their own actions\" ahead of the 1 October confrontation. Police commanders reportedly ignored the wrongdoings and the unlawful behaviours of frontline riot police and refused to use any of the disciplinary measure to avoid upsetting them. As of December 2019, no officer has been suspended for their actions. The lack of prosecution against officers sparked fears that the police cannot be held accountable for their actions and that they are immune to any legal consequence; as of 24 December 2019, no police have been charged or prosecuted over protest-related actions.<ref name=\"WPost Police misconduct\"/>\n\n==Impacts==\n===Effects on economy===\n[[File:Hong Kong IMG 20190726 161256 (48379850001).jpg|thumb|left|Protest at the [[Hong Kong International Airport]] on 26 July 2019.]]\n\nOfficial total statistics showed that Hong Kong had slipped into recession as its economy had shrunk in the second and third quarters of 2019.<ref name=\"bi_20191029_retailersdestroyed\"/> Retail sales have declined and consumers' appetite for spending has decreased.<ref name=\"scmp_3017580\"/> During the days of protests, protesters brought \"mixed fortunes\" to the businesses according to the ''[[South China Morning Post]]''. Some restaurants saw their customers cancelling their bookings and some banks and shops were forced to shut their doors. Supplies for goods were also halted and obstructed due to the protest. Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners. Fearing the instability in Hong Kong, some investors abandoned the purchases of land. Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting. Many mainland tourists avoided travelling to Hong Kong due to safety concerns. Various countries have since issued travel warnings to Hong Kong.<ref name=\"bbc_49276259\"/>\n\n===Effects on society===\n[[Carrie Lam as Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Lam's administration]] received criticisms for its performance during the protests.

name=\"hkfp_20190707_missingleader\"/> At a press conference on 5 August, Lam explained her absence from the public eye in the preceding two weeks by the risks for organisers regarding possible disruption of public events and press conferences by protesters.<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> According to polls conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, Lam's approval ratings declined to 22.3 in October, lowest among all chief executives, and her performance was categorised as \"disastrous\" alongside [[Secretary for Security]] [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] and [[Secretary for Justice (Hong Kong)|Secretary for Justice]] [[Teresa Cheng (politician)|Teresa Cheng]], prompting institute director [[Robert Chung]] to describe the situation as \"dire\".<ref name=\"hkfp_20191009_ratingplunges\"/> [[Ma Ngok]], a political scientist, remarked that the government \"has lost the trust of a whole generation\" and predicted that the youths would remain angry at both the government and the police \"for years to come\".<ref name=\"guardian_20190811_lacktrust\"/> According to ''[[The Diplomat]]'', there was also the emergence of the concept of \"mutually assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts within the government were also formed with Lennon Walls being set up in government offices and civil servants organising rallies.<ref name=\"scmp_3020206\"/>\n\n[[File:P1120823 (49001440122).jpg|thumb|left|A riot police officer held up a blue flag warning the protesters to disperse in an unapproved march.]]\nThe reputation of the police has taken a serious drubbing following the heavy-handed treatment of protesters.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190625_policeconfusion\"/><ref name=\"standardhk_132961\"/> In October, a survey conducted by CUHK revealed that more than 50% of the respondents were deeply dissatisfied with the police's performance.<ref name=\"independent_9158061\"/> According to some reports, the police's aggressive behaviours and tactics have caused them to become a symbol that represented hostility and suppression and police's actions on the protesters has resulted in a breakdown of citizens' trust towards the police.<ref name=\"aljazeera_191101070008742\"/><ref name=\"atlantic_597205\"/><ref name=\"hkfp_20180628_lostgoodwill\"/> Citizens were also concerned about the police's ability to regulate and control itself and feared about its abuse of power.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190910_offdutybatons\"/> The suspected acts of police brutality have turned some politically neutral citizens to become more sympathetic with the young protesters.<ref name=\"wsj_11567458226\"/> Fearing Hong Kong changing into a [[police state]], some citizens were actively considering emigration.<ref name=\"cnn_20191008_hkleave\"/> For the police, some lower-ranking officers reported feeling \"lost and confused\", citing \"a lack of leadership\" during important moments,<ref name=\"reuters_20190717_underpressure\"/> and was reportedly discontent with the government, as its extended absence left the police to be the only group to clash with the protesters, resulting in the two groups developing immense mutual hatred for each other.<ref name=\"ft_20190830_policefurious\"/> The police has cancelled foot patrol due to fear that they may be attacked,<ref name=\"scmp_3025140\"/> and issued extendable batons to off-duty

strained.\n\nTo cope with the ongoing protests, on 15 November 2019, the police had appointed no more than 100 [[Correctional Services Department]] officers as special constables to assist the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3038039\"/> Due to internal redeployment of staff within the force to deal with the protests, anti-crime operations were \"smaller and less frequent than in the past\". Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

The police later backed down on the claim, saying that among the protesters, only five of them rioted. Protesters have since demanded the government to fully retract the riot characterisation.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_backdown\"/> Lam's analogy as Hong Kong people's mother attracted criticisms after the violent crackdown on 12 June.<ref name=\"standardhk_129667\"/>\n\nLam announced the suspension of the bill on 15 June,<ref name=\"scmp_3014669\"/> and officially apologised to the public on 18 June two days after another massive march.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190618_sincereapologies\"/> In early July, Lam reiterated that the bill \"had passed away\" and reaffirmed that all efforts to amend the law had ceased, though her use of language was thought to be ambiguous.<ref name=\"guardian_20190709_deadbill\"/> During July and August, the government insisted that it would not make any concessions, and that Lam could still lead the government despite calls asking her to resign. For the demand to set up an independent commission to investigate police misconduct, she insisted that the existing mechanism, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]] (IPCC) would suffice.<ref name=\"scmp_3017795\"/><ref name=\"coconutshk_20190709\"/>\n\nAfter condemning the protesters for storming the legislature on 1 July for their \"use of extreme violence\"<ref name=\"hkfp_20190702_condemnsoccupation\"/> and defacing the national emblem during the 21 July protest,<ref name=\"coconutshk_20190722\"/> Lam suggested in early August that the protests had derailed from their original purposes and that its goal was to challenge China's sovereignty and damage \"[[one country, two systems]]\".<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\"/> She suggested that the radical protesters were dragging Hong Kong to a \"point of no return\"<ref name=\"scmp_3021459\" /> and that they had \"no stake in society\",<ref name=\"standardhk_132809\"/> a remark that received criticisms from some civil servants.<ref name=\"standardhk_133040\"/>\n\nFollowing a rally on 18 August that was attended by more than 1.7&nbsp;million people, Lam announced that she would create platforms for dialogue.<ref name=\"scmp_3023512\"/> On 4 September, Lam announced that she would formally withdraw the extradition bill, introduce measures such as introducing new members to the IPCC, engaging in dialogue in a community level, and inviting academics to evaluate the deep-rooted problems of Hong Kong. However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

conference, Carrie Lam used a Cantonese phrase to say the proposed legislation was 'reaching the end of its life.' Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations.

As there is no extradition treaty with Taiwan (because the [[government of China]] does not recognise its [[Political status of Taiwan|sovereignty]]), the Hong Kong government proposed an amendment to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|503}}) and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance ({{cite Hong Kong ordinance|525}}) to establish a mechanism for case-by-case transfers of fugitives, on the order of the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]], to any jurisdiction with which the city lacks a formal extradition treaty.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /> One such jurisdiction would be mainland China.\n\nThe inclusion of mainland China in the amendment is of concern to different sectors of Hong Kong society. Pro-democracy advocates fear the removal of the separation of the region's jurisdiction from mainland Chinese laws administered by the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]], thereby eroding the \"[[one country, two systems]]\" principle in practice since the 1997 handover. In addition, Hong Kong citizens also lacked confidence in China's judiciary system and human rights protection due to its history of suppressing political dissidents.<ref name=theconversation118753>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/mass-protests-protect-hong-kongs-legal-autonomy-from-china-for-now-118753|title=Mass protests protect Hong Kong's legal autonomy from China \u2013 for now|first=Kelly|last=Chernin|work=[[The Conversation]]|date=18 June 2019|accessdate=14 January 2020}}</ref> Opponents of the bill urged the Hong Kong government to explore other avenues, such as establishing an extradition arrangement solely with Taiwan, and to [[Sunset provision|sunset]] the arrangement immediately after the surrender of the suspect.<ref name=\"scmp_3004067\" /><ref name=\"scmp_3006463\" />\n\nA [[Reuters]] report claims that the Beijing officials had been pushing for an extradition law for 20 years. [[Xiao Jianhua]], a Chinese billionaire residing in Hong Kong, was allegedly abducted by Chinese agents across the border in January 2017 as a spillover of China's [[paramount leader]] and [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|general secretary]] [[Xi Jinping]]'s mass [[Anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping|anti-graft campaign]]. The incident was widely reported in Hong Kong, sparking fear among residents. That same year, the [[Central Commission for Discipline Inspection]] (CCDI), the [[Chinese Communist Party]]'s internal anti-corruption body, began pressing Beijing officials in charge of Hong Kong affairs about the urgent need for an extradition arrangement, which it thought to be less damaging politically than kidnapping for snaring fugitive mainlanders in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"reuters_20191220_hkrevolt\"/>\n\n===Underlying causes===\nThe 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests came four and a half years after the [[Umbrella Revolution]] of 2014. It had begun after the [[2014 NPCSC Decision on Hong Kong|decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress]] (NPCSC) regarding [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform|proposed reforms to the Hong Kong electoral system]], which were largely seen as restrictive. However, the movement ended in failure as the government offered no concessions.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Since then, [[democratic development in Hong Kong|democratic development]] has stalled: only half of the seats in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|Legislative Council]] remain directly elected, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues to be voted by the small-circle [[Election Committee]]. The [[2017 imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists]] further dashed the city's hope of meaningful political reform.<ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Citizens began to fear the loss of the \"high degree of autonomy\" as provided for in the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]], as the government of the People's Republic of China appeared to be increasingly and overtly interfering with Hong Kong's affairs. Notably, the [[Hong Kong Legislative Council oath-taking controversy|Legislative Council oath-taking controversy]] ended with the disqualification of six lawmakers following a ruling by the NPCSC; the [[Causeway Bay Books disappearances]] sparked concerns over state-sanctioned rendition and [[extrajudicial detention]].<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /><ref name=\"time_5661211\" /> Another example considered representing Hong Kong losing its freedoms is its steady fall on the [[Economist Intelligence Unit|Economist Intelligence Unit's]] [[Democracy Index]]. Despite [[universal suffrage]] being part of Hong Kong's basic law, in the 2019 report Hong Kong was scored&nbsp;6.02/10, classing it in the index as a \"[[Illiberal democracy|flawed democracy]]\", being only 0.02&nbsp;points off a [[hybrid regime]]. Hong Kong was only scored&nbsp;3.59/10 for Electoral process and pluralism. This was the lowest score in the category for a flawed democracy and lower than some [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries. Of 167 countries, Hong Kong ranked&nbsp;75th while mainland China ranked&nbsp;153rd.<ref name=thestandard215668>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestandard.com.hk/section-news/section/4/215668/Hong-Kong-barely-passes-as-%27flawed-democracy%27|title=Hong Kong barely passes as 'flawed democracy'|last=Standard|first=The|website=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]|access-date=19 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=democracyindex2019|title=Democracy Index 2019 A year of democratic setbacks and popular protest|website=[[Economist Intelligence Unit|EIU.com]]|url-access=registration|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe rise of [[Localism in Hong Kong|localism]] and the [[Hong Kong independence|pro-independence movement]] was marked by the campaign for the [[2016 New Territories East by-election]] by activist [[Edward Leung]].<ref name=\"scmp_3021518\" /> As fewer and fewer youth in Hong Kong identified themselves as Chinese, pollsters at the [[University of Hong Kong]] found that the younger respondents were, the more distrustful they were of the Chinese government.<ref name=\"bbc_48607723\" /> By 2019, almost no Hong Kong youth identified themselves as Chinese.<ref name=\"economist_20190826_almostnobody\" /> The [[Moral and National Education controversy]] in 2012 severely shook young people's confidence in the systems which they believed protected their rights. With the approach of 2047, when the Basic Law is set to expire along with the constitutional guarantees enshrined within it, sentiments of an uncertain future have driven youth to join the protests against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> For some protesters, the Umbrella Revolution was an inspiration that brought about a political awakening.<ref name=\"bbc_48655474\" /> Others, who felt that peaceful methods were ineffective, resorted to increasingly radical methods to express their views.<ref name=\"mingpao_1566064531\" /><ref name=\"hkfp_20190728_democracyfighters\" /> Media have noted that unlike the 2014 protests, protesters in 2019 were driven by a sense of desperation rather than hope,<ref name=\"guardian_20190702_moodhardens\" /><ref name=\"cnn_20190702_protestsdesperation\" /> and that the aims of the protests had evolved from withdrawing the bill to fighting for greater freedom and liberties.<ref name=\"time_20190815_summerunrest\" />\n\nUnaffordable housing prices were also cited as an underlying cause of anger among [[Hong Kongers]].<ref name=\"economist_20190822_unaffordablehousing\" /><ref name=\"aljazeera_190801151538867\" /> Hong Kong is \"the world's most expensive city to buy a home\".<ref name=\"cnbc_20190412_averageprice\" /> Hong Kong has not secured affordable or public housing for the city's population<ref name=\"scmp_3020789\" /> because, since the [[British Hong Kong|colonial period]], the city's politics have been ruled largely by the business elite.<ref name=\"scmp_1618427\" /> This has meant a few powerful families have significant influence over [[property development]], with the construction of commercial properties on key real estate with limited competition.<ref name=\"scmp_3025260\" /><ref name=\"scmp_2125469\" /> With the business elites exerting great influence, Hong Kong also suffers from [[income disparity]].<ref name=\"disparity\"/> The city had the second highest [[Gini Coefficient]] in the world in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/hong-kong-is-one-of-the-most-unequal-cities-in-the-world-so-why-arent-the-protesters-angry-at-the-rich-and-powerful-123866|title=What hope for the poorest?

Following an escalation in the severity of policing tactics against demonstrators on 12&nbsp;June, the protesters objective has been to achieve the following five demands (under the slogan \"Five demands, not one less\"):<ref name=\"focustw_20190627_urgeg20\" />\n* '''Complete withdrawal of the extradition bill from the legislative process''': Although the chief executive announced an indefinite suspension of the bill on 15&nbsp;June, the reading of it may be resumed quickly. The bill was \"pending resumption of second reading\" in the [[Legislative Council of Hong Kong|legislative council]]. It was formally withdrawn on 23&nbsp;October.<ref name=\"reuters_20191023_officiallykilled\" />\n* '''Retraction of the \"riot\" characterisation''': The government originally characterised the 12&nbsp;June protest as \"riots\". Later the description was amended to say there were \"some\" protesters who rioted. However, protesters contest the existence of acts of rioting during the 12&nbsp; June protest. Through the government's characterisation of the protests as \"riots\", any protester who was arrested could spend up to 10 years in prison.\n* '''Release and exoneration of arrested protesters''': Protesters consider the arrests to be politically motivated; they also question the legitimacy of police arresting protesters at hospitals through access to their confidential medical data in breach of patient privacy.\n* '''Establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into police conduct and use of force during the protests''': Civic groups felt that the level of violence used by the police on 12&nbsp;June, specifically that against protesters who were not committing any offences when they were set upon, was unjustified; police performing stop-and-search on numerous passers-by near the protest site without probable cause was also considered abusive.<ref name=\"rfa_06112019114440\" /> Some officers' failure to display or show their police identification number or warrant card, despite being required to do so by the Police General Orders,<!-- PGO is technically not law --> is seen to be a breakdown of accountability.<ref name=\"standnews_20190627\" /> The existing watchdog, the [[Independent Police Complaints Council]], lacks independence, and its functioning relies on police co-operation. As the number of allegations of police brutality and misconduct continued to increase, some Hong Kong protesters began to call for the disbandment of the police force.<ref name=\"scmp_3030211\" />\n* '''Resignation of [[Carrie Lam]] and the implementation of universal suffrage for [[Hong Kong legislative elections|Legislative Council elections]] and for the election of the Chief Executive''':<ref name=\"nyt_20190708_moredemocracy\" /> Currently, the chief executive is selected by the 1,200-member [[Election Committee]], and 30 of the 70 legislative council seats are filled by representatives from different sectors of the economy, forming the majority of the so-called [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], most of which have few electors.\n\n==History==\n===Early demonstrations===\n{{Main|Timeline of the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests (March\u2013June 2019)}}\n\n[[File:Harcourt Road tear smoke view1 20190612.jpg|left|thumb|The police used [[tear gas]] to disperse protesters gathering outside the Legislative Council Complex on 12 June.]]\nA sit-in by the pro-democracy group [[Demosist\u014d]] held at the [[Central Government Complex (Hong Kong)|Central Government Complex]] on 15&nbsp;March was the first protest against the extradition bill.<ref name=\"now_340955\" /> The [[Civil Human Rights Front]] (CHRF), a platform for 50 [[pro-democracy camp (Hong Kong)|pro-democracy groups]], launched a protest march against the bill on 31&nbsp;March 2019 and another on 28&nbsp;April 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190331_12000protest\" /> The anti-extradition issue attracted more attention when pro-democratic lawmakers in the legislative council launched a [[filibuster]] campaign against the bill. In response, the Secretary of Security [[John Lee (government official)|John Lee]] announced that the government would resume second reading of the bill in full council on 12&nbsp;June, bypassing the Bills Committee, whose role would have been to scrutinise it.<ref name=\"scmp_3011104\" />\n\nWith the possibility of a second reading of the bill, the CHRF launched their third protest march on 9&nbsp;June.

Meanwhile, some shops prospered as nearby protesters bought food and other commodities.<ref name=\"scmp_3014240\"/> Due to lower consumer spending, several luxury brands delayed the opening of their shops.<ref name=scmp3038400>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3038400/chanel-rimowa-delay-new-stores-prada-moving-out-sales|title=Chanel, Rimowa delay new stores, Prada moving out, sales plummet at Moncler, Gucci \u2013 will Hong Kong become city of 'ghost malls'?|first=Vincenzo|last=La Torre|work=[[South China Morning Post]]|date=20 November 2019|accessdate=19 February 2020}}</ref> Protest supplies such as gas masks were running low in stock in both Hong Kong and Taiwan.<ref name=\"asiatimes_20190813_gasmasks\"/>\n\nThe protests also affected property owners.

Desire to purchase properties also declined, as overall property transactions declined by 24% when compared with the Umbrella Revolution. Property developers were forced to reduce the selling price.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/> Trade shows reported decreased attendance and revenue, and many firms cancelled their events in Hong Kong.<ref name=\"scmp_3037982\"/> The [[Hang Seng Index]] declined by at least 4.8% from 9 June to late August. As interest in trading waned, companies that had already applied for [[initial public offering]]s (IPO) in Hong Kong urged their bankers to put their listing on hold. August 2019 recorded only one IPO, which was the lowest since 2012, and two large IPOs were shelved respectively in June and July. [[Fitch Ratings]] downgraded Hong Kong's sovereignty rating from AA+ to AA due to doubts over the government's ability to maintain the \"one country, two systems\" principle; the outlook of the city was similarly lowered from \"stable\" to \"negative\".<ref name=\"scmp_3026109\"/>\n\nTourism was also affected. The number of visitors travelling to Hong Kong declined by 40% in August 2019 compared to August 2018,<ref name=\"reuters_20190909_40%plunge\"/> while the decline was 31.9% for the days during and after [[National Day of the People's Republic of China|National Day]].<ref name=\"cnn_20191010_holidaydip\"/> As a consequence, both the tourist sector and the food and beverage industry saw an increased unemployment rate.<ref name=\"scmp_3024412\"/><ref name=\"scmp_3034595\"/> Flight bookings also declined, with airlines cutting or reducing their services.<ref name=\"scmp_3038102\"/> During the airport protests on 12 and 13 August 2019, the [[Airport Authority Hong Kong|Airport Authority]] cancelled numerous flights, which resulted in an estimated US$76&nbsp;million loss according to aviation experts.<ref name=\"cna_11842026\"/> [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] also revealed that there were fewer guests visiting.

assured destruction\" ({{zh|labels=no|t=\u652c\u7092}}) where protesters became more radical to compel the administration to concede, while the establishment waited for their increase in aggressiveness so that they can justify the greater militarisation of the police and dismissed the protesters as \"insurgents\" and their demands.<ref name=\"diplomat_20190906_madrhetoric\"/> Rifts

Criminals also had taken advantage of the lowered police presence to commit crimes,<ref name=\"scmp_3042048\"/> leading to certain types of crimes such as home and shop burglaries being committed between June and October 2019 with higher frequency as compared to the same period in 2018.<ref name=\"scmp_3035418\"/> The Hong Kong government has spent nearly HK$950&nbsp;million for officers' overtime payments during the protests in the period from June to November 2019.<ref name=\"hkfp_20191213_overtimepay\"/>\n\nThe protests have deepened the rift between the \"yellow\" (pro-democracy) and \"blue\" (pro-government) camps created since the Umbrella Revolution. People who oppose the protests in a self-dubbed \"[[silent majority]]\", including wavering sideline supporters and moderates who say that they have been driven away by the violence, argued that protesters were spreading \"chaos and fear\" across the city, causing damage to the economy and harming people not involved in the protests. On the other hand, protesters justified their actions by what they saw as the greater good of protecting the city's freedoms against the encroachment of mainland China.<ref

However, protesters and democrats had previously affirmed that all the five core demands must be answered.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_billwithdrawn\"/> Her concession was described as \"too little, too late\", as the conflicts would not have escalated if she had withdrawn the bill during the early stage of the protest.<ref name=\"hkfp_20190904_toolittle\" /><ref name=\"medium_20190907_govburn\"/> The first dialogue session was held on 26 September.

Her government suspended the progress of the bill after demonstrations last month ... 'We suspended it and we have no timetable,' Lam said. 'What I said today is not very different from before, but maybe people want to hear a very firm response ... the bill has actually died. So people won't need to worry that there will be renewed discussions on the bill in the current legislature.' Protesters rejected her remarks and promised to continue the demonstrations. Figo Chan Ho-wun of the Civil Human Rights Front said: 'I urge Carrie Lam not to use words to deceive us.

Today, the large lake on the east side of Little Canada bears his name (Lake Gervais). The grist mill was converted into a park, which is recognized as the birthplace of the city.  Little Canada began as the township of New Canada in 1858. In the 1950s the township was threatened by the suburban sprawl of the ensuing larger communities that were formed, such as [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]].  In 1953, the city leaders came together and established the village of Little Canada. It became a city in 1974.\n\n===Canadian Ties===\nThe city displays the Canadian influence in its history in several ways. Its official symbol is an initial LC on a white [[fleur-de-lis]] with a red Maple Leaf background, and the [[Flag of Canada]] is displayed in council chambers.<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | last = Scrivener\n  | first = Leslie\n  | author-link =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = O Little Canada, a home away from home\n  | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]]\n  | pages = A1\n  | date = 2007-07-01 ([[Canada Day]])\n  | url = https://www.thestar.com/article/231344}}</ref>\n\nThe city itself also hosts an annual celebration named ''Canadian Days'' in early August with its sister city [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], in Canada.\n\n===Sister cities===\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]] since 1977\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.48|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.89|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nInterstate Highway [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|35E]], Interstate Highway [[Interstate 694|694]], and Minnesota Highway [[Minnesota State Highway 36|36]] are three of the main routes in the city.

Today, the large lake on the east side of Little Canada bears his name (Lake Gervais). The grist mill was converted into a park, which is recognized as the birthplace of the city.  Little Canada began as the township of New Canada in 1858. In the 1950s the township was threatened by the suburban sprawl of the ensuing larger communities that were formed, such as [[Maplewood, Minnesota|Maplewood]].  In 1953, the city leaders came together and established the village of Little Canada. It became a city in 1974.\n\n===Canadian Ties===\nThe city displays the Canadian influence in its history in several ways. Its official symbol is an initial LC on a white [[fleur-de-lis]] with a red Maple Leaf background, and the [[Flag of Canada]] is displayed in council chambers.<ref>\n{{Citation\n  | last = Scrivener\n  | first = Leslie\n  | author-link =\n  | author2-link =\n  | title = O Little Canada, a home away from home\n  | newspaper = [[Toronto Star]]\n  | pages = A1\n  | date = 2007-07-01 ([[Canada Day]])\n  | url = https://www.thestar.com/article/231344}}</ref>\n\nThe city itself also hosts an annual celebration named ''Canadian Days'' in early August with its sister city [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]], in Canada.\n\n===Sister cities===\n* {{flagicon|Canada}} [[Thunder Bay]], [[Ontario]] since 1977\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|4.48|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|3.89|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nInterstate Highway [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|35E]], Interstate Highway [[Interstate 694|694]], and Minnesota Highway [[Minnesota State Highway 36|36]] are three of the main routes in the city.
