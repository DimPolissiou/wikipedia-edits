In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to show falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Another example is \"this angel does not have large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

However, when these predictions were not in fact borne out, the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ''ad hoc'' hypotheses which made it compatible with the facts. By this means, Popper asserted, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudo-scientific dogma.\"}}\n\nSome economists, such as those of the [[Austrian School]], believe that [[macroeconomics]] is [[Empiricism|empirically]] unfalsifiable and that thus the only appropriate means to understand economic events is by [[deductive reasoning|logically]] studying [[Subjective theory of value|the intentions]] of [[methodological individualism|individual economic decision-makers]], [[Praxeology#Austrian School approach|based on]] certain fundamental [[Action axiom|truths]].{{sfn|Heath|2015}}{{sfn|Mises|1998|p=11}} Prominent figures within the Austrian School of economics, [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]] were associates of Karl Popper, with whom they co-founded the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n\n===Evolution===\n{{Main|Objections to evolution#Unfalsifiability|l1=Objections to evolution: Unfalsifiability}}\nNumerous examples of potential (indirect) ways to falsify common descent have been proposed by its proponents. [[J.B.S. Haldane]], when asked what hypothetical evidence could disprove evolution, replied \"[[precambrian rabbit|fossil rabbits in the Precambrian era]]\".{{sfn|Ridley|2003}} [[Richard Dawkins]] adds that any other modern animal, such as a hippo, would suffice.{{sfn|Wallis|2005}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1995}}{{sfn|Dawkins|1986}} [[Karl Popper]] at first spoke against the testability of natural selection{{sfn|Popper|1982b}}{{sfn|Popper|1976}} but recanted, \"I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection, and I am glad to have the opportunity to make a recantation.\"{{sfn|Popper|1978}}\n\n===Young-earth creationism===\n{{Main|Omphalos hypothesis}}\nMuch of the criticism against [[young-Earth creationism]] is based on evidence in nature that the Earth is much older than adherents believe.  Confronting such evidence, some adherents make an [[Omphalos hypothesis|argument]] (called the [[Omphalos hypothesis]]) that the world was created with the appearance of age; e.g., the sudden appearance of a mature chicken capable of laying eggs.  This hypothesis is non-falsifiable since no evidence about the age of the earth (or any astronomical feature) can be shown not to be fabricated during creation.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Historicism===\nTheories of [[history]] or politics that allegedly predict future events have a [[logical form]] that renders them neither falsifiable nor verifiable. They claim that for every historically significant event, there exists an historical or economic law that ''determines'' the way in which events proceeded. Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims. Again, this does not mean that any of these types of theories is necessarily ''incorrect''.

Thus a few stray basic statements contradicting a theory will hardly induce us to reject it as falsified. We shall take it as falsified only if we discover a reproducible effect which refutes the theory.

In the philosophy of science, it is the same, except that the observations used to show falsifiability are logical constructions that can be impossible.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> For example, the law \"All swans are white\" is falsifiable because  \"Here is a black swan\" contradicts it and, even if it was impossible, it would still contradict it and make the law falsifiable.<ref name=\"blackswanimpossible\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nFalsifiability was introduced by the [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] [[Karl Raimund Popper|Karl Popper]] in his book ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'' (1934), as an answer to both the [[Problem of Induction]] and  the [[Demarcation Problem]].  He saw falsifiability as the cornerstone of [[critical rationalism]], his theory of science.{{sfn|Popper|1989|pp=82-85}}\n\nIt differs from [[Logical_positivism|verifiability]], which was held as fundamental by many philosophers such as those of the [[Vienna Circle]]. In order to verify the claim \"All swans are white\" one would have to observe every swan, which is not possible, whereas the single observation \"Here is a black swan\" is sufficient to falsify it. \n\nAs a key notion in the separation of science from non-science, it has featured prominently in many scientific controversies and applications, even being used as legal precedent.\n\n==The problem of induction==\nOne of the questions in [[Scientific method]] is: how does one move from observations to laws? This is the [[problem of induction]].  Suppose we want to put the theory that all swans are white to the test. We come across a white swan. We cannot validly argue from \"here is a white swan\" to \"all swans are white\"; doing so would require a fallacious logic such as, for example, [[affirming the consequent]].<ref name=\"affirmtheconsequentVsinductivelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>{{sfn|Grayling|2019|p=397}}\n\nPopper's solution to this problem is to flip it upside down. He noticed that while it is impossible to verify that every swan is white, finding a single black swan shows that ''not'' every swan is  white. We might tentatively accept the proposal that every swan is white, while looking out for examples of non-white swans that would show our conjecture to be false. This is the basis of critical rationalism. \n\nFalsification uses the valid inference [[modus tollens]]: if from a statement <math>P</math> (say some law with some initial condition) we logically deduce {{nowrap|<math>Q</math>,}} but what is observed is {{nowrap|<math>\\neg Q</math>,}} we infer that <math>P</math> is false. For example, given the law \"all swans are white\" and the initial condition \"there is a swan here\", we can deduce \"the swan here is white\", but if what is observed is \"the swan here is not white\" (say black), then \"all swans are white\" is false, or it was not a swan.<ref name=\"swandecision\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper was aware that a too simplistic view on critical rationalism would be subject to valid criticisms. [[Imre Lakatos|Lakatos]], realizing that Popper's critical rationalism was misunderstood, contrasted it with  weaker versions, which he called dogmatic falsificationism and naive falsificationism.{{sfn|Lakatos|1978|pp=12-30}} Popper's critical rationalism is not (and never has been) one of these two weak versions.<ref name=\"lakatoscreditPopper\" group=upper-alpha/> Also, on the terminological side of this issue, Popper never used the term \"falsificationism\"<ref name=\"poppernotfalsificationismism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> and proposed instead the term \"critical rationalism\".<ref name=\"popperproposecriticalrationalism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>     \n\n===Away from dogmatic falsificationism===\nA dogmatic falsificationist ignores that every observation is theory impregnated. This leads to the critique that we cannot tell which theory is falsified. Is it the one that is being studied or the one behind the observation?<ref name=duhemcritic group=\"upper-alpha\"/> This is sometimes called the 'Duhem\u2013Quine problem'. [[Duhem\u2013Quine_thesis#Example_from_Galilean_astronomy|An example is Galileo's refutation]] of the time-honoured theory that celestial bodies are faultless crystal balls. Many considered that it was the optical theory of the telescope that was false, not the theory of celestial bodies. A dogmatic falsificationist ignores a more subtle fact: only statements can contradict statements. So, it is fundamentally incorrect to say that an observation contradicts a theory. \n\nA dogmatic falsificationist further ignores the role of auxiliary hypotheses, which could explain the contradicting observation. For the falsification to logically occur, we need a [[ceteris paribus]] clause, which says that no auxiliary hypothesis is responsible for the contradicting observation. Again, this leads to the critique that we cannot tell if it is the theory or the ceteris paribus clause that is false. Lakatos gives the example of the path of a planet. If the path contradicts Newton's law, we will not know if it is Newton's law that is false or the assumption that no other body influenced the path.  Popper was aware that one can always find another auxiliary hypothesis,{{efn-ua | [[Falsifiability#CITEREFPopper1959|Popper 1959]]. p.19: \"It might be said that even if the asymmetry [between universal and existential statements] is admitted, it is still impossible, for various reasons, that any theoretical system should ever be conclusively falsified. For it is always possible to find some way of evading falsification, for example by introducing ad hoc an auxiliary hypothesis, or by changing ad hoc a definition. It is even possible without logical inconsistency to adopt the position of simply refusing to acknowledge any falsifying experience whatsoever. Admittedly, scientists do not usually proceed in this way, but logically such procedure is possible; and this fact, it might be claimed, makes the logical value of my proposed criterion of demarcation dubious, to say the least.\"}} though he clearly distinguished falsifiable theories such as Newton theory and non falsifiable theories on this respect.<ref name=\"popperagainstceterispabirus\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> \n\nLakatos explains that Popper's solution to these valid criticisms against dogmatic falsificationism requires that we relax the dogmatic assumption that an observation can show a theory to be false<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>: {{Quote| If a theory is falsified [in the usual sense], it is proven false; if it is ''falsified'' [in the technical sense], it may still be true. | author=Imre Lakatos| source={{harvnb|Lakatos|1978|p=24}}}}\nMethodological falsificationism replaces the contradicting observation in a falsification with a \"contradicting observation\" accepted by convention among scientists, a convention that implies three decisions: the theory underlying the observation is correct, no auxiliary hypotheses explain this observation and the written form of the observation matches with an actual observation.<ref name=\"twootherdecisions\" group=\"upper-alpha\"> Lakatos add two other decisions. One of them is needed to accept statistical statements as falsifiable. The other allows even more falsifiable theories.</ref> The falsifiers thus depend on decisions made by scientists in view of the currently accepted technology and its associated theory. So, Popper says that \"Science does not rest upon solid bedrock\".<ref name=\"theswamp\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> He also says (see section [[Falsifiability#Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability| Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability]]) that it's not an obstacle to the definition of an empirical basis and of falsifiability.\n\n===Away from naive falsificationism===\nNaive falsificationism is the claim that methodological falsifications can by themselves explain how we gain scientific knowledge. Very often we must deal with two or more competing theories which can both be non-falsified (say by not making the proper decisions). Considering only falsifications, we cannot explain why we pick one theory above the other. We cannot explain why often a corroborating experiment is seen as a sign of progress. Popper's falsificationism or critical rationalism use both falsifications and corroborations to explain progress in science.<ref name=\"poppernonnaive\" group=\"upper-alpha\" />  How corroborations and falsifications can explain progress in science was a subject of disagreement between many philosophers, especially between Lakatos and Popper.<ref name=\"popper01and2\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>\n\nPopper clearly distinguished between the creative and informal process from which theories emerge and the logical and formal process where theories are falsified or corroborated.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/><ref name=\"methodologydifferfrompurelogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"Poppermethodbeyondlogic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> The main issue is whether the decision to select a theory among competing theories in the light of falsifications and corroborations should be moved in the logical part as some kind of formal logic.<ref name=\"zaharonmaindivergence\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is a delicate question, because this logic could be considered as inductive: it selects a universal law in view of instances. The answer of Lakatos and many others to that question is that it should.<ref name=\"naivefalsificationism\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/><ref name=\"kuhncritic\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> In contradistinction, for Popper, the creative and informal part is guided by methodological rules, which naturally say to favor theories that are corroborated<ref name=\"arulethatusescorroborations\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, but this methodology can hardly be made rigorous.<ref  name=\"splitlogicmethod\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Popper does not mention corroborations when he describes the purely logical part.<ref  name=\"poppernoapriori\"  group=\"upper-alpha\"/>   \n\nPopper's way to analyze progress in science was through the concept of [[verisimilitude]], a way to define how close a theory is to the truth, which he did not consider very significant, except (as an attempt) to clarify a concept already clear in practice. Later, it was shown that the specific definition proposed by Popper cannot distinguish between two theories that are false, which is the case for all theories in the history of science.<ref name=\"verisimilitudenotsoanissue\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> Today, there is still on going research on the general concept of verisimilitude.{{sfn|Fine|2019}}\n\n==The demarcation problem==\n{{main|Demarcation problem}}\nPopper's response to the problem of induction is simply that we do not need induction. He claims that we actually never use induction in science.<ref name=\"neveruseinduction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  Instead, we conjecture the laws, test them and consider the results together with other aspects to decide which laws we apply in practice.{{sfn|Popper|1963}} In contradistinction, the logical positivism of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]], which included such philosophers as [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Otto Neurath]], and the [[logical empiricism]] of [[A.J. Ayer]], both hold that a law must, in principle, be empirically verifiable in order that it be scientific. Here, ''empirically verifiable'' means that observations can show it to be true. To defend his approach against this verifiability criterion, which was at the time the accepted approach to demarcate science from non-science, Popper criticized its practical side. He also criticized the basic philosophical motivation of the logical positivists.\n\nOn the practical side, Popper's dissatisfaction with the general attitude associated with verificationism originated with his encounter with psychoanalysis in the years 1910. It did not matter what observation was presented, psychoanalysis could explain it. Unfortunately, the reason why it could explain everything is that it did not exclude anything also. For Popper, this was a failure, because it meant that it could not make any prediction. From a logical standpoint, if we find an observation that does not contradict a law, it does not mean that the law is true.  A verification has no value in itself.  But, if the law makes risky predictions and these are corroborated, Popper says, we have a reason to prefer this law over another law that makes less risky predictions or no predictions at all.   \n\nOn the basic philosophical side, Popper noticed that the philosophers of the Vienna Circle had mixed two different problems, that of meaning and that of demarcation, and had proposed in verificationism a single solution to both: a statement that could not be verified was considered meaningless and thus useless.  In opposition to this view, Popper emphasized that there are meaningful theories that are not scientific, and that, accordingly, a criterion of meaningfulness does not coincide with a [[demarcation problem|criterion of demarcation]].\n\n==Basic statements and the definition of falsifiability==\nPopper has always drawn a clear distinction between the logic of science and its applied methodology.<ref  name=\"cleardistinctioncomplete\"  group=upper-alpha/>  The logical part consists of theories, statements and their purely logical relationship. The methodological part consists, in Popper's view, of informal rules, which we use to guess theories, accept observation statements as factual, etc.  When we apply this distinction to the term \"falsifiability\", it corresponds to a distinction between two completely different meanings of the term. The same is true for the term \"falsifiable\".  Popper explained that he only uses \"falsifiability\" or \"falsifiable\" in reference to the logical side and that, when he refers to the methodological side, he speaks of falsification and of its problems instead.<ref name=\"twomeanings\" group=upper-alpha/>  He was aware of the problems in the methodological side. He even proposed methodological rules to address them. For example, one such rule is that, if one refuses to go along with falsifications, then he has retired himself from the game of science. The logical side does not have the same problem as the methodological side, in particular with regard to the falsifiability of a theory, because  basic statements are not required to be possible. The methodological rules are only needed when we consider actual falsifications.  He wrote that an entire literature exists because this distinction was not understood.<ref name=\"somecontradiction\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  \n\n===Basic statements===\nIn Popper's view of science, statements of observation can be constructed within a logical structure independently of any factual observations.<ref name=\"fourlinesoftesting\" group=upper-alpha/>{{sfn|Thornton|2016|loc=sec. 4}}  The set of all purely logical observations that can be created constitutes the empirical \"basis\". Popper calls them the basic statements.  They are the statements that can be used to show the falsifiability of a theory. Popper insists that a basic statement does not have to be possible in practice. It is sufficient that the values or properties that appear in the observations are associated with technologies.  \n{{Annotated image\n| image = Guido Reni 031.jpg\n| image-left = 0\n| image-width = 290\n| image-top = -15    \n| height =  198       \n| annotations =       \n| caption = Even if we accept that angels exist, the sentence \"All angels have large wings\" is not falsifiable, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify these angels.\n}}\nPopper gives the example of an apple that moves from the ground up to a branch and then starts to dance from one branch to another.<ref name=\"appledancingexample\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/> It is clearly impossible, yet a valid potential falsifier for Newton's theory, because we can measure the position of the apple at different times. In contrast, \"this man is immortal\" is not a basic statement, because no technology can decide that a man is immortal. Indeed, \"All men are mortal\" is a classical example of an unfalsifiable statement. Yet another example is \"this angel has large wings\". It is not a basic statement, because though we know how to observe the absence of large wings, no technology (independent of the presence of wings) exists to identify angels.\n\nIn more than twelve pages of ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' {{harv|Popper|1959|loc=sec. 13-15, 28}}, Popper discusses informally which statements among those that can be constructed in the logical structure are basic statements. A logical structure uses universal classes to define laws. For example, in the law \"all swans are white\" the concept of swans is a universal class. It corresponds to a set of properties that every swan must have. It is not restricted to the swans that exist, existed or will exist. Informally, a basic statement is simply a statement that concerns only a finite number of specific instances in universal classes. In particular, an existential statement such as \"there exists a black swan\" is not a basic statement, because it is not specific about the instance. On the other hand, \"this swan here is black\" is a basic statement. Popper says that it is a singular existential statement or simply a singular statement. So, basic statements are singular (existential) statements.\n\n===The definition of falsifiability===\nThornton says that basic statements are statements that correspond to particular \"observation-reports\".  He then gives Popper's definition of falsifiability:  \n{{quote | text= \"A theory is scientific if and only if it divides the class of basic statements into the following two non-empty sub-classes: (a) the class of all those basic statements with which it is inconsistent, or which it prohibits\u2014this is the class of its potential falsifiers (i.e., those statements which, if true, falsify the whole theory), and (b) the class of those basic statements with which it is consistent, or which it permits (i.e., those statements which, if true, corroborate it, or bear it out).\"| author= Thornton, Stephen | source = {{harvnb|Thornton|2016|loc= at the end of section 3}} }}\n\nAs in the case of actual falsifiers, decisions must be taken by scientists to accept a logical structure and its associated empirical basis, but these are usually part of a background knowledge that scientists have in common and, often, no discussion is even necessary.<ref name=\"nodiscussionneededforbasicstatements\" group=upper-alpha/> This agreement, if we can speak of agreement when there is not even a discussion, exists only in principle. This is where the distinction between the logical and methodological sides of science becomes important. When an actual falsifier is proposed, the technology used is considered in details and, as mentioned in section [[Falsifiability#Away_from_dogmatic_falsificationism| Away from dogmatic falsificationism]],  an actual agreement is needed.  This may require that we use a deeper empirical basis<ref name=\"nosolidgrown\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>, hidden within the current empirical basis, to make sure that the properties or values used in the falsifier were obtained correctly ({{harvnb|Andersson|2016}} gives some examples). \n\nDespite the fact that the empirical basis can be shaky, more comparable to a swamp than to a solid ground, the definition that is given above is simply the formalization of a natural requirement on scientific theories, without which, Popper says, the whole logical process of science as we know it would not be possible.\n\n==Controversies==\n===Kuhn===\n{{main|Thomas Kuhn}}\n[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Thomas Kuhn]] emphasized aspects of science that were not much considered by Popper. In particular, he analyzed what he calls periods of normal science as well as revolutions from one period of normal science to another, whereas Popper's view is that only revolutions are relevant.<ref name=\"watkinsonPopperVsKuhn\" group=\"upper-alpha\"/>  For Popper, the role of science, mathematics and metaphysics, actually the role of any knowledge,  is to solve puzzles. In the same line of thought,  Kuhn observes that in periods of normal science the scientific theories, which are created under some paradigm, are used to routinely solve puzzles and the validity of the paradigm is hardly in question. It's only when important new puzzles emerge that cannot be solved by accepted theories that a revolution might occur. This can be seen as a viewpoint on the distinction made by Popper between the informal and formal process in science (see section [[#Away_from_naive_falsificationism |Away from_naive falsificationism]]). In the big picture presented by Kuhn, the routinely solved puzzles are corroborations. Falsifications or otherwise unexplained observations are unsolved puzzles. All of these are used in the informal process that generates a new kind of theory.  Kuhn says that Popper emphasizes formal or logical falsifications and fails to explain how the social and informal process works.\n\n===Feyerabend===\n{{main|Paul Feyerabend}}\nPaul Feyerabend examined the history of science with a more critical eye, and ultimately rejected any prescriptive methodology at all. He rejected Lakatos' argument for ad hoc hypothesis, arguing that science would not have progressed without making use of any and all available methods to support new theories. He rejected any reliance on a scientific method, along with any special authority for science that might derive from such a method.{{sfn|Martin|2017|p=}} Rather, he claimed that if one is keen to have a universally valid methodological rule, [[epistemological anarchism]] or ''anything goes'' would be the only candidate. For Feyerabend, any special status that science might have derives from the social and physical value of the results of science rather than its method.{{sfn | Broad | 1979 }}\n\n===Sokal and Bricmont===\nIn their book ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (from 1997, published in the UK as ''Intellectual Impostures'') the physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]] criticised falsifiability.  They include this critique in the \"Intermezzo\" chapter, where they expose their own views on truth in contrast to the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.  Even though Popper is clearly not a relativist, Sokal and Bricmont discuss falsifiability because they see postmodernist epistemological relativism as a reaction to Popper's insistence on falsifiability, and more generally, to his theory of science.\n\n==Applications==\n{{Missing information|how falsifiability relates to fundamental concepts such as probability theory and the principle of parsimony required to discuss most of its applications|talksection=talksection|date=April 2020}}\n===Use in courts of law===\nFalsifiability has been used in the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case (in 1982), the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case (in 1993) and other cases. A survey of 303 federal judges conducted in 1998 revealed that  \"[P]roblems with the nonfalsifiable nature of an expert\u2019s underlying theory and difficulties with an unknown or too-large error rate were cited in less than 2% of cases.\"{{efn-ua |Surveys were mailed to all active U.S. district court judges in November 1998 (N &#61; 619). 303 usable surveys were obtained for a response rate of 51%.}}\n\n==== ''McLean v. Arkansas'' case ====\nIn the ruling of the ''[[McLean v. Arkansas]]'' case, Judge [[William Overton (judge)|William Overton]] used falsifiability as one of the criteria to determine that \"[[creation science]]\" was not scientific and should not be taught in [[Arkansas]] [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] as such (it can be taught as religion). In his testimony, philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] defined the characteristics which constitute science as (see {{harvnb|Pennock|2000|p=5}} and {{harvnb|Ruse|2010}}):\n* It is guided by natural law;\n* It has to be  explanatory by reference to natural law; \n* It is testable against the empirical world;\n* Its conclusions are tentative, i.e., are not necessarily the final word; and\n* It is falsifiable.\nIn his conclusion related to this criterion Judge Overton stated that {{Quote|text=While anybody is free to approach a scientific inquiry in any fashion they choose, they cannot properly describe the methodology as scientific, if they start with the conclusion and refuse to change it regardless of the evidence developed during the course of the investigation.|sign=William Overton|source={{harvnb|McLean v. Arkansas|1982|loc=at the end of section IV. (C)}}}}\n\n==== ''Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals'' case ====\nIn the ''[[Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.|Daubert]]'' case, the [[majority opinion]] proposed the so-called [[Daubert standard#Definition|five Daubert factors]], which include falsifiability, to define a scientific methodology that is acceptable in courts of law.{{efn-ua | The Daubert case and subsequent cases that used it as a reference, including ''[[General Electric Co. v. Joiner]]'' and ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'', resulted in an amendment of the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]] (see {{harvnb|Rules of Evidence|2017|p=15|loc=Rule 702}} and {{harvnb|Rule 702 Notes|2011}}). The ''Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael'' case and other cases considered the original Daubert factors, but the amended rule, rule 702, even though it is often referred to as the [[Daubert standard]], does not include the original Daubert factors or mention falsifiability or [[testability]] and neither does the majority opinion delivered  by [[William Rehnquist]]  in the ''General Electric Co. v. Joiner'' case.}} These original Daubert factors have been cited in the ''[[Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael]]'' case and in the ''U.S. v. PRIME'' case {{harv|United States v. Prime|2002}}.  In the Daubert case, Associate Justice [[Harry Blackmun]], delivering the [[majority opinion]] of the [[United States Supreme Court]], has cited Popper and other philosophers of science: {{Quote|text=Ordinarily, a key question to be answered in determining whether  a  theory  or  technique  is  scientific  knowledge  that will  assist  the  trier  of  fact  will  be  whether  it  can  be  (and has been) tested.

Failure to identify the law does not mean that it does not exist, yet an event that satisfies the law does not prove the general case. Evaluation of such claims is at best difficult. On this basis, Popper \"fundamentally criticized historicism in the sense of any preordained prediction of history\"{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  and argued that neither [[Marxism]] nor [[psychoanalysis]] was science,{{sfn|Burton|2000|p=12-13}}  although both made such claims.

The film is an adaptation of [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'', a series of [[short film]]s of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as ''The Little Rascals'') which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood [[children]]. The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur, and [[Penelope Spheeris]]{{spaced ndash}}who also directed{{spaced ndash}}presents several of the ''Our Gang'' characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It was the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were ''[[Liar Liar]]'' and ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]''.\n\nAnother film based on ''[[Our Gang]]'', ''[[The Little Rascals Save the Day]]'', was released as a [[direct-to-video]] feature in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nSpanky McFarland ([[Travis Tedford]]) is the president of the \"He-Man Woman Haters Club\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer ([[Bug Hall]]), Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, \"The Blur\", in the upcoming [[Soap Box Derby]] go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.\n\nAt the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (whoopee cushion, cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down.\n\nDarla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo ([[Blake McIver Ewing]]), the new kid in town whose father ([[Donald Trump]]) is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, he is assigned by Stymie (Kevin Jamal Woods) to guard the go-kart until the day of the race.\n\nAlfalfa makes several attempts to win back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially denied entrance to her ballet recital, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a [[frog]] to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies, Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins), who chase them inside the building. To escape, Spanky and Alfalfa duck into a costume room and disguise themselves as ballerinas in pink tights, tutus, and wigs. They manage to evade the bullies, but they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises, which are tight and uncomfortable. They are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla, dressed in identical ballet outfits. The boys nervously pretend to be in the recital that is about to take place, but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress ([[Lea Thompson]]) enters and ushers them all on stage.\n\nThe recital begins, and the boys are horrified when the mistress announces they are performing scenes from \"The Nutcracker.\" Alfalfa hands the frog to Spanky, but Spanky drops the frog into the waistband of Alfalfa's tights. Alfalfa squirms in discomfort as the slimy frog wriggles around in his tights, turning the show to chaos as he tries to catch it while still dancing along. The girls break out into laughter, along with the audience. The recital ends, and the boys run off stage and Alfalfa quickly ducks behind a curtain and strips out of his disguise in order to get the frog out.\n\nThe ballet mistress, furious that the boys ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. Butch and Woim chase Alfalfa into a mansion, but are turned away by the maid. Escaping through the back door, Alfalfa is chased by Fifi, Waldo's [[Doberman]], and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side. As he climbs out, he notices his underwear floating on the surface of the pool. As Alfalfa retrieves his underwear, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. Waldo's dog then chases Alfalfa off the property.\n\nAt the carnival talent show the day before the race, the boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat ([[Ross Bagley|Ross Elliot Bagley]]) and Porky (Zachary Mabry), have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree ([[Daryl Hannah]]), finds out about the scheme and confronts Spanky, but he convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby.\n\nAlfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his singing voice. Waldo and Darla have also entered the show in a duet. Alfalfa then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song.\n\nAs a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, \"The Blur\" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys need a new go-kart. They band together to build \"Blur 2: The Sequel,\" and on the day before the race, Spanky and Alfalfa (who previously had a falling out when the latter discovers the gang's \"prank list\", which was the proof that the gang sabotaged Alfalfa's picnic with Darla) reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson.\n\nButch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also in the race, but they are eventually annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, \"The Blur 2\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between \"The Blur\" and \"The Blur 2\" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim then gets scared and jumps into the slop willingly.\n\nAlong with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone because she found out that Waldo was responsible for the bubbles at the talent show. Meanwhile, Spanky is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be female ([[Reba McEntire]]). Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys were responsible for ruining their picnic lunch. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla as well as other girls into the club, adding a \"Women Welcome\" sign onto the front door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Travis Tedford]] as [[George McFarland|Spanky McFarland]], the president of \"He-Man Women Hater's Club\" and Alfalfa's best friend\n* [[Bug Hall]] as [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa Switzer]], Spanky's best friend\n* Brittany Ashton Holmes as [[Darla Hood|Darla]], Alfalfa's love interest\n* Kevin Jamal Woods as [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|Stymie]], the club's vice-president\n* Jordan Warkol (voice dubbed by [[Elizabeth Daily|E.G.

Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent ''Our Gang'' comedies, tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, \"It's real cold.

These include:\n* The scene in which Buckwheat and Porky are fishing and get their fishing lines tangled originates from a scene in the 1943 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Three Smart Guys]]'' with [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]], [[Billy Laughlin|Froggy]], and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Mickey]].\n* The He-Man Woman Haters Club originally appeared in the 1937 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Hearts are Thumps]]''; the club would return in the short ''[[Mail and Female]]'' the same year. The plots for both shorts were reused for the film. In addition, the scene where the gang ruins Alfalfa and Darla's lunch date, as well as the scene where bubbles come out of Alfalfa's mouth while he sings, were borrowed gags from ''Hearts are Thumps''. Alfalfa sending Buckwheat and Porky to deliver a love note to Darla was borrowed from ''Mail and Female''.\n* The \"hi-sign\" originally appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short ''[[Anniversary Trouble]], ''and the animated 1979 special, ''[[The Little Rascals Christmas Special]]''.\n* The children dressing up as fire fighters and attempting to put out a fire appeared in the ''Our Gang'' shorts ''[[Fire Fighters]]'' (1922), ''[[The Fourth Alarm]]'' (1926), and ''[[Hook and Ladder (1932 film)|Hook and Ladder]]'' (1932). The gag in which Spanky (Travis Tedford) winds up on a flying water hose was originally used with [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] in ''The Fourth Alarm''.\n* The gag involving Spanky and Stymie disguising as adults appeared in a handful of ''Our Gang'' shorts. [[Mickey Daniels]] and [[Johnny Downs]] attempted to dress up as Santa Claus with this gag in the 1926 short ''[[Good Cheer]]''. [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] and Pleurisy tried this routine in the 1929 short ''[[Election Day (1929 film)|Election Day]]''. [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|Stymie]] and [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] tried it in the 1933 short ''[[Fish Hooky]]'', while [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] tried pulling it off in both the 1935 short ''[[Teacher's Beau]]'' and the 1936 short ''[[Two Too Young]]''.\n* The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa accidentally find themselves performing in a ballet recital was inspired by the plot of the 1937 short ''[[Rushin' Ballet]]''. The costumes that the duo wear are exact replicas of the costumes that the original [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] wore in ''Rushin' Ballet''. The gag in which Alfalfa gets a frog loose in his clothes was originally used in the 1937 short ''[[Framing Youth]]'', where Spanky was trying to convince him he had a frog in his throat.\n* Alfalfa singing \"The Barber of Seville\" originated in ''[[Our Gang Follies of 1938]]''.\n* The idea of the children building their own vehicle out of junk and scrap metal had been used in several ''Our Gang'' shorts, most notably the 1934 short ''[[Hi'-Neighbor!]]''. The gag in which the kids' car causes several adults to leap into the air was also borrowed from ''Hi'-Neighbor!'', and also appears in ''[[One Wild Ride]]'' (1925), ''[[Free Wheeling]]'' (1932), and ''[[Divot Diggers]]'' (1936).\n* Much of the Go-Cart race climax (including the gag in which the car belonging to Butch and Woim accidentally goes into reverse) was borrowed from the 1939 short ''[[Auto Antics]]''.

The film is an adaptation of [[Hal Roach]]'s ''[[Our Gang]]'', a series of [[short film]]s of the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s (many of which were broadcast on television as ''The Little Rascals'') which centered on the adventures of a group of neighborhood [[children]]. The film, with a screenplay by Paul Guay, Stephen Mazur, and [[Penelope Spheeris]]{{spaced ndash}}who also directed{{spaced ndash}}presents several of the ''Our Gang'' characters in an updated setting, and features re-interpretations of several of the original shorts. It was the first collaboration by Guay and Mazur, whose subsequent comedies were ''[[Liar Liar]]'' and ''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]''.\n\nAnother film based on ''[[Our Gang]]'', ''[[The Little Rascals Save the Day]]'', was released as a [[direct-to-video]] feature in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nSpanky McFarland ([[Travis Tedford]]) is the president of the \"He-Man Woman Haters Club\" with many school-aged boys from around the neighborhood as members. Alfalfa Switzer ([[Bug Hall]]), Spanky's best friend, has been chosen to be the driver for the club's prize-winning go-kart, \"The Blur\", in the upcoming [[Soap Box Derby]] go-kart race. However, Alfalfa is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe boys go to find Alfalfa and discover him in the company of his sweetheart Darla (Brittany Ashton Holmes), with whom he is forbidden to be in love because she is a girl, which goes against club rules. Alfalfa invites Darla on a picnic, and to prove his devotion to her, he agrees to have the picnic inside the clubhouse. Unbeknownst to Alfalfa, his fellow club members find out about his plans.\n\nAt the picnic, Alfalfa and Darla think they are alone, but the other club members secretly pull several silly pranks to sabotage their romantic date (whoopee cushion, cat litter in sandwiches, etc.). When they finally reveal themselves and demand to come inside the clubhouse, Alfalfa frantically tries to convince Darla to hide in the closet, which leads her to mistakenly believe that Alfalfa feels ashamed of her. In the frenzy, a candle flame gets out of control, ultimately causing the clubhouse to burn down.\n\nDarla breaks up with Alfalfa and turns her attentions towards Waldo ([[Blake McIver Ewing]]), the new kid in town whose father ([[Donald Trump]]) is an oil tycoon. Because Alfalfa burned down the clubhouse and also fraternized with a girl, he is assigned by Stymie (Kevin Jamal Woods) to guard the go-kart until the day of the race.\n\nAlfalfa makes several attempts to win back Darla, including sending her a fake love note. When that fails, Spanky goes with him to formally break things off with Darla. They are initially denied entrance to her ballet recital, but Spanky insists that they will wait for Darla to come out; Spanky gives Alfalfa a [[frog]] to play with while they wait. They are soon spotted by the neighborhood bullies, Butch (Sam Saletta) and Woim (Blake Jeremy Collins), who chase them inside the building. To escape, Spanky and Alfalfa duck into a costume room and disguise themselves as ballerinas in pink tights, tutus, and wigs. They manage to evade the bullies, but they attempt to enter another room to get out of their disguises, which are tight and uncomfortable. They are surprised to find the room filled with girls, including Darla, dressed in identical ballet outfits. The boys nervously pretend to be in the recital that is about to take place, but Alfalfa almost gives them away when the frog he is still holding croaks. Just as they are about to back out of the room, the ballet mistress ([[Lea Thompson]]) enters and ushers them all on stage.\n\nThe recital begins, and the boys are horrified when the mistress announces they are performing scenes from \"The Nutcracker.\" Alfalfa hands the frog to Spanky, but Spanky drops the frog into the waistband of Alfalfa's tights. Alfalfa squirms in discomfort as the slimy frog wriggles around in his tights, turning the show to chaos as he tries to catch it while still dancing along. The girls break out into laughter, along with the audience. The recital ends, and the boys run off stage and Alfalfa quickly ducks behind a curtain and strips out of his disguise in order to get the frog out.\n\nThe ballet mistress, furious that the boys ruined her recital, confronts them and throws them out immediately, Alfalfa in his underwear and Spanky still in drag. Butch and Woim are waiting for them outside the door, so Spanky distracts them while Alfalfa sneaks out. When Spanky loses his wig, the bullies give chase. Spanky manages to lose them, but they bump into Alfalfa, who is trying to run home in his underwear. Butch and Woim chase Alfalfa into a mansion, but are turned away by the maid. Escaping through the back door, Alfalfa is chased by Fifi, Waldo's [[Doberman]], and he leaps into a pool and swims to the other side. As he climbs out, he notices his underwear floating on the surface of the pool. As Alfalfa retrieves his underwear, he discovers Darla and Waldo in a hot tub, laughing at him, to his embarrassment. Waldo's dog then chases Alfalfa off the property.\n\nAt the carnival talent show the day before the race, the boys try to fund-raise $450, the cost of the lumber needed to rebuild their clubhouse. The youngest club members, Buckwheat ([[Ross Bagley|Ross Elliot Bagley]]) and Porky (Zachary Mabry), have unwittingly come up with $500, not realizing that their method for earning the money was not exactly honest. Their school teacher, Miss Crabtree ([[Daryl Hannah]]), finds out about the scheme and confronts Spanky, but he convinces her to donate the money to be given as first prize in the go-kart derby.\n\nAlfalfa once again tries to win Darla back, this time through song, being that Darla mentioned after she dumped him that the only thing she ever really missed about him was his singing voice. Waldo and Darla have also entered the show in a duet. Alfalfa then requests the chance to perform for her and win her back. However, Waldo sabotages his attempts to serenade her by putting soap in his drinking water, causing him to burp out bubbles all throughout his song.\n\nAs a result of Alfalfa's carelessness, \"The Blur\" is eventually stolen by Butch and Woim, so that now, in addition to having to rebuild the clubhouse, the boys need a new go-kart. They band together to build \"Blur 2: The Sequel,\" and on the day before the race, Spanky and Alfalfa (who previously had a falling out when the latter discovers the gang's \"prank list\", which was the proof that the gang sabotaged Alfalfa's picnic with Darla) reconcile their friendship and decide to ride in the two-seat go-kart together. They hope to win the prize money and the trophy, which is to be presented to the winners by A.J. Ferguson.\n\nButch and Woim make several sneaky attempts to stop Alfalfa and Spanky from winning the race. Waldo and Darla are also in the race, but they are eventually annoyed with each other, and Waldo seemingly kicks Darla out from his car. In a wild dash to the finish, and despite the many scrapes and crashes throughout the race, \"The Blur 2\" crosses the finish line ahead of the pack in a photo-finish between \"The Blur\" and \"The Blur 2\" literally by a hair, due to Alfalfa's pointy hairstyle. After the race, Butch and Woim are angry towards Alfalfa because he won the trophy and the prize money. They attempt to beat him up, but Alfalfa finally stands up for himself and punches Butch in the face, knocking him into a pool of pig slop. Woim then gets scared and jumps into the slop willingly.\n\nAlong with first prize, Alfalfa also wins back Darla, after it is revealed that it had been Darla who had kicked Waldo out of their car and finished the race alone because she found out that Waldo was responsible for the bubbles at the talent show. Meanwhile, Spanky is shocked at the trophy presentation when he finally meets his favorite driver, A.J. Ferguson, who turns out to be female ([[Reba McEntire]]). Spanky confesses to Darla that he and the boys were responsible for ruining their picnic lunch. After the club house is rebuilt, the boys collectively have a change of heart towards membership and they decide to welcome Darla as well as other girls into the club, adding a \"Women Welcome\" sign onto the front door.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Travis Tedford]] as [[George McFarland|Spanky McFarland]], the president of \"He-Man Women Hater's Club\" and Alfalfa's best friend\n* [[Bug Hall]] as [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa Switzer]], Spanky's best friend\n* Brittany Ashton Holmes as [[Darla Hood|Darla]], Alfalfa's love interest\n* Kevin Jamal Woods as [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|Stymie]], the club's vice-president\n* Jordan Warkol (voice dubbed by [[Elizabeth Daily|E.G.

The surviving cast members saw this as especially hurtful, in light of the fact that director Penelope Spheeris had previously made a point of including [[Buddy Ebsen]], from the original ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'', in her [[The Beverly Hillbillies (film)|1993 feature film adaptation]] of that series. Eugene Jackson, who played the original Pineapple from the silent ''Our Gang'' comedies, tried unsuccessfully to contact the studio to be a part of production, stated, \"It's real cold.

These include:\n* The scene in which Buckwheat and Porky are fishing and get their fishing lines tangled originates from a scene in the 1943 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Three Smart Guys]]'' with [[Billie Thomas|Buckwheat]], [[Billy Laughlin|Froggy]], and [[Robert Blake (actor)|Mickey]].\n* The He-Man Woman Haters Club originally appeared in the 1937 ''Our Gang'' short ''[[Hearts are Thumps]]''; the club would return in the short ''[[Mail and Female]]'' the same year. The plots for both shorts were reused for the film. In addition, the scene where the gang ruins Alfalfa and Darla's lunch date, as well as the scene where bubbles come out of Alfalfa's mouth while he sings, were borrowed gags from ''Hearts are Thumps''. Alfalfa sending Buckwheat and Porky to deliver a love note to Darla was borrowed from ''Mail and Female''.\n* The \"hi-sign\" originally appeared in the 1935 Our Gang short ''[[Anniversary Trouble]], ''and the animated 1979 special, ''[[The Little Rascals Christmas Special]]''.\n* The children dressing up as fire fighters and attempting to put out a fire appeared in the ''Our Gang'' shorts ''[[Fire Fighters]]'' (1922), ''[[The Fourth Alarm]]'' (1926), and ''[[Hook and Ladder (1932 film)|Hook and Ladder]]'' (1932). The gag in which Spanky (Travis Tedford) winds up on a flying water hose was originally used with [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] in ''The Fourth Alarm''.\n* The gag involving Spanky and Stymie disguising as adults appeared in a handful of ''Our Gang'' shorts. [[Mickey Daniels]] and [[Johnny Downs]] attempted to dress up as Santa Claus with this gag in the 1926 short ''[[Good Cheer]]''. [[Allen Hoskins|Farina]] and Pleurisy tried this routine in the 1929 short ''[[Election Day (1929 film)|Election Day]]''. [[Matthew Beard (American actor)|Stymie]] and [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]] tried it in the 1933 short ''[[Fish Hooky]]'', while [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] tried pulling it off in both the 1935 short ''[[Teacher's Beau]]'' and the 1936 short ''[[Two Too Young]]''.\n* The scene in which Spanky and Alfalfa accidentally find themselves performing in a ballet recital was inspired by the plot of the 1937 short ''[[Rushin' Ballet]]''. The costumes that the duo wear are exact replicas of the costumes that the original [[George McFarland|Spanky]] and [[Carl Switzer|Alfalfa]] wore in ''Rushin' Ballet''. The gag in which Alfalfa gets a frog loose in his clothes was originally used in the 1937 short ''[[Framing Youth]]'', where Spanky was trying to convince him he had a frog in his throat.\n* Alfalfa singing \"The Barber of Seville\" originated in ''[[Our Gang Follies of 1938]]''.\n* The idea of the children building their own vehicle out of junk and scrap metal had been used in several ''Our Gang'' shorts, most notably the 1934 short ''[[Hi'-Neighbor!]]''. The gag in which the kids' car causes several adults to leap into the air was also borrowed from ''Hi'-Neighbor!'', and also appears in ''[[One Wild Ride]]'' (1925), ''[[Free Wheeling]]'' (1932), and ''[[Divot Diggers]]'' (1936).\n* Much of the Go-Cart race climax (including the gag in which the car belonging to Butch and Woim accidentally goes into reverse) was borrowed from the 1939 short ''[[Auto Antics]]''. Material from ''Hi'-Neighbor'' and ''[[Three Men in a Tub]]'' (1938) is also present.\n\n==Home media==\n''The Little Rascals'' was released on VHS and DVD in 1995 and 2004 respectively.

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

Although cacti is thought to only grow in Arizona and New Mexico, many native cacti grow throughout Nevada, Utah, Colorado, and west Texas. [[Steppe]] is also located all over the high plains areas in Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas. The mountains of the southwestern states have large tracts of alpine trees.\n\n[[File:Curry County Eastern New Mexico 2010.jpg|thumb|left|The [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] in [[Eastern New Mexico]], but also located in [[Colorado Eastern Plains|Eastern Colorado]] and [[West Texas]]]]\nLandscape features of the core southwestern areas include mountains, canyons, mesas, [[butte]]s, high broad basins, plateaus, desert lands, and some plains, characteristic of the [[Basin and Range Province]]. The entire southwestern region features semi-arid to arid terrain. The far eastern part of southwestern Texas, for example the [[Texas Hill Country]], consists of dry, tall, and rugged rocky hills of limestone and granite. [[South Texas]] and the [[Rio Grande Valley]] is mostly flat with many places consisting of scrub and bare topsoil, much like the deserts further west.\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe region has an extremely diverse bird population, with hundreds of species being found in the American Southwest.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

He calls the first subregion \"[[Northern New Mexico]]\", and describes it as focused on [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]]. It extends from the [[San Luis Valley]] of southern Colorado to south of [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]] and including the [[Manzano Mountains]], with an east-west breadth in the north stretching from the upper [[Canadian River]] to the upper [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]. The area around Albuquerque is sometimes called [[Central New Mexico]].\n\n\"Central Arizona\" is a vast metropolitan area spread across one contiguous sprawling oasis, essentially equivalent to the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]]. The city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] is the largest urban center, and located in the approximate center of the area that includes [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], and many others.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 103\u2013106</ref>\n\nMeinig calls the third subregion \"El Paso, Tucson, and the Southern Borderlands\". While [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] and [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] are distinctly different cities, they serve as anchor points to the hinterland between them. [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] occupies a large oasis at the western end of the El Paso-Tucson corridor. The region between the two cities is a major transportation trunk with settlements servicing both highway and railway needs. There are also large mining operations, ranches, and agricultural oases. Both El Paso and Tucson have large military installations nearby; [[Fort Bliss]] and [[White Sands Missile Range]] north of El Paso in New Mexico, and, near Tucson, the [[Davis-Monthan Air Force Base]]. About {{convert|70|mi|km}} to the southeast are the research facilities at [[Fort Huachuca]]. These military installations form a kind of hinterland around the El Paso-Tucson region, and are served by scientific and residential communities such as [[Sierra Vista, Arizona|Sierra Vista]], [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]], and [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]]. El Paso's influence extends north into the [[Mesilla Valley]], and southeast along the Rio Grande into the [[Trans-Pecos]] region of Texas.<ref>''Meinig'', pp. 112\u2013114</ref>\n\nThe fourth subregion Meinig calls the \"Northern Corridor and Navajolands\".

The various definitions can be broken down into four main categories: Historical/Archeological; Geological/Topographical; Ecological; and Cultural. In the 1930s and 1940s, many definitions of the Southwest included all or part of Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Colorado, and Utah. As time has gone on, the definition of the Southwest as become more solidified and more compact. For example, in 1948 the [[National Geographic Society]] defined the American Southwest as all of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico, and the southernmost sections of Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming, as well as parts of southwest Nebraska, western Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. By 1977, the Society's definition had narrowed to only the four states of Utah, Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico; and by 1982 the portion of the Southwest in the United States, as defined by the Society, had shrunk to Arizona and New Mexico, with the southernmost strip of Utah and Colorado, as well as the Mojave and Colorado deserts in California.<ref name=UAtpncd /> Other individuals who focus on Southwest studies who favored a more limited extent of the area to center on Arizona and New Mexico, with small parts of surrounding areas, include [[Erna Fergusson]], [[Charles Lummis]] (who claimed to have coined the term, the Southwest), and cultural geographer [[Raymond Gastil]], and ethnologist [[Miguel Le\u00f3n-Portilla]].<ref name=UAtpncd />\n\n===Historical/archeological===\nAs the [[Territorial evolution of the United States|US expanded westward]], the country's [[American frontier|western border]] also shifted westward, and consequently, so did the location of the Southwestern and [[Northwestern United States]]. In the early years of the United States, [[Overmountain Men|newly colonized lands]] lying immediately west of the Appalachian Mountains were [[State cessions|detached]] from North Carolina and given the name [[Southwest Territory]]. During the decades that followed, the [[Old Southwest|region known as \"the Southwestern United States\"]] covered much of the [[Deep South]] east of the Mississippi River.\n\nHowever, as territories and eventual states to the west were added after the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the geographical \"Southwest\" expanded, and the relationship of these new acquisitions to the South itself became \"increasingly unclear.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Encyclopedia of Southern Culture\". Charles Reagan Wilson and William Ferris. University of North Carolina Press 1989</ref>\n\nHowever, archeologist, Erik Reed, gives a description which is the most widely accepted as defining the American Southwest, which runs from Durango, Colorado in the north, to Durango, Mexico, in the south, and from Las Vegas, Nevada in the west to Las Vegas, New Mexico in the East. Reed's definition is roughly equivalent to the western half of the Learning Center of the American Southwest's definition, leaving out any portion of Kansas and Oklahoma, and much of Texas, as well as the eastern half of New Mexico. Since this article is about the Southwestern United States, the areas of Sonora and Chihuahua in Mexico will be excluded. The portion left includes Arizona and western New Mexico, the very southernmost part of Utah, southwestern Colorado, the very tip of west Texas, and triangle formed by the southern tip of Nevada.

Edited by Joseph Carlton Wilder. University of Arizona Press</ref> most of Texas and large parts of Oklahoma are often placed into a sub-region of the [[Southern United States|South]], which some consider southwestern in the general framework of the original application, meaning the \"Western South\". This is an area containing the basic elements of Southern [[Confederate States of America|history]], [[Culture of the Southern United States|culture]], [[Solid South|politics]], [[Bible Belt|religion]], and [[Southern American English|linguistic]] and settlement patterns, yet blended with traits of the frontier West. While this particular Southwest is notably different in many ways from the classic \"Old South\" or [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]], these features are strong enough to give it a separate southwestern identity quite different in nature from that of the interior southwestern states to the west.\n\nOne of these distinguishing characteristics in Texas\u2014in addition to being a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate state]] during the Civil War\u2014is that Indigenous and Spanish American culture never played a central role in the development of this area in relative comparison to the others, as the vast majority of settlers were Anglo and blacks from the South.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Cultural Regions of the United States. Raymond Gastil. University of Washington Press 1975</ref> Although the present day state of Oklahoma was [[Indian Territory]] until the early 20th century, many of these American Indians were from the southeastern United States and became culturally assimilated early on. The majority of members of these tribes also allied themselves with the Confederacy during the Civil War. Combined with that, once the territory was open for settlement, southeastern pioneers made up a disproportionate number of these newcomers. All this contributed to the new state having a character that differed from other parts of the Southwest with large American Indian populations.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nThe fact that a majority of residents of Texas and Oklahoma\u2014unlike those in other \"southwestern\" states\u2014self-identify as living in the South and consider themselves southerners rather than the West and westerners\u2014also lends to treating these two states as a somewhat distinct and separate entity in terms of regional classification.<ref>Southern Focus Poll 1992\u20131999.

The metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and El Paso hardly ever receive any snow at all, as they are strictly desert lands with mountains.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" /> Albuquerque receives less snow than other cities, but still receives significant snowfalls occasionally in the winter time. Although it snows in this region, the snow in this part of the United States melts rapidly, often before nightfall. This is due mainly to the higher altitude and abundant sunshine in these states.\n\nNevada and Arizona are both generally arid with desert lands and mountains, and receive large amounts of snow in the higher elevations in and near the mountains. New Mexico, Utah, and Colorado are generally arid, with desert lands and mountains as well. They all receive decent amounts of snow and large amounts of snow in the high elevations in the mountains, although some areas in far southwestern and southern New Mexico do not receive much snow at all at lower elevations. West Texas is generally arid as well but does not receive the same amount of snow that the other southwestern states receive at their high elevations. The terrain of western Texas in the Southwest is the flat, rolling land of the plains, which eventually turns into a desert with some hills. There are significant mountains as well in west Texas upon reaching the [[Trans-Pecos]] area.\n\nThe term \"High Desert\" is also synonymous with this region. The High Desert is generally defined as the [[Mojave Desert]], which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada, and southwestern Utah. The High Desert also extends into other parts of the [[Northwestern United States|Northwest]], such as the [[Red Desert (Wyoming)|Red Desert]] in southwestern Wyoming. The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona, in the [[Sonoran Desert]]. This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation, much higher than the normal desert land, and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah), sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights. The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter (with the exception of California, southern Nevada and southwestern Utah) but melts very quickly.\n\n[[File:CONM Independence monument 2.jpg|thumb|Monument Canyon, some of the high desert lands found in Colorado]]\n\nOther areas of the Southwest may also be referred to as the \"High Desert\" such as the [[Colorado Plateau]]. The desert lands found in Eastern Utah, Northern Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico are usually referred to as the high desert. Colorado has scattered desert lands found in southern, southwestern, western, and the northwestern parts of the state. These scattered desert lands are located in and around areas such as, the [[Roan Plateau]], [[Dinosaur National Monument]], [[Colorado National Monument]], [[Royal Gorge]], [[Cortez, Colorado|Cortez]], [[Dove Creek, Colorado|Dove Creek]], [[Canyons of the Ancients National Monument]], [[Four Corners Monument]], [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]], [[Blue Mesa Reservoir]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], [[San Luis Valley]], [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] and [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Besides the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], lands in southwestern and southern New Mexico, they also have scattered desert lands in the northwestern and northern portions of their state, which is referred to as the high desert.\n\nDuring El Ni\u00f1o, winters and springs are generally colder and wetter across southern portions of the region, while the northern portion stays warmer and drier due to a southern jet stream. Under La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens, meaning the cool and wet weather tends to stay further north.<ref name=\"BATTG19\" />\n\n==National parks, monuments and forests==\n[[File:Grand Canyon Ao\u00fbt 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=3.65|center|<center>[[Grand Canyon]] from the South Rim</center>]]\nThe southwestern United States contains many well-known national parks including [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]] in Arizona, [[Death Valley National Park|Death Valley]] in California, [[Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve|Great Sand Dunes]] in Colorado, [[Arches National Park|Arches]] in Utah, [[Big Bend National Park|Big Bend]] in Texas, [[Great Basin National Park|Great Basin]] in Nevada, and [[White Sands National Park|White Sands]] in New Mexico.\n\n[[File:Dunes as White Sands NM.jpg|thumb|[[White Sands National Park]], New Mexico]]\nArizona parks and monuments include Grand Canyon, [[Monument Valley]] (a [[Navajo Nation]] park), [[Petrified Forest National Park|Petrified Forest]], and [[Saguaro National Park|Saguaro]] national parks; the national monuments of [[Agua Fria National Monument|Agua Fria]], [[Canyon de Chelly National Monument|Canyon de Chelly]], [[Casa Grande Ruins National Monument|Casa Grande Ruins]], [[Chiricahua National Monument|Chiricahua]], [[Ironwood Forest National Monument|Ironwood Forest]], [[Montezuma Castle National Monument|Montezuma Castle]], [[Navajo National Monument|Navajo]], [[Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument|Organ Pipe Cactus]], [[Pipe Spring National Monument|Pipe Spring]], [[Sonoran Desert National Monument|Sonoran Desert]], [[Sunset Crater Volcano National Monument|Sunset Crater]], [[Tonto National Monument|Tonto]], [[Tuzigoot National Monument|Tuzigoot]], [[Vermilion Cliffs National Monument|Vermilion Cliffs]], [[Walnut Canyon National Monument|Walnut Canyon]], and [[Wupatki National Monument|Wupatki]].

A prolific artist and printmaker, Rowlandson produced a wide variety of illustrations for novels, joke books,  and topographical works. Like other contemporary pre-Victorian caricaturists like [[James Gillray]], he too depicted characters in bawdy postures and he also produced erotica which was censured by the 1840s. His caricatures included those of people in power such as the Duchess of Devonshire, William Pitt and Napoleon Bonaparte. \n\n== Biography ==\nRowlandson was born in [[Old Jewry]], in the [[City of London]]. He was baptised on 23 July 1757 at [[St Mary Colechurch]], London to William and Mary Rowlandson. The baptismal record for ST Mary, now in the London archives, clearly gives his birth-date as 13 July 1757, not 1756 as given in most earlier biographies.<ref>Payne and Payne p.2</ref>  His father, William, had been a weaver, but had moved into trading supplies for the textile industry and after overextending himself was declared bankrupt in 1759. Life became difficult for him in London and, in late 1759, he moved his family to [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]]. Thomas's uncle James died in 1764, and his widow Jane probably provided both the funds and accommodation which allowed Thomas to attend school in London.<ref name=\"Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314\">Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314</ref><ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nRowlandson was educated at the school of Dr Barvis in [[Soho Square]], then \"an academy of some celebrity,\" where one of his classmates was Richard Burke, son of the politician [[Edmund Burke]]. As a schoolboy, Rowlandson \"drew humourous characters of his master and many of his scholars before he was ten years old,\" covering the margins of his schoolbooks with his artwork.<ref name = \"GM\">Rowlandson obituary in Sylvanus Urban, ''The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle,'' Volume 97, Part 1, Jan\u2013June 1827 (London: J B Nichols, 1827), page 564</ref>\n\nIn 1765 or 1766 he started at the Soho Academy.<ref name=\"Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314\"/> There is no documentary evidence that Rowlandson took drawing classes at the mainly business-oriented school, but it seems likely, as on leaving school in 1772, he became a student at the [[Royal Academy]].<ref>Payne and Payne. p.15</ref> According to his obituary of 22 April 1827 in ''The Gentleman's Magazine,'' Rowlandson was sent to Paris at the age of 16 (1772), and spent two years studying in a \"drawing academy.\"<ref name = \"GM\"/> there. In Paris he studied drawing \"the human figure\" and continued developing his youthful skill in [[caricature]].<ref name = \"GM\"/> It was on his return to London that he took classes at the [[Royal Academy]], then based at [[Somerset House]].<ref name = \"GM\"/>\n\nRowlandson spent six years studying at the Royal Academy, but about a third of this time was spent in [[Paris, France|Paris]] where he may have studied under [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]].<ref>Payne and Payne. p.26</ref> He later made frequent tours to the Continent, enriching his [[Career portfolio|portfolio]]s with numerous sketches of life and character. In 1775 he exhibited a drawing of ''Dalilah Payeth Sampson a Visit while in Prison at Gaza'' at the Royal Academy and two years later received a silver medal for a bas-relief figure. He was spoken of as a promising student. On the death of his aunt, he inherited \u00a37,000 with which he plunged into the dissipations of the town and was known to sit at the gaming-table for 36&nbsp;hours at a stretch.\n\n[[Image:Rowlandson-Epicure.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Discomforts of an Epicure'', a self-portrait from 1787, showed that he could aim his caricatures at himself]]\nIn time poverty overtook him; and the friendship and examples of [[James Gillray]] and [[Henry William Bunbury]] seem to have suggested [[caricature]] as a means of earning a living. His drawing of [[Vauxhall]], shown in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1784, had been engraved by Pollard, and the print was a success. Rowlandson was largely employed by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], the art publisher, who in 1809\u2014issued in his ''Poetical Magazine'' ''The Schoolmaster's Tour''\u2014a series of plates with illustrative verses by Dr. [[William Combe]]. They were the most popular of the artist's works.

A prolific artist and printmaker, Rowlandson produced a wide variety of illustrations for novels, joke books,  and topographical works. Like other contemporary pre-Victorian caricaturists like [[James Gillray]], he too depicted characters in bawdy postures and he also produced erotica which was censured by the 1840s. His caricatures included those of people in power such as the Duchess of Devonshire, William Pitt and Napoleon Bonaparte. \n\n== Biography ==\nRowlandson was born in [[Old Jewry]], in the [[City of London]]. He was baptised on 23 July 1757 at [[St Mary Colechurch]], London to William and Mary Rowlandson. The baptismal record for ST Mary, now in the London archives, clearly gives his birth-date as 13 July 1757, not 1756 as given in most earlier biographies.<ref>Payne and Payne p.2</ref>  His father, William, had been a weaver, but had moved into trading supplies for the textile industry and after overextending himself was declared bankrupt in 1759. Life became difficult for him in London and, in late 1759, he moved his family to [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]]. Thomas's uncle James died in 1764, and his widow Jane probably provided both the funds and accommodation which allowed Thomas to attend school in London.<ref name=\"Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314\">Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314</ref><ref name=\"ODNB\" />\n\nRowlandson was educated at the school of Dr Barvis in [[Soho Square]], then \"an academy of some celebrity,\" where one of his classmates was Richard Burke, son of the politician [[Edmund Burke]]. As a schoolboy, Rowlandson \"drew humourous characters of his master and many of his scholars before he was ten years old,\" covering the margins of his schoolbooks with his artwork.<ref name = \"GM\">Rowlandson obituary in Sylvanus Urban, ''The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle,'' Volume 97, Part 1, Jan\u2013June 1827 (London: J B Nichols, 1827), page 564</ref>\n\nIn 1765 or 1766 he started at the Soho Academy.<ref name=\"Payne and Payne. pp.8\u201314\"/> There is no documentary evidence that Rowlandson took drawing classes at the mainly business-oriented school, but it seems likely, as on leaving school in 1772, he became a student at the [[Royal Academy]].<ref>Payne and Payne. p.15</ref> According to his obituary of 22 April 1827 in ''The Gentleman's Magazine,'' Rowlandson was sent to Paris at the age of 16 (1772), and spent two years studying in a \"drawing academy.\"<ref name = \"GM\"/> there. In Paris he studied drawing \"the human figure\" and continued developing his youthful skill in [[caricature]].<ref name = \"GM\"/> It was on his return to London that he took classes at the [[Royal Academy]], then based at [[Somerset House]].<ref name = \"GM\"/>\n\nRowlandson spent six years studying at the Royal Academy, but about a third of this time was spent in [[Paris, France|Paris]] where he may have studied under [[Jean-Baptiste Pigalle]].<ref>Payne and Payne. p.26</ref> He later made frequent tours to the Continent, enriching his [[Career portfolio|portfolio]]s with numerous sketches of life and character. In 1775 he exhibited a drawing of ''Dalilah Payeth Sampson a Visit while in Prison at Gaza'' at the Royal Academy and two years later received a silver medal for a bas-relief figure. He was spoken of as a promising student. On the death of his aunt, he inherited \u00a37,000 with which he plunged into the dissipations of the town and was known to sit at the gaming-table for 36&nbsp;hours at a stretch.\n\n[[Image:Rowlandson-Epicure.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''Discomforts of an Epicure'', a self-portrait from 1787, showed that he could aim his caricatures at himself]]\nIn time poverty overtook him; and the friendship and examples of [[James Gillray]] and [[Henry William Bunbury]] seem to have suggested [[caricature]] as a means of earning a living. His drawing of [[Vauxhall]], shown in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1784, had been engraved by Pollard, and the print was a success. Rowlandson was largely employed by [[Rudolph Ackermann]], the art publisher, who in 1809\u2014issued in his ''Poetical Magazine'' ''The Schoolmaster's Tour''\u2014a series of plates with illustrative verses by Dr. [[William Combe]]. They were the most popular of the artist's works. Again engraved by Rowlandson himself in 1812, and issued under the title of the ''Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of the Picturesque,'' they had attained a fifth edition by 1813, and were followed in 1820 by ''Dr Syntax in Search of Consolation,'' and in 1821 by the ''Third Tour of Dr Syntax in Search of a Wife''. He also produced a body of erotic prints and woodcuts.<ref>Encyclopedia Britannica, https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Rowlandson</ref>\n\nThe same collaboration of designer, author and publisher appeared in the ''English [[Dance of Death]],'' issued in 1814\u201316 and in the ''Dance of Life,'' 1817. Rowlandson also illustrated [[Tobias Smollett|Smollett]], [[Oliver Goldsmith|Goldsmith]] and [[Laurence Sterne|Sterne]], and his designs will be found in ''The Spirit of the Public Journals'' (1825), ''The English Spy'' (1825), and ''The Humorist'' (1831).\n\n[[File:Thomas Rowlandson - Vaux-Hall - Dr. Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Robinson, et al.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Vauxhall Gardens]]'' (1785).

{"title_page": "M\u00f6ssbauer effect", "text_new": "{{More footnotes|date=April 2009}}\nThe '''M\u00f6ssbauer effect''', or '''recoilless nuclear resonance fluorescence''', is a physical phenomenon discovered by [[Rudolf M\u00f6ssbauer]] in 1958. It involves the resonant and [[Atomic recoil|recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]].\n\nIn the M\u00f6ssbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.\n\n==History==\n\nThe emission and absorption of [[X-ray]]s by gases had been observed previously, and it was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for [[gamma ray]]s, which are created by [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by [[electron]]ic transitions).  However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the [[Doppler effect]] also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum).  M\u00f6ssbauer was able to observe resonance in nuclei of solid [[iridium]], which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids, but not in gases. M\u00f6ssbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, under certain circumstances a fraction of the nuclear events could occur essentially without recoil. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of nuclear events.\n\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer effect was one of the last major discoveries in physics to be originally reported in the German language. The first report in English was a letter describing a repetition of the experiment.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Craig |first1=P.\n |last2=Dash |first2=J.\n |last3=McGuire |first3=A.\n |last4=Nagle |first4=D.\n |last5=Reiswig |first5=R.\n |year=1959\n |title=Nuclear Resonance Absorption of Gamma Rays in Ir<sup>191</sup>\n |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=221\n |bibcode=1959PhRvL...3..221C\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.3.221\n}}</ref>\n\nThe discovery was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1961 together with [[Robert Hofstadter]]'s research of [[electron scattering]] in atomic nuclei.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:M\u00f6ssbauerSpectrum57Fe.svg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00f6ssbauer absorption spectrum of <sup>57</sup>Fe]]\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer Effect is a process in which a nucleus emits or absorbs gamma rays without loss of energy to a nuclear recoil. It was discovered by the German physicist Rudolf L. M\u00f6ssbauer in 1958 and has proved to be remarkably useful for basic research in physics and chemistry. It has been used, for instance, in precisely measuring small energy changes in nuclei, atoms, and crystals induced by electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields. In a transition of a nucleus from a higher to a lower energy state with accompanying emission of gamma rays, the emission generally causes the nucleus to recoil, and this takes energy from the emitted gamma rays. Thus the gamma rays do not have sufficient energy to excite a target nucleus to be examined. However, M\u00f6ssbauer discovered that it is possible to have transitions in which the recoil is absorbed by a whole crystal in which the emitting nucleus is bound. Under these circumstances, the energy that goes into the recoil is a negligible portion of the energy of the transition. Therefore, the emitted gamma rays carry virtually all of the energy liberated by the nuclear transition. The gamma rays thus are able to induce a reverse transition, under similar conditions of negligible recoil, in a target nucleus of the same material as the emitter but in a lower energy state. In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom.  If the lost recoil energy is small compared with the energy [[linewidth]] of the nuclear transition, then the gamma ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called [[resonance|resonant]] [[fluorescence]].  Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding nuclear transition.\n\nThe amount of energy in the recoiling body ({{math|''E''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}}) can be found from momentum conservation:\n\n:<math>|P_\\mathrm{R}| = |P_\\mathrm{\\gamma}| \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''P''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}} is the momentum of the recoiling matter, and {{math|''P''{{sub|\u03b3}}}} the momentum of the gamma ray. Substituting energy into the equation gives:\n\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{R} = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{\\gamma}^2}{2Mc^2}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}} ({{val|0.002|ul=eV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the energy lost as recoil, {{math|''E''{{sub|\u03b3}}}} is the energy of the gamma ray ({{val|14.4|ul=keV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}), {{math|''M''}} ({{val|56.9354|ul=u}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the mass of the emitting or absorbing body, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].<ref>\n{{Cite web\n | last = Nave | first = C.R.\n | year = 2005\n | title = M\u00f6ssbauer Effect in Iron-57\n | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mossfe.html\n | work = [[HyperPhysics]]\n | publisher = [[Georgia State University]]\n | accessdate = 7 June 2010\n}}</ref>  In the case of a gas the emitting and absorbing bodies are atoms, so the mass is relatively small, resulting in a large recoil energy, which prevents resonance.  (Note that the same equation applies for recoil energy losses in x-rays, but the photon energy is much less, resulting in a lower energy loss, which is why gas-phase resonance could be observed with x-rays.)\n\nIn a solid, the nuclei are bound to the lattice and do not recoil in the same way as in a gas.  The lattice as a whole recoils but the recoil energy is negligible because the {{math|''M''}} in the above equation is the mass of the whole lattice.  However, the energy in a decay can be taken up or supplied by lattice vibrations.  The energy of these vibrations is quantised in units known as ''phonons''.  The M\u00f6ssbauer effect occurs because there is a finite probability of a decay occurring involving no phonons.  Thus in a fraction of the nuclear events (the '''recoil-free fraction''', given by the [[Lamb\u2013M\u00f6ssbauer factor]]), the entire crystal acts as the recoiling body, and these events are essentially recoil-free.  In these cases, since the recoil energy is negligible, the emitted gamma rays have the appropriate energy and resonance can occur.\n\nIn general (depending on the half-life of the decay), gamma rays have very narrow linewidths.  This means they are very sensitive to small changes in the energies of nuclear transitions.  In fact, gamma rays can be used as a probe to observe the effects of interactions between a nucleus and its electrons and those of its neighbors.  This is the basis for M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, which combines the M\u00f6ssbauer effect with the [[Doppler effect]] to monitor such interactions.\n\n[[Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband|Zero-phonon optical transitions]], a process closely analogous to the M\u00f6ssbauer effect, can be observed in lattice-bound [[chromophore]]s at low temperatures.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Isomeric shift]]\n* [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]]\n* [[Perturbed angular correlation]]\n* [[Nuclear spectroscopy]]\n* [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite journal\n  | last= M\u00f6ssbauer |first=R.

It involves the resonant and [[Atomic recoil|recoil]]-free emission and absorption of [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] by atomic nuclei bound in a solid. Its main application is in [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]].\n\nIn the M\u00f6ssbauer effect, a narrow resonance for nuclear gamma emission and absorption results from the momentum of recoil being delivered to a surrounding crystal lattice rather than to the emitting or absorbing nucleus alone. When this occurs, no gamma energy is lost to the kinetic energy of recoiling nuclei at either the emitting or absorbing end of a gamma transition: emission and absorption occur at the same energy, resulting in strong, resonant absorption.\n\n==History==\n\nThe emission and absorption of [[X-ray]]s by gases had been observed previously, and it was expected that a similar phenomenon would be found for [[gamma ray]]s, which are created by [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] transitions (as opposed to X-rays, which are typically produced by [[electron]]ic transitions).  However, attempts to observe nuclear resonance produced by gamma-rays in gases failed due to energy being lost to recoil, preventing resonance (the [[Doppler effect]] also broadens the gamma-ray spectrum).  M\u00f6ssbauer was able to observe resonance in nuclei of solid [[iridium]], which raised the question of why gamma-ray resonance was possible in solids, but not in gases. M\u00f6ssbauer proposed that, for the case of atoms bound into a solid, under certain circumstances a fraction of the nuclear events could occur essentially without recoil. He attributed the observed resonance to this recoil-free fraction of nuclear events.\n\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer effect was one of the last major discoveries in physics to be originally reported in the German language. The first report in English was a letter describing a repetition of the experiment.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Craig |first1=P.\n |last2=Dash |first2=J.\n |last3=McGuire |first3=A.\n |last4=Nagle |first4=D.\n |last5=Reiswig |first5=R.\n |year=1959\n |title=Nuclear Resonance Absorption of Gamma Rays in Ir<sup>191</sup>\n |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=221\n |bibcode=1959PhRvL...3..221C\n |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.3.221\n}}</ref>\n\nThe discovery was rewarded with the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1961 together with [[Robert Hofstadter]]'s research of [[electron scattering]] in atomic nuclei.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:M\u00f6ssbauerSpectrum57Fe.svg|thumb|right|250px|M\u00f6ssbauer absorption spectrum of <sup>57</sup>Fe]]\nThe M\u00f6ssbauer Effect is a process in which a nucleus emits or absorbs gamma rays without loss of energy to a nuclear recoil. It was discovered by the German physicist Rudolf L. M\u00f6ssbauer in 1958 and has proved to be remarkably useful for basic research in physics and chemistry. It has been used, for instance, in precisely measuring small energy changes in nuclei, atoms, and crystals induced by electrical, magnetic, or gravitational fields. In a transition of a nucleus from a higher to a lower energy state with accompanying emission of gamma rays, the emission generally causes the nucleus to recoil, and this takes energy from the emitted gamma rays. Thus the gamma rays do not have sufficient energy to excite a target nucleus to be examined. However, M\u00f6ssbauer discovered that it is possible to have transitions in which the recoil is absorbed by a whole crystal in which the emitting nucleus is bound. Under these circumstances, the energy that goes into the recoil is a negligible portion of the energy of the transition. Therefore, the emitted gamma rays carry virtually all of the energy liberated by the nuclear transition. The gamma rays thus are able to induce a reverse transition, under similar conditions of negligible recoil, in a target nucleus of the same material as the emitter but in a lower energy state. In general, gamma rays are produced by nuclear transitions from an unstable high-energy state to a stable low-energy state. The energy of the emitted gamma ray corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, minus an amount of energy that is lost as recoil to the emitting atom.  If the lost recoil energy is small compared with the energy [[linewidth]] of the nuclear transition, then the gamma ray energy still corresponds to the energy of the nuclear transition, and the gamma ray can be absorbed by a second atom of the same type as the first. This emission and subsequent absorption is called [[resonance|resonant]] [[fluorescence]].  Additional recoil energy is also lost during absorption, so in order for resonance to occur the recoil energy must actually be less than half the linewidth for the corresponding nuclear transition.\n\nThe amount of energy in the recoiling body ({{math|''E''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}}) can be found from momentum conservation:\n\n:<math>|P_\\mathrm{R}| = |P_\\mathrm{\\gamma}| \\,</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''P''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}} is the momentum of the recoiling matter, and {{math|''P''{{sub|\u03b3}}}} the momentum of the gamma ray. Substituting energy into the equation gives:\n\n:<math>E_\\mathrm{R} = \\frac{E_\\mathrm{\\gamma}^2}{2Mc^2}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''E''<small>{{sub|R}}</small>}} ({{val|0.002|ul=eV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the energy lost as recoil, {{math|''E''{{sub|\u03b3}}}} is the energy of the gamma ray ({{val|14.4|ul=keV}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}), {{math|''M''}} ({{val|56.9354|ul=u}} for {{SimpleNuclide2|Fe|57}}) is the mass of the emitting or absorbing body, and ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].<ref>\n{{Cite web\n | last = Nave | first = C.R.\n | year = 2005\n | title = M\u00f6ssbauer Effect in Iron-57\n | url = http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nuclear/mossfe.html\n | work = [[HyperPhysics]]\n | publisher = [[Georgia State University]]\n | accessdate = 7 June 2010\n}}</ref>  In the case of a gas the emitting and absorbing bodies are atoms, so the mass is relatively small, resulting in a large recoil energy, which prevents resonance.  (Note that the same equation applies for recoil energy losses in x-rays, but the photon energy is much less, resulting in a lower energy loss, which is why gas-phase resonance could be observed with x-rays.)\n\nIn a solid, the nuclei are bound to the lattice and do not recoil in the same way as in a gas.  The lattice as a whole recoils but the recoil energy is negligible because the {{math|''M''}} in the above equation is the mass of the whole lattice.  However, the energy in a decay can be taken up or supplied by lattice vibrations.  The energy of these vibrations is quantised in units known as ''phonons''.  The M\u00f6ssbauer effect occurs because there is a finite probability of a decay occurring involving no phonons.  Thus in a fraction of the nuclear events (the '''recoil-free fraction''', given by the [[Lamb\u2013M\u00f6ssbauer factor]]), the entire crystal acts as the recoiling body, and these events are essentially recoil-free.  In these cases, since the recoil energy is negligible, the emitted gamma rays have the appropriate energy and resonance can occur.\n\nIn general (depending on the half-life of the decay), gamma rays have very narrow linewidths.  This means they are very sensitive to small changes in the energies of nuclear transitions.  In fact, gamma rays can be used as a probe to observe the effects of interactions between a nucleus and its electrons and those of its neighbors.  This is the basis for M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy, which combines the M\u00f6ssbauer effect with the [[Doppler effect]] to monitor such interactions.\n\n[[Zero-phonon line and phonon sideband|Zero-phonon optical transitions]], a process closely analogous to the M\u00f6ssbauer effect, can be observed in lattice-bound [[chromophore]]s at low temperatures.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Isomeric shift]]\n* [[M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy]]\n* [[Perturbed angular correlation]]\n* [[Nuclear spectroscopy]]\n* [[Pound\u2013Rebka experiment]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*{{cite journal\n  | last= M\u00f6ssbauer |first=R.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

It ranges across [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]] extending into the United States portion of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. It is characterized by its long, dense fur, triangular ears with black tufts at the tips, and broad, [[snowshoe]]-like paws. Similar to the [[bobcat]] (''L. rufus''), the hindlimbs are remarkably longer than the forelimbs, so that the back appears to be sloping downward to the front. The lynx is a good swimmer and an agile climber. The Canada lynx stands {{convert|48|\u2013|56|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall at the shoulder and weighs between {{convert|5|and|17|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. This lynx was first [[scientific description|described]] by [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] in 1792. Three [[subspecies]] are recognized.\n\nThe Canada lynx is typically [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] like its primary prey, the [[snowshoe hare]]. The strong dependence of this [[Specialist and generalist species|specialist predator]] on snowshoe hares for food leads to an example of a prey-predator cycle. Canada lynxes respond to the cyclic rises and falls over the years in snowshoe hare populations in Alaska and central Canada\u2014when hares are scarce lynxes tend to move to areas with more hares and tend to not produce litters, and as the numbers of the hare increase, so does the population of the lynx. The lynx waits for the hare in specific trails or \"ambush beds\", then pounces on it and kills it by a bite on its head, throat or the nape of its neck. Individuals of the same sex particularly tend to avoid each other, forming \"intrasexual\" territories. The mating season is roughly a month long (from March to early April). After a gestational period of two to three months, a litter of one to eight kittens is born. Offspring are weaned at 12 weeks.\n\nThis lynx occurs predominantly in dense [[Taiga|boreal forest]]s, and its range heavily coincides with that of the snowshoe hare. Given its abundance throughout its range and no severe threats, this lynx has been listed as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. This lynx is regularly trapped for the international fur trade in most of Alaska and Canada, but is protected in the southern half of its range due to threats such as habitat loss.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn his 1792 work ''The Animal Kingdom'', Scottish scientific writer [[Robert Kerr (writer)|Robert Kerr]] [[Scientific description|described]] a [[Lynx (genus)|lynx]] from Canada, giving it the [[Binomial nomenclature|name]] ''Felis lynx canadensis''.<ref name=\"Kerr1792\">{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=R. |authorlink=Robert Kerr (writer) |title=The Animal Kingdom |date=1792 |publisher=A.

Canada lynxes generally avoid open areas despite good prey availability; they face difficulty surviving in heavily logged areas and agricultural land, though they can thrive well in deforested areas which have been left to regenerate for 15 years or more. In the past, the lynx occurred from the northern United States (in 24 States), possibly up to the [[Rocky Mountains]] in [[New Mexico]], to the [[tree line]] in the Arctic through coniferous forests in Alaska and Canada. The lynx continues to occur in most of Alaska and its erstwhile range in Canada. In the United States, the lynx occurs in the  [[Blue Mountains (Pacific Northwest)|Blue Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]] and southern Rocky Mountains, [[Great Lakes region]] and [[New England]].

Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 mentioned night fighting only in Section 253. The regulation stipulated in vague language, that night fighting zones should be established so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each others operations. The regulation foresaw the use of [[Search light]]s in cooperation with pilots. Any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' did order experiments with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10\u201316}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15\u201316}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} [[Josef Kammhuber]] established the Night Fighter Division and [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI/NJG 2 was formed on 1 September 1940 from elements of 1./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 1]] (ZG&nbsp;1) and  the original II./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 1]] (NJG&nbsp;1). II. ''Gruppe'' was raised as a single ''staffel'' (number 4) from 1./''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 2. The ''gruppe'' was formally ativated as such on 1 November 1941. It used 4 and 6/NJG 1 to accomplish the formation. On 1 October 1942 it became IV/NJG 1, and the existing III/NJG 2 became the new II/NJG 2 from that date. III./NJG 2 was formed in March 1942 and on 1 October 1942 became II/NJG 2. The second formation, simultaneous with its disbandment, was made from V/[[NJG 6]]. On 30 October 1944 was redesignated IV/[[NJG 3]]. The existing IV/NJG 3 became III/NJG 3 in that wing. IV/NJG 2 was formed on 30 October 1944 from I/NJG 7 and on 23 February 1945 became NSGr 30. V/NJG 2 was formed from the retraining of III/[[KG 2]] but this ''gruppe'' did not reach operational status.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} Stab/NJG 2 was not formed unitl 1 November 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}} Thus the existing ''gruppen'' acted independently or as attachments to other night fighter wings. In general the night fighter force was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]C-2, C-4 and D-1; the latter had the \"[[Daschund]]\" belly tank removed. I/NJG 2 was the exception to the rule. [[Junkers Ju 88]]A-5 bombers were modified\u2014stripped of bomber equipment\u2014and converted to Ju 88C-2 [[heavy fighter]] standard.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Dornier Do 17]]Z-7s ''Krauz'' were modified from bomber to night fighter standard. The Do 17 and Ju 88 initialled had weaker armament to the Bf 110, but the latter types could carry bombs considered ideal for intruder operations.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==World War II==\nOver Europe, the German defences were limited against Bomber Command raids in 1940 and 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precise [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvantage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32\u201333}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf&nbsp;110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over {{convert|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. German pilots would have to detect the bomber early in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} Kammhuber introduced tighter control-based tactics for night fighters, searchlight batteries and radar. The night fighters were guided to a light and radio beacon located behind an \"illuminated belt\" of searchlights. Once a bomber was detected the night fighter flew into the belt, turned behind the bomber and began the combat.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=18\u201319}} W\u00fcrzburg radars were required for the intercept; one to track the fighter, the other the bomber in order to coordinate the searchlight. It became known as the ''Helle Nachtjagd'' (Illuminated night fighting).{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=27}} The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) replaced this system in 1941. The system remained the same, but the accurate, long-range Freya was introduced to maintain overall surveillance and often could bring the radar-less night fighters into visual range of the bomber.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=27}} The introduction of the Freya radar, eventually improved the range and identification problems prevalent in 1940 and 1941. Weaknesses of the system allowed for only one German night fighter to be controlled from the ground by a team of two W\u00fcrzburg's. Experimentation with [[Lichtenstein radar]] in 1941, and its gradual introduction in 1942, provided night fighters with their own sets on-board and increased the independence and effectiveness of night fighters.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=13\u201318}} The removal of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns to organised points near cities by 1942 freed night fighters from direct cooperation with searchlights meaning that all the fighting was conducted purely in the dark.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n===Intruder operations===\n[[File:Luftwaffeintrudermap1940to1941.jpg|thumb|Boundary map drawn up by the Luftwaffe in 1940 for intruder operations]]\nBefore the introduction of improved radars and [[airborne radar]], Kammhuber founded the ''Fernnachtjagd'', or long-range night fighter [[Intruder (air combat)|intruder force]] 1940 to explore alterantive night fighting methods and to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17, 30}} The Luftwaffe quickly developed a series of basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar at this stage in the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the ''Fernnachtjagd'' in operations over Britain.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} ''Major'' Kuhlmann, head of the [[wireless telegraphy]] interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did [[Wolfgang Martini]]'s ''Luftnachrichtentruppe'' (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the [[North Sea]], and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or ''R\u00e4ume'' (areas). ''Raum A'' was [[Yorkshire]], bounded by [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. ''Raum B'' covered the [[The Midlands, England|Midlands]] and [[Lincolnshire]] whilst ''Raum C'' encompassed [[East Anglia]] bounded by London [[Peterborough]], [[Luton]] and [[The Wash]]. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} \n\nUnder the command of Karl-Heinrich Heyse,{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=129}} I./NJG 2 was designated an intruder unit, as the idea of a complete intruder wing gained traction. The ''gruppe'' was assigned longer-range and modified Do 17Z and Ju 88C aircraft for intruder operations as they could carry heavy armament and bombs, unlike the shorter-range Bf 110. German airborne radar was still a year from operations, and German crews were reliant on visual contacts; navigation lights and [[Flare Path]]s. The Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II had an infra-red searchlight for the ''Spanner Anlage'' [[infrared]] detection system installed to aid detection-finding.{{sfn|Spick|2011|p=145}}{{sfn|Price|1973|p=20}} During the late summer 1940, the staff of I./NJG 2 at [[Gilze-Rijen Air Base]] developed tactics for operations over the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=40}} The first claim was made in this role on 23/24 October 1940. Heyse, a [[Condor Legion]] veteran, was killed within the month and replaced.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=129}} The practice of intruder operations proved difficult in 1940. By December NJG 2 had lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF aircraft claimed shot down. Despite the claims made by German crews, evidence showed a considerable amount of [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories during World War II|over claiming]], and the difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over enemy territory became evident.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} The [[operational level]] problems left an average of only 20 machines available for intruder missions between August 1940 and October 1941.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=40}} Between 1 October 1940 and 31 March 1941 the crews of NJG 2 made some fifty individual attacks on Bomber Command aircraft.{{sfn|Bowyer|2003|pp=90\u201391}} By November 15 serviceable aircraft in the ''gruppe'' had fallen to seven by February 1941.{{sfn|Bowyer|2003|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nIntruder pilots began accumulating personnel successes. One such pilot was [[Paul Semrau]]. He claimed his 6th victory on the night of 18/19 June 1941 off [[Great Yarmouth]]. Semrau claimed 46 night victories until he was killed by [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in February 1945 conducting an unwise daylight test flight.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=23}} There were successful intruder pilots who did not become high-claiming night fighters. Albert Schulz and Hermann Sommer of 2./NJG&nbsp;2 claimed several victories over England; Sommer later fought in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=19}} Sommer proved intruders a threat to RAF training centres when he accounted for a [[Airspeed Oxford]] trainer on 29 April 1941, confirmed through British sources.{{sfn|Foreman|1993|pp=127-128}} [[Wilhelm Beier]], another eventual [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] recipient, from 3./NJG 2 claimed two aircraft on two consecutive nights from 5\u20137 July 1941 to reach his 10th victory. [[Heinz-Horst Hi\u00dfbach]] was another that began his career on intruder missions.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=24, 195}} Total claims improved from 1940. In 1941, until mid-October, 128 RAF aircraft were claimed against 28 losses.{{sfn|Spick|2011|p=145}} Other sources put German losses at 55 aircraft along with 74 personnel.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=41}} RAF night fighters carrying [[Airborne Interception radar]] were making flights to England hazardous.{{sfn|Spick|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} [[Hans Hahn (night fighter pilot)|Hans Hahn]] of I./NJG&nbsp;2 became the leading intruder \"expert\", but was killed in October 1941, shortly before [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered a stop to intruder operations.{{sfn|Foreman|1993|p=145}} Bomber Command reports list only seven complete losses to intruders and 20 badly damaged aircraft from 1 October 1940 to 31 March 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}}\n\nDespite the heavy price I./NJG&nbsp;2 had to pay, their successes rose. On 26 June 1941, the ''gruppe'' claimed its 100th victory.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=41}} Expansion and intensification of intruder operations carried out by NJG&nbsp;2 and NJG&nbsp;1 was hampered by the low production of Ju&nbsp;88 night fighter variants, to Kammhuber's frustration\u2014he viewed the type as the standard intruder for the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=45}} As it appeared night intruder [[sortie]]s were showing promise Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, he thought that the morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during [[The Blitz]]. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=43}}\n\n===Area offensives: Cologne and L\u00fcbeck===\nAt the end of 1941 Bomber Command's future was in doubt after the shock of the [[Butt Report]]. 1942 became the command's watershed year.{{sfn|Chorley|1994|p=7}} In February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} At the start of the area offensives Stab/NJG 2, under the command of Hulshoff, II. ''Gruppe'' under Lent, and III. ''Gruppe'' under B\u00f6nsch, were based at Gilze Rijn. II/NJG 2, which travelled to [[Sicily]], returned in September 1942 and was posted to [[Melsbroek]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} In February 1942, II./NJG&nbsp;2 took part in [[Operation Donnerkeil]] to provide air cover for the [[Kriegsmarine]]'s [[Operation Cerberus]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=50}}\n\nLent was among the few NJG 2 pilots to claim in the defence of L\u00fcbeck to reach his 26th night victory.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=36\u201337}} Bomber Command's success cost them only 12 aircraft.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2008|p=42}} NJG&nbsp;2 claimed 11 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} By this time a number of fighter pilots from NJG 1 had joined NJG 2. [[Helmut Lent]] (49 at the end of 1942) and [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] (44), the former the second highest claiming night fighter in history, and the latter the first to claim a victory with [[Lichtenstein radar]] introduced in small numbers in 1941 joined in November that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=40, 227, 240}} [[Paul Gildner]] (38) followed from NJG 1. Other NJG 2 pilots and their supporting crews, [[Leopold Fellerer]], [[Heinz Str\u00fcning]] (23), [[Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]] (38), [[Rudolf Schoenert]] (23) began claiming bombers with growing frequency in 1942. These men led the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[Heinz Vinke]] made his first claims in 1942 becoming an ace in August.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=56}} The cause of this rise in claims was growing experience of crews and ground controllers, coupled with high-performing ground radar and the introduction of airborne sets installed in night fighters. In November 1941 [[Winston Churchill]] ordered Bomber Command to curtail German operations to conserve its strength for 1942.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=113\u2013118}} The initial reaction by night fighter pilots, who followed the trends set by Lent and Gildner, to Lichtenstein radar was hostile. The set was perceived as cumbersome and negatively effected the performance of the aircraft.{{sfn|National Archives|2001|p=191}}\n\nThe transition to airborne radar was not smooth. Production failures and rushed construction damaged their potential. Even in August 1943, two years after its debut, eighty percent of the sets produced and delivered to operational centres at [[Werl]] and [[G\u00fctersloh]] were defective and technicians were overloaded with repair work. A large proportion of the Lichtenstein sets were sent back to the manufacturer. The consequences of the reduction in operational sets, was the Netherlands-based units were given priority. I./NJG&nbsp;1 and II./NJG&nbsp;2 were given priority since they patrolled air space most used by Bomber Command squadrons in transit to Germany. High preforming maintenance teams ensured these ''gruppen'' had above average operational sets. In September 1942, the ''gruppen'' were fully equipped with the Lichtenstein B/C model. A test detachment helped with II./NJG&nbsp;2 availability. A crucial development was the use of IFF (identification friend or foe) devices in the night fighters and as attachments to the Freya. Signals, or pulses, were sent from the Freya, picked up by the night fighter, and returned at a certain rhythm. The Freya controllers could now see which blips on their screens were enemy and friendly. None of the devices had been tested in combat. Luftwaffe controllers opted to use radio transmissions ([[Y-stations|Y-service]]) at the time instead, since it was proven in bomber navigation. Through using transmitters, receivers and [[radio direction finding|direction finding equipment]], the bearing, height and range of the night fighter could be determined. In practice two Wurzburg sets controlled one fighter, while the Y-Service controlled two all within one zone or \"box\". The practice soon exposed the difficulties in Y-controlled night fighting; although it provided faultless IFF it was not as accurate as radar and vulnerable to British jamming and allowed their night fighters to home in on German aircraft. The use of IFF devices and airborne radar were the only ways to detect enemy aircraft and plan an interception.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=76\u221277}} \n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-484-2984-31A, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 88.jpg|thumb|left|Ju 88C heavy fighter.

Italian military defeats necessitated the dispatch of the [[German Africa Corps]] (''Deutsches Afrika Korps'') under the command of [[Erwin Rommel]] to prevent the collapse of [[Italian Libya]] after the failed [[Italian invasion of Egypt]]. The Luftwaffe High Command ([[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]) sent forces into North Africa and Mediterranean to support to Axis forces and lay [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|lay siege to Malta]], the base from which British sea and air forces interdicted Axis air and supply routes.\n\nI./NJG&nbsp;2 was ordered to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]].

It was not furnished with Lichtenstein radar and the crews had to fighter their war blind, supported by a few radar sets on the ground.

Daylight brought no respite for the pilots had to fly interceptions, convoy escort and [[close air support]] where possible. Only assistance from III./[[ZG 26]] provided relief. The pilots were forced to fly to the limits of their aircraft and endurance. In June and July 1942 they were still able to claim 25 aircraft shot down. Four pilots were awarded the [[German Cross in Gold]] in Africa. In August 1942 the ''gruppe'' was sent back to Sicily, presumably to fly in support of the invasion of Malta.

Luftwaffe Service Regulation No. 16 mentioned night fighting only in Section 253. The regulation stipulated in vague language, that night fighting zones should be established so that night fighters and [[anti-aircraft artillery]] did not interfere with each others operations. The regulation foresaw the use of [[Search light]]s in cooperation with pilots. Any hinderance to offensive air forces caused by \"restrictive measures\" was to be avoided. The prevailing attitude to night fighting left commanders on the ground to carry out research on their own; the first occurred in [[Berlin]], by ''Luftkreiskommando'' II from May to November 1936. The ''[[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]'' did order experiments with searchlights and aircraft from the summer, 1937. In 1939 several night fighter ''staffeln'' (squadrons or flights) had been established; but all of these had been converted back to day fighter units by 16 August 1939.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10, 12}} \n\nThe [[German invasion of Poland]] in September 1939 began [[World War II]] in [[Europe]]. The [[French Air Force]] and [[RAF Bomber Command]] began bombing raids on German ports and shipping. The [[Battle of the Heligoland Bight (1939)|Battle of the Heligoland Bight]] in December 1939 ended [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) daylight operations until 1944. Bomber Command persisted in night operations against Germany, which extended to German towns and cities from 10/11 May 1940. The [[Armistice of 22 June 1940|capitulation of the Fench]] after the [[Battle of France]] did not end the threat posed by British air power.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=10\u201316}}{{sfn|Caldwell|Muller|2007|p=41}} [[Wolfgang Falck]] commanded I/ZG 1 during the [[German invasion of Denmark]]. Immediately after the occupation, Bomber Command appeared frequently to attack German positions, and Falck was able to fly interceptions during [[dusk]]. Falck was sure that a [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] unit could defend the airspace at night with assistance from [[radar]] operators. Falck was invited to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Nazi Germany)|RLM]] to express his views to [[Albert Kesselring]], [[Ernst Udet]] and [[Erhard Milch]]. [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, ordered Falck to created a ''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' at [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] on 22 June 1940.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=15\u201316}} \n\nFalck came to the conclusion, night fighting could not be organised and operated by one commanding officer of a single wing. In response, [[Josef Kammhuber]] formed the Night Fighter Division. Radar, search lights and anti-aircraft artillery were coordinated under this organisation at [[division (military)|division]]-level on 17 July 1940. On 23 July the headquarters was established at [[Brussels]], in occupied [[Belgium]]. On 1 August 1940 a command post was established at [[Zeist]] near [[Utrecht]] in the occupied [[Netherlands]]. The Zerst\u00f6rer pilots and units were used for conversion to night fighters. No night fighter training schools existed in 1940, until blind-flying schools were established at [[Schlei\u00dfheim]] from 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=16\u201317}} [[Josef Kammhuber]] established the Night Fighter Division and [[Kammhuber Line]], which evenutally allowed radar to guide night fighters to RAF bombers.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17\u201329}}\n\n===Formation===\nI/NJG 2 was formed on 1 September 1940 from elements of 1./[[Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader 1|''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 1]] (ZG&nbsp;1) and  the original II./[[Nachtjagdgeschwader 1|''Nachtjagdgeschwader'' 1]] (NJG&nbsp;1). II. ''Gruppe'' was raised as a single ''staffel'' (number 4) from 1./''Zerst\u00f6rergeschwader'' 2. The ''gruppe'' was formally ativated as such on 1 November 1941. It used 4 and 6/NJG 1 to accomplish the formation. On 1 October 1942 it became IV/NJG 1, and the existing III/NJG 2 became the new II/NJG 2 from that date. III./NJG 2 was formed in March 1942 and on 1 October 1942 became II/NJG 2. The second formation, simultaneous with its disbandment, was made from V/[[NJG 6]]. On 30 October 1944 was redesignated IV/[[NJG 3]]. The existing IV/NJG 3 became III/NJG 3 in that wing. IV/NJG 2 was formed on 30 October 1944 from I/NJG 7 and on 23 February 1945 became NSGr 30. V/NJG 2 was formed from the retraining of III/[[KG 2]] but this ''gruppe'' did not reach operational status.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=224}} Stab/NJG 2 was not formed unitl 1 November 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=227}} Thus the existing ''gruppen'' acted independently or as attachments to other night fighter wings. In general the night fighter force was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]]C-2, C-4 and D-1; the latter had the \"[[Daschund]]\" belly tank removed. I/NJG 2 was the exception to the rule. [[Junkers Ju 88]]A-5 bombers were modified\u2014stripped of bomber equipment\u2014and converted to Ju 88C-2 [[heavy fighter]] standard.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=27}} [[Dornier Do 17]]Z-7s ''Krauz'' were modified from bomber to night fighter standard. The Do 17 and Ju 88 initialled had weaker armament to the Bf 110, but the latter types could carry bombs considered ideal for intruder operations.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=27\u201328}}\n\n==World War II==\nOver Europe, the German defences were limited against Bomber Command raids in 1940 and 1941. The [[Nazi propaganda]] machine dismissed RAF bombers as \"tired old cows\", but the limited range of the precise [[W\u00fcrzburg radar]], and the inability to distinguish friend from foe, left the Luftwaffe at a disadvantage. The ''Henaja'' belt, which provided three radars per searchlight battery, covered the area from the Danish border to [[Maubeuge]], could detect bombers entering and exiting the zone with great accuracy, but RAF bomber pilots learned to dive upon departing the belt, accelerate past the search light batteries at low-altitudes and escape the most hazardous part of the defence zone. The system bore the burden of the defensive battles in 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=32\u201333}} In 1942, the introduction of the [[Handley-Page Halifax]] and [[Avro Lancaster]] would produce further problems. The bombers could outrun a Bf&nbsp;110C or D in a shallow dive and at altitudes of over {{convert|5,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. German pilots would have to detect the bomber early in order to be able to dive from much greater heights.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=32}} Kammhuber introduced tighter control-based tactics for night fighters, searchlight batteries and radar. The night fighters were guided to a light and radio beacon located behind an \"illuminated belt\" of searchlights. Once a bomber was detected the night fighter flew into the belt, turned behind the bomber and began the combat.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=18\u201319}} W\u00fcrzburg radars were required for the intercept; one to track the fighter, the other the bomber in order to coordinate the searchlight. It became known as the ''Helle Nachtjagd'' (Illuminated night fighting).{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=27}} The ''Himmelbett'' (canopy bed) replaced this system in 1941. The system remained the same, but the accurate, long-range Freya was introduced to maintain overall surveillance and often could bring the radar-less night fighters into visual range of the bomber.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=27}} The introduction of the Freya radar, eventually improved the range and identification problems prevalent in 1940 and 1941. Weaknesses of the system allowed for only one German night fighter to be controlled from the ground by a team of two W\u00fcrzburg's. Experimentation with [[Lichtenstein radar]] in 1941, and its gradual introduction in 1942, provided night fighters with their own sets on-board and increased the independence and effectiveness of night fighters.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=13\u201318}} The removal of searchlights and anti-aircraft guns to organised points near cities by 1942 freed night fighters from direct cooperation with searchlights meaning that all the fighting was conducted purely in the dark.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=13\u201318}}\n\n===Intruder operations===\n[[File:Luftwaffeintrudermap1940to1941.jpg|thumb|Boundary map drawn up by the Luftwaffe in 1940 for intruder operations]]\nBefore the introduction of improved radars and [[airborne radar]], Kammhuber founded the ''Fernnachtjagd'', or long-range night fighter [[Intruder (air combat)|intruder force]] 1940 to explore alterantive night fighting methods and to forestall the intensified Bomber Command raids.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=17, 30}} The Luftwaffe quickly developed a series of basic tactics for intercepting enemy intruders. The lack of airborne radar at this stage in the war meant finding and destroying Allied bombers at night was a difficult prospect, thus it was decided to use the ''Fernnachtjagd'' in operations over Britain.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=17}} ''Major'' Kuhlmann, head of the [[wireless telegraphy]] interception service played a significant part in assisting the Luftwaffe night fighter force as did [[Wolfgang Martini]]'s ''Luftnachrichtentruppe'' (Air Signal Corps). Intercepting British signal communications by monitoring the radio traffic of enemy ground stations and aircraft the Germans could determine where and at what airfields RAF night activity was occurring. With the British base identified Falck could then move against them over their own airfields. Three waves could then be deployed; one to attack the bombers as they took off, one to cover the known routes taken by the enemy over the [[North Sea]], and the third to attack them on landing at a time when, after a long flight, enemy crews were tired and much less alert. For operational purposes, Eastern England was divided into four regions or ''R\u00e4ume'' (areas). ''Raum A'' was [[Yorkshire]], bounded by [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. ''Raum B'' covered the [[The Midlands, England|Midlands]] and [[Lincolnshire]] whilst ''Raum C'' encompassed [[East Anglia]] bounded by London [[Peterborough]], [[Luton]] and [[The Wash]]. Operations began in earnest in October 1940.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}} \n\nUnder the command of Karl-Heinrich Heyse,{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=129}} I./NJG 2 was designated an intruder unit, as the idea of a complete intruder wing gained traction. The ''gruppe'' was assigned longer-range and modified Do 17Z and Ju 88C aircraft for intruder operations as they could carry heavy armament and bombs, unlike the shorter-range Bf 110. German airborne radar was still a year from operations, and German crews were reliant on visual contacts; navigation lights and [[Flare Path]]s. The Do 17 Z-10 Kauz II had an infra-red searchlight for the ''Spanner Anlage'' [[infrared]] detection system installed to aid detection-finding.{{sfn|Spick|2011|p=145}}{{sfn|Price|1973|p=20}} During the late summer 1940, the staff of I./NJG 2 at [[Gilze-Rijen Air Base]] developed tactics for operations over the [[United Kingdom]].{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=40}} The first claim was made in this role on 23/24 October 1940. Heyse, a [[Condor Legion]] veteran, was killed within the month and replaced.{{sfn|Hooton|1999|p=129}} The practice of intruder operations proved difficult in 1940. By December NJG 2 had lost 32 aircrew [[killed in action]] and 12 aircraft lost in exchange for 18 RAF aircraft claimed shot down. Despite the claims made by German crews, evidence showed a considerable amount of [[Confirmation and overclaiming of aerial victories during World War II|over claiming]], and the difficulty in substantiating claims at night and over enemy territory became evident.{{sfn|Parry|2003|pp=31, 33, 35, 37}} The [[operational level]] problems left an average of only 20 machines available for intruder missions between August 1940 and October 1941.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=40}} Between 1 October 1940 and 31 March 1941 the crews of NJG 2 made some fifty individual attacks on Bomber Command aircraft.{{sfn|Bowyer|2003|pp=90\u201391}} By November 15 serviceable aircraft in the ''gruppe'' had fallen to seven by February 1941.{{sfn|Bowyer|2003|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nIntruder pilots began accumulating personnel successes. One such pilot was [[Paul Semrau]]. He claimed his 6th victory on the night of 18/19 June 1941 off [[Great Yarmouth]]. Semrau claimed 46 night victories until he was killed by [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s in February 1945 conducting an unwise daylight test flight.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=23}} There were successful intruder pilots who did not become high-claiming night fighters. Albert Schulz and Hermann Sommer of 2./NJG&nbsp;2 claimed several victories over England; Sommer later fought in the [[Battle of the Mediterranean]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=19}} Sommer proved intruders a threat to RAF training centres when he accounted for a [[Airspeed Oxford]] trainer on 29 April 1941, confirmed through British sources.{{sfn|Foreman|1993|pp=127-128}} [[Wilhelm Beier]], another eventual [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] recipient, from 3./NJG 2 claimed two aircraft on two consecutive nights from 5\u20137 July 1941 to reach his 10th victory. [[Heinz-Horst Hi\u00dfbach]] was another that began his career on intruder missions.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=24, 195}} Total claims improved from 1940. In 1941, until mid-October, 128 RAF aircraft were claimed against 28 losses.{{sfn|Spick|2011|p=145}} Other sources put German losses at 55 aircraft along with 74 personnel.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=41}} RAF night fighters carrying [[Airborne Interception radar]] were making flights to England hazardous.{{sfn|Spick|2011|pp=145\u2013146}} [[Hans Hahn (night fighter pilot)|Hans Hahn]] of I./NJG&nbsp;2 became the leading intruder \"expert\", but was killed in October 1941, shortly before [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered a stop to intruder operations.{{sfn|Foreman|1993|p=145}} Bomber Command reports list only seven complete losses to intruders and 20 badly damaged aircraft from 1 October 1940 to 31 March 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=30}}\n\nDespite the heavy price I./NJG&nbsp;2 had to pay, their successes rose. On 26 June 1941, the ''gruppe'' claimed its 100th victory.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=41}} Expansion and intensification of intruder operations carried out by NJG&nbsp;2 and NJG&nbsp;1 was hampered by the low production of Ju&nbsp;88 night fighter variants, to Kammhuber's frustration\u2014he viewed the type as the standard intruder for the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=45}} As it appeared night intruder [[sortie]]s were showing promise Hitler ordered a cessation of operations. For propaganda purposes, he thought that the morale of the German people would be better served by seeing British bombers destroyed and wrecked over German territory. Hitler was also reticent owing the fact there had been no noticeable reduction in British air raids and the RAF had not adopted these methods during [[The Blitz]]. This order came into effect on 12 October 1941.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfn|Boiten|1997|p=43}}\n\n===Area offensives: Cologne and L\u00fcbeck===\nAt the end of 1941 Bomber Command's future was in doubt after the shock of the [[Butt Report]]. 1942 became the command's watershed year.{{sfn|Chorley|1994|p=7}} In February 1942, [[Air Marshall]] [[Sir Arthur Harris, 1st Baronet|Arthur Harris]] became [[Air Officer Commanding]] Bomber Command. Harris became the driving force behind producing a powerful [[heavy bomber]] command to carry out his [[area bombing]] operations. The attacks on [[Bombing of L\u00fcbeck in World War II|L\u00fcbeck in March]] and [[Bombing of Cologne in World War II|Cologne in May]] 1942 began the new phase in the [[Defence of the Reich]] campaign.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} At the start of the area offensives Stab/NJG 2, under the command of Hulshoff, II. ''Gruppe'' under Lent, and III. ''Gruppe'' under B\u00f6nsch, were based at Gilze Rijn. II/NJG 2, which travelled to [[Sicily]], returned in September 1942 and was posted to [[Melsbroek]].{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=41}} In February 1942, II./NJG&nbsp;2 took part in [[Operation Donnerkeil]] to provide air cover for the [[Kriegsmarine]]'s [[Operation Cerberus]].{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=50}}\n\nLent was among the few NJG 2 pilots to claim in the defence of L\u00fcbeck to reach his 26th night victory.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|pp=36\u201337}} Bomber Command's success cost them only 12 aircraft.{{sfn|Heaton|Lewis|2008|p=42}} NJG&nbsp;2 claimed 11 bombers during the latter attack on Cologne on 30/31 May 1942 from the 32 claimed by German night fighter units.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=42}} 41 bombers were lost.{{sfn|Everitt|1985|p=127}} By this time a number of fighter pilots from NJG 1 had joined NJG 2. [[Helmut Lent]] (49 at the end of 1942) and [[Ludwig Becker (pilot)|Ludwig Becker]] (44), the former the second highest claiming night fighter in history, and the latter the first to claim a victory with [[Lichtenstein radar]] introduced in small numbers in 1941 joined in November that year.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=40, 227, 240}} [[Paul Gildner]] (38) followed from NJG 1. Other NJG 2 pilots and their supporting crews, [[Leopold Fellerer]], [[Heinz Str\u00fcning]] (23), [[Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]] (38), [[Rudolf Schoenert]] (23) began claiming bombers with growing frequency in 1942. These men led the Luftwaffe.{{sfn|Aders|1978|p=240}} [[Heinz Vinke]] made his first claims in 1942 becoming an ace in August.{{sfn|Foreman|Parry|Matthews|2004|p=56}} The cause of this rise in claims was growing experience of crews and ground controllers, coupled with high-performing ground radar and the introduction of airborne sets installed in night fighters. In November 1941 [[Winston Churchill]] ordered Bomber Command to curtail German operations to conserve its strength for 1942.{{sfn|Hall|1998|pp=113\u2013118}} The initial reaction by night fighter pilots, who followed the trends set by Lent and Gildner, to Lichtenstein radar was hostile. The set was perceived as cumbersome and negatively effected the performance of the aircraft.{{sfn|National Archives|2001|p=191}}\n\nThe transition to airborne radar was not smooth. Production failures and rushed construction damaged their potential. Even in August 1943, two years after its debut, eighty percent of the sets produced and delivered to operational centres at [[Werl]] and [[G\u00fctersloh]] were defective and technicians were overloaded with repair work. A large proportion of the Lichtenstein sets were sent back to the manufacturer. The consequences of the reduction in operational sets, was the Netherlands-based units were given priority. I./NJG&nbsp;1 and II./NJG&nbsp;2 were given priority since they patrolled air space most used by Bomber Command squadrons in transit to Germany. High preforming maintenance teams ensured these ''gruppen'' had above average operational sets. In September 1942, the ''gruppen'' were fully equipped with the Lichtenstein B/C model. A test detachment helped with II./NJG&nbsp;2 availability. A crucial development was the use of IFF (identification friend or foe) devices in the night fighters and as attachments to the Freya. Signals, or pulses, were sent from the Freya, picked up by the night fighter, and returned at a certain rhythm. The Freya controllers could now see which blips on their screens were enemy and friendly. None of the devices had been tested in combat. Luftwaffe controllers opted to use radio transmissions ([[Y-stations|Y-service]]) at the time instead, since it was proven in bomber navigation. Through using transmitters, receivers and [[radio direction finding|direction finding equipment]], the bearing, height and range of the night fighter could be determined. In practice two Wurzburg sets controlled one fighter, while the Y-Service controlled two all within one zone or \"box\". The practice soon exposed the difficulties in Y-controlled night fighting; although it provided faultless IFF it was not as accurate as radar and vulnerable to British jamming and allowed their night fighters to home in on German aircraft. The use of IFF devices and airborne radar were the only ways to detect enemy aircraft and plan an interception.{{sfn|Aders|1978|pp=76\u221277}} \n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-484-2984-31A, Flugzeug Junkers Ju 88.jpg|thumb|left|Ju 88C heavy fighter.

Italian military defeats necessitated the dispatch of the [[German Africa Corps]] (''Deutsches Afrika Korps'') under the command of [[Erwin Rommel]] to prevent the collapse of [[Italian Libya]] after the failed [[Italian invasion of Egypt]]. The Luftwaffe High Command ([[Oberkommando der Luftwaffe]]) sent forces into North Africa and Mediterranean to support to Axis forces and lay [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|lay siege to Malta]], the base from which British sea and air forces interdicted Axis air and supply routes.\n\nI./NJG&nbsp;2 was ordered to [[Catania]], [[Sicily]]. Though its ''staffeln'' ended up spread throughout the Mediteranean and Africa from April 1942 but Catania was its headquarters.{{sfn|Forsyth|2019|p=47}} It remained in southern Europe until September 1942. It was not furnished with Lichtenstein radar and the crews had to fighter their war blind, supported by a few radar sets on the ground. The reasons lay in the fear of the OKL that an aircraft may land in enemy territory and captured. Daylight brought no respite for the pilots had to fly interceptions, convoy escort and [[close air support]] where possible. Only assistance from III./[[ZG 26]] provided relief. The pilots were forced to fly to the limits of their aircraft and endurance. In June and July 1942 they were still able to claim 25 aircraft shot down. Four pilots were awarded the [[German Cross in Gold]] in Africa. In August 1942 the ''gruppe'' was sent back to Sicily, presumably to fly in support of the invasion of Malta.
