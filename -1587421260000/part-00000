Torvalds cited an example of a source-control management system needing 30 seconds to apply a patch and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where synchronizing with fellow maintainers could require 250 such actions at once. For his design criterion, he specified that patching should take no more than three seconds,<ref name=\"kernel_SCM_saga\" /> and added three more points:\n* Take [[Concurrent Versions System]] (CVS) as an example of what ''not'' to do; if in doubt, make the exact opposite decision.<ref name=\"linusGoogleTalk\" />\n* Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow.<ref name=\"linusGoogleTalk\" />\n* Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious.<ref name=\"integrity_goals\" />\n\nThese criteria eliminated every then-extant version-control system, so immediately after the 2.6.12-rc2 Linux kernel development release, Torvalds set out to write his own.<ref name=\"linusGoogleTalk\" />\n\nThe development of Git began on 3 April 2005.<ref name=\"selfhost\">{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117254154130732 |title=Re: Trivia: When did git self-host? |date=2007-02-27 |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |mailinglist=git}}</ref> Torvalds announced the project on 6 April;<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111280216717070 |title=Kernel SCM saga.. |date=2005-04-06 |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |mailinglist=linux-kernel}}</ref> it became [[Self-hosting (compilers)|self-hosting]] as of 7 April.<ref name=\"selfhost\" /> The first merge of multiple branches took place on 18 April.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=111377572329534 |title=First ever real kernel git merge! |date=2005-04-17 |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |mailinglist=git}}</ref> Torvalds achieved his performance goals; on 29 April, the nascent Git was benchmarked recording patches to the Linux kernel tree at the rate of 6.7 patches per second.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=111475459526688 |title=Mercurial 0.4b vs git patchbomb benchmark |date=2005-04-29 |last=Mackall |first=Matt |mailinglist=git}}</ref> On 16 June, Git managed the kernel 2.6.12 release.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git-commits-head&m=111904216911731 |title=Linux 2.6.12 |date=2005-06-17 |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |mailinglist=git-commits-head}}</ref>\n\nTorvalds turned over [[software maintenance|maintenance]] on 26 July 2005 to Junio Hamano, a major contributor to the project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=112243466603239 |title=Meet the new maintainer... |date=2005-07-27 |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |mailinglist=git}}</ref> Hamano was responsible for the 1.0 release on 21 December 2005 and remains the project's maintainer.<ref>{{cite mailing list |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=113515203321888 |title=Announce: Git 1.0.0 |date=2005-12-21 |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |mailinglist=git}}</ref>\n\n===Naming===\nTorvalds sarcastically quipped about the name ''git'' (which means ''unpleasant person'' in [[British English]] slang): \"I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself.

These influences led to the following implementation choices:{{citation needed | reason=the content is highly questionable and hence proper citation is required | date = February 2017}}\n; Strong support for non-linear development: Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existent CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst's Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed that it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version-control systems; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all}}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a ''commit'' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User's Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git's script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}, praising Git's scriptability.</ref>\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User's Manual |date=2007-08-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of ''packs'' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a ''packfile''. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, without depending on this for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects, and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically, but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside, and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\n\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision-control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source-code tree.\n\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision-control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, Git searches for a file that existed only in revision ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\n\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* ''resolve'': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\n* ''recursive'': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Torvalds explains:<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates... |date=2005-04-10}}</ref>\n{{quote|In many ways you can just see git as a filesystem{{snd}} it's [[Content-addressable storage|content-addressable]], and it has a notion of versioning, but I really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a ''filesystem'' person (hey, kernels is what I do), and I actually have absolutely ''zero'' interest in creating a traditional SCM system.}}\n\nFrom this initial design approach, Git has developed the full set of features expected of a traditional SCM,<ref name=\"bare_url\" /> with features mostly being created as needed, then refined and extended over time.\n\n[[File:Git operations.svg|thumb|Some data flows and storage levels in the Git revision control system]]\n\nGit has two [[data structure]]s: a mutable ''index'' (also called ''stage'' or ''cache'') that caches information about the working directory and the next revision to be committed; and an immutable, append-only ''object database''.\n\nThe index serves as a connection point between the object database and the working tree.\n\nThe object database contains four types of objects:\n* A ''blob'' ([[binary large object]]) is the content of a [[computer file|file]]. Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob's name internally is a hash of its content.)\n* A ''tree'' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory's contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to precisely pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\n* A ''commit'' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a timestamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\n* A ''tag'' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\n\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash and uses this value for the object's name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\n\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into ''packs'', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\n\n===References===\nEvery object in the Git database that is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\n* ''heads'': refers to an object locally,\n* ''remotes'': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository,\n* ''stash'': refers to an object not yet committed,\n* ''meta'': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced retrospectively, gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]],<ref name=\"Gerrit Code Review\">{{cite web | title=Project Configuration File Format | website=Gerrit Code Review | url=https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-project-config.html | access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>\n* ''tags'': see above.\n\n==Implementations==\n[[File:GNOME gitg.png|thumb|[[GNOME Core Applications|gitg]] is a graphical front-end using [[GTK+]]]]\n\nGit is primarily developed on [[Linux]], although it also supports most major operating systems, including [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[macOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/downloads |accessdate=14 May 2012 |title=downloads |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021315/http://git-scm.com/downloads |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first Windows [[porting|port]] of Git was primarily a Linux-emulation framework that hosts the Linux version.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named ''.git'' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git does not allow the all-lowercase version of ''.git'' to be created manually) with malicious files in the ''.git/hooks'' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user ''pulls'' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in ''.git/hooks'' may be run, which results in the attacker's commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the ''.git/config'' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/ |title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390 |date= 20 December 2014 |accessdate= 22 December 2014 |last= Pettersen |first= Tim |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/ |archivedate= 24 December 2014 |df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

These influences led to the following implementation choices:{{citation needed | reason=the content is highly questionable and hence proper citation is required | date = February 2017}}\n; Strong support for non-linear development: Git supports rapid branching and merging, and includes specific tools for visualizing and navigating a non-linear development history. In Git, a core assumption is that a change will be merged more often than it is written, as it is passed around to various reviewers. In Git, branches are very lightweight: a branch is only a reference to one commit. With its parental commits, the full branch structure can be constructed.\n; Distributed development: Like [[Darcs]], [[BitKeeper]], [[Mercurial]], [[Bazaar (software)|Bazaar]], and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]], Git gives each developer a local copy of the full development history, and changes are copied from one such repository to another. These changes are imported as added development branches and can be merged in the same way as a locally developed branch.\n; Compatibility with existent systems and protocols: Repositories can be published via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), or a Git protocol over either a plain socket, or [[Secure Shell]] (ssh). Git also has a CVS server emulation, which enables the use of existent CVS clients and IDE plugins to access Git repositories. [[Apache Subversion|Subversion]] repositories can be used directly with git-svn.\n; Efficient handling of large projects: Torvalds has described Git as being very fast and scalable,<ref>{{cite mailing list |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116128307511686 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |date=2006-10-19 |mailinglist=git}}</ref> and performance tests done by Mozilla<ref>Jst's Blog on Mozillazine {{cite web|title=bzr/hg/git performance |url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |accessdate=12 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529094107/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/jst/archives/2006/11/vcs_performance.html |archivedate=29 May 2010}}</ref> showed that it was an [[order of magnitude]] faster than some version-control systems; fetching version history from a locally stored repository can be one hundred times faster than fetching it from the remote server.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreier |first=Roland |url=http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |title=Oh what a relief it is |date=2006-11-13 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116175841/http://digitalvampire.org/blog/index.php/2006/11/16/oh-what-a-relief-it-is/ |archivedate=16 January 2009 |df=dmy-all}}, observing that \"git log\" is 100x faster than \"svn log\" because the latter must contact a remote server.</ref>\n; Cryptographic authentication of history: The Git history is stored in such a way that the ID of a particular version (a ''commit'' in Git terms) depends upon the complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is published, it is not possible to change the old versions without it being noticed. The structure is similar to a [[Merkle tree]], but with added data at the nodes and leaves.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |publisher=Git User's Manual |work=Git Concepts |title=Trust |date=2006-10-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#trust |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> ([[Mercurial]] and [[Monotone (software)|Monotone]] also have this property.)\n; Toolkit-based design: Git was designed as a set of programs written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and several shell scripts that provide wrappers around those programs.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=116118369005954 |title=Re: VCS comparison table |accessdate=2009-04-10}}, describing Git's script-oriented design</ref> Although most of those scripts have since been rewritten in C for speed and portability, the design remains, and it is easy to chain the components together.<ref>{{cite web |author=iabervon |url=https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |title=Git rocks! |date=2005-12-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914100946/https://lwn.net/Articles/165202/ |archivedate=14 September 2016 |df=dmy-all}}, praising Git's scriptability.</ref>\n; Pluggable merge strategies: As part of its toolkit design, Git has a well-defined model of an incomplete merge, and it has multiple algorithms for completing it, culminating in telling the user that it is unable to complete the merge automatically and that manual editing is needed.\n; [[Garbage (computer science)|Garbage]] accumulates until collected: Aborting operations or backing out changes will leave useless dangling objects in the database. These are generally a small fraction of the continuously growing history of wanted objects. Git will automatically perform [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] when enough loose objects have been created in the repository. Garbage collection can be called explicitly using <code>git gc --prune</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |title=Git User's Manual |date=2007-08-05 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222053056/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/user-manual.html#ensuring-reliability |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n; Periodic explicit object packing: Git stores each newly created object as a separate file. Although individually compressed, this takes a great deal of space and is inefficient. This is solved by the use of ''packs'' that store a large number of objects [[Delta encoding|delta-compressed]] among themselves in one file (or network byte stream) called a ''packfile''. Packs are compressed using the [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] that files with the same name are probably similar, without depending on this for correctness. A corresponding index file is created for each packfile, telling the offset of each object in the packfile. Newly created objects (with newly added history) are still stored as single objects, and periodic repacking is needed to maintain space efficiency. The process of packing the repository can be very computationally costly. By allowing objects to exist in the repository in a loose but quickly generated format, Git allows the costly pack operation to be deferred until later, when time matters less, e.g., the end of a work day. Git does periodic repacking automatically, but manual repacking is also possible with the <tt>git gc</tt> command. For data integrity, both the packfile and its index have an [[SHA-1]] checksum inside, and the file name of the packfile also contains an SHA-1 checksum. To check the integrity of a repository, run the <tt>git fsck</tt> command.\n\nAnother property of Git is that it snapshots directory trees of files. The earliest systems for tracking versions of source code, [[Source Code Control System]] (SCCS) and [[Revision Control System]] (RCS), worked on individual files and emphasized the space savings to be gained from [[interleaved deltas]] (SCCS) or [[delta encoding]] (RCS) the (mostly similar) versions. Later revision-control systems maintained this notion of a file having an identity across multiple revisions of a project. However, Torvalds rejected this concept.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates.. |date=2005-04-10}}</ref> Consequently, Git does not explicitly record file revision relationships at any level below the source-code tree.\n\nThese implicit revision relationships have some significant consequences:\n* It is slightly more costly to examine the change history of one file than the whole project.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Haible |first=Bruno |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=117119479505638 |title=how to speed up \"git log\"? |date=2007-02-11}}</ref> To obtain a history of changes affecting a given file, Git must walk the global history and then determine whether each change modified that file. This method of examining history does, however, let Git produce with equal efficiency a single history showing the changes to an arbitrary set of files. For example, a subdirectory of the source tree plus an associated global header file is a very common case.\n* Renames are handled implicitly rather than explicitly. A common complaint with [[Concurrent Versions System|CVS]] is that it uses the name of a file to identify its revision history, so moving or renaming a file is not possible without either interrupting its history or renaming the history and thereby making the history inaccurate. Most post-CVS revision-control systems solve this by giving a file a unique long-lived name (analogous to an [[inode]] number) that survives renaming. Git does not record such an identifier, and this is claimed as an advantage.<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114123702826251 |title=Re: impure renames / history tracking |date=2006-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114316047119262 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-24}}</ref> [[Source code]] files are sometimes split or merged, or simply renamed,<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=git |last=Hamano |first=Junio C. |url=https://marc.info/?l=git&m=114315795227271 |title=Re: Errors GITtifying GCC and Binutils |date=2006-03-23}}</ref> and recording this as a simple rename would freeze an inaccurate description of what happened in the (immutable) history.

However, when there is no like-named file in revision ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, Git searches for a file that existed only in revision ''N''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and is very similar to the new file.) However, it does require more [[central processing unit|CPU]]-intensive work every time the history is reviewed, and several options to adjust the heuristics are available. This mechanism does not always work; sometimes a file that is renamed with changes in the same commit is read as a deletion of the old file and the creation of a new file. Developers can work around this limitation by committing the rename and the changes separately.\n\nGit implements several merging strategies; a non-default strategy can be selected at merge time:<ref>{{cite web |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |title=git-merge(1) |date=2007-07-18 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716100147/https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html |archivedate=16 July 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n* ''resolve'': the traditional [[three-way merge]] algorithm.\n* ''recursive'': This is the default when pulling or merging one branch, and is a variant of the three-way merge algorithm. {{quote|When there are more than one common ancestors that can be used for three-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as the reference tree for the three-way merge.

Torvalds explains:<ref>{{cite mailing list |mailinglist=linux-kernel |last=Torvalds |first=Linus |url=https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=111314792424707 |title=Re: more git updates... |date=2005-04-10}}</ref>\n{{quote|In many ways you can just see git as a filesystem{{snd}} it's [[Content-addressable storage|content-addressable]], and it has a notion of versioning, but I really designed it coming at the problem from the viewpoint of a ''filesystem'' person (hey, kernels is what I do), and I actually have absolutely ''zero'' interest in creating a traditional SCM system.}}\n\nFrom this initial design approach, Git has developed the full set of features expected of a traditional SCM,<ref name=\"bare_url\" /> with features mostly being created as needed, then refined and extended over time.\n\n[[File:Git operations.svg|thumb|Some data flows and storage levels in the Git revision control system]]\n\nGit has two [[data structure]]s: a mutable ''index'' (also called ''stage'' or ''cache'') that caches information about the working directory and the next revision to be committed; and an immutable, append-only ''object database''.\n\nThe index serves as a connection point between the object database and the working tree.\n\nThe object database contains four types of objects:\n* A ''blob'' ([[binary large object]]) is the content of a [[computer file|file]]. Blobs have no proper file name, time stamps, or other metadata. (A blob's name internally is a hash of its content.)\n* A ''tree'' object is the equivalent of a directory. It contains a list of file names, each with some type bits and a reference to a blob or tree object that is that file, symbolic link, or directory's contents. These objects are a snapshot of the source tree. (In whole, this comprises a [[Merkle tree]], meaning that only a single hash for the root tree is sufficient and actually used in commits to precisely pinpoint to the exact state of whole tree structures of any number of sub-directories and files.)\n* A ''commit'' object links tree objects together into a history. It contains the name of a tree object (of the top-level source directory), a timestamp, a log message, and the names of zero or more parent commit objects.\n* A ''tag'' object is a container that contains a reference to another object and can hold added meta-data related to another object. Most commonly, it is used to store a [[digital signature]] of a commit object corresponding to a particular release of the data being tracked by Git.\n\nEach object is identified by a SHA-1 [[Cryptographic hash function|hash]] of its contents. Git computes the hash and uses this value for the object's name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the file name for that object.\n\nGit stores each revision of a file as a unique blob. The relationships between the blobs can be found through examining the tree and commit objects. Newly added objects are stored in their entirety using [[zlib]] compression. This can consume a large amount of disk space quickly, so objects can be combined into ''packs'', which use [[Delta encoding|delta compression]] to save space, storing blobs as their changes relative to other blobs.\n\n===References===\nEvery object in the Git database that is not referred to may be cleaned up by using a garbage collection command or automatically. An object may be referenced by another object or an explicit reference. Git knows different types of references. The commands to create, move, and delete references vary. \"git show-ref\" lists all references. Some types are:\n* ''heads'': refers to an object locally,\n* ''remotes'': refers to an object which exists in a remote repository,\n* ''stash'': refers to an object not yet committed,\n* ''meta'': e.g. a configuration in a bare repository, user rights; the refs/meta/config namespace was introduced retrospectively, gets used by [[Gerrit (software)|Gerrit]],<ref name=\"Gerrit Code Review\">{{cite web | title=Project Configuration File Format | website=Gerrit Code Review | url=https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-project-config.html | access-date=2 February 2020}}</ref>\n* ''tags'': see above.\n\n==Implementations==\n[[File:GNOME gitg.png|thumb|[[GNOME Core Applications|gitg]] is a graphical front-end using [[GTK+]]]]\n\nGit is primarily developed on [[Linux]], although it also supports most major operating systems, including [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[macOS]], and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://git-scm.com/downloads |accessdate=14 May 2012 |title=downloads |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120508021315/http://git-scm.com/downloads |archivedate=8 May 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe first Windows [[porting|port]] of Git was primarily a Linux-emulation framework that hosts the Linux version.

An attacker could perform [[arbitrary code execution]] on a target computer with Git installed by creating a malicious Git tree (directory) named ''.git'' (a directory in Git repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git does not allow the all-lowercase version of ''.git'' to be created manually) with malicious files in the ''.git/hooks'' subdirectory (a folder with executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac user ''pulls'' (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac filesystems) and the malicious executable files in ''.git/hooks'' may be run, which results in the attacker's commands being executed. An attacker could also modify the ''.git/config'' configuration file, which allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/ |title= Securing your Git server against CVE-2014-9390 |date= 20 December 2014 |accessdate= 22 December 2014 |last= Pettersen |first= Tim |url-status= live |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141224012942/https://developer.atlassian.com/blog/2014/12/securing-your-git-server/ |archivedate= 24 December 2014 |df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite newsgroup |title=[Announce] Git v2.2.1 (and updates to older maintenance tracks) |author= Hamano, J.

During [[World War II]] the Dutch sent a detachment of 13 soldiers to the town of Saumlaki in the Tanimbar Islands in July 1942. Japanese ships entered the bay at Saumlaki on 30 July and small boats were used to get to the jetty. The Japanese filed in ranks on the jetty and wanted to march in close order into Saumlaki. The [[garrison]] opened fire at close range with their two light [[machine gun]]s. The Japanese retreated to their boats leaving several dead on the jetty. Subsequent enemy landings, however, were made elsewhere while the Japanese ships opened fire on the defenders\u2019 position. Six of the Dutch soldiers were killed and the survivors were driven into the bush. On 31 July, a vessel carrying an [[Australian Army]] contingent arrived at the jetty at Saumlaki, unaware that the town had fallen to the Japanese. The vessel was fired on from the shore, and the commander of the landing party was killed.  The Australians retreated to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Afterwards, the members of the Dutch garrison came under naval gunfire from the Japanese; this inflicted some casualties, and was followed by attacks by Japanese unfantry on a wider front.

The Tanimbar Islands were sighted and possibly visited by Portuguese navigators such as Martim Afonso de Melo Jusarte around 1522\u20131525, who traveled around the archipelagos of Aru (with the reference \"Here wintered Martin Afonso de Melo\") and Tanimbar, and possibly [[Gomes de Sequeira]] in 1526.<ref>Continent of Curiosities: A Journey Through Australian Natural History - Danielle Clode, Cambridge University Press, Page 26[https://books.google.pt/books?id=kRZv2Se4ONMC&pg=PA26&lpg=PA26&dq=Continent+of+Curiosities:+A+Journey+Through+Australian+Natural+History+-+Danielle+Clode+Gomes+de+Sequeira&source=bl&ots=BZkwkzDVB5&sig=RCTay5tBmW1S5yjJGhF-cXiXGZw&hl=pt-PT&sa=X&ei=RXjsVK-tH4L6UsnzgfAC&ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Continent%20of%20Curiosities%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Australian%20Natural%20History%20-%20Danielle%20Clode%20Gomes%20de%20Sequeira&f=false]</ref>\n\nThe Tanimbar Islands were part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. During [[World War II]] the Dutch sent a detachment of 13 soldiers to the town of Saumlaki in the Tanimbar Islands in July 1942. Japanese ships entered the bay at Saumlaki on 30 July and small boats were used to get to the jetty. The Japanese filed in ranks on the jetty and wanted to march in close order into Saumlaki. The [[garrison]] opened fire at close range with their two light [[machine gun]]s. The Japanese retreated to their boats leaving several dead on the jetty. Subsequent enemy landings, however, were made elsewhere while the Japanese ships opened fire on the defenders\u2019 position. Six of the Dutch soldiers were killed and the survivors were driven into the bush. On 31 July, a vessel carrying an [[Australian Army]] contingent arrived at the jetty at Saumlaki, unaware that the town had fallen to the Japanese. The vessel was fired on from the shore, and the commander of the landing party was killed.  The Australians retreated to [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Afterwards, the members of the Dutch garrison came under naval gunfire from the Japanese; this inflicted some casualties, and was followed by attacks by Japanese unfantry on a wider front. Seven surviving members of tbe garrison then boarded a sailing ship and escaped to Australia.<ref>{{cite web|first=Klemen |last=L |url= http://www.dutcheastindies.webs.com/banda_sea.html |title=The Banda Sea Operations 1941-1942 |date=1999\u20132000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nImportant products are [[copra]], tortoiseshell, and ''trepang'' (an edible [[sea cucumber (food)|sea cucumber]]).
