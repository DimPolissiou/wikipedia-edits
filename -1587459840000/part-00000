She imagines that characters Beast and Hamilton Hocks are her friends.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n{{:List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Maggie (voiced by Kristen Bone) is a five-year-old girl (who later turns six years old)  and the human protagonist of the show. She is Hamilton's and Beast's best friend. They both look up to Maggie very much and always turn to her for advice. Maggie is the leader of the group and is always there to be the compassionate voice of reason to her dear friends.\n* The Ferocious Beast (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) he is very scary or ferocious. However, he can shout louder than anybody. He is a yellow beast, with big red removable spots, and three horns on his head. His favorite catchphrase is \"Great googly moogly!\", which he says several times per episode. In \"Hide And Go Beast\", it is shown that he is allergic to pollen. He is just a big softie, despite his bold appearance. Beast loves pumpkins, which is convenient since there is an impressive pumpkin patch in Nowhere Land. As a matter of fact, Beast loves pretty much any kind of food, including Hamilton's cooking, and is almost always hungry. He even loves baths. Maggie and Hamilton are his best friends. He wears multi-colored galoshes which he pronounces as \"Goo-lashes\". Hamilton always corrects him about the pronunciation, but he does not believe him.\n* Hamilton Hocks (voiced by Michael Caruana) is a pig who can be bossy and quite fussy, but he has a warm heart. He lives inside a portable cardboard box which he loves, is the best cook in Nowhere Land, and is a total clean freak. Hamilton's most prized possessions are his beautiful \"H\" sweater and his cardboard box, which also happens to be his home. Maggie and the Beast are his best friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Rudy the Mouse: Rudy is a cheese-loving mouse who lives in a large wheel of cheese in a part of Nowhere Land called Cheese Town. It is revealed in one episode that Rudy's hat and boots do not come off because they are glued to him. Strangely enough, this character started off with the name Pippy but was renamed by the writers soon after.\n* Nedley the Rabbit: Nedley speaks in rhymes. He says rhymes almost all through every episode that he appears in, but sometimes he talks normally a little bit before starting his rhyme again. Nedley lives in a rabbit hole next to his carrot patch in Nowhere Land.\n* The Moo Sisters: They are the three cows who live in a part of Nowhere Land called Mooville. They love to sing and do it often. They are sisters and their names are Millicent, Mavis and Marge.\n* Mr. Moon: He is the only non-human and non-animal character in the episode \"Blue Moon\". He is usually grumpy because people say he is made of green cheese.\n* The Kindly Giant: The Kindly Giant is not at all scary but instead kind hearted. The others are scared at first but they soon get used to him and they sometimes go to him for advice or a favour. He refers to Maggie, Hamilton and the Beast as little ones. He owns a garden full of fruits and vegetables, from which he always lets the ever hungry Beast scarf up a giant blueberry or two. His face is never shown, and he only appears in a few episodes. He is big and strong. Even the Beast seems small compared to the giant. The Kindly Giant lives in an area of Nowhere Land where all the fruits and vegetables are giant sized. Usually, only his shoes and ankles are seen due to his largeness.\n* The Dream Sheep: White sheep that make \"baa\" sounds. They are occasionally up in the clouds.\n* The Jellybean Team: They are a group of seven jellybeans. There is a red one, an orange one, a yellow one, a purple one, a black one and two green ones. They are small, of course, but have big personalities. They also tend to argue with each other a lot because they each think they are more important than the others.\n* The Triplets: Maggie's baby cousins (Zack, Max, and Oscar). They only appear in four episodes, \"One, Two, Three\", \"Home of the Kindly Giant\", \"The New Rubber Ball\" and \"Which Way Did They Go?\".\n* Big Duck: A large duck with white feathers who lives in the water. She is the focus of the episode \"The Big Duck\" and appears in the series' theme song.\n* Reggie Van Beast: Beast's cousin. His coloring is the inverse of Beast's, being red with yellow spots, and he wears a monocle. He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\".\n\n==Production==\nThe theme song for the show is \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\" which is an original song by [[Isabella Molley]]. ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' is produced by [[Nelvana]], and directed by [[Jamie Whitney]] and [[Stuart Shankly]]. The series debuted in 2001 and the series aired its last episode in 2003. The show is distributed by Nelvana. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original Canadian soundtrack. The shorts were shown with the original voices.\n\n==Broadcast==\nIn Canada, ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' aired on [[Teletoon]] and [[Treehouse TV]]. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] as part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block from June 5, 2000, to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]) from April 7, 2003, until September 27, 2009, when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010.

The first full-length episode premiered on August 26, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Nelvana's+%22Maggie+and+the+Ferocious+Beast%22+soars+to+a+ferocious+No.+1...-a063944653 |title=Nelvana's \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast\" soars to a ferocious No. 1 on Nick Jr. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=August 21, 2013}}</ref>   \n\nThe series began airing on [[Qubo]] on May 28, 2018.\n\n==Plot==\nA young girl named Maggie creates her own map of an imaginary world known as \"Nowhere Land\" that, in reality, takes the characters nowhere. She imagines that characters Beast and Hamilton Hocks are her friends.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n{{:List of Maggie and the Ferocious Beast episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Maggie (voiced by Kristen Bone) is a five-year-old girl (who later turns six years old)  and the human protagonist of the show. She is Hamilton's and Beast's best friend. They both look up to Maggie very much and always turn to her for advice. Maggie is the leader of the group and is always there to be the compassionate voice of reason to her dear friends.\n* The Ferocious Beast (voiced by [[Stephen Ouimette]]) he is very scary or ferocious. However, he can shout louder than anybody. He is a yellow beast, with big red removable spots, and three horns on his head. His favorite catchphrase is \"Great googly moogly!\", which he says several times per episode. In \"Hide And Go Beast\", it is shown that he is allergic to pollen. He is just a big softie, despite his bold appearance. Beast loves pumpkins, which is convenient since there is an impressive pumpkin patch in Nowhere Land. As a matter of fact, Beast loves pretty much any kind of food, including Hamilton's cooking, and is almost always hungry. He even loves baths. Maggie and Hamilton are his best friends. He wears multi-colored galoshes which he pronounces as \"Goo-lashes\". Hamilton always corrects him about the pronunciation, but he does not believe him.\n* Hamilton Hocks (voiced by Michael Caruana) is a pig who can be bossy and quite fussy, but he has a warm heart. He lives inside a portable cardboard box which he loves, is the best cook in Nowhere Land, and is a total clean freak. Hamilton's most prized possessions are his beautiful \"H\" sweater and his cardboard box, which also happens to be his home. Maggie and the Beast are his best friends.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Rudy the Mouse: Rudy is a cheese-loving mouse who lives in a large wheel of cheese in a part of Nowhere Land called Cheese Town. It is revealed in one episode that Rudy's hat and boots do not come off because they are glued to him. Strangely enough, this character started off with the name Pippy but was renamed by the writers soon after.\n* Nedley the Rabbit: Nedley speaks in rhymes. He says rhymes almost all through every episode that he appears in, but sometimes he talks normally a little bit before starting his rhyme again. Nedley lives in a rabbit hole next to his carrot patch in Nowhere Land.\n* The Moo Sisters: They are the three cows who live in a part of Nowhere Land called Mooville. They love to sing and do it often. They are sisters and their names are Millicent, Mavis and Marge.\n* Mr. Moon: He is the only non-human and non-animal character in the episode \"Blue Moon\". He is usually grumpy because people say he is made of green cheese.\n* The Kindly Giant: The Kindly Giant is not at all scary but instead kind hearted. The others are scared at first but they soon get used to him and they sometimes go to him for advice or a favour. He refers to Maggie, Hamilton and the Beast as little ones. He owns a garden full of fruits and vegetables, from which he always lets the ever hungry Beast scarf up a giant blueberry or two. His face is never shown, and he only appears in a few episodes. He is big and strong. Even the Beast seems small compared to the giant. The Kindly Giant lives in an area of Nowhere Land where all the fruits and vegetables are giant sized. Usually, only his shoes and ankles are seen due to his largeness.\n* The Dream Sheep: White sheep that make \"baa\" sounds. They are occasionally up in the clouds.\n* The Jellybean Team: They are a group of seven jellybeans. There is a red one, an orange one, a yellow one, a purple one, a black one and two green ones. They are small, of course, but have big personalities. They also tend to argue with each other a lot because they each think they are more important than the others.\n* The Triplets: Maggie's baby cousins (Zack, Max, and Oscar). They only appear in four episodes, \"One, Two, Three\", \"Home of the Kindly Giant\", \"The New Rubber Ball\" and \"Which Way Did They Go?\".\n* Big Duck: A large duck with white feathers who lives in the water. She is the focus of the episode \"The Big Duck\" and appears in the series' theme song.\n* Reggie Van Beast: Beast's cousin. His coloring is the inverse of Beast's, being red with yellow spots, and he wears a monocle. He is rather stuck up and rude, and never really seems to enjoy anything that Beast and his friends want to do. He also often speaks in rhymes, similar to Nedley. He first appeared in \"Guess Who's Coming to Visit\".\n\n==Production==\nThe theme song for the show is \"Maggie and the Ferocious Beast in Nowhere Land,\" which is an original song by [[Isabella Molley]]. ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' is produced by [[Nelvana]], and directed by [[Jamie Whitney]] and [[Stuart Shankly]]. The series debuted in 2000 and the series aired its last episode in 2002. The show is distributed by Nelvana. \n\nIn the United Kingdom, the show was dubbed with British voice actors, replacing the original Canadian soundtrack. The shorts were shown with the original voices.\n\n==Broadcast==\nIn Canada, ''Maggie and the Ferocious Beast'' aired on [[Teletoon]] and [[Treehouse TV]]. In the United States, it aired on [[Nickelodeon]] as part of its [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] block from June 5, 2000, to September 6, 2004, and the American children's channel [[Nick Jr.|Noggin]] (now [[Nick Jr.]]) from April 7, 2003, until September 27, 2009, when Noggin was re-branded as Nick Jr., and continued to air reruns until October 30, 2010.

She also called 911, declaring in a frantic voice that she had been kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a Hispanic man and a Caucasian woman in their 40s driving a blue van. When asked if she knew what direction her captors went after setting her free, she said, \"I have no idea. I don't even know where I am.\" The calls were traced to a pay phone at a [[7-Eleven]] convenience store in Albuquerque, where she was picked up by local police. Her family publicly thanked the media for getting through to the kidnappers. Later, during FBI interrogation, Wilbanks admitted that she had not been abducted, but needed time and space to escape the pressures of her upcoming wedding.\n*May 17 \u2013 Wilbanks canceled her engagement to her fianc\u00e9.\n*May 25 \u2013 Wilbanks was charged with [[making false statements]].<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/US/05/25/wilbanks/index.html | title='Runaway bride' charged with making false statement | date= May 26, 2005 | publisher=CNN.com}}</ref>\n*May 31 \u2013 Wilbanks reached an agreement with the city of Duluth to repay more than $13,000 in costs incurred by the city in their search.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=806212 | title=Wilbanks Agrees to Pay $13,000 in Costs | date= May 31, 2005 | publisher=ABC News}}</ref>\n*October 10, 2006 \u2013 Wilbanks filed a lawsuit against her ex-fianc\u00e9 for $500,000, claiming it is her share of a home the ex-fianc\u00e9 purchased with the proceeds to a book deal he negotiated for them when she was medicated, plus [[punitive damages]].<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15205164| title='Runaway Bride' sues ex for $500,000 | date= October 10, 2006 | publisher=NBC News}}</ref>\n*June 2010 \u2013 Wilbanks declares bankruptcy.<ref name=PageSix2010-06-22/>\n\n==Aftermath and lawsuit==\n\nOn May 22, 2006, [[People (magazine)|''People'']] magazine reported that Wilbanks and Mason had officially called off their engagement.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Jennifer Wilbanks sold the media rights to her story to a New York City company for $500,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=US runaway bride sells her story|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4100320.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=2005-06-16|accessdate=2007-01-12}}</ref> Wilbanks did not offer to repay the whole cost of the search for her, which totaled almost $43,000.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn September 2006, Wilbanks filed a lawsuit against her ex-fianc\u00e9, claiming that while she was hospitalized and under medication, she granted Mason [[power of attorney]] to negotiate the sale of the couple's story to a publisher in New York. According to her, Mason negotiated a deal for $500,000 and then used the money to buy a house, in his name only, from which he later evicted Wilbanks. She claimed $250,000 as her share of the house, and another $250,000 in [[punitive damages]]. Mason countersued, claiming emotional distress from being left at the altar.

However, although there is no longer any paradoxical aspect to the discrepancy between genome size and gene number, the term remains in common usage. For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested by one author to more accurately comprise a puzzle or an enigma (the so-called \"[[C-value enigma]]\").\n\nGenome size correlates with a range of measurable characteristics at the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and organism levels, including cell size, [[cell division]] rate, and, depending on the [[taxon]], body size, [[metabolic rate]], developmental rate, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] complexity, geographical distribution, or [[extinction]] risk.<ref name=\"Bennett2005\"/><ref name=\"Gregory2005\"/> Based on currently available completely sequenced genome data (as of April 2009), log-transformed gene number forms a linear correlation with log-transformed genome size in bacteria, archaea, viruses, and organelles combined, whereas a nonlinear (semi-natural logarithm) correlation is seen for eukaryotes.<ref name=\"Hou2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hou Y, Lin S|year=2009 |title=Distinct Gene Number- Genome Size Relationships for Eukaryotes and Non-Eukaryotes: Gene Content Estimation for Dinoflagellate Genomes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |page=e6978 | issue=9 |pmid=19750009 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006978 |pmc=2737104 |editor1-last=Redfield |editor1-first=Rosemary Jeanne| editor1link=Rosemary Redfield|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.6978H }}</ref> Although the latter contrasts with the previous view that no correlation exists for the eukaryotes, the observed nonlinear correlation for eukaryotes may reflect disproportionately fast-increasing [[non-coding DNA]] in increasingly large eukaryotic genomes. Although sequenced genome data are practically biased toward small genomes, which may compromise the accuracy of the empirically derived correlation, and ultimate proof of the correlation remains to be obtained by sequencing some of the largest eukaryotic genomes, current data do not seem to rule out a possible correlation.\n\n==Genome reduction==\n[[File:Genome_size_vs_protein_count.svg|thumb|Genome size compared to number of genes. [[Log-log plot]] of the total number of annotated proteins in genomes submitted to [[GenBank]] as a function of genome size. Based on data from [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] genome reports.]]\n'''Genome reduction''', also known as '''[[bacterial genome size|genome degradation]]''', is the process by which an organism's genome shrinks relative to that of its ancestors. Genomes fluctuate in size regularly, and [[bacterial genome size|genome size reduction]] is most significant in [[bacteria]].\n\nThe most evolutionarily significant cases of genome reduction may be observed in the eukaryotic [[organelle]]s known to be derived from bacteria: [[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s. These organelles are descended from primordial [[endosymbiont]]s, which were capable of surviving within the host cell and which the host cell likewise needed for survival. Many present-day mitochondria have less than 20 genes in their entire genome, whereas a modern free-living bacterium generally has at least 1,000 genes. Many genes have apparently been transferred to the host [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], while others have simply been lost and their function replaced by host processes.\n\nOther bacteria have become endosymbionts or obligate intracellular [[pathogen]]s and experienced extensive genome reduction as a result. This process seems to be dominated by [[genetic drift]] resulting from small [[population genetics|population]] size, low [[genetic recombination|recombination]] rates, and high [[mutation]] rates, as opposed to [[natural selection|selection]] for smaller genomes.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some free-living marine bacterioplanktons also shows signs of genome reduction, which are hypothesized to be driven by natural selection.<ref name=\"Dufresne2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dufresne A, Garczarek L, Partensky F|year=2005 |title=Accelerated evolution associated with genome reduction in a free-living prokaryote |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-2-r14|pmid=15693943|journal=Genome Biol |volume=6 |page=R14 |issue=2 |pmc=551534}}</ref><ref name=\"Giovannoni2005\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1114057 |author=Giovannoni SJ |year=2005 |title=Genome streamlining in a cosmopolitan oceanic bacterium |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5738 |pages=1242\u20131245 |pmid=16109880 |last2=Tripp |first2=HJ |last3=Givan |first3=S |last4=Podar |first4=M |last5=Vergin |first5=KL |last6=Baptista |first6=D |last7=Bibbs |first7=L |last8=Eads |first8=J |last9=Richardson |first9=TH|displayauthors=1 |bibcode=2005Sci...309.1242G }}</ref><ref name=\"Giovannoni2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01598.x |author=Giovannoni SJ |year=2008 |title=The small genome of an abundant coastal ocean methylotroph |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1771\u20131782 |pmid=18393994 |last2=Hayakawa |first2=Darin H. |last3=Tripp |first3=H.

These species have become a considerable threat to human health, as they are often capable of evading human immune systems and manipulating the host environment to acquire nutrients. A common explanation for these manipulative abilities is their consistently compact and efficient genomic structure. These small genomes are the result of massive losses of extraneous DNA, an occurrence that is exclusively associated with the loss of a free-living stage. As much as 90% of the genetic material can be lost when a species makes the evolutionary transition from a free-living to an obligate intracellular lifestyle. During this process the future parasite subjected to an environment rich of metabolite where somehow needs to hide within the host cell, those factors reduce the retention and increase the genetic drift leading to an acceleration of the loss of non-essential genes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Moran|first=N.

However, although there is no longer any paradoxical aspect to the discrepancy between genome size and gene number, the term remains in common usage. For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested by one author to more accurately comprise a puzzle or an enigma (the so-called \"[[C-value enigma]]\").\n\nGenome size correlates with a range of measurable characteristics at the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and organism levels, including cell size, [[cell division]] rate, and, depending on the [[taxon]], body size, [[metabolic rate]], developmental rate, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] complexity, geographical distribution, or [[extinction]] risk.<ref name=\"Bennett2005\"/><ref name=\"Gregory2005\"/> Based on currently available completely sequenced genome data (as of April 2009), log-transformed gene number forms a linear correlation with log-transformed genome size in bacteria, archaea, viruses, and organelles combined, whereas a nonlinear (semi-natural logarithm) correlation is seen for eukaryotes.<ref name=\"Hou2009\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Hou Y, Lin S|year=2009 |title=Distinct Gene Number- Genome Size Relationships for Eukaryotes and Non-Eukaryotes: Gene Content Estimation for Dinoflagellate Genomes |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=4 |page=e6978 | issue=9 |pmid=19750009 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0006978 |pmc=2737104 |editor1-last=Redfield |editor1-first=Rosemary Jeanne| editor1link=Rosemary Redfield|bibcode=2009PLoSO...4.6978H }}</ref> Although the latter contrasts with the previous view that no correlation exists for the eukaryotes, the observed nonlinear correlation for eukaryotes may reflect disproportionately fast-increasing [[non-coding DNA]] in increasingly large eukaryotic genomes.

Based on data from [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]] genome reports.]]\n'''Genome reduction''', also known as '''[[bacterial genome size|genome degradation]]''', is the process by which an organism's genome shrinks relative to that of its ancestors. Genomes fluctuate in size regularly, and [[bacterial genome size|genome size reduction]] is most significant in [[bacteria]].\n\nThe most evolutionarily significant cases of genome reduction may be observed in the eukaryotic [[organelle]]s known to be derived from bacteria: [[mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s. These organelles are descended from primordial [[endosymbiont]]s, which were capable of surviving within the host cell and which the host cell likewise needed for survival. Many present-day mitochondria have less than 20 genes in their entire genome, whereas a modern free-living bacterium generally has at least 1,000 genes. Many genes have apparently been transferred to the host [[cell nucleus|nucleus]], while others have simply been lost and their function replaced by host processes.\n\nOther bacteria have become endosymbionts or obligate intracellular [[pathogen]]s and experienced extensive genome reduction as a result. This process seems to be dominated by [[genetic drift]] resulting from small [[population genetics|population]] size, low [[genetic recombination|recombination]] rates, and high [[mutation]] rates, as opposed to [[natural selection|selection]] for smaller genomes.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} Some free-living marine bacterioplanktons also shows signs of genome reduction, which are hypothesized to be driven by natural selection.<ref name=\"Dufresne2005\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dufresne A, Garczarek L, Partensky F|year=2005 |title=Accelerated evolution associated with genome reduction in a free-living prokaryote |doi=10.1186/gb-2005-6-2-r14|pmid=15693943|journal=Genome Biol |volume=6 |page=R14 |issue=2 |pmc=551534}}</ref><ref name=\"Giovannoni2005\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1114057 |author=Giovannoni SJ |year=2005 |title=Genome streamlining in a cosmopolitan oceanic bacterium |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5738 |pages=1242\u20131245 |pmid=16109880 |last2=Tripp |first2=HJ |last3=Givan |first3=S |last4=Podar |first4=M |last5=Vergin |first5=KL |last6=Baptista |first6=D |last7=Bibbs |first7=L |last8=Eads |first8=J |last9=Richardson |first9=TH|displayauthors=1 |bibcode=2005Sci...309.1242G }}</ref><ref name=\"Giovannoni2008\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2008.01598.x |author=Giovannoni SJ |year=2008 |title=The small genome of an abundant coastal ocean methylotroph |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=10 |issue=7 |pages=1771\u20131782 |pmid=18393994 |last2=Hayakawa |first2=Darin H. |last3=Tripp |first3=H.

These species have become a considerable threat to human health, as they are often capable of evading human immune systems and manipulating the host environment to acquire nutrients. A common explanation for these manipulative abilities is their consistently compact and efficient genomic structure. These small genomes are the result of massive losses of extraneous DNA, an occurrence that is exclusively associated with the loss of a free-living stage. As much as 90% of the genetic material can be lost when a species makes the evolutionary transition from a free-living to an obligate intracellular lifestyle. During this process the future parasite subjected to an environment rich of metabolite where somehow needs to hide within the host cell, those factors reduce the retention and increase the genetic drift leading to an acceleration of the loss of non-essential genes.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Moran|first=N.

The game features a single player (the \"1\") competing against 100 other contestants (known as \"the Mob\") in a trivia match. The 1 earns prize money depending on how many Mob members he or she has eliminated from the game, but loses all winnings with an incorrect answer at any point. The host of the original NBC version was [[Bob Saget]], while [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] hosted the GSN revival.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played with the main contestant acting as the \"1\" answering questions against 100 other people collectively known as the \"Mob\", for the top prize of $1,000,000 ($50,000 or $100,000 in the GSN revival). The contestant's goal must be the last player standing, and by eliminating all 100 members of the Mob by correctly answering general-knowledge questions in succession.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nTo begin the game, a multiple-choice question is revealed with three options, with one being the correct answer. Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game, bringing the \"1\" closer to winning the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question (season 1), or at a level per every 10 mobs eliminated (season 2). If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, his or her winnings was augmented to the top prize . \n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter. If the \"1\" continues and misses the question, the game ends and the contestant won nothing, while any surviving Mob members who answered the last question correctly evenly split the \"1\"'s winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game.

The game features a single player (the \"1\") competing against 100 other contestants (known as \"the Mob\") in a trivia match. The 1 earns prize money depending on how many Mob members he or she has eliminated from the game, but loses all winnings with an incorrect answer at any point. The host of the original NBC version was [[Bob Saget]], while [[Carrie Ann Inaba]] hosted the GSN revival.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game is played with the main contestant acting as the \"1\" answering questions against 100 other people collectively known as the \"Mob\", for the top prize of $1,000,000 ($50,000 or $100,000 in the GSN revival). The contestant's goal must be the last player standing, and by eliminating all 100 members of the Mob by correctly answering general-knowledge questions in succession.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\nTo begin the game, a multiple-choice question is revealed with three options, with one being the correct answer. Once all of the Mob members have locked in their answers, the contestant is given the opportunity to answer the question. If the contestant is correct, all Mob members who answered incorrectly are eliminated from the game, bringing the \"1\" closer to winning the game. The amount of money in the contestant's bank also increases by an amount dependent on the number of mob members eliminated in that question (season 1), or at a level per every 10 mobs eliminated (season 2). If the contestant eliminates all 100 mob members, his or her winnings was augmented to the top prize . \n\nAfter every correct answer, the contestant is given the choice to either walk away with the money he or she has earned or continue playing. In conjunction with the various changes made in the sixth episode, the contestant could now only walk away after correctly answering the third question, the fifth question, and every question thereafter. If the \"1\" continues and misses the question, the game ends and the contestant won nothing, while any surviving Mob members who answered the last question correctly evenly split the \"1\"'s winnings accumulated up to that point in the game.<ref name=\"Stanley\"/>\n\n===Helps===\nTo assist the main contestant, assistance from the mob is offered in the form of \"helps\". Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\">{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|season=1|number=1|network=NBC|date=October 13, 2006}}</ref> Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and contestants could choose any of the three at any point in the game.

The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the contestant chooses one of the revealed mob members to discuss his or her response.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Ask The Mob\": Originally known as the second help, two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the contestant, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/>\n*\"Trust The Mob\" (added in episode six): The contestant is automatically committed to the answer chosen most frequently by the Mob.<ref name=\"Season1Ep6\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=December 1, 2006|season=1|number=6}}</ref>\n\nAfter reaching a certain point in the game, contestants can be given a \"Sneak Peek\" which allows the contestant to see their next question (but not the three answers) before deciding whether or not to answer the next question. In season one, it was used when a player eliminated 90 or more members of the mob;<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/> it eventually became available once a contestant used all his or her helps in season two.<ref>{{cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=January 25, 2008|season=2|number=4}}</ref>\n\n===Payout structure===\nOriginally, contestants were awarded a cumulative amount of money after each individual question for each Mob member eliminated; this amount increased with each question as the game went on. For example, a contestant who eliminated eight Mob members on his or her second question would be awarded $500 per member, adding up to $4,000 to add to his or her total.<ref name=\"NBC1Premiere\"/> The payout structure was tweaked slightly prior to the third episode of the season<ref name=\"Season1Ep3\">{{Cite episode|series=1 vs. 100|network=NBC|date=October 27, 2006|season=1|number=3}}</ref> and changed once again on the sixth episode in conjunction with introduction of the \"Trust the Mob\" help.<ref name=\"NBC Rules\"/><ref name=\"Season1Ep6\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Question\n! colspan=\"3\"| Value\n|-\n!

After the failure of the ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise]]'' sequel ''[[Aoki Uru ]]'' Gainax studio started planning a new series. For the new project Anno apparently borrowed one of ''Aoki Uru'' key themes, the concept of \"not running away\". According to Gainax co-founder [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], the passage was \"something more than just transposing one show's theme onto another\", since \"Anno inherited something from ''Aoki Uru'' \u2014 the determination not to run away from problems \u2014 and what we saw in ''Evangelion'' was maybe just a reflection of those feelings\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Takeda |first=Yasuhiro |authorlink=Yasuhiro Takeda |title=The Notenki memoirs: studio Gainax and the men who created Evangelion |year=2002 |publisher=ADV Manga |isbn=1-4139-0234-0 |p=164-165}}</ref> Anno originally proposed an [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]]-like girl as main character, following [[Gainax]] tradition of a female protagonist in ''[[Gunbuster]]'' and ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''. However character design Sadamoto proved very reluctant to a new female protagonist; while arguing that \"a robot should be piloted by a trained person, and if that person just happens to be a girl then that is fine\" he didn't understand the reason why a young girl \"would pilot a robot\". He eventually suggested that Shinji should be a boy, and his relationship with [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]] was to be similar to Nadia's own relationship with Jean, her love interest and eventual husband in the series.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-November/003855.html|title=Interview with Sadamoto Yoshiyuki|last1=Mond|first1=Der|date=September 1999|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=\"An easily recognizable silhouette is also important, but I designed the characters so that their personalities could be more or less understood at a glance.

Shinji visits a comatose Asuka in the hospital, but when his pleas for attention go unanswered, Shinji accidentally exposes Asuka's breasts and masturbates at the sight. He remains catatonic while all Nerv officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive and Asuka. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji enter it again. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon to Earth.<ref name=Note>From the [[Red Cross Book]], ''Production Note''.</ref> Shinji then has extended dream-like sequences inside Instrumentality, has access to Misato's memories of having sex with Kaji and briefly sees himself having sex with Asuka.\n\nThe fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. He eventually converses with his mother Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Shinji, having erected several grave markers in memory of most of the other characters, wakes up sometime later, and notices Asuka laying down by his side. Shinji attempts to strangle her again for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.\n\n===''Rebuild of Evangelion''===\nIn ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' Shinji returns as the central protagonist in ''[[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]]'', where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2007}}</ref> In ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]'', Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly.

Shinji is treated with hostility by Misato and others. They install a \"DSS Choker\" on him, an explosive device on his neck that is to be activated if he comes close to starting another Impact. After learning from Misato that they are part of a new organization called Wille fighting against Nerv, Shinji decides to leave with Rei. At the remnants of Nerv, he is approached by Kaworu who befriends him. He becomes despondent after Kaworu tells him that humanity holds him responsible for initiating Third Impact. He then has a meeting with Fuyutsuki. Shinji learns his mother's soul is the control mechanism of Unit 01 and that it is, in fact, a clone of Rei that now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, Kaworu convinces him to pilot Eva-13 with him. Shinji starts Fourth impact after pulling the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. Kaworu is killed by the DSS Choker he had taken from Shinji in an attempt to stop Fourth Impact. A devastated Shinji loses his will to live. Asuka rescues him from his Entry Plug, accuses him of acting like a baby and only caring about himself. The Rei clone appears and follows Asuka and Shinji as they start heading along the ruins of Tokyo-3 to get rescued by Wille again.\n\n=== Manga ===\n\nIn the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto Shinji has a very different character. Sadamoto attempted to portray him as more of a misfit, a young teenager more stubborn, rebellious, juvenile and apathetic than the insecure Shinji of Hideaki Anno. In the manga he has brown eyes instead of the blue ones he has in the anime series and ''Rebuild ''movies. He is also less introspective and introverted than his series counterpart and does not play the cello. This brings him closer to the typical ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|shounen]]'' protagonist. For instance, when his classmate [[Toji Suzuhara]]'s sister is sent to the hospital because of Shinji's actions, Shinji sardonically mocks her instead of meekly taking Toji's punches like in the series. Later, after the battle against Bardiel, in which his friend Toji dies following an order from Commander Ikari, Shinji tries to punch his father.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=85}}</ref> Shinji is overall far more aloof and distant in the manga, but also enjoys a far closer relationship with Rei,<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=90}}</ref> also being initially fairly hostile and apathetic to both Asuka who nonetheless manages to get his attention and Misato, who is frustrated by his increased indifference to his duties as a pilot and particularly Kaworu whom he deliberately avoids,<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=97}}</ref> while also having a more distant friendship with Toji and Kensuke, though Kaji has an increased role as a mentor to him.

In the ending, he is seen leading a normal life in a reformed new world, and meets Asuka by chance though they only have a faint recollection of one another.\n\nSadamoto decided to work on a ''Evangelion'' manga while watching Shinji in the first episodes of the original series. Reflecting on his dialogues he wondered \"what the world looked like through Shinji's eyes\". This led him to change his characterization and psychology. During the whole serialization Sadamoto also wanted to reflect twenty-first century teens in him and took inspiration from [[Gulf War]], wondering how a 14-year-old would have behaved boarding a helicopter.<ref name=Milano>{{cite web|url =http://www.animeclick.it/news/36125-milano-manga-festival-reportage-dei-sadamoto-days | title =Milano Manga Festival: Reportage dei Sadamoto Days| date=11 July 2013| website =Animeclick.it| accessdate =5 July 2014|language=it}}</ref> In order to realistically portray his psychology he drew inspiration from his own personal experience, thinking back to his adolescence and trying to transpose his experiences on paper.

Spin-offs and video games such as these often pair Shinji romantically with [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] or, less commonly, [[Rei Ayanami]]. In [[Petit Eva: Evangelion@School]], Shinji is portrayed as a boy \"frightened by the idea of growing up\" but extremely popular among the students of Municipal Nerv High School of Tokyo-3.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Characters|magazine=Newtype USA|volume=6|issue=6|p=67|date=June 2007}}</ref> Shinji, alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]].

After the failure of the ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honn\u00eaamise]]'' sequel ''[[Aoki Uru ]]'' Gainax studio started planning a new series. For the new project Anno apparently borrowed one of ''Aoki Uru'' key themes, the concept of \"not running away\". According to Gainax co-founder [[Yasuhiro Takeda]], the passage was \"something more than just transposing one show's theme onto another\", since \"Anno inherited something from ''Aoki Uru'' \u2014 the determination not to run away from problems \u2014 and what we saw in ''Evangelion'' was maybe just a reflection of those feelings\".<ref>{{Cite book |last=Takeda |first=Yasuhiro |authorlink=Yasuhiro Takeda |title=The Notenki memoirs: studio Gainax and the men who created Evangelion |year=2002 |publisher=ADV Manga |isbn=1-4139-0234-0 |p=164-165}}</ref> Anno originally proposed an [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]]-like girl as main character, following [[Gainax]] tradition of a female protagonist in ''[[Gunbuster]]'' and ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''. However character design Sadamoto proved very reluctant to a new female protagonist; while arguing that \"a robot should be piloted by a trained person, and if that person just happens to be a girl then that is fine\" he didn't understand the reason why a young girl \"would pilot a robot\". He eventually suggested that Shinji should be a boy, and his relationship with [[Asuka Langley Soryu|Asuka]] was to be similar to Nadia's own relationship with Jean, her love interest and eventual husband in the series.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://eva.onegeek.org/pipermail/evangelion/2006-November/003855.html|title=Interview with Sadamoto Yoshiyuki|last1=Mond|first1=Der|date=September 1999|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=\"An easily recognizable silhouette is also important, but I designed the characters so that their personalities could be more or less understood at a glance.

Since Shinji lacks the typical enthusiasm and courage of other robot anime heroes, Sadamoto was forced to give a different heroic interpretation, \"rather than a reflection of a hero, sort of a refraction of a hero\". At first he tried to create a character \"that would tap into the consciousness of today's anime fans\". In early stages Shinji was drawn with slightly different features, later changed by the staff.

Shinji visits a comatose Asuka in the hospital, but when his pleas for attention go unanswered, Shinji accidentally exposes Asuka's breasts and masturbates at the sight. He remains catatonic while all Nerv officers, including Misato, are killed. Shinji then decides to pilot the Eva to save those who are still alive and Asuka. When Shinji learns of Asuka's defeat, the Evangelion moves on its own to let Shinji enter it again. Despite this, after witnessing the mangled, mutilated corpse of Unit-02 being carried by the Mass Production Evas, Shinji's intense emotion summons the Lance of Longinus stuck on the Moon to Earth.<ref name=Note>From the [[Red Cross Book]], ''Production Note''.</ref> Shinji then has extended dream-like sequences inside Instrumentality, has access to Misato's memories of having sex with Kaji and briefly sees himself having sex with Asuka.\n\nThe fusion of the Lance of Longinus with the Eva recreates a Tree of Life. Shinji, now one with all other humans, converses with them, particularly Rei and Kaworu. He eventually converses with his mother Yui, whom he wonders what will do, until he decides that he wants to live and returns to Earth. Shinji, having erected several grave markers in memory of most of the other characters, wakes up sometime later, and notices Asuka laying down by his side. Shinji attempts to strangle her again for an un-clarified reason, but stops himself and breaks down after Asuka regains consciousness and caresses his face.\n\n===''Rebuild of Evangelion''===\nIn ''[[Rebuild of Evangelion]]'' Shinji returns as the central protagonist in ''[[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]]'', where he is shown to be more outspoken than his TV counterpart. In this film, Shinji's role is very much the same as that of the anime series. He is assigned to be the pilot of Unit-01 and works alongside Rei to defeat the Angel Ramiel.<ref>{{cite video | people = [[Hideaki Anno]], [[Kazuya Tsurumaki]], Masayuki (directors) | title = [[Evangelion: 1.0 You Are (Not) Alone]] | medium = [[Film]] | publisher = [[Studio Khara]] |date = 2007}}</ref> In ''[[Evangelion: 2.0 You Can (Not) Advance]]'', Shinji continues his duties as pilot of Unit-01, albeit reluctantly.

Shinji is treated with hostility by Misato and others. They install a \"DSS Choker\" on him, an explosive device on his neck that is to be activated if he comes close to starting another Impact. After learning from Misato that they are part of a new organization called Wille fighting against Nerv, Shinji decides to leave with Rei. At the remnants of Nerv, he is approached by Kaworu who befriends him. He becomes despondent after Kaworu tells him that humanity holds him responsible for initiating Third Impact. He then has a meeting with Fuyutsuki. Shinji learns his mother's soul is the control mechanism of Unit 01 and that it is, in fact, a clone of Rei that now pilots Mark 09, aka The Vessel of Adams. After Shinji realizes that he did not save Rei, Kaworu convinces him to pilot Eva-13 with him. Shinji starts Fourth impact after pulling the two spears of Longinus out from Lilith. Eva-13 then eats the Twelfth Angel and ascends to divinity. Kaworu is killed by the DSS Choker he had taken from Shinji in an attempt to stop Fourth Impact. A devastated Shinji loses his will to live. Asuka rescues him from his Entry Plug, accuses him of acting like a baby and only caring about himself. The Rei clone appears and follows Asuka and Shinji as they start heading along the ruins of Tokyo-3 to get rescued by Wille again.\n\n=== Manga ===\n\nIn the ''Neon Genesis Evangelion'' manga adaptation by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto Shinji has a very different character. Sadamoto attempted to portray him as more of a misfit, a young teenager more stubborn, rebellious, juvenile and apathetic than the insecure Shinji of Hideaki Anno. In the manga he has brown eyes instead of the blue ones he has in the anime series and ''Rebuild ''movies. He is also less introspective and introverted than his series counterpart and does not play the cello. This brings him closer to the typical ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|shounen]]'' protagonist. For instance, when his classmate [[Toji Suzuhara]]'s sister is sent to the hospital because of Shinji's actions, Shinji sardonically mocks her instead of meekly taking Toji's punches like in the series. Later, after the battle against Bardiel, in which his friend Toji dies following an order from Commander Ikari, Shinji tries to punch his father.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=85}}</ref> Shinji is overall far more aloof and distant in the manga, but also enjoys a far closer relationship with Rei,<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=90}}</ref> also being initially fairly hostile and apathetic to both Asuka who nonetheless manages to get his attention and Misato, who is frustrated by his increased indifference to his duties as a pilot and particularly Kaworu whom he deliberately avoids,<ref>{{cite book|author=Yoshiyuki Sadamoto|title=\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u30a8\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30b2\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3 \u516c\u5f0f\u30ac\u30a4\u30c9\u30d6\u30c3\u30af|publisher=Kadokawa Shoten|date=March 31, 2011|language=ja|isbn=978-4-04-715671-5|p=97}}</ref> while also having a more distant friendship with Toji and Kensuke, though Kaji has an increased role as a mentor to him.

In the ending, he is seen leading a normal life in a reformed new world, and meets Asuka by chance though they only have a faint recollection of one another.\n\nSadamoto decided to work on a ''Evangelion'' manga while watching Shinji in the first episodes of the original series. Reflecting on his dialogues he wondered \"what the world looked like through Shinji's eyes\". This led him to change his characterization and psychology. During the whole serialization Sadamoto also wanted to reflect twenty-first century teens in him and took inspiration from [[Gulf War]], wondering how a 14-year-old would have behaved boarding a helicopter.<ref name=Milano>{{cite web|url =http://www.animeclick.it/news/36125-milano-manga-festival-reportage-dei-sadamoto-days | title =Milano Manga Festival: Reportage dei Sadamoto Days| date=11 July 2013| website =Animeclick.it| accessdate =5 July 2014|language=it}}</ref> In order to realistically portray his psychology he drew inspiration from his own personal experience, thinking back to his adolescence and trying to transpose his experiences on paper.

Spin-offs and video games such as these often pair Shinji romantically with [[Asuka Langley Soryu]] or, less commonly, [[Rei Ayanami]]. In [[Petit Eva: Evangelion@School]], Shinji is portrayed as a boy \"frightened by the idea of growing up\" but extremely popular among the students of Municipal Nerv High School of Tokyo-3.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Characters|magazine=Newtype USA|volume=6|issue=6|p=67|date=June 2007}}</ref> Shinji, alongside other ''Evangelion'' characters, makes frequent appearances in video games, such as ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion (video game)|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 64]].
