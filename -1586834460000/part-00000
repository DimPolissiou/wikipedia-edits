He rose to prominence as the head coach of the [[New York Giants]], which he led to two [[Super Bowl]] titles. Parcells later served as the head coach of the [[New England Patriots]], [[New York Jets]], and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Throughout his career, he coached teams that were in a period of decline and turned them into postseason contenders. He is the only coach in NFL history to lead four teams to the playoffs and three teams to a conference championship game.\n\nWhen Parcells became the head coach of the Giants in 1983, he took over a franchise that had qualified for the postseason only once (1981) in the past decade and had only one winning record in their last 10 seasons. Parcells brought new success to the team and within four years, guided them to their first [[Super Bowl XXI|Super Bowl win]]. His tenure with the Giants spanned eight seasons and concluded with a second championship victory in [[Super Bowl XXV]]. After the Super Bowl win, Parcells retired as a coach in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Parcells came out of retirement to become the head coach of the Patriots, another struggling franchise at the time. Once again, Parcells changed the fortunes for the team and led them to an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] during his fourth season as their coach, although the game ended in defeat for the Patriots. Amid conflicts with Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]], he left the franchise after their Super Bowl loss and became the head coach of the Jets for the next season. Under Parcells, the Jets went from having only one victory in the previous season to obtaining a winning record, and they reached the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#AFC: Denver Broncos 23, New York Jets 10|1998 AFC Championship Game]] in his second year with the team.\n\nAfter three seasons as the Jets' head coach, Parcells retired for a second time in 1999, but came back to football in 2003 to become the head coach of the Cowboys. He coached the Cowboys for four seasons and helped them qualify for the playoffs twice, although the team was eliminated in the first round each time. Following the team's loss in a [[2006\u201307 NFL playoffs#NFC: Seattle Seahawks 21.2C Dallas Cowboys 20|2006 NFC Wild Card game]], Parcells retired from coaching for good in 2007.\n\nSince his final retirement from coaching,  Parcells currently serves as an NFL analyst for [[ESPN]] and since 2014, has been an unofficial consultant for the [[Cleveland Browns]]. He was also the Vice President of Football Operations with the [[Miami Dolphins]], a position he held from 2008 to 2010. In 2013, Parcells was voted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Parcells, Carter finally make Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/02/nfl-hall-of-fame-announcement/1886453/|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 2, 2013|first1=Jim|last1=Corbett|date=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis life story, \"Parcells: A Football Life\" was co-authored by Bill Parcells and writer Nunyo Demasio, a former ''Washington Post'' reporter.

In his first year, he made a controversial decision to bench [[Phil Simms]] in favor of [[Scott Brunner]]. The result was a disastrous 3\u201312\u20131 season during which the Giants surreptitiously offered Parcells' job to [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] head coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] after a week 14 loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]]; however, Schnellenberger declined, and Parcells remained as head coach.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6D91638F931A25751C1A965948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fF%2fFootball | work=The New York Times | title=Young Is Angry | date=December 12, 1983 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter this dismal first season, Parcells made Simms the starter again. The team's record improved to 9\u20137 and 10\u20136 over the next two years, and earned them their first back-to-back playoff appearances since 1961\u20131963. In 1986, he led the Giants to the first of two [[Super Bowl]]s. In the [[1986 New York Giants season|1986 season]], the Giants compiled a franchise best 14\u20132 record and the first of three division titles. Parcells, whose stifling 3\u20134 defense (known as the Big Blue Wrecking Crew) led by [[Lawrence Taylor]], [[Carl Banks]], [[Harry Carson]], and [[Leonard Marshall]], and an offense under the direction of Phil Simms, knocked off the [[1986 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 49\u20133, and the [[1986 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 17\u20130, in the playoffs before routing the [[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], 39\u201320, in [[Super Bowl XXI]]. Parcells is credited as the first coach to be doused with Gatorade at the end of a Super Bowl, which led to a Super Bowl tradition.

The Giants began the [[1990 NFL season|1990 season]] 10\u20130, [[1990 New York Giants season|and finished 13\u20133]], but lost Simms to injury late in the season. Playing with a back-up quarterback in [[Jeff Hostetler]] and a 33-year-old veteran running back in [[Ottis Anderson]], the Giants convincingly defeated the [[1990 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the divisional playoff, 31\u20133, and won in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion over [[1990 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], 15\u201313, in the [[NFC Championship]] on a last-second 42-yard field goal by [[Matt Bahr]] which was set up by a [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] fumble caused by nose tackle [[Erik Howard]]. [[Super Bowl XXV]] proved equally exciting as the Giants used tough defense, and a ball-control and power-running [[New england patriots strategy#Erhardt-Perkins offensive system|Erhardt \u2013 Perkins style offense]] to stop the [[1990 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]], 20\u201319, whose own last-second 47-yard field goal attempt by [[Scott Norwood]] missed wide right. Parcells retired from football after Super Bowl XXV due to health problems.\n\nDuring his coaching tenure, the Giants had secured three division titles (1986, 1989, 1990), had only two losing seasons (the Giants went 6\u20139 during the [[1987 NFL Season|strike year]] of 1987) and tallied an 8\u20133 playoff record.   Parcells, along with former Giants head coach [[Tom Coughlin]], have both made the [[NFL playoffs]] five times as Giants head coach, and the two [[Super Bowl Champions|Super Bowl titles]] they each have won with the Giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise, respectively.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/myers-coughlin-join-parcells-hof-day-article-1.1416849 | title=As Bill Parcells enters Football Hall, Tom Coughlin's resume displays Fame appeal | location=New York | work=Daily News | date=August 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===First retirement===\nFollowing retirement, Parcells spent time as a football analyst for NBC Sports from 1991\u20131992, working as a commentator. He also hosted a local sports show in New York with [[Mike Francesa]] entitled ''Around the NFL''.\n\nIn 1992, Parcells made a handshake agreement to become head coach of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. At the last minute, Parcells opted not to take the job. Parcells did not feel the situation was right for him at that time. Tampa Bay owner [[Hugh Culverhouse]] said, \"I feel like I've been jilted at the altar.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/01/19/parcells_career_ap/ | title = With Parcells, it's the same old song, different verse | agency=Associated Press |work=Sports Illustrated | date = January 19, 2002 | accessdate = January 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===New England Patriots (1993\u22121996)===\nAfter a two-year [[Unemployment|hiatus]], Parcells returned to the NFL in 1993 as the head coach for the [[New England Patriots]]. Within two years, he coached the team to a 10\u20136 record and its first [[NFL playoffs|playoff game]] in eight years. In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], he guided the Patriots to their first division title in 11 years, and only the second and third home playoff games in franchise history. The Patriots went all the way to [[Super Bowl XXXI]], but lost to the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], 35\u201321, in New Orleans.\n\nParcells left the Patriots after disagreements with owner [[Robert Kraft]]. He had effectively been the team's [[general manager]] since arriving in New England, but felt Kraft would not allow him enough input in player personnel decisions. Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: \"They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries. Okay?\" This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots' war room during the [[1996 NFL Draft|1996 Draft]]. Parcells wanted to draft DE [[Tony Brackens]] with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft. They ultimately selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] WR [[Terry Glenn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-12-30/sports/0712290246_1_parcells|title=Give Parcells picks, he will Find gold|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===New York Jets (1997\u22121999)===\nAlthough Parcells had decided to leave New England, his contract did not allow him to coach anywhere else. The New York Jets sought Parcells as head coach and general manager after a 4\u201328 record under [[Rich Kotite]]. To circumvent Parcells' contractual obligations, the Jets hired [[Bill Belichick]] (then the No.&nbsp;1 assistant to Parcells) as the Jets coach, and then hired Parcells in an \"advisory\" role. New England threatened legal action against Parcells and the Jets, but [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] brokered a deal between the two sides, with New England releasing Parcells from his contract and the Jets giving New England a third and fourth round pick that year, a second-round pick the next year and a first-round draft choice the year after that. Jets owner [[Leon Hess]] gave Parcells complete control over football operations, the main sticking point in his dispute with Kraft.\n\n====1997\u201398====\nParcells again orchestrated a remarkable turnaround in his first year with the Jets. In his [[1997 NFL season|first season]] with the Jets, the team barely missed the playoffs with a record of 9\u20137 (the Jets were 1-15 the year before Parcells arrived, and had won a total of 10 games in the previous three seasons combined). In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the Jets went to the playoffs with a current franchise-best 12\u20134 record, which was good enough for second place in the conference<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1998/ \u2013 1998 NFL Standings, Team & Offensive Statistics|Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/standings.html?lg=NFL&yr=1998|title=1998 NFL Standings - The Football Database|publisher=}}</ref> and earned the Jets their third home playoff game since moving to New Jersey in 1984 (their first home playoff game was against the New England Patriots following the 1985 season), but lost to the eventual Super Bowl-champion [[1998 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Championship Game.\n\n====1999====\nIn [[1999 NFL season|1999]], expectations were high for the Jets to go to the Super Bowl. However, quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] ruptured his Achilles tendon in the Jets home opener and the season went downhill from there. After starting the season 1\u20136, the Jets won three straight and faced the Indianapolis Colts. Parcells emphasized the importance of not obtaining a \"7th loss\" but they did lose to the Colts and then to the New York Giants the following week. At 4\u20138, the Jets were in danger of finishing below .500. The Jets would finish 8\u20138, but out of the playoffs. In 1999, Parcells retired from football for the second time, vowing that he would not coach again. He remained with the Jets one more year as general manager.  To date, he is the only Jets coach to leave the team with a winning record after coaching at least two seasons.\n\n===Dallas Cowboys (2003\u22122006)===\nFollowing three straight 5\u201311 seasons, [[Dallas Cowboys]]' owner [[Jerry Jones]] lured Parcells out of retirement and made him the head coach in 2003.\n\n====Earn the Star====\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =  \u201cYou knew real quick in my rookie year with Coach Parcells that nothing was going to be given to you, and you had to respect that tradition of what the Cowboys are all about.

Since then, all drafted and UFA (undrafted free agent) rookies that report to the Cowboys must officially make the roster before having the star logo permanently placed on their helmet.<ref>https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2018/05/09/young-cowboys-players-will-earn-blue-stars-rookie-camp-week</ref> \n\nThe practice of \"earning the star\" has become a permanent fixture of Cowboy tradition, with all of Parcells' successors adopting the practice. <ref>http://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/6824104/dallas-cowboys-rookies-earn-their-helmet-stars</ref> As social media emerged, #EarnTheStar and #EarningTheStar became popular [[Twitter]] [[hashtags]] for Cowboy fans and players.<ref>https://twitter.com/dallascowboys/status/1009512473752489986?lang=en</ref>\n\n====2003====\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, he led them to the playoffs with a 10\u20136 record (losing to the eventual NFC Champion [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] in the opening round), making him the first head coach in NFL history to guide four teams to the playoffs.\n\n====2004====\nThe 2004 season was one of turmoil. Starting quarterback [[Quincy Carter]] was terminated for alleged drug use in favor of 40-year-old veteran [[Vinny Testaverde]], who had been brought to the Cowboys from the New York Jets by his former coach in the off-season. While a favorite of Coach Parcells, Testaverde proved ineffective as a starter. The Cowboys started strong, with victories against the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Washington Redskins]], but injuries, older personnel, spotty play calling, and persistent penalties hobbled the Cowboys, and they quickly fell off to a 3\u20135 record by midseason, finishing the season 6\u201310.\n\n====2005====\nThe Cowboys improved their defense before the 2005 season with the additions of first round draft picks [[DeMarcus Ware]] and [[Marcus Spears (defensive end)|Marcus Spears]]. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional [[Glossary of American football|4\u20133 defense]] to a [[3\u20134 defense]], which Parcells had run in all of his previous stops. Jerry Jones also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle [[Jason Ferguson]] and cornerback [[Anthony Henry (American football)|Anthony Henry]] via free agency, and linebacker [[Scott Fujita]] via the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back [[Julius Jones (American football player)|Julius Jones]], and acquired quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for him in the past, including Bledsoe, [[Terry Glenn]] (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback [[Aaron Glenn]], wide receiver [[Keyshawn Johnson]], and fullback [[Richie Anderson]] with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9\u20137, missing the playoffs by one game.\n\n====2006====\nIn 2006 the Cowboys signed controversial former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[wide receiver]] [[Terrell Owens]]. [[Keyshawn Johnson]] was released and signed with the [[Carolina Panthers]]. Owens, whom Parcells never referred to by name, but rather as \"The Player\", was fairly successful with the team. In week 7 of the 2006 season, Parcells decided to replace veteran quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] with fourth year quarterback [[Tony Romo]]. The Cowboys were 6\u20134 with Romo as the starter. They finished the season with a 9\u20137 overall record but failed to win the [[NFC East]] Division after a 23\u20137 loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on Christmas Day in week 16 followed by a loss to the last-place team in the [[NFC North]], the [[Detroit Lions]] in week 17. They were able to clinch a playoff berth as the 5th seed in the NFC, eventually losing 21\u201320 against the Seahawks in Seattle on January 6, on a botched hold by [[Tony Romo]] during a field goal attempt.\n\nParcells would finish his Dallas stint with a 34\u201330 record and no playoff wins. Parcells' greatest accomplishment as Cowboys coach was the development of QB Tony Romo. He signed Romo in 2003 and developed him into a Pro Bowl quarterback by 2006.\n\n===Third retirement===\nParcells would have entered the final year of his contract with the Cowboys in 2007, and had been facing questions all year as to whether he would return to the Cowboys to coach his final season. With his 0\u20132 playoff record over four years as coach of Dallas, many had begun to wonder if the game had simply \"passed him by.\" Immediately following the Cowboys' loss to the [[Seattle Seahawks]], Parcells said that he was unsure if he would return in 2007, and the rumors about Parcells' future escalated.\n\nOn January 9, the ''[[Newark Star Ledger]]'' reported through anonymous sources that Parcells had contacted the [[New York Giants]] about their available general manager position, but the Giants were not interested in Parcells' services.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/giants/ledger/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/116832097233500.xml&coll=1 | title = Giants: Say no thanks to Parcells | publisher = Newark Star-Ledger | date = January 9, 2007 | accessdate = January 9, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070111010324/http://www.nj.com/giants/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F116832097233500.xml&coll=1 | archivedate = January 11, 2007 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>  Parcells, the next day, quickly refuted any interest in the Giants GM position, stating, \"There is absolutely nothing to it.

It was rumored that ESPN offered him a position on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', but Parcells declined the opportunity. (It is also worth noting that ESPN still held a contract with Parcells as a broadcaster even as he coached the Cowboys.)\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\nOn December 19, 2007, the [[Miami Herald]] reported that Parcells had agreed to become the new Executive Vice President of Football Operations of the [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/350561.html|title=Parcells accepts top job with Dolphins \u2013 December 19, 2007 \u2013 MiamiHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> ESPN reported the following day that he signed a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3162909|title=Parcells inks 4-year deal as Dolphins VP|date=December 20, 2007|publisher=}}</ref> Just a day prior, reports linking Parcells to the [[Atlanta Falcons]]' position of vice president of football operations were leaked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3160597|title=Parcells says he'll likely accept Falcons' VP offer|date=December 19, 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\nHowever, the following day the Falcons formally announced that Parcells had turned down the offer because of discussions with Miami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=108282|title=11Alive.com - Atlanta, GA - Parcells Leaves Falcons At Altar<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the first season as Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Parcells fired head coach [[Cam Cameron]], GM [[Randy Mueller]], along with a few assistant coaches, after a 1\u201315 finish in the [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|2007 season]]. With vacancies at the GM and head coaching spots, he brought in [[Jeff Ireland]] to be the general manager and signed [[Tony Sparano]] as head coach.\n\nThe new front office under Parcells then signed over 20 little-known players in the free-agent market.\n\nIn the 2008 draft, they drafted offensive tackle [[Jake Long]] with the No.&nbsp;1 overall pick, along with [[Phillip Merling]], [[Kendall Langford]], [[Chad Henne]], [[Lex Hilliard]], and [[Donald Thomas (American football)|Donald Thomas]].

There was an old commercial from StarKist with Charlie the StarKist tuna. So my players were trying to con me on something one time, and I said, 'You must think I'm Charlie the Tuna.'\"</ref> is a former American [[American football|football]] coach who was a [[head coach]] in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for 19 seasons. He rose to prominence as the head coach of the [[New York Giants]], which he led to two [[Super Bowl]] titles. Parcells later served as the head coach of the [[New England Patriots]], [[New York Jets]], and [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Throughout his career, he coached teams that were in a period of decline and turned them into postseason contenders. He is the only coach in NFL history to lead four teams to the playoffs and three teams to a conference championship game.\n\nWhen Parcells became the head coach of the Giants in 1983, he took over a franchise that had qualified for the postseason only once (1981) in the past decade and had only one winning record in their last 10 seasons. Parcells brought new success to the team and within four years, guided them to their first [[Super Bowl XXI|Super Bowl win]]. His tenure with the Giants spanned eight seasons and concluded with a second championship victory in [[Super Bowl XXV]]. After the Super Bowl win, Parcells retired as a coach in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Parcells came out of retirement to become the head coach of the Patriots, another struggling franchise at the time. Once again, Parcells changed the fortunes for the team and led them to an appearance in [[Super Bowl XXXI]] during his fourth season as their coach, although the game ended in defeat for the Patriots. Amid conflicts with Patriots owner [[Robert Kraft]], he left the franchise after their Super Bowl loss and became the head coach of the Jets for the next season. Under Parcells, the Jets went from having only one victory in the previous season to obtaining a winning record, and they reached the [[1998\u201399 NFL playoffs#AFC: Denver Broncos 23, New York Jets 10|1998 AFC Championship Game]] in his second year with the team.\n\nAfter three seasons as the Jets' head coach, Parcells retired for a second time in 1999, but came back to football in 2003 to become the head coach of the Cowboys. He coached the Cowboys for four seasons and helped them qualify for the playoffs twice, although the team was eliminated in the first round each time. Following the team's loss in a [[2006\u201307 NFL playoffs#NFC: Seattle Seahawks 21.2C Dallas Cowboys 20|2006 NFC Wild Card game]], Parcells retired from coaching for good in 2007.\n\nSince his final retirement from coaching,  Parcells currently serves as an NFL analyst for [[ESPN]] and since 2014, has been an unofficial consultant for the [[Cleveland Browns]]. He was also the Vice President of Football Operations with the [[Miami Dolphins]], a position he held from 2008 to 2010. In 2013, Parcells was voted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Parcells, Carter finally make Pro Football Hall of Fame|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2013/02/02/nfl-hall-of-fame-announcement/1886453/|work=USA Today|accessdate=February 2, 2013|first1=Jim|last1=Corbett|date=February 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nHis life story, \"Parcells: A Football Life\" was co-authored by Bill Parcells and writer Nunyo Demasio, a former ''Washington Post'' reporter.

In his first year, he made a controversial decision to bench [[Phil Simms]] in favor of [[Scott Brunner]]. The result was a disastrous 3\u201312\u20131 season during which the Giants surreptitiously offered Parcells' job to [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] head coach [[Howard Schnellenberger]] after a week 14 loss to the [[Arizona Cardinals|St. Louis Cardinals]]; however, Schnellenberger declined, and Parcells remained as head coach.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E6D91638F931A25751C1A965948260&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fF%2fFootball | work=The New York Times | title=Young Is Angry | date=December 12, 1983 | accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter this dismal first season, Parcells made Simms the starter again. The team's record improved to 9\u20137 and 10\u20136 over the next two years, and earned them their first back-to-back playoff appearances since 1961\u20131963. In 1986, he led the Giants to the first of two [[Super Bowl]]s. In the [[1986 New York Giants season|1986 season]], the Giants compiled a franchise best 14\u20132 record and the first of three division titles. Parcells, whose stifling 3\u20134 defense (known as the Big Blue Wrecking Crew) led by [[Lawrence Taylor]], [[Carl Banks]], [[Harry Carson]], and [[Leonard Marshall]], and an offense under the direction of Phil Simms, knocked off the [[1986 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] 49\u20133, and the [[1986 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] 17\u20130, in the playoffs before routing the [[1986 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]], 39\u201320, in [[Super Bowl XXI]]. Parcells is credited as the first coach to be doused with Gatorade at the end of a Super Bowl, which led to a Super Bowl tradition.

The Giants began the [[1990 NFL season|1990 season]] 10\u20130, [[1990 New York Giants season|and finished 13\u20133]], but lost Simms to injury late in the season. Playing with a back-up quarterback in [[Jeff Hostetler]] and a 33-year-old veteran running back in [[Ottis Anderson]], the Giants convincingly defeated the [[1990 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] in the divisional playoff, 31\u20133, and won in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion over [[1990 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]], 15\u201313, in the [[NFC Championship]] on a last-second 42-yard field goal by [[Matt Bahr]] which was set up by a [[Roger Craig (American football)|Roger Craig]] fumble caused by nose tackle [[Erik Howard]]. [[Super Bowl XXV]] proved equally exciting as the Giants used tough defense, and a ball-control and power-running [[New england patriots strategy#Erhardt-Perkins offensive system|Erhardt \u2013 Perkins style offense]] to stop the [[1990 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]], 20\u201319, whose own last-second 47-yard field goal attempt by [[Scott Norwood]] missed wide right. Parcells retired from football after Super Bowl XXV due to health problems.\n\nDuring his coaching tenure, the Giants had secured three division titles (1986, 1989, 1990), had only two losing seasons (the Giants went 6\u20139 during the [[1987 NFL Season|strike year]] of 1987) and tallied an 8\u20133 playoff record.   Parcells, along with former Giants head coach [[Tom Coughlin]], have both made the [[NFL playoffs]] five times as Giants head coach, and the two [[Super Bowl Champions|Super Bowl titles]] they each have won with the Giants have occurred in their fourth and eighth seasons with the franchise, respectively.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/myers-coughlin-join-parcells-hof-day-article-1.1416849 | title=As Bill Parcells enters Football Hall, Tom Coughlin's resume displays Fame appeal | location=New York | work=Daily News | date=August 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n===First retirement===\nFollowing retirement, Parcells spent time as a football analyst for NBC Sports from 1991\u20131992, working as a commentator. He also hosted a local sports show in New York with [[Mike Francesa]] entitled ''Around the NFL''.\n\nIn 1992, Parcells made a handshake agreement to become head coach of the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]. At the last minute, Parcells opted not to take the job. Parcells did not feel the situation was right for him at that time. Tampa Bay owner [[Hugh Culverhouse]] said, \"I feel like I've been jilted at the altar.\"<ref>{{cite news | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2002/01/19/parcells_career_ap/ | title = With Parcells, it's the same old song, different verse | agency=Associated Press |work=Sports Illustrated | date = January 19, 2002 | accessdate = January 2, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===New England Patriots (1993\u22121996)===\nAfter a two-year [[Unemployment|hiatus]], Parcells returned to the NFL in 1993 as the head coach for the [[New England Patriots]]. Within two years, he coached the team to a 10\u20136 record and its first [[NFL playoffs|playoff game]] in eight years. In [[1996 NFL season|1996]], he guided the Patriots to their first division title in 11 years, and only the second and third home playoff games in franchise history. The Patriots went all the way to [[Super Bowl XXXI]], but lost to the [[1996 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]], 35\u201321, in New Orleans.\n\nParcells left the Patriots after disagreements with owner [[Robert Kraft]]. He had effectively been the team's [[general manager]] since arriving in New England, but felt Kraft would not allow him enough input in player personnel decisions. Upon his departure, Parcells famously stated: \"They want you to cook the dinner; at least they ought to let you shop for some of the groceries. Okay?\" This was mainly in reference to an incident in the Patriots' war room during the [[1996 NFL Draft|1996 Draft]]. Parcells wanted to draft DE [[Tony Brackens]] with their first-round choice, but was vetoed by Kraft. They ultimately selected [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] WR [[Terry Glenn]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2007-12-30/sports/0712290246_1_parcells|title=Give Parcells picks, he will Find gold|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===New York Jets (1997\u22121999)===\nAlthough Parcells had decided to leave New England, his contract did not allow him to coach anywhere else. The New York Jets sought Parcells as head coach and general manager after a 4\u201328 record under [[Rich Kotite]]. To circumvent Parcells' contractual obligations, the Jets hired [[Bill Belichick]] (then the No.&nbsp;1 assistant to Parcells) as the Jets coach, and then hired Parcells in an \"advisory\" role. New England threatened legal action against Parcells and the Jets, but [[NFL Commissioner]] [[Paul Tagliabue]] brokered a deal between the two sides, with New England releasing Parcells from his contract and the Jets giving New England a third and fourth round pick that year, a second-round pick the next year and a first-round draft choice the year after that. Jets owner [[Leon Hess]] gave Parcells complete control over football operations, the main sticking point in his dispute with Kraft.\n\n====1997\u201398====\nParcells again orchestrated a remarkable turnaround in his first year with the Jets. In his [[1997 NFL season|first season]] with the Jets, the team barely missed the playoffs with a record of 9\u20137 (the Jets were 1-15 the year before Parcells arrived, and had won a total of 10 games in the previous three seasons combined). In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], the Jets went to the playoffs with a current franchise-best 12\u20134 record, which was good enough for second place in the conference<ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/1998/ \u2013 1998 NFL Standings, Team & Offensive Statistics|Pro-Football-Reference.com</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballdb.com/standings.html?lg=NFL&yr=1998|title=1998 NFL Standings - The Football Database|publisher=}}</ref> and earned the Jets their third home playoff game since moving to New Jersey in 1984 (their first home playoff game was against the New England Patriots following the 1985 season), but lost to the eventual Super Bowl-champion [[1998 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] Championship Game.\n\n====1999====\nIn [[1999 NFL season|1999]], expectations were high for the Jets to go to the Super Bowl. However, quarterback [[Vinny Testaverde]] ruptured his Achilles tendon in the Jets home opener and the season went downhill from there. After starting the season 1\u20136, the Jets won three straight and faced the Indianapolis Colts. Parcells emphasized the importance of not obtaining a \"7th loss\" but they did lose to the Colts and then to the New York Giants the following week. At 4\u20138, the Jets were in danger of finishing below .500. The Jets would finish 8\u20138, but out of the playoffs. In 1999, Parcells retired from football for the second time, vowing that he would not coach again. He remained with the Jets one more year as general manager.  To date, he is the only Jets coach to leave the team with a winning record after coaching at least two seasons.\n\n===Dallas Cowboys (2003\u22122006)===\nFollowing three straight 5\u201311 seasons, [[Dallas Cowboys]]' owner [[Jerry Jones]] lured Parcells out of retirement and made him the head coach in 2003.\n\n====Earn the Star====\n{{Quote box\n |quote  =  \u201cYou knew real quick in my rookie year with Coach Parcells that nothing was going to be given to you, and you had to respect that tradition of what the Cowboys are all about.

Since then, all drafted and UFA (undrafted free agent) rookies that report to the Cowboys must officially make the roster before having the iconic star permanently placed on their helmet.<ref>https://sportsday.dallasnews.com/dallas-cowboys/cowboys/2018/05/09/young-cowboys-players-will-earn-blue-stars-rookie-camp-week</ref> \n\nThe practice of \"earning the star\" has become a permanent fixture of Cowboy tradition, with all of Parcells' successors adopting the practice. <ref>http://www.espn.com/dallas/nfl/story/_/id/6824104/dallas-cowboys-rookies-earn-their-helmet-stars</ref> As social media emerged, #EarnTheStar and #EarningTheStar have become popular [[Twitter]] [[hashtags]] for Cowboy fans and players.<ref>https://twitter.com/dallascowboys/status/1009512473752489986?lang=en</ref>\n\n====2003====\nIn his first season with the Cowboys, he led them to the playoffs with a 10\u20136 record (losing to the eventual NFC Champion [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]] in the opening round), making him the first head coach in NFL history to guide four teams to the playoffs.\n\n====2004====\nThe 2004 season was one of turmoil. Starting quarterback [[Quincy Carter]] was terminated for alleged drug use in favor of 40-year-old veteran [[Vinny Testaverde]], who had been brought to the Cowboys from the New York Jets by his former coach in the off-season. While a favorite of Coach Parcells, Testaverde proved ineffective as a starter. The Cowboys started strong, with victories against the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Washington Redskins]], but injuries, older personnel, spotty play calling, and persistent penalties hobbled the Cowboys, and they quickly fell off to a 3\u20135 record by midseason, finishing the season 6\u201310.\n\n====2005====\nThe Cowboys improved their defense before the 2005 season with the additions of first round draft picks [[DeMarcus Ware]] and [[Marcus Spears (defensive end)|Marcus Spears]]. Parcells drafted these players in hopes of jumpstarting the team's transition from the traditional [[Glossary of American football|4\u20133 defense]] to a [[3\u20134 defense]], which Parcells had run in all of his previous stops. Jerry Jones also added a number of high-priced older veteran players, acquiring nose tackle [[Jason Ferguson]] and cornerback [[Anthony Henry (American football)|Anthony Henry]] via free agency, and linebacker [[Scott Fujita]] via the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. On offense, the Cowboys felt the need to upgrade their passing game to complement their top 2004 draft pick, running back [[Julius Jones (American football player)|Julius Jones]], and acquired quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] via free agency. During his tenure, Parcells made a point of signing players who had played for him in the past, including Bledsoe, [[Terry Glenn]] (with the Patriots), Testaverde, cornerback [[Aaron Glenn]], wide receiver [[Keyshawn Johnson]], and fullback [[Richie Anderson]] with the Jets. In 2005, the Cowboys went 9\u20137, missing the playoffs by one game.\n\n====2006====\nIn 2006 the Cowboys signed controversial former [[Philadelphia Eagles]] [[wide receiver]] [[Terrell Owens]]. [[Keyshawn Johnson]] was released and signed with the [[Carolina Panthers]]. Owens, whom Parcells never referred to by name, but rather as \"The Player\", was fairly successful with the team. In week 7 of the 2006 season, Parcells decided to replace veteran quarterback [[Drew Bledsoe]] with fourth year quarterback [[Tony Romo]]. The Cowboys were 6\u20134 with Romo as the starter. They finished the season with a 9\u20137 overall record but failed to win the [[NFC East]] Division after a 23\u20137 loss to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on Christmas Day in week 16 followed by a loss to the last-place team in the [[NFC North]], the [[Detroit Lions]] in week 17. They were able to clinch a playoff berth as the 5th seed in the NFC, eventually losing 21\u201320 against the Seahawks in Seattle on January 6, on a botched hold by [[Tony Romo]] during a field goal attempt.\n\nParcells would finish his Dallas stint with a 34\u201330 record and no playoff wins. Parcells' greatest accomplishment as Cowboys coach was the development of QB Tony Romo. He signed Romo in 2003 and developed him into a Pro Bowl quarterback by 2006.\n\n===Third retirement===\nParcells would have entered the final year of his contract with the Cowboys in 2007, and had been facing questions all year as to whether he would return to the Cowboys to coach his final season. With his 0\u20132 playoff record over four years as coach of Dallas, many had begun to wonder if the game had simply \"passed him by.\" Immediately following the Cowboys' loss to the [[Seattle Seahawks]], Parcells said that he was unsure if he would return in 2007, and the rumors about Parcells' future escalated.\n\nOn January 9, the ''[[Newark Star Ledger]]'' reported through anonymous sources that Parcells had contacted the [[New York Giants]] about their available general manager position, but the Giants were not interested in Parcells' services.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nj.com/giants/ledger/index.ssf?/base/sports-0/116832097233500.xml&coll=1 | title = Giants: Say no thanks to Parcells | publisher = Newark Star-Ledger | date = January 9, 2007 | accessdate = January 9, 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070111010324/http://www.nj.com/giants/ledger/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports-0%2F116832097233500.xml&coll=1 | archivedate = January 11, 2007 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>  Parcells, the next day, quickly refuted any interest in the Giants GM position, stating, \"There is absolutely nothing to it.

It was rumored that ESPN offered him a position on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', but Parcells declined the opportunity. (It is also worth noting that ESPN still held a contract with Parcells as a broadcaster even as he coached the Cowboys.)\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\nOn December 19, 2007, the [[Miami Herald]] reported that Parcells had agreed to become the new Executive Vice President of Football Operations of the [[Miami Dolphins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/350561.html|title=Parcells accepts top job with Dolphins \u2013 December 19, 2007 \u2013 MiamiHerald.com<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}</ref> ESPN reported the following day that he signed a four-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3162909|title=Parcells inks 4-year deal as Dolphins VP|date=December 20, 2007|publisher=}}</ref> Just a day prior, reports linking Parcells to the [[Atlanta Falcons]]' position of vice president of football operations were leaked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3160597|title=Parcells says he'll likely accept Falcons' VP offer|date=December 19, 2007|publisher=}}</ref>\nHowever, the following day the Falcons formally announced that Parcells had turned down the offer because of discussions with Miami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/article_news.aspx?storyid=108282|title=11Alive.com - Atlanta, GA - Parcells Leaves Falcons At Altar<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nIn the first season as Executive Vice President of Football Operations, Parcells fired head coach [[Cam Cameron]], GM [[Randy Mueller]], along with a few assistant coaches, after a 1\u201315 finish in the [[2007 Miami Dolphins season|2007 season]]. With vacancies at the GM and head coaching spots, he brought in [[Jeff Ireland]] to be the general manager and signed [[Tony Sparano]] as head coach.\n\nThe new front office under Parcells then signed over 20 little-known players in the free-agent market.\n\nIn the 2008 draft, they drafted offensive tackle [[Jake Long]] with the No.&nbsp;1 overall pick, along with [[Phillip Merling]], [[Kendall Langford]], [[Chad Henne]], [[Lex Hilliard]], and [[Donald Thomas (American football)|Donald Thomas]].
