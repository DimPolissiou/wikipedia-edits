A [[manga]] adaptation by Takahiro Seguchi launched ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Ace]]'' in October 2018, and an [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Satelight]] aired from January to March 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nEarth has come under attack by the Zai, a mysterious \"armed group\" using unusually highly advanced weapon systems far superior to any Terran military technology. A young Chinese-Japanese teenager named Kei Narutani and his Chinese friend Minghua, both living in Shanghai, are force-evacuated to Japan when the city is attacked by the Zai. During their escape by sea, several Zai fighters begin sinking the evacuation fleet when Kei suddenly witnesses the Zai being repelled by a strange airplane. When the plane subsequently crashes, Kei rushes to aid the pilot, but is surprised to find a pretty girl at the controls.\n\nAfter arriving in Japan, Kei begins investigating the origins of the strange plane, and before long he is captured by Japanese secret service agents. He learns from them that it was a Swedish fighter retrofitted with special technology developed by the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|JASDF]]. In order to combat the Zai, their technology - HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology) and EPCM (Electronic Perceptory Countermeasures) - was reverse-engineered and applied to existing fighter models, which are codenamed \"Daughters\"; but in order to function properly, this tech requires an autonomous interface unit called \"Anima\", android shaped human-like girls who are made from salvaged Zai parts. The girl Kei encountered, by the name of Gripen (after the plane she flies), is such an \"Anima\" unit who formed an emotional attachment to him when he came to her aid. When her supervising developer notices that effect, he invites Kei into the Anima project and act as Gripen's partner in order to boost her flight performance and prevent her from being scrapped.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Kei Narutani|\u9cf4\u8c37\u6167|Narutani Kei}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]}}<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-08-09/girly-air-force-anime-announces-cast-winter-2019-premiere/.135281 |title=Girly Air Force Anime Announces Cast, Winter 2019 Premiere |last=Loo |first=Egan |date=August 9, 2018 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=August 9, 2018 }}</ref>\n:A Chinese-Japanese teenager who was living in Shanghai before it had to be evacuated due to a Zai attack.

As the critical test flight approaches, Yashirod\u014dri finds out that Gripen's brainwaves have synchronized with Kei's upon their first meeting, and that her inner stability depends greatly on his close proximity to her. But during an encounter with antipathic JASDF members, Kei learns that Anima are created using salvaged Xi technology, which incites an emotional conflict in him. At the day of the test flight, however, he receives a message from Gripen explaining that she knows of her Zai origin but has chosen to fight for humanity's sake. Deciding that he cannot abandon her, Kei races to Komatsu to attend her test flight, but Gripen suffers another breakdown and a Zai fighter unexpectedly moves in to attack. But before Gripen is shot down, another Anima - Eagle - intervenes and takes out the enemy.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The World You See\n| TranslitTitle       = Kimi no Miru Sekai\n| NativeTitle         = \u541b\u306e\u898b\u308b\u4e16\u754c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|1|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Soon after Eagle arrived at Komatsu, she barges in on a date between Kei and Minghua (much to the latter's chagrin). After he learns from her that Gripen is going to be scrapped on this very day, he frantically rushed back to the air base and seeks her out, assuring her that he cares for her. Just before he can spirit her away from her impending fate, a massive Xi attack force approaches Japan, and with Eagle outnumbered on her own, defeat seems assured. Despite Yashirod\u014dri's willingness to allow Gripen and Kei to defect, Gripen and Kei decide to go up together. Gripen's initial failure to interface with her fighter forces Kei to take the controls, and after he manages to shoot down a Xi fighter, Gripen's confidence is boosted, allowing her to enter the fight by herself. The hostile force is defeated, but in the process Kei somehow manages to interface with the plane's controls just like an Anima can.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Independent Mixed Test Unit\n| TranslitTitle       = Dokuritsu konsei hik\u014d jikken-tai\n| NativeTitle         = \u72ec\u7acb\u6df7\u6210\u98db\u884c\u5b9f\u9a13\u968a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|2|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kei begins combat training as Gripen's co-pilot, but her performance still leaves something to be desired because she is now too concerned about Kei's health during high-G maneuvers.

The next day, Yashirod\u014dri announces that the Animas have been reorganized into an Independent Mixed Test Unit (IMTU), meaning a combined fighting team for greater effectiveness against further Xi incursions; but any ideas towards an [[Morale|esprit de corps]] are hindered by inherent rivalistic tensions between the three girls, so Yashirod\u014dri schedules an immediate training flight for them.

The Animas are sent out to destroy the base, with Phantom assigned to guide in a missile barrage while Gripen and Eagle provide cover. However, Phantom, thinking herself too valuable to die, hangs back from the action, which leads to Gripen and Eagle being overwhelmed by the base's defenses and forced into retreating.

Despite this, Kei outwits Phantom and shoots her down, revealing afterwards that he had expected her to use her hacking routine and developed a matching counter-tactic. Admitting defeat, Phantom sets the condition that during the next day's repeat to destroy the Xi base, Kei must fly while Gripen is to handle the plane's weapon systems, as she knows that Gripen can't handle the stress of combat piloting.

Shankle invites Kei and Gripen to play a simulation to either defeat the Xi or ensure humanity's survival for 10 years. After Kei fails several times, Gripen wins the scenario by ensuring humanity's survival. After the simulation, Yashirod\u014dri explains to Kei that Shankle views Animas as computers and programming, when in fact they are thinking beings whose loyalty and friendship must be won for humanity to succeed.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 10\n| Title               = The Mission to Retake Shanghai\n| TranslitTitle       = Shanhai Dakkan Sakusen\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0a\u6d77\u596a\u9084\u4f5c\u6226\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|14}}\n| ShortSummary        = An invasion of Shanghai, which entails a massive missile barrage and [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] action, is being planned as the first step of beating back the Xi.

Phantom does not want him to take part in the attack lest he gets hurt, as she surmises that the assault will only serve to sacrifice the Japanese Anima in order to both provide live combat data for the new drone fighters and preserve the status quo between Japan and America. Soon the IMTU relocates on board of the ''[[USS Gerald R. Ford]]'' for the operation.

The Animas finish the break through to head towards Shanghai, only to be betrayed by a large EPCM burst that confuses the Brawlers and forces them to switch sides, attacking the Animas instead. Gripen is saved by Rhino, and while the two of them have a great deal of damage and end up low on fuel. Without options, they continue on to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, which appears to be covered in the same white fog. Kei notices that this looks similar to the scenes he saw in his dreams. After an unsuccessful search for fuel, Kei, Gripen, and Rhino retire to a hotel room, noting that while empty of people, the terminal is still running on full electricity with food and toiletries available. Kei hears a cracking sound that has him suspicious. Rhino agrees to keep first watch, but ends up keeping all watches and disappears in the morning, leaving a note about going to find fuel. Kei hears the cracking sound repeatedly again, and tries to find it. He opens the door, only to find Rhino, with her hood up, in the hallway. \n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 12\n| Title               = The Sky I Fly With You\n| TranslitTitle       = \n| NativeTitle         = \n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|3|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Rhino greets Kei cheerfully, explaining that she has found fuel. The cracking sounds increase,and a blue glass appears on the floor. Rhino and Kei go to fill the planes with fuel. After fueling is complete, Kei, now suspicious, asks Rhino how she was able to find fuel when there was none available yesterday. She reveals herself to have had her anima side taken over by the Xi, who have turned her into one of them, and then shoots at Kei, wounding his face and leg. As Kei runs to rescue a dreaming Gripen, the entire airport starts turning to the Xi's blue glass. Kei manages to awaken Gripen from her dream, in which she is dreaming about peace and the order of the Xi. They run, being chased by Rhino who claims to want to simply let them stay in the peace and order of the Xi world forever, saying the human world is too full of noise. Kei and Gripen take off, still being chased by Rhino. Rhino nearly manages to turn Gripen to the Xi through her programming, but Kei uses their relationship to snap her out of it. The two planes engage in a dog fight, which Gripen and Kei win by dropping a missile behind them and using the distraction to shoot Rhino down. Now chased by many Xi fighters, the two are rescued by Eagle, Phantom, and Viper Zero, who dispatch the Xi. Kei then blacks out, awakening in the hospital. Yashirodoori-san reveals that the Americans had placed many restrictions and controls on Rhino's source coding, causing her to lose control of herself when the Xi dissolved those restrictions. It was only the bond between Gripen and Kei that prevented the same,although the Japanese Anima have their own, less restrictive safeguards. Afterwards, Kei tells Gripen he would love to fly with her over China one day. \n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://dengekibunko.jp/title/girly/|Official light novel website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://gaf-anime.jp/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ANN|anime|21099}}\n\n{{Satelight}}\n\n[[Category:2014 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Dengeki Bunko]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Satelight]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Science fiction anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Girly Air Force\n| image           = Girly Air Force, volume 1.jpg\n| caption         = Light novel cover volume 1 featuring Gripen\n| ja_kanji        = \u30ac\u30fc\u30ea\u30fc\u30fb\u30a8\u30a2\u30d5\u30a9\u30fc\u30b9\n| ja_romaji       = G\u0101r\u012b Ea F\u014dsu\n| genre           = [[Action fiction|Action]], [[science fiction]], [[War novel|warfare]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Farris, Christopher|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/girly-air-force/episode-11/.144845|title=Episode 11 - Girly Air Force|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=March 23, 2019|accessdate=May 17, 2019|quote=''Girly Air Force'' has jumped around in genre a few times already, entertaining sci-fi military action and harem hijinks interchangeably.}}</ref><!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

A [[manga]] adaptation by Takahiro Seguchi launched ''[[Monthly Sh\u014dnen Ace]]'' in October 2018, and an [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Satelight]] aired from January to March 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nEarth has come under attack by the Zai, a mysterious \"armed group\" using unusually highly advanced weapon systems far superior to any Terran military technology. A young Chinese-Japanese teenager named Kei Narutani and his Chinese friend Minghua, both living in Shanghai, are force-evacuated to Japan when the city is attacked by the Zai. During their escape by sea, several Zai fighters begin sinking the evacuation fleet when Kei suddenly witnesses the Zai being repelled by a strange airplane. When the plane subsequently crashes, Kei rushes to aid the pilot, but is surprised to find a pretty girl at the controls.\n\nAfter arriving in Japan, Kei begins investigating the origins of the strange plane, and before long he is captured by Japanese secret service agents. He learns from them that it was a Swedish fighter retrofitted with special technology developed by the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force|JASDF]]. In order to combat the Zai, their technology - HiMAT (Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology) and EPCM (Electronic Perceptory Countermeasures) - was reverse-engineered and applied to existing fighter models, which are codenamed \"Daughters\"; but in order to function properly, this tech requires an autonomous interface unit called \"Anima\", android shaped human-like girls who are made from salvaged Zai parts. The girl Kei encountered, by the name of Gripen (after the plane she flies), is such an \"Anima\" unit who formed an emotional attachment to him when he came to her aid. When her supervising developer notices that effect, he invites Kei into the Anima project and act as Gripen's partner in order to boost her flight performance and prevent her from being scrapped.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{Nihongo|Kei Narutani|\u9cf4\u8c37\u6167|Narutani Kei}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]}}<ref name=\"cast\">{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-08-09/girly-air-force-anime-announces-cast-winter-2019-premiere/.135281 |title=Girly Air Force Anime Announces Cast, Winter 2019 Premiere |last=Loo |first=Egan |date=August 9, 2018 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=August 9, 2018 }}</ref>\n:A Chinese-Japanese teenager who was living in Shanghai before it had to be evacuated due to a Zai attack.

Several Xi aircraft arrive and attack the ship Kei and Minghua are riding in, but they are saved by the intervention of a highly advanced plane resembling a [[Saab JAS 39 Gripen|JAS 39E/F Gripen]]. The Gripen crashes into the water after the Xi retreat, and Kei swims over to rescue the pilot, who is a mysterious girl that kisses him upon seeing him. The [[Japan Air Self Defense Force]] recovers the Gripen and Kei and Minghua reach Japan safely where they live at Kei's grandfather's house. Intrigued by the Gripen, as well as wanting revenge against the Xi for killing his mother, Kei heads to [[Komatsu Airport|a nearby JASDF base]] to see if the Gripen is being stored there. Minghua follows him, and they are both captured by base security. Inside, Kei meets Haruka Yashirod\u014dri, who reveals to him that the JASDF has developed advanced fighters called \"Daughters\" which are capable of overcoming the Xi's technological advantage, and they are piloted by special entities called \"Anima\". He further reveals that for some reason, Gripen seems to respond positively to Kei's presence, and he offers him a chance to join his team and help fight the Xi.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 2\n| Title               = Komatsu Rendezvous\n| TranslitTitle       = Komatsu Randeb\u016b\n| NativeTitle         = \u30b3\u30de\u30c4\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c7\u30d6\u30fc\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|1|17}}\n| ShortSummary        = Upon Yashirod\u014dri's invitation, Kei returns to Komatsu Air Base the next morning to start working with Gripen. Gripen fetches him from their meeting point and begins showing him around, thereby revealing a surprisingly, dreamy human-like but very scatterbrained side. Kei also notices a strong antipathy by the JASDF staff towards the Anima. The next day, Gripen seeks Kei out at his home for a date, in which course she reveals that she suffers from an unknown defect, which leaves her without a clear purpose of existence and frequent breakdowns during her missions. They spend the rest of the day with leisure activities until Gripen inexplicably collapses and is immediately picked up by Yashirod\u014dri's staff for repairs. Yashirod\u014dri tells Kei that Gripen usually breaks down (i.e., falls asleep) after just three hours, but during this day her activity cycle was substantially extended, and expresses hope that Kei's presence will affect her positively during her test flight in a week's time, because otherwise she will be declared a write-off prototype and scrapped.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 3\n| Title               = Anima Core\n| TranslitTitle       = Anima no Honishitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u30a2\u30cb\u30de\u306e\u672c\u8cea\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|1|24}}\n| ShortSummary        = When Gripen performs substandard during a test simulation, Kei is allowed to take the controls of a \"Daughter\" for the first time. As the critical test flight approaches, Yashirod\u014dri finds out that Gripen's brainwaves have synchronized with Kei's upon their first meeting, and that her inner stability depends greatly on his close proximity to her. But during an encounter with antipathic JASDF members, Kei learns that Anima are created using salvaged Xi technology, which incites an emotional conflict in him. At the day of the test flight, however, he receives a message from Gripen explaining that she knows of her Zai origin but has chosen to fight for humanity's sake. Deciding that he cannot abandon her, Kei races to Komatsu to attend her test flight, but Gripen suffers another breakdown and a Zai fighter unexpectedly moves in to attack. But before Gripen is shot down, another Anima - Eagle - intervenes and takes out the enemy.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 4\n| Title               = The World You See\n| TranslitTitle       = Kimi no Miru Sekai\n| NativeTitle         = \u541b\u306e\u898b\u308b\u4e16\u754c\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|1|31}}\n| ShortSummary        = Soon after Eagle arrived at Komatsu, she barges in on a date between Kei and Minghua (much to the latter's chagrin). After he learns from her that Gripen is going to be scrapped on this very day, he frantically rushed back to the air base and seeks her out, assuring her that he cares for her. Just before he can spirit her away from her impending fate, a massive Xi attack force approaches Japan, and with Eagle outnumbered on her own, defeat seems assured. Despite Yashirod\u014dri's willingness to allow Gripen and Kei to defect, Gripen and Kei decide to go up together. Gripen's initial failure to interface with her fighter forces Kei to take the controls, and after he manages to shoot down a Xi fighter, Gripen's confidence is boosted, allowing her to enter the fight by herself. The hostile force is defeated, but in the process Kei somehow manages to interface with the plane's controls just like an Anima can.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 5\n| Title               = Independent Mixed Test Unit\n| TranslitTitle       = Dokuritsu konsei hik\u014d jikken-tai\n| NativeTitle         = \u72ec\u7acb\u6df7\u6210\u98db\u884c\u5b9f\u9a13\u968a\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|2|7}}\n| ShortSummary        = Kei begins combat training as Gripen's co-pilot, but her performance still leaves something to be desired because she is now too concerned about Kei's health during high-G maneuvers.

The next day, Yashirod\u014dri announces that the Animas have been reorganized into an Independent Mixed Test Unit (IMTU), meaning a combined fighting team for greater effectiveness against further Xi incursions; but any ideas towards an [[Morale|esprit de corps]] are hindered by inherent rivalistic tensions between the three girls, so Yashirod\u014dri schedules an immediate training flight for them.

Soon afterwards, an emergency arises as the Xi begin establishing a forward base on an island right within the edges of Japan's [[Air Defense Identification Zone|ADIZ]]. The Animas are sent out to destroy the base, with Phantom assigned to guide in a missile barrage while Gripen and Eagle provide cover. However, Phantom, thinking herself too valuable to die, hangs back from the action, which leads to Gripen and Eagle being overwhelmed by the base's defenses and forced into retreating. After their return, Kei begins taunting Phantom with a challenge to a match between her and Gripen: If she loses, she will finally subordinate herself; and if she wins, Kei will become her partner.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| Title               = After the Bewilderment \n| TranslitTitle       = Madoi no Saki\n| NativeTitle         = \u60d1\u3044\u306e\u5148\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|2|21}}\n| ShortSummary        = Even though chagrined at the infighting, Yashiod\u014dri gives Kei permission to go through with his plan, knowing that time is of the essence. Using the simulators at [[Naha Air Base|Naha Airbase]], Kei and Gripen engage in mock combat with Phantom, but she attempts to cheat again. Despite this, Kei outwits Phantom and shoots her down, revealing afterwards that he had expected her to use her hacking routine and developed a matching counter-tactic. Admitting defeat, Phantom sets the condition that during the next day's repeat to destroy the Xi base, Kei must fly while Gripen is to handle the plane's weapon systems, as she knows that Gripen can't handle the stress of combat piloting. The next morning, the attack is renewed, but Eagle is sent off to support an allied strike force, leaving Kei, Gripen, and Phantom on their own.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber       = 8\n| Title               = An Unhappy Top Secret\n| TranslitTitle       = Fukigen na Saik\u014d Kimitsu\n| NativeTitle         = \u4e0d\u6a5f\u5acc\u306a\u6700\u9ad8\u6a5f\u5bc6\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2019|2|28}}\n| ShortSummary        = Despite the Xi's formidable defenses, Kei, Gripen, and Phantom manage to complete their mission with the unexpected assistance of another Anima, Zero One.

As Yashirod\u014dri later informs him, the mystery girl is Viper Zero, whose defective EGG makes her assume the illusionary appearance of any specific person in the eyes of any who see her.

Shankle invites Kei and Gripen to play a simulation to either defeat the Xi or ensure humanity's survival for 10 years. After Kei fails several times, Gripen wins the scenario by ensuring humanity's survival.

As Kei, who wishes to participate in the mission, tries to sort out his feelings, he is nearly overrun by a truck due to Phantom's actions. Phantom does not want him to take part in the attack lest he gets hurt, as she surmises that the assault will only serve to sacrifice the Japanese Anima in order to both provide live combat data for the new drone fighters and preserve the status quo between Japan and America.

The Animas finish the break through to head towards Shanghai, only to be betrayed by a large EPCM burst that confuses the Brawlers and forces them to switch sides, attacking the Animas instead. Gripen is saved by Rhino, and while the two of them have a great deal of damage and end up low on fuel. Without options, they continue on to Shanghai Pudong International Airport, which appears to be covered in the same white fog. Kei notices that this looks similar to the scenes he saw in his dreams. After an unsuccessful search for fuel, Kei, Gripen, and Rhino retire to a hotel room, noting that while empty of people, the terminal is still running on full electricity with food and toiletries available. Kei hears a cracking sound that has him suspicious. Rhino agrees to keep first watch, but ends up keeping all watches and disappears in the morning, leaving a note about going to find fuel.

The cracking sounds increase,and a blue glass appears on the floor. Rhino and Kei go to fill the planes with fuel. After fueling is complete, Kei, now suspicious, asks Rhino how she was able to find fuel when there was none available yesterday. She reveals herself to have had her anima side taken over by the Xi, who have turned her into one of them, and then shoots at Kei, wounding his face and leg. As Kei runs to rescue a dreaming Gripen, the entire airport starts turning to the Xi's blue glass. Kei manages to awaken Gripen from her dream, in which she is dreaming about peace and the order of the Xi. They run, being chased by Rhino who claims to want to simply let them stay in the peace and order of the Xi world forever, saying the human world is too full of noise. Kei and Gripen take off, still being chased by Rhino. Rhino nearly manages to turn Gripen to the Xi through her programming, but Kei uses their relationship to snap her out of it. The two planes engage in a dog fight, which Gripen and Kei win by dropping a missile behind them and using the distraction to shoot Rhino down. Now chased by many Xi fighters, the two are rescued by Eagle, Phantom, and Viper Zero, who dispatch the Xi. Kei then blacks out, awakening in the hospital. Yashirodoori-san reveals that the Americans had placed many restrictions and controls on Rhino's source coding, causing her to lose control of herself when the Xi dissolved those restrictions. It was only the bond between Gripen and Kei that prevented the same,although the Japanese Anima have their own, less restrictive safeguards. Afterwards, Kei tells Gripen he would love to fly with her over China one day. \n}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://dengekibunko.jp/title/girly/|Official light novel website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{Official website|http://gaf-anime.jp/|Official anime website}} {{in lang|ja}}\n* {{ANN|anime|21099}}\n\n{{Satelight}}\n\n[[Category:2014 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Anime and manga based on light novels]]\n[[Category:Dengeki Bunko]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Dwango franchises]]\n[[Category:Kadokawa Shoten manga]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Satelight]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014dnen manga]]\n[[Category:Science fiction anime and manga]]\n", "name_user": "Pazio Paz", "label": "safe", "comment": "Number of published volumes.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girly_Air_Force"}

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted. Unlike its previous organization enlisted personnel of the division were exclusively Philippine Scouts. The War Department also proposed organizing a second Philippine Scout division, the [[14th Infantry Division (United States)|14th]], but never did so.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexander M.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

These troops were generally [[Filipinos]] and [[Filipino-Americans]] assigned to the [[United States Army]] [[Philippine Department]], under the command of [[white American]] [[commissioned officer]]s (though a handful of Filipino Americans received commissions from the [[United States Military Academy]]). Philippine Scout units were given the suffix \"'''(PS)'''\", to distinguish them from other U.S. Army units.\n\nThe first Scout companies were organized by the US in 1901 to combat the [[Philippine Revolutionary Army]] led at that time by General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. In 1919\u20131920, the PS companies were grouped into regiments as part of the [[United States Army|US Army]] and redesignated the [[43d Infantry Regiment (PS)|43d]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (United States)|44th]], [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th]], and [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)|57th Infantry Regiments]], plus the [[24th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|24th]] and [[25th Field Artillery Regiment (United States)|25th Field Artillery Regiments]], the [[26th Cavalry Regiment (PS)]] and the [[91st Coast Artillery (United States)|91st]] and [[92nd Coast Artillery (United States)|92nd Coast Artillery Regiments]]. Service and support formations were also organized as engineer, medical, quartermaster and military police units. The infantry and field artillery regiments were grouped together with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|U.S. 31st Infantry Regiment]] to form the U.S. Army's [[Philippine Division]]. At this point, the Scouts became the U.S. Army's front line troops in the Pacific.\n\nThe Philippine Department assigned the Scouts to subdue the [[Moro people|Moro tribes]] on the island of Mindanao (see [[Moro rebellion]]), and to establish tranquility throughout the islands. In the 1930s, Philippine Scouts, along with the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]], saw action at [[Palawan|Jolo, Palawan]].\n\nPhilippine Scout regiments became the first United States Army units to be in combat during World War II, until the surrender of [[USAFFE]] in May 1942. Even after that some individual soldiers and units refused to surrender and become beginning elements of the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines#Resistance|resistance to the Japanese occupation]]. Later paroled [[POWs]] would also join the resistance.\n\n==Macabebe Scouts==\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Macabebe Scouts\n|image=\n|caption=\n|dates=1899\u20131901\n|country={{flag|United States|1896}}<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|allegiance={{flag|United States of America|1899}}\n* {{flagdeco|United States|1896}} [[United States Military Government of the Philippine Islands|Military Government]]<br>{{small|(1899\u20131901)}}\n|branch={{army|United States}} (1899\u20131901)\n|type= [[Militia]], [[Irregular military|Irregulars]]\n|role= [[military intelligence|intelligence]], [[reconnaissance]]\n|size= 1402 in December 1900<ref name=dum>{{cite web |last=Dumindin |first=Arnaldo |title=Philippine-American War, 1899\u20131902 |url=http://www.filipinoamericanwar.com/thewarrages1899.htm |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n|command_structure=\n|garrison=\n|garrison_label=\n|nickname=\n|patron=\n|motto=\n|colors=\n|march=\n|mascot=\n|equipment=\n|equipment_label=\n|battles=[[Philippine\u2013American War]]<br>[[Moro rebellion]]\n|anniversaries=\n|decorations=\n|battle_honours=\n|disbanded=\n<!-- Commanders -->\n|commander1=\n|commander1_label=\n|commander2=\n|commander2_label=\n|commander3=\n|commander3_label=\n|notable_commanders=General [[Henry Lawton]]<br>\nGeneral [[Frederick Funston]]<br>\nLieutenant [[Matthew A.

MacArthur took command of all military forces in the Philippines except the U.S. Navy's [[Asiatic Fleet]]. The [[Philippine Division]], [[Philippine Department]] and all other Philippine Scout units were included in USAFFE, as was the U.S. Army's [[United States Far East Air Force|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF). At the time of USAFFE's formation, the unit consisted of 22,532 troops, of which 11,972 were Philippine Scouts.\n\nOf the 22,532 troops, 10,473 were members of the Philippine Division, itself containing 2,552 Americans and 7,921 Filipinos. All of the division's enlisted men, with the exception of the [[31st Infantry Regiment (United States)|31st Infantry Regiment]] and some of the [[Military Police Corps (United States)|military police]] and headquarters troops, were Philippine Scouts.\n\n==Filipino Officers within the Philippine Division, July 1941==\nIn 1910, the U.S. Army began sending one outstanding Filipino soldier per year to West Point.

Over the next three months the Japanese Army marched through [[Southeast Asia]], and by March 1942 the Japanese had completely overrun every country and island in the western Pacific\u2014except the Philippines.\n\nOn the [[Bataan Peninsula]] of [[Luzon Island]], the Philippine Scouts, a few U.S. Army National Guard units, and ten divisions of poorly equipped, almost untrained [[Philippine Army]] soldiers held out against the Japanese. Survivors of the [[Battle of Bataan]], to a man, describe the Philippine Scouts as the backbone of the American defense there. President Franklin Roosevelt awarded the U.S. Army\u2019s first three [[Medal of Honor|Medals of Honor]] of World War II to Philippine Scouts: to Sergeant [[Jose Calugas]] for action at Culis, Bataan on January 6, 1942, to Lieutenant [[Alexander R. Nininger]] for action near Abucay, Bataan on January 12, and to Lieutenant [[Willibald C. Bianchi]] for action near Bagac, Bataan on February 3, 1942.\n\nWith the U.S. Navy at [[Pearl Harbor]] in shambles, and the Japanese Navy blockading the Philippines, there was no way to send adequate amounts of food, medicine, ammunition or reinforcements to Bataan. Early in the campaign, in January 1942, General MacArthur ordered that his forces be fed one-half daily rations because the USAFFE food-stocks on Bataan were insufficient for the planned six-month siege. Such a diet did not provide enough calories for men working and fighting in the tropical heat of the Philippines' Dry Season. Nonetheless, the Scouts and the other soldiers held out for more than four months without adequate food or medicine, while malaria, dysentery and malnutrition ravaged their ranks, and Japanese attacks drove them further down the [[Bataan Peninsula]]. In the midst of the [[Battle of Bataan]], on 11 March 1942, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered General [[Douglas MacArthur]] spirited out of the Philippines by PT boat and airplane.\n\n==Prisoners of war==\nThe [[Battle of Bataan]] ended on April 9, 1942, when [[Edward P. King|Major General Edward P. King, Jr.]], surrendered rather than see any more of his starving, diseased men slaughtered by the advancing enemy. At that point 70,000 men became [[Prisoners of War]]: about 16,000 Americans and 54,000 Filipinos. Japanese soldiers marched the emaciated Scouts, American soldiers, and Philippine Army men sixty-five miles up the Bataan Peninsula's East Road on the notorious \"March of Death,\" the [[Bataan Death March]]. During the March, Japanese guards shot or bayoneted between 7,000 and 10,000 men who fell, attempted to escape, or just stopped to quench their thirst at roadside spigots or puddles. They also beat and sometimes killed Filipino civilians who attempted to give food and water to the POWs, and at times flashed the \"V\" for \"Victory\" hand-gesture to the defeated soldiers along the length of the Death March. The March ended at the railroad head in San Fernando, Pampanga province. There the POWs were forced into overcrowded \"40 and 10\" railroad cars, which only had enough room for them to sit down in shifts on the final leg of the trip to Capas, Tarlac province. At Capas they were herded into Camp O'Donnell, a former Philippine Army training camp, which was to be their prison camp.\n\nAt [[Camp O'Donnell]] the Japanese crammed all 60,000 survivors into a Philippine Army camp designed to accommodate 10,000 men. There, the Japanese commander greeted each new group of arrivals with the discouraging \"Goddamn you to Hell\" speech in his native language, and assured the men that they were \"captives,\" not Prisoners of War, and would be treated as such. There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care, and only slit trenches for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoner's food, and malaria, dysentery, beriberi and a host of other diseases swept through the crowds of men. They began to die at the rate of four hundred per day.\n\nFrom September through December 1942, the Japanese gradually paroled the surviving Philippine Scouts and other Filipino soldiers to their families and to the mayors of their hometowns. But by the time Camp O'Donnell closed in January 1943, after eight months of operation, 26,000 of the 50,000 Filipino [[Prisoners of War]] had died there.\n\nThe Japanese transferred the American prisoners to [[Cabanatuan]], Nueva Ecija province, where conditions were only marginally better. But as U.S. forces pulled closer to the Philippines in 1944, they [[Hell ship|evacuated]] the healthiest American prisoners to [[Japan]] and [[Manchuria]], for use as slave laborers. Thousands of men were crammed into the dark holds of cargo ships so tightly that they could not sit or lay down. Again, food and water were scarce, sanitary facilities were non-existent, and the heat in the closed holds of the ships was unbearable. Men suffocated to death standing up. The Japanese ships were unmarked and some of them were torpedoed by American submarines. More of the men died of malnutrition and exposure in the work camps. By the time Japan surrendered and the U.S. and Filipino Army liberated the Bataan Prisoners of War, two-thirds of the American prisoners had died in Japanese custody.\n\n==Liberation and the \"New\" Scouts==\nDuring the Japanese occupation of the Philippines an extensive Filipino [[guerrilla]] movement sprang up. In some cases the guerrilla units were led by escaped American officers (e.g., [[Wendell Fertig]]) and often included \"paroled\" Philippine Scout and Philippine Commonwealth Army soldiers, along with civilian members of the Philippine underground. As MacArthur\u2019s forces, supported by the guerrillas, liberated the [[Philippine Islands]], the surviving Philippine Scouts stepped forward and rejoined the U.S. Army. The Filipino guerrillas joined them, and the U.S. Army set up new Philippine Scout units, reconstituting the old Philippine Division as the [[Philippine Division (United States)|12th Infantry Division]]. Subordinate units included the [[43rd Infantry Regiment (PS)|43rd]], [[44th Infantry Regiment (PS)|44th]] and [[45th Infantry Regiment (PS)|45th Infantry Regiments]] (PS); [[23rd Field Artillery (PS)|23rd]], [[24th Field Artillery (PS)|24th]] and [[88th Field Artillery (PS)|88th Field Artillery]] (PS) Battalions; [[56th Engineer Battalion (PS)]] and the [[57th Infantry Regiment (PS)]]. The \"New Scouts\" actively participated in combat against the Japanese Army in north [[Luzon]], served as [[military police]] to restore order and help locate pockets of escaped Japanese in the south, and served as occupation forces on [[Okinawa]]. As planning for the invasion of Japan progressed, the Philippine Scouts were included in the invasion forces, and were selected to become part of the occupying force once Japan was defeated.\n\nAfter Japan surrendered in August 1945, the United States granted the Republic of the Philippines full independence on July 4, 1946. At that point the ethnically Filipino Philippine Scouts held a unique status in U.S. military history: they were soldiers in the regular U.S. Army, but now they were citizens of a foreign country. To solve this dilemma, the United States offered the Filipinos in the Philippine Scouts full [[U.S. citizenship]]. Many of the surviving Scouts, perhaps around 1,000, accepted, and the Army transferred them to other units to finish their military careers.\n\nWith the consent of the Philippine government, Congress approved the maintenance of 50,000 Philippine Scouts. Under Major General Hibbs, Philippine Division as the 12th Infantry Division (PS) was reconstituted.

Children of the Scouts (known as \"Army Soup\" in pre-World War II Fort William McKinley days) sometimes carried on their fathers' military traditions and also became US Army soldiers and Marines. Two Philippine Scout children even earned the stars of US Army generals: Lt. General [[Edward Soriano]] and Major General [[Antonio M. Taguba]]. A third, Brig. General [[Oscar Hilman]], a native of Washington state and an armor officer who had started out as an enlisted man, earned his star in a long career in the Army National Guard.\n\nUnlike other non-citizen veterans, veterans of the Philippine Division and other Filipinos who fought as part of the [[USAFFE]] were never granted citizenship. Since 1993, various bills have been introduced to the [[United States Congress]] under the name [[Filipino Veterans Fairness Act]] to rectify this. However, this was a complicated matter as after the liberation of the Philippines members of the Philippine Scouts were offered enlistments and in some applicable cases commissions in the US Army and subsequent citizenship. Large numbers of \"old\" Philippine Scouts (those enlisting before or during World War II) took advantage of this. However, most \"new\" Philippine Scouts (those recruited following the war, mostly for occupation duty on Okinawa and elsewhere) were not offered citizenship. Language similar to the aforementioned proposed legislation was inserted by the Senate into the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]<ref>{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Maze |title=Senate puts Filipino vet pensions in stimulus |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_filipinoscouts_stimulus_012909w/ |format=News article |work=Army Times |date=2008-01-29|accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote=Buried inside the Senate bill, which includes tax cuts and new spending initiatives intended to create jobs in the U.S., the Filipino payment was inserted at the urging of Sen.

This provided a one-time payment to those veterans who are recognized as being soldiers or recognized guerrilla members by the United States or their surviving spouse. Even this, however, falls far short of the benefits available to similar veterans of other units.\n\nIn 2012, a [[documentary film]] named ''Forgotten Soldiers'' was produced by Donald A.

After their initial solo attempts fail, the two reluctantly team up and manage to recover the Scroll; during this fight, one of the Nazis transforms into a Daemonite and attacks Logan.  Zannah kills the Daemonite, then knocks Logan unconscious and takes the Scroll.  Later, the two meet again when Logan assists Zannah in securing passage on a [[train]] in [[Vienna]].  Logan persuades Zannah to trust him, and she fills him in on what the Scroll is.  Their travel is interrupted by a Daemonite and Kenyan, who injures Zannah, sabotages the train tracks, and makes off with the Scroll.  Surviving the train wreck, Logan and Zannah rest and recuperate, then sneak into a convoy truck, which brings them to an underground base where Kenyan uses the Scroll to resurrect Ebron, an ancient Daemonite warlord.  While Logan fights Kenyan, Zannah kills Ebron, which causes a massive explosion that levels the base.

After being released from a South American prison by [[Nick Fury]], [[Grifter (comics)|Cole Cash]] is drafted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to work as a field agent to investigate what appears to be an \"alien invasion\" and to recover an operative who has been captured in [[Sydney]].  At the same time, [[Jean Grey]], on a flight to a [[model (person)|modeling]] shoot in Sydney, is psionically accosted by the \"aliens,\" who reveal themselves to be hybrids of the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] and the Daemonites and who mistake Jean for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on the plane who has knowledge of a plot involving the hybrids.  The hybrids kill the agent after the plane lands, but are themselves killed by a psionic blast from Cash. Jean telepathically learns the fallen agent's information before he dies, calms Cash after his psi-blast, helps him get past the police at the airport, and offers to help him complete his mission.  The news of the attack at the airport is reported by the human/[[Kherubim]] halfbreed assassin Pike to [[Mister Sinister]], who is revealed to have created the hybrids and who has captured Zealot, the missing S.H.I.E.L.D operative.  Cash and Jean infiltrate a cruise ship which is attacked by Pike and a swarm of hybrids, who capture the passengers so that Sinister can use them to incubate new hybrids.  Cash and Jean resist, but are defeated by Pike; however, the rest of the X-Men arrive (having tracked Jean using [[Cerebro]]) and defeat Pike and the rest of the hybrids.  Sinister escapes, unnoticed by anyone; Zealot is freed, and Jean and Cash part company.\n\n===The Modern Age===\n'''Story:''' [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]]<br>\n'''Pencils:''' [[Adam Hughes]]<br>\n'''Inks:''' [[Mark Farmer]]<br>\n'''Colors:''' Joe Chiodo & Martin Jiminez<br>\n'''Letters:''' Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Dave Lanphear<br>\n'''Editor:''' Scott Dunbier<br>\n'''Consulting Editor:''' Bob Harras<br>\nOriginally published as ''WildC.A.T.s/X-Men: The Modern Age #1'' in August 1997 \n\nThis story takes place after the formation of the second X-Men team and the WildC.A.T.s, but before the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]].  The X-Men are investigating the disappearance of a young mutant boy which appears to be connected to a [[Great Britain|British]] branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].  At the same time, the WildC.A.T.s are investigating a suspected allegiance between this branch of the Club and the Daemonites.  During a reconnaissance mission at the mansion, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] is assaulted by [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]], who mistakes the X-Man for a Daemonite.  They are accosted by Hellfire Club minions; one exposes itself as a Daemonite and attacks Warblade, who kills the entire group then is teleported away.  Two months later, as the X-Men plan to sneak into the Club to investigate further, [[Lord Emp]] receives and accepts an invitation for Jacob Marlowe to join the Club, and takes [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] with him; they are accepted into the Club, but are later ambushed and incapacitated.  The other WildC.A.T.s and the X-Men converge on the Club's mansion and battle combined Club and Daemonite forces, and eventually discover Emp and the missing mutant boy deep underground, where they are to be sacrificed to a demonic creature which is summoned by the Club's leader.  A vicious battle ensues, and Emp and the boy are freed.  With its sacrifices taken away, the creature is unsummoned, and the resulting energy vortex destroys the Club's mansion.  Jean and [[Void (comics)|Void]] save the two teams from the rubble, and the remaining Club and Daemonite forces are defeated.  The two teams part on less than friendly terms, as the X-Men (even Wolverine) are disturbed by the WildC.A.T.s' lethal tactics and merciless attitude about killing.\n\n===The Dark Age===\n'''Story:''' [[Warren Ellis]]<br>\n'''Pencils:''' Mat Broome<br>\n'''Inks:''' Sean Parsons<br>\n'''Colors:''' Wendy Fouts & Wildstorm FX<br>\n'''Letters:''' Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Dave Lanphear<br>\n'''Editor:''' Scott Dunbier<br>\n'''Consulting Editor:''' Bob Harras<br>\nOriginally published as ''X-Men/WildC.A.T.s: The Dark Age #1'' in May 1998 \n\nThis story takes place in [[Manhattan]] in 2019.  [[North America]] is a wasteland ruled by the Daemonites.  It is revealed that the Daemonites on Earth went insane in anger and grief after learning that their homeworld had been conquered by the Kherubim.  Still intent on conquering Earth, they stole [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] technology from the [[United States|US]] government and fused the technology with themselves, turning themselves into monstrous [[cyborg]]s who easily overpowered the combined human/superhuman/Kherubim forces which tried to stop them.  By the time of the story's beginning, most of the Marvel Universe [[superhero]]es have either been killed or imprisoned, along with several Wildstorm superheroes.  Of the surviving superheroes, Savant, Voodoo, Zealot, Lord Emp, [[Mister Majestic]], Warblade, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Kitty Pryde]], Jean Grey, and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] are all prisoners of the Daemonites.  Zealot, Cable, Jean, and Mister Majestic are segregated from the rest, subdued, and subjected to near-constant [[torture]]. The rest are held in holding areas patrolled by Daemonite guards.  Emp is wheelchair-bound, and Storm is mildly deranged due to a severe attack of [[claustrophobia]] caused by being buried in a pile of corpses.  All of them have had their powers shut off by living implants in their bodies, and those who are physically able are forced to perform horrific, demoralizing tasks such as examining corpses.\n\nGrifter and Wolverine, who have survived the Daemonite takeover and are members of a resistance army, are shown making their way across the country from Canada to Manhattan to set off a [[nuclear bomb]].  After finding the corpse of [[Grunge (comics)|Grunge]], they encounter and defeat members of [[DV8]] who have been conscripted by the Daemonites as border guards.  While this is going on, a plan put together by Kitty and Emp is put into motion.  Warblade sacrifices himself by having Emp kill his implant; before he dies, he uses his power to surgically shut down and remove the others' implants.  Savant, Storm, Kitty, and Voodoo then free Zealot, Cable, Jean, and Mister Majestic from captivity, and the final stage of the plan is put into motion:  to erase the current timeline by going back in time and ensuring that the Kherubim do not reach Earth.  This will keep the Daemonites from following the Kherubim to Earth, and will also eliminate the X-Men, which will take away the need to develop the Sentinels.  Using the time travel knowledge in Cable's mind, Jean psionically links herself, Cable, Emp, and Savant, and begins the process, but lacks the power needed to complete the task.  The bomb planted by Grifter and Wolverine detonates, providing the energy that Jean lacks, and the psionically merged foursome destroy a Kherubim ship on the verge of reaching Earth.  As the current timeline is erased, single panel scenes from each of the four stories are shown being destroyed.

After their initial solo attempts fail, the two reluctantly team up and manage to recover the Scroll; during this fight, one of the Nazis transforms into a Daemonite and attacks Logan.  Zannah kills the Daemonite, then knocks Logan unconscious and takes the Scroll.  Later, the two meet again when Logan assists Zannah in securing passage on a [[train]] in [[Vienna]].  Logan persuades Zannah to trust him, and she fills him in on what the Scroll is.  Their travel is interrupted by a Daemonite and Kenyan, who injures Zannah, sabotages the train tracks, and makes off with the Scroll.  Surviving the train wreck, Logan and Zannah rest and recuperate, then sneak into a convoy truck, which brings them to an underground base where Kenyan uses the Scroll to resurrect Ebron, an ancient Daemonite warlord.  While Logan fights Kenyan, Zannah kills Ebron, which causes a massive explosion that levels the base.  Logan digs his way out of the rubble, but can find no trace of Zannah except for her broken [[sword]].\n\n===The Silver Age===\n'''Story:''' Scott Lobdell<br>\n'''[[Penciller|Pencils]]:''' [[Jim Lee]]<br>\n'''[[Inker|Inks]]:''' [[Scott Williams (comics)|Scott Williams]] and [[Sal Regla]]<br>\n'''Colors:''' [[Joe Chiodo]] & Martin Jiminez<br>\n'''Letters:''' Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Dave Lanphear<br>\n'''Editor:''' [[Scott Dunbier]]<br>\n'''Consulting Editor:''' [[Bob Harras]]<br>\nOriginally published as ''WildC.A.T.s/X-Men: The Silver Age #1'' in June 1997\n\nThis story takes place in the early days of the original X-Men and before the formation of the WildC.A.T.s.  After being released from a South American prison by [[Nick Fury]], [[Grifter (comics)|Cole Cash]] is drafted by [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] to work as a field agent to investigate what appears to be an \"alien invasion\" and to recover an operative who has been captured in [[Sydney]].  At the same time, [[Jean Grey]], on a flight to a [[model (person)|modeling]] shoot in Sydney, is psionically accosted by the \"aliens,\" who reveal themselves to be hybrids of the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]] and the Daemonites and who mistake Jean for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent on the plane who has knowledge of a plot involving the hybrids.  The hybrids kill the agent after the plane lands, but are themselves killed by a psionic blast from Cash. Jean telepathically learns the fallen agent's information before he dies, calms Cash after his psi-blast, helps him get past the police at the airport, and offers to help him complete his mission.  The news of the attack at the airport is reported by the human/[[Kherubim]] halfbreed assassin Pike to [[Mister Sinister]], who is revealed to have created the hybrids and who has captured Zealot, the missing S.H.I.E.L.D operative.  Cash and Jean infiltrate a cruise ship which is attacked by Pike and a swarm of hybrids, who capture the passengers so that Sinister can use them to incubate new hybrids.  Cash and Jean resist, but are defeated by Pike; however, the rest of the X-Men arrive (having tracked Jean using [[Cerebro]]) and defeat Pike and the rest of the hybrids.  Sinister escapes, unnoticed by anyone; Zealot is freed, and Jean and Cash part company.\n\n===The Modern Age===\n'''Story:''' [[James Robinson (comics)|James Robinson]]<br>\n'''Pencils:''' [[Adam Hughes]]<br>\n'''Inks:''' [[Mark Farmer]]<br>\n'''Colors:''' Joe Chiodo & Martin Jiminez<br>\n'''Letters:''' Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Dave Lanphear<br>\n'''Editor:''' Scott Dunbier<br>\n'''Consulting Editor:''' Bob Harras<br>\nOriginally published as ''WildC.A.T.s/X-Men: The Modern Age #1'' in August 1997 \n\nThis story takes place after the formation of the second X-Men team and the WildC.A.T.s, but before the [[Dark Phoenix Saga]].  The X-Men are investigating the disappearance of a young mutant boy which appears to be connected to a [[Great Britain|British]] branch of the [[Hellfire Club (comics)|Hellfire Club]].  At the same time, the WildC.A.T.s are investigating a suspected allegiance between this branch of the Club and the Daemonites.  During a reconnaissance mission at the mansion, [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] is assaulted by [[Warblade (comics)|Warblade]], who mistakes the X-Man for a Daemonite.  They are accosted by Hellfire Club minions; one exposes itself as a Daemonite and attacks Warblade, who kills the entire group then is teleported away.  Two months later, as the X-Men plan to sneak into the Club to investigate further, [[Lord Emp]] receives and accepts an invitation for Jacob Marlowe to join the Club, and takes [[Spartan (comics)|Spartan]] and [[Voodoo (Wildstorm)|Voodoo]] with him; they are accepted into the Club, but are later ambushed and incapacitated.  The other WildC.A.T.s and the X-Men converge on the Club's mansion and battle combined Club and Daemonite forces, and eventually discover Emp and the missing mutant boy deep underground, where they are to be sacrificed to a demonic creature which is summoned by the Club's leader.  A vicious battle ensues, and Emp and the boy are freed.  With its sacrifices taken away, the creature is unsummoned, and the resulting energy vortex destroys the Club's mansion.  Jean and [[Void (comics)|Void]] save the two teams from the rubble, and the remaining Club and Daemonite forces are defeated.  The two teams part on less than friendly terms, as the X-Men (even Wolverine) are disturbed by the WildC.A.T.s' lethal tactics and merciless attitude about killing.\n\n===The Dark Age===\n'''Story:''' [[Warren Ellis]]<br>\n'''Pencils:''' Mat Broome<br>\n'''Inks:''' Sean Parsons<br>\n'''Colors:''' Wendy Fouts & Wildstorm FX<br>\n'''Letters:''' Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Dave Lanphear<br>\n'''Editor:''' Scott Dunbier<br>\n'''Consulting Editor:''' Bob Harras<br>\nOriginally published as ''X-Men/WildC.A.T.s: The Dark Age #1'' in May 1998 \n\nThis story takes place in [[Manhattan]] in 2019.  [[North America]] is a wasteland ruled by the Daemonites.  It is revealed that the Daemonites on Earth went insane in anger and grief after learning that their homeworld had been conquered by the Kherubim.  Still intent on conquering Earth, they stole [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinel]] technology from the [[United States|US]] government and fused the technology with themselves, turning themselves into monstrous [[cyborg]]s who easily overpowered the combined human/superhuman/Kherubim forces which tried to stop them.  By the time of the story's beginning, most of the Marvel Universe [[superhero]]es have either been killed or imprisoned, along with several Wildstorm superheroes.  Of the surviving superheroes, Savant, Voodoo, Zealot, Lord Emp, [[Mister Majestic]], Warblade, [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Kitty Pryde]], Jean Grey, and [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] are all prisoners of the Daemonites.  Zealot, Cable, Jean, and Mister Majestic are segregated from the rest, subdued, and subjected to near-constant [[torture]]. The rest are held in holding areas patrolled by Daemonite guards.  Emp is wheelchair-bound, and Storm is mildly deranged due to a severe attack of [[claustrophobia]] caused by being buried in a pile of corpses.  All of them have had their powers shut off by living implants in their bodies, and those who are physically able are forced to perform horrific, demoralizing tasks such as examining corpses.\n\nGrifter and Wolverine, who have survived the Daemonite takeover and are members of a resistance army, are shown making their way across the country from Canada to Manhattan to set off a [[nuclear bomb]].  After finding the corpse of [[Grunge (comics)|Grunge]], they encounter and defeat members of [[DV8]] who have been conscripted by the Daemonites as border guards.  While this is going on, a plan put together by Kitty and Emp is put into motion.  Warblade sacrifices himself by having Emp kill his implant; before he dies, he uses his power to surgically shut down and remove the others' implants.  Savant, Storm, Kitty, and Voodoo then free Zealot, Cable, Jean, and Mister Majestic from captivity, and the final stage of the plan is put into motion:  to erase the current timeline by going back in time and ensuring that the Kherubim do not reach Earth.  This will keep the Daemonites from following the Kherubim to Earth, and will also eliminate the X-Men, which will take away the need to develop the Sentinels.  Using the time travel knowledge in Cable's mind, Jean psionically links herself, Cable, Emp, and Savant, and begins the process, but lacks the power needed to complete the task.  The bomb planted by Grifter and Wolverine detonates, providing the energy that Jean lacks, and the psionically merged foursome destroy a Kherubim ship on the verge of reaching Earth.  As the current timeline is erased, single panel scenes from each of the four stories are shown being destroyed.  In the last panels, a young girl resembling Savant and a man resembling Logan are shown walking together outside a mansion resembling the [[X-Mansion]].\n<!--The girl with \"Logan\" could also be said to resemble Kitty; it's hard to tell who she looks like, exactly, and I don't know of any notes from the author stating who she is supposed to be.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8{{nbsp}}million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Some of these facilities will have [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] capability for patients of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic]], while others will serve non-coronavirus patients to allow established hospitals to concentrate on the pandemic. A public briefing of the plan was given by Army General [[Todd T. Semonite|Todd Semonite]] on March 20, 2020.

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract was awarded Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing over $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8{{nbsp}}million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020. The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.
