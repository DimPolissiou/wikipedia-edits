Kosberg had spent ten years working at the ''Central Institute of Aircraft Engine Construction'' on [[fuel]] systems and was tapped to run the new bureau. Approaching German armies required the group to relocate to [[Berdsk]], [[Siberia]], where Kosberg and his team of about 30 specialists developed [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] fuel systems, eventually implemented on the [[Lavochkin La-5|La-5]], [[La-7]], [[Tupolev Tu-2]] and Tu-2D. The new fuel systems provided a significant increase in performance over conventional gasoline fuel systems and eliminated carburetor float problems caused by aggressive combat flying. They competed with direct injection systems developed by [[Daimler Benz]] at the time. After the end of the war, the design bureau was moved to Voronezh, where it continued to design fuel systems for piston, turboprop and jet aircraft.<ref name = \"BNL \">{{cite web| title = Semyon Ariyevich Kosberg| work = Belarus Newsletter| url = http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/newsletter/Kosberg.htm| accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref><ref name = \"SH\">{{cite web| title = \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447| work =| url = http://www.space.hobby.ru/kosberg.html| accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== KBKhA Rocket Engine Company Maturity Years ==\n\nSuccessful work results were a basis for the reformation of Plant 154 Design Bureau into the independent company OCB-154. The new enterprise was to develop rocket engines.\nThe works were performed in two directions: development of LREs for space launch vehicles (LV) and missiles.\nStart of works was marked by the meeting of S. Kosberg and S. Korolev on February 10, 1958. The result of this meeting was the joint development of oxygen-kerosene engine RD0105 for LV \u201cLuna\u201d LV stage (engine chief designer V. Koshelnikov). This engine allowed LV to reach second space velocity for the first time in the world, deliver USSR pennon to the Moon surface, make the round flight of the Moon and take pictures of Moon back side. Later on, one of the craters on its backside was named after S. Kosberg.\nKBKhA developed LRE RD0109 for \u201cVostok\u201d LV third stage (chief designer \u2013 V. Koshelnikov) on the basis of engine RD0105. The engine was more reliable and had higher technical specifications due to the creation of the new efficient lightweight combustion chamber. RD 0109 thrusts to orbit space ship Vostok with Y. Gagarin on board, all one-seat manned ships and different military and scientific spacecraft later. The development of space industry in the end of the 50th and beginning of 60th required the creation of more powerful LV for orbiting objects with mass up to 7000&nbsp;kg. To fulfill this purpose, the Design bureau \u2013 on the basis of second stage engine RD0106 of military rocker P-9A - developed engines RD0107, RD0108, and RD0110 (chief designer Y. Gershkovits) for third stages of S. Korolev LVs \u201cMolnia\u201d, \u201cVoshod\u201d, \u201cSoyuz\u201d that ensured launches of interplanetary stations to Mars and Venus, orbiting space ships with 2 and 3 cosmonauts on board. Members of these crews were the first human beings entering into open space, made orbit docking and joint flight of two ships, including American \u201cApollo\u201d. LV \u201cSoyuz\u201d is used to deliver payload to orbital stations.\nUsing highly reliable engine RD0110, over 1500 LV successful launches were performed. In the beginning of 1965, chief designer S. Kosberg died in a car accident. A. Konopatov was appointed as a lead designer of the Design Bureau.<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kbkha.ru/?p=4|title=\"\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0411\u044e\u0440\u043e \u0425\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438\" - \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f|work=kbkha.ru|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== New Projects \u2013 New Engines. Seventies of last century ===\nAnother milestone in the development of Russian space industry was the creation of powerful LV UR500 by General designer V. Chelomey. The LV was able to orbit heavy objects with weight up to 20 tons. For the second stage of LV \u201cProton\u201d KBKhA created LRE RD0208 and RD0209 (chief designer V. Kozelkov), operating according to oxidizer rich preburner staged combustion schematic. As a prototype, engine RD0206 was used, installed on military missile UR-200. This LV orbited heavy automated stations \u201cProton\u201d. LV UR500 was later named \u201cProton\u201d.\nThree-stage \u201cProton\u201d was a more powerful LV, for whose second stage engines RD0208 and RD0209 were modernized. The modernized engines got indexes RD0210 and RD0211 (chief designer V. Kozelkov). For the third stage engine, RD0212 was renewed (chief designer Y. Gershkovits). Besides, for the position correction of \u201cAlmaz\u201d space station, launched by \u201cProton\u201d, KBKhA created pressure fed engine RD0225 (chief designer V. Borodin) and multiple startup (up to 100 times), with orbit stand-by mode (up to 2 years). These LV delivered Lunar excursion modules to the Moon, interplanetary spacecrafts that took probes of lunar soil and landed on Mars and Venus. It became possible to launch long-stay orbital stations \u201cSalut\u201d and \u201cMir\u201d, as well as modules \u201cZarya\u201d and \u201cZvezda\u201d for International space station. For the moment, over 300 \u201cProton\u201d LV launches have been performed.\nTechnical perfection of engines RD0110, RD0210, RD0211, RD0212 ensured their long life. For over 40 years these engines have launched different spacecrafts, automated stations, and manned space ships. High energy-weight characteristics and operation simplicity support their position in the best of Russian and foreign engines of the same class.<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\"/>\n\n=== Created Nuclear-Rocket Umbrella ===\nOne of KBKhA priority directions was the completion of defense contracts \u2013 creation of LREs with high energy characteristics and reliability, with low production costs, without servicing during entire life. In 1957, using extensive experience acquired during the development of engines RD0100, RD0101, RD0102 for interceptors, the Design Bureau started the creation of engines for antiaircraft missiles (SAM) on self-ignited components. The first LRE RD0200 (chief designer A. Golubev) was developed for the second stage of S. Lavochkin 5\u041211 SAM. The engine was designed as open cycle engine with 1 : 10 throttle capability. The engine passed all types of tests and was serially manufactured\nLRE RD0201 (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) was designed for the third stage of P. Grushin B1100 SAM. The difference of the engine from RD0200 was four swivel combustion chambers due to which flight navigation was performed. In the end of the 50th, the question about the creation of a more powerful rocket R-9 arose, which was to replace rocket 8K72. In 1959-1962 the Design Bureau developed oxygen-kerosene engine RD0106 for LV second stage (block B) (chief designer \u2013 Y. Gershkovitz).\nHigh energy characteristics, optimum mounting, relatively small height, simple operation, development time (on ground and flight) were the basis for the development of a variety of engines for Korolev's space rockets, including RD0110 for the third stage (block \u0418) of Soyuz LV. In the beginning of the 60th, long-term and prolific cooperation of KBKhA and Chelomey Design Bureau started, for whose LVs our design bureau developed about 20 LREs.\nThe creation of powerful LVs during these years required considerable increase of energy characteristics and operational features of LREs. And KBKhA was among the first to start the development of such LREs. In 1961-1964 RD0203 and RD0204 LREs (chief designer V. Kozelkov) for the first stage of rocket UR200 and RD0206 and RD0207 LREs (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) for the second stage of the same rocket were developed.\nThese new engines were of advanced design, operate on storable fuel components and for the first time staged combustion cycle was used. The application of such schematic allowed double combustion chamber pressure (up to 150&nbsp;kg/cm2 as compared to 70&nbsp;kg/cm2 for open cycle engines) and excluded Isp losses for TPA turbine drive.\nPowerful and highly economical engines created in short time, went through ground development and flight tests. The engines were a basis for the creation of new LREs. In 1963, Chelomei Design Bureau started the creation of the new rocket RS-10 for first stage KBKhA developed engines RD0216 and RD0217 were used in 1963-1966 (chief designer V. Koshelnikov). Higher technical and operational requirements to LV defined the necessity of high engine efficiency and reliability, protection of its inner cavities from the environment, etc. All these requirements were fulfilled and confirmed by ground and flight development testing as rocket component.\nThe experience acquired was the basis for development of new generation engines with higher combustion chamber pressures. First engines of this type were RD0233 and RD0234 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer V. Ezhov), created in 1969-1974 for RS-18 rocket first stage.\nFurther on, two engines were developed: staged combustion RD0235, and open cycle steering engine RD0236 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer Y. Garmanov) for RS-18 rocket second stage. Engine RD0235 was developed on the basis of RD0216 engine but it is more reliable due to better design and technology possibilities\nThe experience of LRE development was the basis for the engagement of KBKhA in 1967 in the development of engine RD0208 (lead designer Y. Gershkovich) for the second stage of rocket RS-20, designed by general designer M. Yangel. The engine was developed on the basis of a third stage engine RD0212, used in \u201cProton\u201d, but it was more powerful and was differently applied within the stage.<br />\nThe First Nuclear Rocket Engine\nIn 1965 KBKhA was involved into project of the development of nuclear rocket engines RD0410 and RD0411 (chief designer G. Chursin, lead designers \u2013 L. Nikitin, M. Biryukov, A. Belogurov, Y. Mamontov). The engines were specified for the acceleration and deceleration of spacecrafts and orbit correction for deep space explorations. Due to operating fluid high thermodynamic properties and high heating temperatures in the nuclear reactor, (up to 3 000 K), the engine possesses high efficiency (vacuum Isp 910&nbsp;kg s/kg). For time and costs saving, the nuclear reactor and \u201ccold\u201d engine (feed system, regulation and control components) were developed in parallel. The nuclear reactor is designed according to heterogeneous schematic \u2013 its design utilizes block-mounting principle, which allowed to develop uranium-containing (fuel cell) assemblies and reactor separately. The results of the development of RD-0410 nuclear rocket engine were used for development of main turbopump of RD-0120 engine and were the basis for development of multimode space nuclear power plants.\n\n=== First Gas-Dynamic Laser ===\n\nIn early 70s KBKhA began development of continuous high power, gas-dynamic of CO2-lasers (GDL), operating on the transformation of the heat energy of active gaseous medium, obtained with non-equilibrium expansion in supersonic nozzle grid, into electromagnetic radiation. The family of GDL samples was created with radiation energy from 10 to 600&nbsp;kW and space on-board GDL RD0600 working on gaseous propellant (the leading designers \u2014 V.P. Koshelnikov, G.I. Zavision, V.Y. Guterman).\n<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\"/>\n\n==Liquid propellant rocket engines==\n\nBy 1954 the bureau was designing [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engines for super performance and experimental aircraft, the [[Yakovlev Yak-25|Yak-27V]] and [[E-50A]], and from 1957 to 1962 they designed engines for anti-aircraft guided missiles. By the early 1960s the bureau was designing Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines (LPREs) for man-rated space launch vehicles.\n\nOver several decades, the CADB became one of the Soviet Union's premier developers of LPREs, designing engines for the [[UR-100|SS-11]], [[SS-18]] and [[SS-19]] and  ballistic missiles, among others. In one unique design, the engine is submerged in the [[UDMH]] propellant tank to save space ([[R-29RM Shtil|SS-N-23]] submarine-launched ballistic missile). They also designed upper stage engines for the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] and [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] space launch vehicles, along with the core engines for the [[Energia]]. The large volume of design work and continuous refinement led to a high degree of technical capability. During this same period in the United States (late 1960s - early 1970s), liquid engines on missiles were dropped in favor of solids, and the only LPRE being developed was the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]. The Kosberg design bureau parlayed their experience into the [[RD-0120]] - the Soviet's first cryogenic engine with over 40 tonnes thrust. Despite designing mostly LOX/Kerosene or N2O4/UDMH engines, the LOX/LH2 RD-0120 had similar ratings and performance as the SSME, but with a lower cost due to the choice of technology.<ref name=\"RD-0120_EA\">{{cite web| title = RD-0120| work = Encyclopedia Astronautica| url = http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0120.htm| accessdate = 2007-11-18| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071203201403/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0120.htm| archivedate = 2007-12-03| df = }}</ref>\n\nCADB is currently offering the RD-0146 to the international market as an alternative to the [[RL-10]].<ref name = \"PW\">{{cite web| title = RD-0146| work = Pratt and Whitney| url = http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextrefresh=1&vgnextoid=e3b90030296eb010VgnVCM1000000881000aRCRD\n| accessdate=2007-11-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> With a reduction in the market for LPRE's, the company has expanded into related fields, designing products for oil and gas, agricultural and medical industries.\n\n==Notable engine designs==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Koselkov and V. Gorokhov, the lead designers \u2014 V. Borodin, A. Plis and V. Gurin) for the third stage of the general designer D. Koslov \"Sojuz-2\" launch vehicle has been conducted. The main engine destination \u2014 delivery into the orbit of different payloads: satellites, cargo and manned space vehicles. RD-0124 engine is developed as substitution for RD-0110. It has the practically identical interfaces, overall dimensions and mass, but it offers the higher specific parameters \u2014 the best of the developed LRE of this class. The engine operates according to oxidizer rich stage combustion cycle and has higher (on 33 s) efficiency compared to RD-0110. This will allow to put into orbit larger payloads (~ 950&nbsp;kg) or to ensure launching of \"Sojuz-2\" launch vehicle from spaceports located to the north of Baikonur. The conducted series of successful stand tests has confirmed the fulfillment of the specification requirements for main parameters. Two test-bench fire tests within LV \u201cSoyuz-2\u201d 3rd stage were performed that completed the 1st phase of on-ground engine development.\nDecember 27, 2006, first flight test of the engine within LV \u201cSoyuz-2b\u201d was performed. In 1998 KBKhA has studied and determined the possibility of using the RD-0124 (the RD-0124A) for the second stage of space rocket complex \"Angara\", created by Khrunichev Design and Research center and aimed for orbiting multiple purpose space vehicles. The main differences from the requirements to base engine are the change of engine operating time of the main and final thrust stage.\nOn December 1, 2007, 150 fire tests were performed, with overall development time over 30,000 seconds, which confirmed the compliance of main parameters with Technical Task requirements.\nRD-0750\nIn 1993-1998 large volume of design, analysis, research and experimental works on development of three-propellant dual-mode engine on the base of RD-0120 have been conducted as a KBKhA initiative. The propellants of the engine are: liquid hydrogen, kerosene, and liquid oxygen.\nStudies and recommendations of the leading Russian [[R&D]] Institutes and foreign firms shown an economic feasibility of application of dual-mode three-propellant engines to advanced launch vehicles (especially single-staged) have become the real support for three-propellant engine works performance. The engine according to the first mode operates on oxygen and kerosene with the small addition of hydrogen and at the second operational mode - with oxygen and hydrogen.\nAs a result of this work, for the first time, in practice of LRE development, three-propellant dual-mode preburner (the lead designers \u2013 Y.A. Martynenko, V.A. Turtushov) successfully tested in KBKhA and in RD0750D demonstrator conditions at NIICHIMMASH.\n\n===RD-0146===\nIn 1997 KBKhA according to the Khrunichev Space Center Technical Specification has begun the development of the new oxygen-hydrogen engine RD-0146 (the chief designer \u2014 N.E. Titkov, the lead designer \u2014 I.V. Liplavy) for space boosters of advanced launchers options \u00ab[[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]]\u00bb and \u00ab[[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]]\u00bb. For the first time in Russia the expander cycle engine has been developed with insurance of multiple in-flight starts. Since 2001, 4 engines were manufactured, independent tests of engine subassemblies and chamber with igniter were performed at modes higher than nominal. Altogether 30 fire tests at mode up to 109.5% and with overall operational time 1680 seconds were completed. The development time per each engine was 1604 seconds in 27 tests.\n\n===RD-0126, RD-0126\u042d===\nIn 1995 the research work for development expander kerosene-hydrogen LREs for advanced space boost units and interorbital tows has been initiated. It has defined the engine configuration and performances. This work was completed by issue of technical proposal. On the basis of this work RKK \u00abEnergia\u00bb has issued specification for RD-0126 engine development that was presented in two variants:\nEngine RD0126 - with a traditional Laval nozzle chamber, and RD0126\u042d with an expansion-deflection nozzle and ring throat (chief designer V. Grokhov, lead designer \u2013 I. Liplyavy).\nEngine RD0126\u042d has the following advantages as compared to traditional LREs:\nequal length, but higher vacuum Isp;\nlighter weight with the same Isp;\npossibility to obtain higher hydrogen temperature in cooling channels, which allows to use it as working medium for TPA turbine rotation;\npossibility of engine ground testing performed under high-altitude conditions without gas-dynamic tube.\n \nIn 1998, test bench chamber with ring throat was tested. 5 sea level fire tests were performed that confirmed combustion products flow without boundary layer separation within high-altitude nozzle, which makes engine development considerably simpler. The calculated performance data complied with the design figures. Steady state operation process was stable; hardware is in satisfactory operable condition.\n\n===GPVRD 58L===\nSince 1994 according [[Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development]] specification KBKhA has been developed experimental axial symmetrical [[scramjet]] 58L (the lead designers \u2014 Y.V. Liplavy, Y.A. Martynenko), for studying of processes of hydrogen combustion at stream velocities 3-6.5 M and altitudes of 20\u201335&nbsp;km flight conditions. The liquid hydrogen is an engine fuel passing CC cooling channels and being introduced into the combustion zones. The combustion chamber is an annular and three-zone design. In the first zone the hydrogen combustion takes place in subsonic airflow, in two others \u2014 in supersonic flow. The combustion chamber is completely designed and manufactured in KBKhA, and the new and advanced design and technological solutions have been realized. In 1998 the flight tests of scramjet on board Kholod laboratory have been successfully conducted. The engine operation started at flight velocity 3 M, at the end of the flight on 77 s the vehicle velocity reached 6.47 M. For the first time in the world hydrogen combustion has taken place under supersonic flow conditions. Engine has operated according to the test program and without remarks under testing program.<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\"/>\n\n==Magnetoplasmadynamic engine==\nIn 2013 the Chemical Automatics Design Bureau successfully conducted a test bench [[Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster|magnetoplasmadynamic engine]] for long-distance space travel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sdelanounas.ru/blogs/44948|title=\"\u0412 \u0412\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0437\u0434\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c \u0434\u043b\u044f \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0430\" \u0432 \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435 \"\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u043a\u0438, \u041d\u0418\u041e\u041a\u0420\u044b, \u0438\u0437\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f\" -  \u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441|work=\u0421\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0441|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref> Magnetoplasmadynamic engine without flaws [[Ion thruster|ion engines]].\n\n== [[Ion thruster]] ==\nAt the test facility Chemical Automation Design Bureau has successfully completed a series of initial tests of the high ion electric propulsion.

Kosberg had spent ten years working at the ''Central Institute of Aircraft Engine Construction'' on [[fuel]] systems and was tapped to run the new bureau. Approaching German armies required the group to relocate to [[Berdsk]], [[Siberia]], where Kosberg and his team of about 30 specialists developed [[Gasoline direct injection|direct injection]] fuel systems, eventually implemented on the [[La-5]], [[La-7]], [[Tupolev Tu-2]] and Tu-2D. The new fuel systems provided a significant increase in performance over conventional gasoline fuel systems and eliminated carburetor float problems caused by aggressive combat flying. They competed with direct injection systems developed by [[Daimler Benz]] at the time. After the end of the war, the design bureau was moved to Voronezh, where it continued to design fuel systems for piston, turboprop and jet aircraft.<ref name = \"BNL \">{{cite web| title = Semyon Ariyevich Kosberg| work = Belarus Newsletter| url = http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/newsletter/Kosberg.htm| accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref><ref name = \"SH\">{{cite web| title = \u041a\u043e\u0441\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0433 \u0421\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d \u0410\u0440\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447| work =| url = http://www.space.hobby.ru/kosberg.html| accessdate=2007-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== KBKhA Rocket Engine Company Maturity Years ==\n\nSuccessful work results were a basis for the reformation of Plant 154 Design Bureau into the independent company OCB-154. The new enterprise was to develop rocket engines.\nThe works were performed in two directions: development of LREs for space launch vehicles (LV) and missiles.\nStart of works was marked by the meeting of S. Kosberg and S. Korolev on February 10, 1958. The result of this meeting was the joint development of oxygen-kerosene engine RD0105 for LV \u201cLuna\u201d LV stage (engine chief designer V. Koshelnikov). This engine allowed LV to reach second space velocity for the first time in the world, deliver USSR pennon to the Moon surface, make the round flight of the Moon and take pictures of Moon back side. Later on, one of the craters on its backside was named after S. Kosberg.\nKBKhA developed LRE RD0109 for \u201cVostok\u201d LV third stage (chief designer \u2013 V. Koshelnikov) on the basis of engine RD0105. The engine was more reliable and had higher technical specifications due to the creation of the new efficient lightweight combustion chamber. RD 0109 thrusts to orbit space ship Vostok with Y. Gagarin on board, all one-seat manned ships and different military and scientific spacecraft later. The development of space industry in the end of the 50th and beginning of 60th required the creation of more powerful LV for orbiting objects with mass up to 7000&nbsp;kg. To fulfill this purpose, the Design bureau \u2013 on the basis of second stage engine RD0106 of military rocker P-9A - developed engines RD0107, RD0108, and RD0110 (chief designer Y. Gershkovits) for third stages of S. Korolev LVs \u201cMolnia\u201d, \u201cVoshod\u201d, \u201cSoyuz\u201d that ensured launches of interplanetary stations to Mars and Venus, orbiting space ships with 2 and 3 cosmonauts on board. Members of these crews were the first human beings entering into open space, made orbit docking and joint flight of two ships, including American \u201cApollo\u201d. LV \u201cSoyuz\u201d is used to deliver payload to orbital stations.\nUsing highly reliable engine RD0110, over 1500 LV successful launches were performed. In the beginning of 1965, chief designer S. Kosberg died in a car accident. A. Konopatov was appointed as a lead designer of the Design Bureau.<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kbkha.ru/?p=4|title=\"\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0443\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0411\u044e\u0440\u043e \u0425\u0438\u043c\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438\" - \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f|work=kbkha.ru|accessdate=3 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== New Projects \u2013 New Engines. Seventies of last century ===\nAnother milestone in the development of Russian space industry was the creation of powerful LV UR500 by General designer V. Chelomey. The LV was able to orbit heavy objects with weight up to 20 tons. For the second stage of LV \u201cProton\u201d KBKhA created LRE RD0208 and RD0209 (chief designer V. Kozelkov), operating according to oxidizer rich preburner staged combustion schematic. As a prototype, engine RD0206 was used, installed on military missile UR-200. This LV orbited heavy automated stations \u201cProton\u201d. LV UR500 was later named \u201cProton\u201d.\nThree-stage \u201cProton\u201d was a more powerful LV, for whose second stage engines RD0208 and RD0209 were modernized. The modernized engines got indexes RD0210 and RD0211 (chief designer V. Kozelkov). For the third stage engine, RD0212 was renewed (chief designer Y. Gershkovits). Besides, for the position correction of \u201cAlmaz\u201d space station, launched by \u201cProton\u201d, KBKhA created pressure fed engine RD0225 (chief designer V. Borodin) and multiple startup (up to 100 times), with orbit stand-by mode (up to 2 years). These LV delivered Lunar excursion modules to the Moon, interplanetary spacecrafts that took probes of lunar soil and landed on Mars and Venus. It became possible to launch long-stay orbital stations \u201cSalut\u201d and \u201cMir\u201d, as well as modules \u201cZarya\u201d and \u201cZvezda\u201d for International space station. For the moment, over 300 \u201cProton\u201d LV launches have been performed.\nTechnical perfection of engines RD0110, RD0210, RD0211, RD0212 ensured their long life. For over 40 years these engines have launched different spacecrafts, automated stations, and manned space ships. High energy-weight characteristics and operation simplicity support their position in the best of Russian and foreign engines of the same class.<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\"/>\n\n=== Created Nuclear-Rocket Umbrella ===\nOne of KBKhA priority directions was the completion of defense contracts \u2013 creation of LREs with high energy characteristics and reliability, with low production costs, without servicing during entire life. In 1957, using extensive experience acquired during the development of engines RD0100, RD0101, RD0102 for interceptors, the Design Bureau started the creation of engines for antiaircraft missiles (SAM) on self-ignited components. The first LRE RD0200 (chief designer A. Golubev) was developed for the second stage of S. Lavochkin 5\u041211 SAM. The engine was designed as open cycle engine with 1 : 10 throttle capability. The engine passed all types of tests and was serially manufactured\nLRE RD0201 (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) was designed for the third stage of P. Grushin B1100 SAM. The difference of the engine from RD0200 was four swivel combustion chambers due to which flight navigation was performed. In the end of the 50th, the question about the creation of a more powerful rocket R-9 arose, which was to replace rocket 8K72. In 1959-1962 the Design Bureau developed oxygen-kerosene engine RD0106 for LV second stage (block B) (chief designer \u2013 Y. Gershkovitz).\nHigh energy characteristics, optimum mounting, relatively small height, simple operation, development time (on ground and flight) were the basis for the development of a variety of engines for Korolev's space rockets, including RD0110 for the third stage (block \u0418) of Soyuz LV. In the beginning of the 60th, long-term and prolific cooperation of KBKhA and Chelomey Design Bureau started, for whose LVs our design bureau developed about 20 LREs.\nThe creation of powerful LVs during these years required considerable increase of energy characteristics and operational features of LREs. And KBKhA was among the first to start the development of such LREs. In 1961-1964 RD0203 and RD0204 LREs (chief designer V. Kozelkov) for the first stage of rocket UR200 and RD0206 and RD0207 LREs (chief designer L. Pozdnyakov) for the second stage of the same rocket were developed.\nThese new engines were of advanced design, operate on storable fuel components and for the first time staged combustion cycle was used. The application of such schematic allowed double combustion chamber pressure (up to 150&nbsp;kg/cm2 as compared to 70&nbsp;kg/cm2 for open cycle engines) and excluded Isp losses for TPA turbine drive.\nPowerful and highly economical engines created in short time, went through ground development and flight tests. The engines were a basis for the creation of new LREs. In 1963, Chelomei Design Bureau started the creation of the new rocket RS-10 for first stage KBKhA developed engines RD0216 and RD0217 were used in 1963-1966 (chief designer V. Koshelnikov). Higher technical and operational requirements to LV defined the necessity of high engine efficiency and reliability, protection of its inner cavities from the environment, etc. All these requirements were fulfilled and confirmed by ground and flight development testing as rocket component.\nThe experience acquired was the basis for development of new generation engines with higher combustion chamber pressures. First engines of this type were RD0233 and RD0234 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer V. Ezhov), created in 1969-1974 for RS-18 rocket first stage.\nFurther on, two engines were developed: staged combustion RD0235, and open cycle steering engine RD0236 (chief designer V. Kozelkov, lead designer Y. Garmanov) for RS-18 rocket second stage. Engine RD0235 was developed on the basis of RD0216 engine but it is more reliable due to better design and technology possibilities\nThe experience of LRE development was the basis for the engagement of KBKhA in 1967 in the development of engine RD0208 (lead designer Y. Gershkovich) for the second stage of rocket RS-20, designed by general designer M. Yangel. The engine was developed on the basis of a third stage engine RD0212, used in \u201cProton\u201d, but it was more powerful and was differently applied within the stage.<br />\nThe First Nuclear Rocket Engine\nIn 1965 KBKhA was involved into project of the development of nuclear rocket engines RD0410 and RD0411 (chief designer G. Chursin, lead designers \u2013 L. Nikitin, M. Biryukov, A. Belogurov, Y. Mamontov). The engines were specified for the acceleration and deceleration of spacecrafts and orbit correction for deep space explorations. Due to operating fluid high thermodynamic properties and high heating temperatures in the nuclear reactor, (up to 3 000 K), the engine possesses high efficiency (vacuum Isp 910&nbsp;kg s/kg). For time and costs saving, the nuclear reactor and \u201ccold\u201d engine (feed system, regulation and control components) were developed in parallel. The nuclear reactor is designed according to heterogeneous schematic \u2013 its design utilizes block-mounting principle, which allowed to develop uranium-containing (fuel cell) assemblies and reactor separately. The results of the development of RD-0410 nuclear rocket engine were used for development of main turbopump of RD-0120 engine and were the basis for development of multimode space nuclear power plants.\n\n=== First Gas-Dynamic Laser ===\n\nIn early 70s KBKhA began development of continuous high power, gas-dynamic of CO2-lasers (GDL), operating on the transformation of the heat energy of active gaseous medium, obtained with non-equilibrium expansion in supersonic nozzle grid, into electromagnetic radiation. The family of GDL samples was created with radiation energy from 10 to 600&nbsp;kW and space on-board GDL RD0600 working on gaseous propellant (the leading designers \u2014 V.P. Koshelnikov, G.I. Zavision, V.Y. Guterman).\n<ref name=\"kbkha.ru\"/>\n\n==Liquid propellant rocket engines==\n\nBy 1954 the bureau was designing [[liquid-propellant rocket]] engines for super performance and experimental aircraft, the [[Yakovlev Yak-25|Yak-27V]] and [[E-50A]], and from 1957 to 1962 they designed engines for anti-aircraft guided missiles. By the early 1960s the bureau was designing Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines (LPREs) for man-rated space launch vehicles.\n\nOver several decades, the CADB became one of the Soviet Union's premier developers of LPREs, designing engines for the [[UR-100|SS-11]], [[SS-18]] and [[SS-19]] and  ballistic missiles, among others. In one unique design, the engine is submerged in the [[UDMH]] propellant tank to save space ([[R-29RM Shtil|SS-N-23]] submarine-launched ballistic missile). They also designed upper stage engines for the [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz]] and [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] space launch vehicles, along with the core engines for the [[Energia]]. The large volume of design work and continuous refinement led to a high degree of technical capability. During this same period in the United States (late 1960s - early 1970s), liquid engines on missiles were dropped in favor of solids, and the only LPRE being developed was the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]. The Kosberg design bureau parlayed their experience into the [[RD-0120]] - the Soviet's first cryogenic engine with over 40 tonnes thrust. Despite designing mostly LOX/Kerosene or N2O4/UDMH engines, the LOX/LH2 RD-0120 had similar ratings and performance as the SSME, but with a lower cost due to the choice of technology.<ref name=\"RD-0120_EA\">{{cite web| title = RD-0120| work = Encyclopedia Astronautica| url = http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0120.htm| accessdate = 2007-11-18| url-status=dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071203201403/http://www.astronautix.com/engines/rd0120.htm| archivedate = 2007-12-03| df = }}</ref>\n\nCADB is currently offering the RD-0146 to the international market as an alternative to the [[RL-10]].<ref name = \"PW\">{{cite web| title = RD-0146| work = Pratt and Whitney| url = http://www.pw.utc.com/vgn-ext-templating/v/index.jsp?vgnextrefresh=1&vgnextoid=e3b90030296eb010VgnVCM1000000881000aRCRD\n| accessdate=2007-11-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> With a reduction in the market for LPRE's, the company has expanded into related fields, designing products for oil and gas, agricultural and medical industries.\n\n==Notable engine designs==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Koselkov and V. Gorokhov, the lead designers \u2014 V. Borodin, A. Plis and V. Gurin) for the third stage of the general designer D. Koslov \"Sojuz-2\" launch vehicle has been conducted. The main engine destination \u2014 delivery into the orbit of different payloads: satellites, cargo and manned space vehicles. RD-0124 engine is developed as substitution for RD-0110. It has the practically identical interfaces, overall dimensions and mass, but it offers the higher specific parameters \u2014 the best of the developed LRE of this class. The engine operates according to oxidizer rich stage combustion cycle and has higher (on 33 s) efficiency compared to RD-0110. This will allow to put into orbit larger payloads (~ 950&nbsp;kg) or to ensure launching of \"Sojuz-2\" launch vehicle from spaceports located to the north of Baikonur. The conducted series of successful stand tests has confirmed the fulfillment of the specification requirements for main parameters. Two test-bench fire tests within LV \u201cSoyuz-2\u201d 3rd stage were performed that completed the 1st phase of on-ground engine development.\nDecember 27, 2006, first flight test of the engine within LV \u201cSoyuz-2b\u201d was performed. In 1998 KBKhA has studied and determined the possibility of using the RD-0124 (the RD-0124A) for the second stage of space rocket complex \"Angara\", created by Khrunichev Design and Research center and aimed for orbiting multiple purpose space vehicles. The main differences from the requirements to base engine are the change of engine operating time of the main and final thrust stage.\nOn December 1, 2007, 150 fire tests were performed, with overall development time over 30,000 seconds, which confirmed the compliance of main parameters with Technical Task requirements.\nRD-0750\nIn 1993-1998 large volume of design, analysis, research and experimental works on development of three-propellant dual-mode engine on the base of RD-0120 have been conducted as a KBKhA initiative. The propellants of the engine are: liquid hydrogen, kerosene, and liquid oxygen.\nStudies and recommendations of the leading Russian [[R&D]] Institutes and foreign firms shown an economic feasibility of application of dual-mode three-propellant engines to advanced launch vehicles (especially single-staged) have become the real support for three-propellant engine works performance. The engine according to the first mode operates on oxygen and kerosene with the small addition of hydrogen and at the second operational mode - with oxygen and hydrogen.\nAs a result of this work, for the first time, in practice of LRE development, three-propellant dual-mode preburner (the lead designers \u2013 Y.A. Martynenko, V.A. Turtushov) successfully tested in KBKhA and in RD0750D demonstrator conditions at NIICHIMMASH.\n\n===RD-0146===\nIn 1997 KBKhA according to the Khrunichev Space Center Technical Specification has begun the development of the new oxygen-hydrogen engine RD-0146 (the chief designer \u2014 N.E. Titkov, the lead designer \u2014 I.V. Liplavy) for space boosters of advanced launchers options \u00ab[[Proton (rocket family)|Proton]]\u00bb and \u00ab[[Angara (rocket family)|Angara]]\u00bb. For the first time in Russia the expander cycle engine has been developed with insurance of multiple in-flight starts. Since 2001, 4 engines were manufactured, independent tests of engine subassemblies and chamber with igniter were performed at modes higher than nominal. Altogether 30 fire tests at mode up to 109.5% and with overall operational time 1680 seconds were completed. The development time per each engine was 1604 seconds in 27 tests.\n\n===RD-0126, RD-0126\u042d===\nIn 1995 the research work for development expander kerosene-hydrogen LREs for advanced space boost units and interorbital tows has been initiated. It has defined the engine configuration and performances. This work was completed by issue of technical proposal. On the basis of this work RKK \u00abEnergia\u00bb has issued specification for RD-0126 engine development that was presented in two variants:\nEngine RD0126 - with a traditional Laval nozzle chamber, and RD0126\u042d with an expansion-deflection nozzle and ring throat (chief designer V. Grokhov, lead designer \u2013 I. Liplyavy).\nEngine RD0126\u042d has the following advantages as compared to traditional LREs:\nequal length, but higher vacuum Isp;\nlighter weight with the same Isp;\npossibility to obtain higher hydrogen temperature in cooling channels, which allows to use it as working medium for TPA turbine rotation;\npossibility of engine ground testing performed under high-altitude conditions without gas-dynamic tube.\n \nIn 1998, test bench chamber with ring throat was tested. 5 sea level fire tests were performed that confirmed combustion products flow without boundary layer separation within high-altitude nozzle, which makes engine development considerably simpler. The calculated performance data complied with the design figures. Steady state operation process was stable; hardware is in satisfactory operable condition.\n\n===GPVRD 58L===\nSince 1994 according [[Baranov Central Institute of Aviation Motor Development]] specification KBKhA has been developed experimental axial symmetrical [[scramjet]] 58L (the lead designers \u2014 Y.V. Liplavy, Y.A. Martynenko), for studying of processes of hydrogen combustion at stream velocities 3-6.5 M and altitudes of 20\u201335&nbsp;km flight conditions. The liquid hydrogen is an engine fuel passing CC cooling channels and being introduced into the combustion zones. The combustion chamber is an annular and three-zone design. In the first zone the hydrogen combustion takes place in subsonic airflow, in two others \u2014 in supersonic flow. The combustion chamber is completely designed and manufactured in KBKhA, and the new and advanced design and technological solutions have been realized. In 1998 the flight tests of scramjet on board Kholod laboratory have been successfully conducted.

A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s.

In the late 1940s and the 1950s, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] led a witch hunt against communists called [[McCarthyism]], where people were accused of being communists.\n\n=== 1920s\u2013present: \"The Devil's music\" ===\n''This section of this page is in need of updating.''\n\nOver the years, there has been concern of various types of new music, often called \"the devil's music\", causing spiritual or otherwise moral corruption to younger generations. While the types of music mainly labeled \"the devil's music\" has changed, along with the nature of the accusations, this basic factor of the moral panic has remained constant. While most notable in the United States, other countries such as [[Romania]]<ref>http://fto.ro/altarul-reintregirii/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2016_3_18.-Nechita-307-323.pdf</ref> have seen exposure to or promotion of the idea as well.\n\n[[Blues]] was one of the first music genres to receive this label, mainly due to a perception that it incited violence and other poor behavior.<ref>SFGate</ref> In the early 20th century, the blues was considered disreputable, especially as white audiences began listening to the blues during the 1920s.\n\n[[Jazz]] was another early receiver of the label. At the time, traditionalists considered jazz to contribute to the breakdown of morality.<ref>Paula S. Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of popular music contributing to a growth in [[Theistic Satanism]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics do not make a distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated with satanism in particular, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backwards messages in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, most often by hiding \"backwards messages\" in a song, culminating in satanic backmasking becoming a plot point of [[The Exorcist]]. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to previous definitions of \"devil music\".\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy.

In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagined moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=993\u20131012 |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}</ref> Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.<ref name=cohen/>{{rp|xxvi\u2013xxxi}}\n\nWriting in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |journal=Social & Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

A clear division forms between [[In-group and out-group|\"them\" and \"us\"]].\n* Consensus \u2013 Though concern does not have to be nationwide, there must be widespread acceptance that the group in question poses a very real threat to society. It is important at this stage that the \"moral entrepreneurs\" are vocal and the \"folk devils\" appear weak and disorganized.\n* Disproportionality \u2013 The action taken is disproportionate to the actual threat posed by the accused group.\n* Volatility \u2013 Moral panics are highly volatile and tend to disappear as quickly as they appeared because public interest wanes or news reports change to another narrative.<ref name = Jones/>\n\nWriting about the [[Blue Whale Challenge]] and the [[Momo Challenge]] as examples of moral panics, Benjamin Radford listed themes he commonly observed in modern versions of these phenomena:\n*Hidden dangers of modern technology.\n*Evil stranger manipulating the innocent.\n*A \u201chidden world\u201d of anonymous evil people.<ref name=BR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|title=The 'Momo Challenge' and the 'Blue Whale Game': Online Suicide Game Conspiracies|last=Radford|first=Benjamin|date=27 February 2019|website=Skeptical Inquirer|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228170347/https://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/the_momo_challenge_and_the_blue_whale_game_online_suicide_game_conspiracies|archive-date=28 February 2019|url-status=live|access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\n<!-- Note: Please do not make NEW ADDITIONS to this section unless you have a reference that cites the incident or phenomenon as an EXAMPLE OF A MORAL PANIC. -->\n=== 1840s-1860s: Nativist movement and the Know-Nothing Party ===\n{{Main|Nativism (politics)|The Know-Nothing Party}}\nThis example reflects the fear of immigrants which emerged in the United States  during the 1840s and 1850s.

Fass, ''The Damned and the Beautiful: American Youth in the 1920s'' (1977), p. 22.</ref> Despite the veiled attacks on Blues and Jazz as \"negro music\" often going hand-in-hand with other attacks on the genres, urban middle-class African Americans perceived jazz as \"devil's music\", and agreed with the beliefs that Jazz's improvised rhythms and sounds were promoting promiscuity.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dinerstein|first=Joel|title=Music, Memory, and Cultural Identity in the Jazz Age|journal=American Quarterly|volume=55|issue=2|year=2003|pages=303\u2013313|doi=10.1353/aq.2003.0012}}</ref> At this stage, the idea of popular music contributing to a growth in [[Theistic Satanism]] was not a major component in the accusations of blues, jazz, or other genres of music. ([[LaVeyan Satanism]] would not be created until the mid-to-late 60's, and \"devil's music\" moral panics do not make a distinction.)\n\nOne of the most cited types of evidence today is [[Backmasking]], which was used to popularize the idea of music being directly associated with satanism in particular, rather than generalized moral depravity. The idea of backmasking began to enter the public discussion with the [[Paul is Dead]] rumor, which popularized the idea that messages recorded backwards in music contained messages by or about the artist, the focus of the topic would change in the 1970s: then, religious leaders in the United States began to claim that backwards messages in music of the time, particularly [[Rock music]], glorified and promoted Satanism through ways that could be accepted subconsciously, most often by hiding \"backwards messages\" in a song, culminating in satanic backmasking becoming a plot point of [[The Exorcist]]. This eventually lead to the proposal in 1983 of bills in California and Arkansas. Some have speculated that this and other moral panics, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, contributed to the popularity of the [[satanic ritual abuse]] moral panic.<ref>https://www.vox.com/2016/10/30/13413864/satanic-panic-ritual-abuse-history-explained</ref>\n\nSince the mid-to-late 1980s, the term has been closely associated with [[heavy metal music]] through falsifiable concepts like backmasking, as well as content of some major acts in the genre. However, there are a number of people who still subscribe to previous definitions of \"devil music\".\n\n=== 1950s: Switchblades ===\n\n{{Main|Switchblade}}\n\nIn the United States, a 1950 article titled \"The Toy That Kills\" in the ''Women's Home Companion'',<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Pollack, Jack H., ''The Toy That Kills'', 77 Women's Home Companion Magazine 38, November 1950</ref> about automatic knives, or \"switchblades\", sparked significant controversy.

In his analysis of [[Donald Trump]]'s 2016 electoral victory, Joosse reimagined moral panic in [[Max Weber|Weberian]] terms, showing how charismatic moral entrepreneurs can at once deride folk devils in the traditional sense while avoiding the conservative moral recapitulation that classic moral panic theory predicts.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bjc/azx047 |title=Expanding Moral Panic Theory to Include the Agency of Charismatic Entrepreneurs |journal=British Journal of Criminology |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=993\u20131012 |last1=Joosse |first1=Paul |year=2017}}</ref> Another criticism is that of disproportionality: there is no way to measure what a proportionate reaction should be to a specific action.<ref name=cohen/>{{rp|xxvi\u2013xxxi}}\n\nWriting in 1995 about the moral panic that arose in the UK after a series of murders by juveniles, chiefly that of two-year-old [[Murder of James Bulger|James Bulger]] by two ten-year-old boys but also including that of 70-year-old [[Murder of Edna Phillips|Edna Phillips]] by two 17-year-old girls, the sociologist [[Colin Hay (political scientist)|Colin Hay]] pointed out that the folk devil was ambiguous in such cases; the child perpetrators would normally be thought of as innocent.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Colin |last=Hay |authorlink=Colin Hay (political scientist) |title=Mobilization Through Interpellation: James Bulger, Juvenile Crime and the Construction of a Moral Panic |journal=Social & Legal Studies |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=197\u2013223 |year=1995 |doi=10.1177/096466399500400203 }} Cited in {{cite book |first=Alan |last=Hunt |contribution=Fractious Rivals?

The public are not sufficiently gullible to keep accepting the latter and consequently allow themselves to be manipulated by the media and the government.<ref name=\"Jewkes1\"/>\n\nAnother British criminologist, Steve Hall, goes a step further to suggest that the term 'moral panic' is a fundamental category error. Hall argues that although some crimes are sensationalized by the media, in the general structure of the crime/control narrative the ability of the existing state and criminal justice system to protect the public is also overstated. Public concern is whipped up only for the purpose of being soothed, which produces not panic but the opposite, comfort and complacency.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hall |first=S. |year=2012 |title=Theorizing Crime and Deviance: A New Perspective |location=London |publisher=Sage |pages=132\u2013139 |isbn=9781848606722 |url=https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/theorizing-crime-and-deviance/book233792#description}}</ref>\n\nEchoing another point Hall makes, the sociologists Thompson and Williams argue that the concept of 'moral panic' is not a rational response to the phenomenon of social reaction, but itself a product of the irrational middle-class fear of the imagined working-class 'mob'. Using as an example a peaceful and lawful protest staged by local mothers against the re-housing of sex-offenders on their estate, Thompson and Williams show how the sensationalist demonization of the protesters by moral panic theorists and the liberal press was just as irrational as the demonization of the sex offenders by the protesters and the tabloid press.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=W. |last2=Williams |first2=A. |year=2013 |title=The Myth of Moral Panics: Sex, Snuff, and Satan |series=Routledge Advances in Criminology |location=London |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415812665 }} {{page needed|date=November 2016}}</ref>\n\nMany sociologists and criminologists (Ungar, Hier, Rohloff) have revised Cohen's original framework.

He was born in [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]], [[Finland]]. He began flying in [[Lentolaivue 32]] and flew later in [[Lentolaivue 30|LeLv 30]], [[Lentolaivue 32|LeLv 32]], [[Lentolaivue 34|LeLv 34]] and [[Lentolaivue 24|LeLv 24]]. He scored 13\u00bc of his victories with [[P-36 Hawk]]s and 19 with [[Me 109|Bf 109]]s. \n\n==Biography==\nAfter the war broke out on the 30 November 1939, Karhila was drafted and posted to Kauhava Air Base for training. On completion of training he was then posted to [[Lentolaivue 24|LeLv 24]] at [[Siikakangas]], equipped with the Fokker D.XXI. He was then posted to LeLv 30 on 20 June 1941. In mid July the unit was re-equipped with the Curtiss P-36 Hawk. Karhila's first air combat was on 31 July 1941, against two Soviet Air Force I-153's. \n\nKarhila transferred to [[Lentolaivue 34|LeLv 34]] based at [[Utti]] in March 1943, flying the Bf 109G-2.

During their operation, many pilots and test pilots died \u2013 some pilots were buried in the cemetery in the village of Hotilovo. Until recently, it was still possible to see the graves with propellers. The town of the airfield was located along the highway. The take-off field and taxiways were created from standard metal ladders, which can still be seen in the village \u2013 they are used both as tracks and as hedges.

The planes arrived and departed by rail unassembled, in wooden containers of gray color \u2013 the fuselage and the plane separately. Later, in the 70s, the town and the airfield itself were moved a few kilometers to the side, across the [[Shlin]] river, where it occupies its present position.\n\n[[File:MiG-31 790 IAP Khotilovo airbase 2.jpg|thumb | [[MiG-31]] from 790 IAP]] From April 2006 a cardinal reconstruction was made: the length was increased [[Runway]] from 2500 to 3000 meters and its width, the runway, apron covers and [[taxiway]]s were completely replaced by concrete monolith; new buildings of the control tower (KDP), a launch command center (UPC) and several other buildings for various purposes, including the building of the duty team, were built.

Since 1994, the air regiment gradually re-armed with interceptor fighters [[MiG-31]]. During the reconstruction of the Khotilovo airbase in 2006\u20132008, the air regiment was temporarily relocated to the air base in [[Dorokhovo (air base)|Dorokhovo]]. With the transition to the new look of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the regiment became an airbase as part of the Air Force Operational-Strategic Command of the Air Force, that is, the re-formed Special Purpose Command. The air regiment received a squadron of [[Su-27]] from the Bezhetsk Fighter Regiment.

It is an interceptor base with three groups of fan revetments.  It is home to 790 IAP (790th Fighter Order of Kutuzov Aviation Regiment) flying 38 [[MiG-25]] aircraft during the [[Cold War]] and [[MiG-31]]s through the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web| title = Aviatsiya PVO | publisher = Aviabaza KPOI | url = http://airbase.ru/squad/russia/avpvo/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title = Air Power Analysis: Russian Federation | last = Butowski | first = Pyotr | publisher = AIRtime Publishing, Inc | year = 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBorisovsky's interceptor regiment initially operated the [[Sukhoi Su-9]] (Fishpot) in the 1960s.<ref name=\"phaseout81\"/> The regiment replaced it in 1980 with the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25]] (Foxbat-A).<ref name=\"phaseout81\">[https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/document/cia-rdp81t00380r000100980001-5 PHASEOUT OF FISHPOT IN APVO STRANYY AIRFIELDS USSR], February 1981, CREST: CIA-RDP81T00380R000100980001-5, Central Intelligence Agency, Washington, DC.</ref>  This was unique to Borisovsky, as all other Su-9 bases received the [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23]] (Flogger).<ref name=\"phaseout81\"/>\n\nOn 1 June 2005 a [[MiG-31]] based here crash-landed here; the crew was only injured.\n\nAs of February 2014, the base is closed for runway 02/20 reconstruction.\n\nThe first airplanes in the area of the village [[Khotilovo (Bologovsky district)|Khotilovo]] appeared before [[World War II]].\n\nIn the period from March 1945 to July 1946, the control and regiments of the [[257th Fighter Aviation Division of the|257th Svirsky Fighter Aviation Division]] disbanded in July 1946 ( [[Yak-9]]M and [[La-7]]).\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, propellers and first jet aircraft were based here. During their operation, many pilots and test pilots died \u2013 some pilots were buried in the cemetery in the village of Hotilovo. Until recently, it was still possible to see the graves with propellers. The town of the airfield was located along the highway. The take-off field and taxiways were created from standard metal ladders, which can still be seen in the village \u2013 they are used both as tracks and as hedges. When visiting [[Castro, Fidel|Fidel Castro]] [[7th Guards Missile Division|rocket division]] in the city [[Lakeside (Tver region)|Bologoe-4]], he flew with the government delegation to the Hotilovo airfield . Maintenance of the airfield went through the nearest railway station [[Kuzhenkino]]. It was equipped with [[a warehouse]], a loading area and a place for unloading fuel. The planes arrived and departed by rail unassembled, in wooden containers of gray color \u2013 the fuselage and the plane separately. Later, in the 70s, the town and the airfield itself were moved a few kilometers to the side, across the [[Shlin]] river, where it occupies its present position.\n\n[[File:MiG-31 790 IAP Khotilovo airbase 2.jpg|thumb | [[MiG-31]] from 790 IAP]] From April 2006 a cardinal reconstruction was made: the length was increased [[Runway]] from 2500 to 3000 meters and its width, the runway, apron covers and [[taxiway]]s were completely replaced by concrete monolith; new buildings of the control tower (KDP), a launch command center (UPC) and several other buildings for various purposes, including the building of the duty team, were built. After reconstruction, the airfield is capable of receiving any type of Russian military aircraft, including strategic bombers [[Tu-160]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20070620152348/http://www.mil.ru/info/1069/details/index.shtml?id=31323 Hotilovo airfield put into operation and ready to receive state aviation]</ref>\n\nBy order of the Commander of the Special Forces Command, from 24 September 2007 [[aerodrome]] was put into operation and ready to receive and organize flights of the state [[aviation] aviation]].\n\nThe air base personnel took an active part in the Russian-Belarusian exercises \"[[Zapad-2009]]\", where they worked on the interception of air targets. In addition, combat shooting is conducted every year at the [[Ashuluk (test site)|Ashuluk]] and Ladoga firing ranges.\n\n== Composition of the air base ==\nCurrently located at the airbase:\n* The 790th Fighter Order of Kutuzov, 3rd class, an aviation regiment that has aircraft [[MiG-31]]\n* 3rd Squadron [[Su-27]]\n\nSince 2007 is [[List of joint-based airfields of Russia|joint-based airfield]] \u2013 in addition to military aviation, there is also a civilian base \u2013 Federal State Budgetary Institution \"Russia\" special flight squadron.

Since 1994, the air regiment gradually re-armed with interceptor fighters [[MiG-31]]. During the reconstruction of the Khotilovo airbase in 2006\u20132008, the air regiment was temporarily relocated to the air base in [[Dorokhovo (air base)|Dorokhovo]]. With the transition to the new look of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, the regiment became an airbase as part of the Air Force Operational-Strategic Command of the Air Force, that is, the re-formed Special Purpose Command. The air regiment received a squadron of [[Su-27]] from the Bezhetsk Fighter Regiment. And in [[Bezhetsk]], the commandant's office remained, structurally incorporated into the Hotilovo airbase.\n\n=== 844 OBS RTO ===\nThe 844th separate communications and radio engineering battalion (OPS RTO) since 1953 provides flights for the 790th IAP.
