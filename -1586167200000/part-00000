Their millennial residence as an open and organised Jewish community in Iberia began to decline with the ''[[Reconquista]]'' and was brought to an end starting with the [[Alhambra Decree]] by Spain's [[Catholic Monarchs]] in 1492, and then by the edict of expulsion of Jews and Muslims by Portuguese king [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel I]] in 1496,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/expulsao-dos-judeus-de-portugal/|title=Expuls\u00e3o dos judeus de Portugal (Expulsion of Jews from Portugal)|last=Fernandes|first= Maria J\u00falia|date= 1996|publisher=[[Radio and Television of Portugal|RTP]]|language=Portuguese|access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref> which resulted in a combination of internal and external migrations, mass conversions and executions.\nIn 2015 both Spain and Portugal passed laws which allowed Sephardim who could prove their origins in those countries to apply for citizenship.\n\n[[File:C\u00f3rdoba_2015_10_23_2637_(25613156304).jpg|thumb|Statue of Sephardic [[Jewish philosophy|philosopher]], [[Maimonides]], in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba,]] Spain]]\nMore broadly, the term Sephardim has today also come sometimes to refer to traditionally [[Mizrahi Jews|Eastern Jewish communities]] of [[West Asia]] and beyond who, although not having genealogical roots in the Jewish communities of Iberia, have adopted a [[Sephardic Judaism|Sephardic style of liturgy]] and [[Sephardic law and customs]] imparted to them by the Iberian Jewish exiles over the course of the last few centuries. This article deals with Sephardim within the narrower ethnic definition.\n\nHistorically, the [[vernacular]] languages of Sephardim and their descendants have been variants of either [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though other tongues had been adopted and adapted throughout their history. The historical forms of Spanish that differing Sephardic communities spoke communally was determined by the date of their departure from Iberia, and their condition of departure as Jews or [[New Christians]].\n\n[[Judaeo-Spanish]], sometimes called \"Ladino Oriental\" (Eastern [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]), is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] derived from [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]], incorporating elements from all the old Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], and was spoken by what became the Eastern Sephardim, who settled in the Eastern Mediterranean, taken with them in the 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. This dialect was further influenced by [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]] vocabulary in the differing lands of their exile. [[Haketia]] (also known as \"Tetouani\" in Algeria), an Arabic-influenced Judaeo-Spanish variety also derived from Old Spanish, with numerous Hebrew and Aramaic terms was spoken by North African Sephardim, taken with them in the 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. The main feature of this dialect is the heavy influence of the Jebli Arabic dialect of northern Morocco. [[Early Modern Spanish]] and [[History of Portuguese|Early Modern Portuguese]], including in a mixture of the two was traditionally spoken or used liturgically by the [[Converso|ex-converso]] [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]], taken with them during their later migration out of Iberia between the 16th and 18th centuries as [[conversos]], after which they reverted to Judaism. [[Modern Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Modern Portuguese]] varieties, traditionally spoken by the [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] of Iberia and [[Ibero-America]], including some recent returnees to Judaism in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

In its most basic form, this broad religious definition of a Sephardi refers to any Jew, of any ethnic background, who follows the customs and traditions of Sepharad. For religious purposes, and in modern Israel, \"Sephardim\" is most often used in this wider sense which encompasses most non-Ashkenazi Jews who are not ethnically Sephardi, but are in most instances of West Asian or North African origin, but who nonetheless commonly use a Sephardic style of liturgy, meaning a majority of [[Mizrahi Jews]].\n\nThe term ''Sephardi'' in the broad sense, thus describes the ''[[nusach]]'' ([[Hebrew language]], \"liturgical tradition\") used by Sephardi Jews in their [[Siddur]] (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, order of prayers, text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Sephardim traditionally pray using ''Minhag Sefarad.'' The term ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'' or ''Nusach Sfarad'' does not refer to the liturgy generally recited by Sephardim proper or even Sephardi in a broader sense, but rather to an alternative Eastern European liturgy used by many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] who are in fact [[Ashkenazi]].\n\nAdditionally, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]], whose branch of practiced Judaism is known as [[Haymanot]], have recently come under the umbrella of Israel's already broad Sephardic [[Chief Rabbi]]nate.\n\n== Divisions ==\nThe divisions among Sephardim and their descendants today are largely a result of the consequences of the Royal edicts of expulsion. Both the Spanish and Portuguese edicts ordered their respective Jewish residents to choose one of only three options:\n# to convert to Catholicism and therefore to be allowed to remain within the kingdom,\n# to remain Jewish and to be expelled by the stipulated deadline, or \n# to be [[Summary execution|summarily executed]].\n\nIn the case of the Alhambra Decree of 1492, the primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large [[converso]] population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391, and as such were not subject to the Decree or to expulsion, yet remained under the watchful eye of the Spanish Inquisition. It has been argued by British scholar Henry Kamen, that \"the real purpose of the 1492 edict likely was not expulsion, but compulsory conversion and assimilation of all Spanish Jews, a process which had been underway for a number of centuries. Indeed, a further number of those Jews who had not yet joined the converso community finally chose to convert and avoid expulsion as a result of the edict. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution during the prior century, between 200,000 and 250,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between one third and one half of Spain's remaining 100,000 non-converted Jews chose exile, with an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=History of a Tragedy |last=P\u00e9rez |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph P\u00e9rez |orig-year=2009 |year=2012 |page=17}}</ref>\n\nForeseeing the economic aftermath of a similar Jewish flight from Portugal, King Manuel's decree five years later was largely pro-forma to appease a precondition the Spanish monarchs had set for him if he wished to marry their daughter. While the stipulations were similar in the Portuguese decree, King Manuel then largely prevented Portugal's Jews from leaving, by blocking Portugal's ports of exit. This failure to leave Portugal was then reasoned by the king to signify a default acceptance of Catholicism by the Jews, and the king then proceeded to proclaim them New Christians. Actual physical [[forced conversion]]s, however, were also experienced throughout Portugal.\n\nSephardi Jews, therefore, encompass Jews descended from those Jews who left the Iberian Peninsula as Jews by the expiration of the respective decreed deadlines. This group is further divided between those who fled south to [[North Africa]], as opposed to those who fled eastwards to the [[Balkans]], [[West Asia]] and beyond. Also included among Sephardi Jews are those who descend from \"[[New Christian]]\" conversos, but then returned to Judaism after leaving Iberia, largely after reaching Southern and Western Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} From these regions, many would again migrate, this time to the non-Iberian territories of the Americas. Additional to all these Sephardic Jewish groups are the descendants of those New Christian conversos who either remained in Iberia, or moved from Iberia directly to the Iberian colonial possessions across what are today the various [[Latin America]]n countries. The descendants of this group of conversos, for historical reasons and circumstances, were never able to formally return to the Jewish religion.\n\nAll these sub-groups are defined by a combination of geography, identity, religious evolution, language evolution, and the timeframe of their reversion (for those who had in the interim undergone a temporary nominal [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Catholicism) or non-reversion back to Judaism.\n\nThese Sephardic sub-groups are separate from any pre-existing local Jewish communities they encountered in their new areas of settlement. From the perspective of the present day, the first three sub-groups appeared to have developed as separate branches, each with its own traditions. <!-- Most Sephardic Jews, especially those from [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], carry the tradition that they are the direct descendants of [[Pharez]] the son of [[Judah (biblical figure)]].--><!--Can we get a citation for that?-->\n\nIn earlier centuries, and as late as the editing of the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' at the beginning of the 20th century, they were usually regarded as together forming a continuum. The [[Jewish community of Livorno]] acted as the clearing-house of personnel and traditions among the first three sub-groups; it also developed as the chief publishing centre.{{Synthesis inline|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Eastern Sephardim ===\n{{main|Eastern Sephardim}}\n[[File:1900 photo of a Sephardi couple from Sarajevo.png|thumb|Sephardi Jewish couple from [[Sarajevo]] in traditional clothing (1900)]]\n\nEastern Sephardim comprise the descendants of the expellees from Spain who left as Jews in 1492 or prior. This sub-group of Sephardim settled mostly [[History of the Jews in Turkey|in various parts of the Ottoman Empire]], which included areas in the [[Near East]] ([[West Asia]]'s [[Middle East]] such as [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]), the [[Balkans]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. They settled particularly in European cities ruled by the Ottoman Empire including [[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Salonica]] in what is today [[Greece]], [[Constantinople]] which today is known as [[Istanbul]] on the European portion of modern [[Turkey]], and [[Sarajevo]] in what is today [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Sephardic Jews also lived in Bulgaria, where they incorporated into their community the [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] Jews they found already living there. They had a presence as well in [[Walachia]] in what is today southern [[Romania]], where there is still a functioning Sephardic Synagogue.<ref>[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Romania YIVO|Romania].</ref> Their traditional language is referred to as [[Judezmo]] (\"Jewish [language]\"); it is [[Judaeo-Spanish]] sometimes also known as Ladino,  which consisted of the medieval Spanish and Portuguese they spoke in Iberia, with admixtures of Hebrew, and the languages around them, especially Turkish. This Judeo-Spanish language was often written in [[Rashi script]].\n[[File:Epoca_1902_Issue.jpg|thumb|A 1902 Issue of ''La Epoca'', a Ladino newspaper from Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]])]]\nSome Sephardim went further east to West Asian territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]], settling among the long-established Arabic-speaking Jewish communities in [[History of the Jews in Syria|Damascus]] and [[History of the Jews in Syria|Aleppo]] in Syria, as well as in the [[Land of Israel]] itself, and as far as [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdad]] in Iraq. Although technically a North African Ottoman region, those who settled [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Alexandria]] in Egypt are also included due to its cultural proximity to the West Asian provinces.\n\nFor the most part, Eastern Sephardim did not maintain their own separate Sephardic religious and cultural institutions from the pre-existing Jews, but instead the local Jews came to adopt the liturgical customs of the recent Sephardic arrivals.\n\nAdditionally, Eastern Sephardim in European areas of the Ottoman Empire retained their culture and language, while those in the West Asian portion gave up their language and adopted the local Judeo-Arabic dialect. This latter phenomenon is just one of the factors which has today led to the broader religious definition of Sephardi.\n\nWhile on the one hand the Jewish communities in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt are partly of Spanish Jewish origin and they are therefore Sephardim proper, conversely the great majority of the Jewish communities in Iraq, and all of those from Iran, Eastern Syria, Yemen and Eastern Turkey are pre-existing indigenous Jewish populations who have adopted Sephardic rite and traditions through cultural diffusion, and are properly termed [[Mizrahi Jews]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This has also been seen to be the case in modern DNA research, where Syrian Jews, while clustering within the various world Jewish groups (where most Jewish groups cluster closely together at large compared to non-Jews), the Syrian Jews nevertheless genetically cluster closest with Sephardim proper counterparts in other regions of Sephardic settlement rather than the Mizrahi Jews geographically closest to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA few of the Eastern Sephardim followed the spice trade routes as far as the [[Malabar coast]] of southern [[India]], where they settled among the established [[Cochin Jews|Cochin Jewish]] community, again imparting their culture and customs to the local Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Additionally, there was a large presence of Jews and crypto-Jews of Portuguese origin in the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]]. Their presence aroused the anger of [[Gaspar Jorge de Le\u00e3o Pereira]], the first archbishop of Goa, who called for the initiation of the [[Goa Inquisition]] against the [[Sephardic Jews in India]].\n\nIn recent times, principally after 1948, most Eastern Sephardim have since relocated to Israel, and others to the US and Latin America.\n\nEastern Sephardim still often carry common Spanish surnames, as well as other specifically Sephardic surnames from 15th-century Spain with Arabic or Hebrew language origins (such as [[Azoulay]], [[Abulafia (surname)|Abulafia]], [[Abravanel]]) which have since disappeared from Spain when those that stayed behind as conversos adopted surnames that were solely Spanish in origin. Other Eastern Sephardim have since also translated their Hispanic surnames into the languages of the regions they settled in, or have modified them to sound more local.\n\n=== North African Sephardim ===\n[[File:Moroccan_wedding_dress,_19-20th_century_(3551817349).jpg|thumb|19th century Moroccan Sephardic wedding dress.]]\n{{main|North African Sephardim}}North African Sephardim consist of the descendants of the expellees from Spain who also left as Jews in 1492.

Settling mostly in [[Moroccan Jews|Morocco]] and [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algeria]], they spoke a variant of [[Judaeo-Spanish]] known as [[Haketia]]. They also spoke [[Judeo-Arabic]] in a majority of cases. They settled in the areas with already established Arabic-speaking Jewish communities in North Africa and eventually merged with them to form new communities based solely on [[Sephardic]] customs.{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nSeveral of the [[Moroccan Jews]] emigrated back to the Iberian Peninsula to form the core of the [[History of the Jews in Gibraltar|Gibraltar Jews]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nIn the 19th century, modern Spanish, French and Italian gradually replaced Haketia and Judeo-Arabic as the mother tongue among most Moroccan Sephardim and other North African Sephardim.<ref>Samuel Toledano, ''Espagne: les retrouvailles'', in: ''Les Juifs du Maroc'' (Editions du Scribe, Paris 1992)</ref>\n\nIn recent times, with the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], principally after the creation of Israel in 1948, most North African Sephardim have relocated to Israel (total pop. est. 1,400,000 in 2015), and most others to France (361,000) and the US (300,000), as well as other countries.

Born into a large New York Sephardi family.]]\n[[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]] (also known more ambiguously as \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\", \"Spanish Jews\", \"Portuguese Jews\" and \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\") are the community of Jewish ex-conversos whose families initially remained in Spain and Portugal as ostensible [[New Christians]], that is, as [[Anusim]] or \"forced [converts]\". Western Sephardim are further sub-divided into an [[Old World]] branch and a [[New World]] branch.\n\nHenry Kamen and Joseph Perez estimate that of the total Jewish origin population of Spain at the time of the issuance of the Alhambra Decree, those who chose to remain in Spain represented the majority, up to 300,000 of a total Jewish origin population of 350,000. Furthermore, a significant number returned to Spain in the years following the expulsion, on condition of converting to Catholicism, the Crown guaranteeing they could recover their property at the same price at which it was sold.\n\nDiscrimination against this large community of conversos nevertheless remained, and those who secretly practiced the Jewish faith specifically suffered severe episodes of persecution by the Inquisition. The last episode of persecution occurred in the mid-18th century. External migrations out of the Iberian peninsula coincided with these episodes of increased persecution by the Inquisition.\n\nAs a result of this discrimination and persecution, a small number of [[marranos]] (conversos who secretly practiced Judaism) later emigrated to more religiously tolerant Old World countries outside the [[Hispanosphere|Iberian cultural sphere]] such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[England]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In these lands conversos reverted to Judaism, rejoining the Jewish community sometimes up to the third or even fourth generations after the initial decrees stipulating conversion, expulsion, or death. It is these returnees to Judaism which represent Old World Western Sephardim.\n\nNew World Western Sephardim, on the other hand, are the descendants of those Jewish-origin New Christian conversos who accompanied the millions of Old Christian Spaniards and Portuguese that emigrated to the Americas. More specifically, New World Western Sephardim are those Western Sephardim whose converso ancestors migrated to various of the non-Iberian colonies in the Americas in whose jurisdictions they could return to Judaism.\n\nNew World Western Sephardim are juxtaposed to yet another group of descendants of conversos who settled in the Iberian colonies of the Americas who could not revert to Judaism. These comprise the related but distinct group known as [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] (see section below).\n\nDue to the presence of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition in the Iberian American territories, initially converso immigration was barred throughout much of Ibero-America. Because of this, very few converso immigrants in Iberian American colonies ever reverted to Judaism. Of those conversos in the New World who did return to Judaism, it was principally those who had come via an initial respite of refuge in the [[Netherlands]] and/or who were settling the New World Dutch colonies such as [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and the area then known as New Holland (also called [[Dutch Brazil]]). Dutch Brazil was the northern portion of the colony of Brazil ruled by the Dutch for under a quarter of a century before it also fell to the Portuguese who ruled the remainder of Brazil. Jews who had only recently reverted in Dutch Brazil then again had to flee to other Dutch-ruled colonies in the Americas, including joining brethren in Cura\u00e7ao, but also migrating to [[New Amsterdam]], in what is today [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nAll of the oldest congregations in the non-Iberian colonial possessions in the Americas were founded by Western Sephardim, many who arrived in the then Dutch-ruled [[New Amsterdam]], with their synagogues being in the tradition of \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\".\n\nIn the United States in particular, [[Congregation Shearith Israel]], established in 1654, in today's New York City, is the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. Its present building dates from 1897. Congregation [[Jeshuat Israel]] in Newport, Rhode Island, is dated to sometime after the arrival there of Western Sephardim in 1658 and prior to the 1677 purchase of a communal cemetery, now known as [[Touro Cemetery]]. See also [[List of the oldest synagogues in the United States]].\n\nThe intermittent period of residence in Portugal (after the initial fleeing from Spain) for the ancestors of many Western Sephardim (whether Old World or New World) is a reason why the surnames of many Western Sephardim tend to be Portuguese variations of common Spanish surnames, though some are still Spanish.\n\nAmong a few notable figures with roots in Western Sephardim are the current president of Venezuela, [[Nicol\u00e1s Maduro]], and former [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]]. Both descend from Western Sephardim who left Portugal for the Netherlands, and in the case of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, from the Netherlands to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and ultimately Venezuela.\n\n=== Sephardic Bnei Anusim ===\n{{See also|Sephardic Bnei Anusim|Conversos|New Christians}}\n[[File:Sephardi Jew family Argentina.jpg|thumb|Sephardi family from Misiones Province, Argentina, circa 1900.]]\nThe [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] consists of the contemporary and largely nominal [[Christianity|Christian]] descendants of assimilated 15th century Sephardic [[anusim]]. These descendants of Spanish and Portuguese [[Jew]]s forced or coerced to convert to [[Catholicism]] remained, as [[conversos]], in [[Iberia]] or moved to the [[Ibero-America|Iberian colonial possessions]] across various [[Latin America]]n countries during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].\n\nDue to historical reasons and circumstances, Sephardic Bnei Anusim had not been able to return to the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] over the last five centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.netanya.ac.il/englishSite/Centers/SecretJewsCenter/Publications/Documents/beloved-legacy.pdf |title=Beloved legacy |website=www.netanya.ac.il }}</ref> although increasing numbers have begun emerging publicly in modern times, especially over the last two decades. Except for varying degrees of putatively rudimentary Jewish customs and traditions which had been retained as [[family traditions]] among individual families, Sephardic Bnei Anusim became a fully assimilated sub-group within the Iberian-descended Christian populations of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Hispanic America]] and [[Brazil]]. In the last 5 to 10 years, however, \"organized groups of [Sephardic] Benei Anusim in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Dominican Republic]] and in [[Iberia|Sefarad]] [Iberia] itself\"<ref name=\"Moshe 2012 20\">{{cite book|first=ben Levi|last=Moshe|isbn=9781463327064|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OgzBQxoODWcC&pg=PA20&dq=Existen+ya+grupos+de+Benei+Anusim+organizados#v=onepage&q=Existen%20ya%20grupos%20de%20Benei%20Anusim%20organizados&f=false|title=La Yeshiv\u00e1 Benei Anusim: El Manual de Estudios Para Entender las Diferencias Entre el Cristianismo y el Judaismo|publisher=Palibrio|year=2012|page=20}}</ref> have now been established, some of whose members have formally reverted to [[Judaism]], leading to the emergence of Neo-Western Sephardim (see group below).\n\nThe [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] estimates the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population to number in the millions.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/world/europe/interest-in-israel-as-spain-weighs-citizenship-for-sephardic-jews.html|title=Prospect of Spanish Citizenship Appeals to Descendants of Jews Expelled in 1492|date=16 February 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Their population size is several times larger than the three Jewish-integrated Sephardi descendant sub-groups combined, consisting of [[Sephardi Jews#Eastern Sephardim|Eastern Sephardim]], [[Sephardi Jews#North African Sephardim|North African Sephardim]], and the ex-converso [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]] (both New World and Old World branches).\n\nAlthough numerically superior, Sephardic Bnei Anusim are, however, the least prominent or known sub-group of Sephardi descendants. Sephardic Bnei Anusim are also more than twice the size of the total world Jewish population as a whole, which itself also encompasses [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Mizrahi Jews]] and [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various other smaller groups]].\n\nUnlike the Anusim (\"forced [converts]\") who were the conversos up to the third, fourth or fifth generation (depending on the Jewish responsa) who later reverted to Judaism, the [[Bnei Anusim]] (\"[later] sons/children/descendants [of the] forced [converts]\") were the subsequent generations of descendants of the Anusim who remained hidden ever since the Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and its New World franchises. At least some Sephardic Anusim in the [[Hispanosphere]] (in Iberia, but especially in their colonies in Ibero-America) had also initially tried to revert to Judaism, or at least maintain crypto-Jewish practices in privacy. This, however, was not feasible long-term in that environment, as Judaizing conversos in Iberia and Ibero-America remained persecuted, prosecuted, and liable to conviction and execution. The Inquisition itself was only finally formally disbanded in the 19th century.\n\nHistorical documentation shedding new light on the diversity in the ethnic composition of the Iberian immigrants to the Spanish colonies of the Americas during the conquest era suggests that the number of [[New Christian]]s of Sephardi origin that actively participated in the conquest and settlement was more significant than previously estimated. A number of Spanish conquerors, administrators, settlers, have now been confirmed to have been of Sephardi origin.{{fact|date=October 2019}} Recent revelations have only come about as a result of modern DNA evidence and newly discovered records in Spain, which had been either lost or hidden, relating to conversions, marriages, baptisms, and Inquisition trials of the parents, grandparents and great grandparents of the Sephardi-origin Iberian immigrants.\n\nOverall, it is now estimated that up to 20% of modern-day Spaniards and 10% of colonial Latin America's Iberian settlers may have been of Sephardic origin, although the regional distribution of their settlement was uneven throughout the colonies. Thus, Iberian settlers of New Christian Sephardi-origin ranged anywhere from none in most areas, to as high as 1 in every 3 (approx. 30%) Iberian settlers in other areas. With Latin America's current population standing at close to 590 million people, the bulk of which consists of persons of full or partial Iberian ancestry (both [[Hispanic America|New World Hispanics]] and [[Brazilians]], whether they're [[Criollo people|criollos]], [[mestizos]] or [[mulattos]]), it is estimated that up to 50 million of these possess Sephardic Jewish ancestry to some degree.\n\nIn Iberia, settlements of known and attested populations of Bnei Anusim include those in [[Belmonte Jews|Belmonte]], in Portugal, and the [[Xuetes]] of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]], in Spain. In 2011 Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], a leading rabbi and Halachic authority and chairman of the Beit Din Tzedek [[Beit Din|rabbinical court]] in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel, recognized the entire Xuete community of Bnei Anusim in Palma de Mallorca, as Jews.<ref name=\"jpost.com\">[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=228936 \"Chuetas of Majorca recognized as Jewish\"; ''Jerusalem Post'' 07/12/2011]</ref> That population alone represented approximately 18,000 people, or just over 2% of the entire population of the island. The proclamation of the Jews' default acceptance of Catholicism by the Portuguese king actually resulted in a high percentage being assimilated in the Portuguese population. Besides the Xuetas, the same is true of Spain.\n\nAlmost all Sephardic Bnei Anusim carry surnames which are known to have been used by Sephardim during the 15th century, however, per se, almost all of these surname are not specifically Sephardic, and are in fact mostly surnames of gentile Spanish or gentile Portuguese origin which only became common among Bnei Anusim because they deliberately adopted them during their conversions in an attempt to obscure their Jewish pedigrees. Very few Sephardic Bnei Anusim carry surnames that are specifically Sephardic in origin, or that are specifically found only among Bnei Ansuim.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\n===Pre-1492===\nPrior to 1492, substantial Jewish populations existed in most Spanish and Portuguese provinces. Among the larger Jewish populations in actual numbers were the Jewish communities in cities like [[Lisbon]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Seville]], [[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Granada]]. In these cities, however, Jews constituted only substantial [[Minority group|minorities]] of the overall population. In several smaller towns, however, Jews composed [[majority|majorities]] or [[wikt:plurality|pluralities]], as the towns were founded or inhabited principally by Jews. Among these towns were [[Oca\u00f1a, Spain|Oca\u00f1a]], [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], [[Buitrago del Lozoya]], [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]], [[Ribadavia]], [[Herv\u00e1s]], [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]], and [[Almaz\u00e1n]].\n\nIn [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[Aranda de Duero]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], [[Alba de Tormes]], [[Ar\u00e9valo]], [[Burgos]], [[Calahorra]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Herrera del Duque]], [[Le\u00f3n (historical region)|Le\u00f3n]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Ourense]], [[Salamanca]], [[Segovia]], [[Soria]], and [[Villal\u00f3n de Campos|Villal\u00f3n]] were home to large Jewish communities or ''[[aljama]]s''. [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] had substantial Jewish communities in the Calls of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Tarragona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] ([[Majorca]]).\n\nThe first Jews to leave Spain settled in what is today [[Algeria]] after the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacre of 1391|various persecutions]] that took place in 1391.\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n_de_los_jud\u00edos.jpg|thumb|''The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (in the year 1492)'' by [[Emilio Sala (painter)|Emilio Sala Franc\u00e9s]]]]\n\n=== Post-1492 ===\nThe [[Alhambra Decree]] (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Spain]] ([[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]) ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and its territories and possessions by 31 July, of that year.<ref name=\"Decree-translation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html|title=The Edict of Expulsion of the Jews - 1492 Spain}}</ref> The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large [[converso]] population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391, and as such were not subject to the Decree or to expulsion. A further number of those remaining chose to avoid expulsion as a result of the edict. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled, an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of a Tragedy|last=P\u00e9rez|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph P\u00e9rez|orig-year=2009|year=2012|page=17}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish Jews who chose to leave Spain instead of converting [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]] throughout the region of North Africa known as the [[Maghreb]]. In those regions, they often intermingled with the already existing [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Arabic-speaking communities, becoming the ancestors of the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan Jewish communities.\n\nMany Spanish Jews also fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they were given refuge. Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of Salonika<!--Use the historical English names under the Ottomans--> (currently [[Thessaloniki]], now in [[Greece]]) and [[Smyrna]]<!--The city was known at the time in English as Smyrna until circa 1930, and the article should use the historical name even if it is now considered politically incorrect in Turkey.

However, the figure is likely to be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000. Many went to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], gaining [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|only a few years of respite from persecution]]. The Jewish community in Portugal (perhaps then some 10% of that country's population)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kayserling, Meyer. \"Hist\u00f3ria dos Judeus em Portugal\". Editora Pioneira, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1971</ref> were then declared Christians by Royal decree unless they left.\n\nSuch figures exclude the significant number of Jews who returned to Spain due to the hostile reception they received in their countries of refuge, notably Fez. The situation of returnees was legalized with the Ordinance of 10 November 1492 which established that civil and church authorities should be witness to baptism and, in the case that they were baptized before arrival, proof and witnesses of baptism were required. Furthermore, all property could be recovered by returnees at the same price at which it was sold. Returnees are documented as late as 1499. On the other hand, the Provision of the Royal Council of 24 October 1493 set harsh sanctions for those who slandered these New Christians with insulting terms such as ''tornadizos''.<ref>{{cite book|last=P\u00e9rez|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph P\u00e9rez|orig-year=1993|year=2013|page=115|title=Historia de una tragedia.

It is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] derived mainly from [[Old Castilian]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), with many borrowings from Turkish, and to a lesser extent from Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and French.\nUntil recently, two different dialects of Judeo-Spanish were spoken in the Mediterranean region: Eastern Judeo-Spanish (in various distinctive regional variations) and Western or North African Judeo-Spanish (also known as [[Haketia|\u1e24akit\u00eda]]), once spoken, with little regional distinction, in six towns in Northern Morocco and, because of later emigration, also in [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (Spanish cities in North Africa), [[Gibraltar]], [[Casablanca]] (Morocco), and [[Oran]] (Algeria). The Eastern Sephardic dialect is typified by its greater conservatism, its retention of numerous Old Spanish features in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and its numerous borrowings from Turkish and, to a lesser extent, also from Greek and South Slavic. Both dialects have (or had) numerous borrowings from Hebrew, especially in reference to religious matters, but the number of [[Hebraism]]s in everyday speech or writing is in no way comparable to that found in [[Yiddish]].\n\nOn the other hand, the North African Sephardic dialect was, until the early 20th century, also highly conservative; its abundant [[Maghrebi Arabic|Colloquial Arabic]] loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological system. During the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco]] (1912\u20131956), \u1e24akit\u00eda was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian form of Spanish]], with only an occasional use of the old language as a sign of in-group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional [[Yinglish|Yiddishism]] in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who continue to practice \u1e24akit\u00eda as a matter of cultural pride, this dialect, probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], has essentially ceased to exist. By contrast, Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive. But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to extinction. Only time will tell whether Judeo-Spanish koin\u00e9, now evolving in Israel\u2014similar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardifolklit.org/flsj/sjjs/orallit/Oral_Lit_Sephardic.html |title=Samuel G.

The [[Gibraltar]] community has had a heavy influence on the Gibraltar dialect [[Llanito]] contributing several words to this English/Spanish patois.\n\nOther languages associated with Sephardic Jews are mostly extinct, ''i.e.'', formerly spoken by some Sephardic communities in Italy. [[Judeo-Arabic]] and its dialects have been a large vernacular language for Sephardim who settled in North African kingdoms and Arabic-speaking parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Low German]] (Low Saxon), formerly used as the vernacular by Sephardim around [[Hamburg]] and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in Northern Germany, is also no longer in use as a specifically Jewish [[vernacular]].\n\nIn other words, through their diaspora, Sephardim have been a polyglot population, often learning or exchanging words with the language of their host population, most commonly [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and were easily integrated in the societies that hosted them. Within the last centuries and more particularly the 19th and 20th century, two languages have become dominant in the Sephardic diaspora; [[French language|French]] introduced first by the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] and then by migration to France after Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria became independent, and [[Hebrew]] by the state of [[Israel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Literature==\nThe doctrine of ''[[galut]]'' is considered by scholars to be one of the most important concepts in Jewish history, if not the most important. In Jewish literature ''galut'', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for [[diaspora]], invoked common motifs of oppression, martyrdom and suffering in discussing the collective experience of exile in [[diaspora]] that has been uniquely formative in Jewish culture. This literature was shaped for centuries by the expulsions from Spain and Portugal and thus featured prominently in a wide range of medieval [[Jewish literature]] from rabbinic writings to profane poetry. Even so, the treatment of ''galut''  diverges in Sephardic sources, which scholar David A.

Abrabanel surmises that the name may have been given to it by the Jewish exiles who arrived in Spain, in remembrance of the city Ashqelon in the Land of Israel. The spelling rendered by Abrabanel is \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4. See: Abrabanel, ''Commentary on the First Prophets'', p. 680, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).</ref> France and Spain. The names \u1e62arfat and Sepharad are explicitly mentioned by him as being France and Spain, respectively. Some scholars think that, in the case of the place-name, \u1e62arfat (lit. [[Sarepta|\u1e62arfend]]) \u2013 which, as noted, was applied to the Jewish [[Diaspora]] in France, the association with France was made only exegetically because of its similarity in spelling with the name \u05e4\u05e8\u05e0\u05e6\u05d0 (France), by a reversal of its letters.\n\nSpanish Jew, [[Moses de Le\u00f3n]] (ca. 1250 \u2013 1305), mentions a tradition concerning the first Jewish exiles, saying that the vast majority of the first exiles driven away from the land of Israel during the Babylonian captivity refused to return, for they had seen that the Second Temple would be destroyed like the first.<ref>Moses de Le\u00f3n, in ''Ha-Nefesh Ha-\u1e24akhamah'' (also known as ''Sefer Ha-Mish\u1e33al''), end of Part VI which treats on the Resurrection of the Dead, pub. in Basel 1608 (Hebrew)</ref> In yet another teaching, passed down later by Moses ben Machir in the 16th century, an explicit reference is made to the fact that Jews have lived in Spain since the destruction of the First Temple:<ref>Moses ben Machir, in ''Seder Ha-Yom'', p. 15a, Venice 1605 (Hebrew)</ref>\n \n<blockquote>Now, I have heard that this praise, ''emet weya\u1e63iv'' [which is now used by us in the prayer rite] was sent by the exiles who were driven away from Jerusalem and who were not with Ezra in Babylon, and that Ezra had sent inquiring after them, but they did not wish to go up [there], replying that since they were destined to go off again into exile a second time, and that the Temple would once again be destroyed, why should we then double our anguish? It is best for us that we remain here in our place and to serve God. Now, I have heard that they are the people of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) and those who are near to them. However, that they might not be thought of as wicked men and those who are lacking in fidelity, may God forbid, they wrote down for them this magnanimous praise, etc.</blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah ibn Jechia]] the Spaniard has written:<ref>Gedaliah ibn Jechia in ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', p. 271, Venice 1585 (Hebrew)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In [5,]252 ''anno mundi'' [1492 CE], the king Ferdinand and his wife, Isabella, made war with the Ishmaelites who were in Granada and took it, and while they returned they commanded the Jews in all of his kingdom that in but a short time they were to take leave from the countries [they had heretofore possessed], they being Castile, Navarre, Catalonia, Arag\u00f3n, Granada and Sicily. Then the [Jewish] inhabitants of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) answered that they were not present [in the land of Judea] at the time when their Christ was put to death. Apparently, it was written upon a large stone in the city's street which some very ancient sovereign inscribed and testified that the Jews of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) did not depart from there during the building of the Second Temple, and were not involved in putting to death [the man whom they called] Christ. Yet, no apology was of any avail to them, neither unto the rest of the Jews, till at length six hundred-thousand souls had evacuated from there.</blockquote>\n\n[[Don Isaac Abrabanel]], a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, informs his readers<ref>Abrabanel's ''Commentary on the First Prophets'' (''Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim''), end of II Kings, pp. 680-681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).</ref> that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship to Spain by a certain Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to a certain Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. This Heracles later renounced his throne because of his preference for his native country in Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, by whom the country of Espa\u00f1a (Spain) derives its name. The Jewish exiles transported there by the said Phiros were descended by lineage from Judah, Benjamin, Shimon and Levi, and were, according to Abrabanel, settled in two districts in southern Spain: one, Andalusia, in the city of [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]]&mdash;a city so-called by the Jewish exiles that had come there; the second, in the country around ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]).\n\nAbrabanel says that the name ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) was given to the city by its first Jewish inhabitants, and surmises that the name may have meant \u05d8\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem. He says, furthermore, that the original name of the city was Pirisvalle, so-called by its early pagan inhabitants. He also writes there that he found written in the ancient annals of Spanish history collected by the kings of Spain that the 50,000 Jewish households then residing in the cities throughout Spain were the descendants of men and women who were sent to Spain by the Roman Emperor and who had formerly been subjected to him and whom Titus had originally exiled from places in or around Jerusalem. The two Jewish exiles joined together and became one.\n\nEvidence that suggests Jewish connections with the Iberian Peninsula includes:\n* References in the books of ''[[Book of Isiah|Isaiah]]'', ''[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'', ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]'', ''[[First Book of Kings|I Kings]]'', and ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]]'' to the country of [[Tarshish]], which is thought by many to have been located in modern southern Spain (in ancient [[Tartessus]]).\n* A [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] found at [[Cadiz]], dating from the 8th-7th century BC. The inscription on the ring, generally accepted as [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]], has been interpreted by a few scholars to be \"paleo-[[Hebrew language|hebraic]].\"\n* An [[amphora]] dating from at least the 1st century found in [[Ibiza]], which bears imprints of two Hebrew characters.\n* Several early Jewish writers wrote that their families had lived in Spain since the destruction of the first temple. Don [[Isaac Abravanel]] (1437\u20131508) stated that the [[Abravanel]] family had lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for 2,000 years.\n\nSome suggest that substantial Jewish immigration probably occurred during the Roman period of [[Hispania]]. The province came under Roman control with the fall of [[Carthage]] after the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013202 BC). Exactly how soon after this time Jews made their way onto the scene in this context is a matter of speculation. It is within the realm of possibility that they went there under the Romans as free men to take advantage of its rich resources. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] confirms that as early as 90 CE there was already a Jewish ''Diaspora'' living in Europe, made-up of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Thus, he writes in his ''Antiquities'':<ref>Josephus Flavius, ''Antiquities'', xi.v.2</ref>  \"... there are but two tribes in Asia (Turkey) and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude.\"\n\nAlthough the spread of Jews into Europe is most commonly associated with the [[Diaspora]] that ensued from the Roman conquest of [[Judea]], emigration from Judea into the greater Roman Mediterranean area antedated the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] at the hands of the Romans under [[Titus]]. Any Jews already in Hispania at this time would have been joined by those who had been enslaved by the Romans under [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]], and dispersed to the extreme west during the period of the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish Wars]], and especially after the defeat of Judea in 70. One account placed the number carried off to Hispania at 80,000. Subsequent immigrations came into the area along both the northern African and southern European sides of the Mediterranean.\n\nAmong the earliest records that may refer specifically to Jews in the Iberian peninsula during the Roman period is [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]]. Scholars such as [[Josephus|Josephus Flavius]] have taken Paul's intention to go to Hispania to preach the [[gospel]] (Romans 15:24, 28) to indicate the presence of Jewish communities there, as well as the fact that [[Herod Antipas]]'s banishment by [[Caligula]] in the year 39 may have been to Hispania.<ref>[[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Wars of the Jews]]'', 2.9.6. However, the place of banishment is identified in Josephus's ''[[Jewish Antiquities|Antiquities of the Jews]]'' as [[Gaul]]; for discussion, see {{cite book |author=Emil Sch\u00fcrer |authorlink=Emil Sch\u00fcrer |others=revised and edited by [[Geza Vermes]], [[Fergus Millar]] and Matthew Black |title=The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ: Volume I |edition=revised English |year=1973 |publisher=T&T Clark |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-567-02242-4 |pages=352 n. 41 }}</ref>\n\nFrom a slightly later period, ''[[Midrash Rabbah]]'' (Leviticus Rabba \u00a7 29.2), and ''[[Pesikta de-Rav Kahana]]'' (''Rosh Hashanna''), both, make mention of the Jewish Diaspora in Spain (Hispania) and their eventual return.\n\nPerhaps the most direct and substantial of early references are the several [[decrees]] of the [[Council of Elvira]], convened in the early 4th century, which address proper Christian behavior with regard to the Jews of Hispania.\n\nAs citizens of the Roman Empire, the Jews of Hispania engaged in a variety of occupations, including agriculture. Until the adoption of Christianity, Jews had close relations with non-Jewish populations, and played an active role in the social and economic life of the province. The [[edicts]] of the [[Synod of Elvira]], provide evidence of Jews who were integrated enough into the greater community to cause alarm among some. Of the Council's 80 [[Canon law|canonic]] decisions, those that pertain to Jews maintained separation between the two communities. It seems that by this time the presence of Jews was of greater concern to Christian authorities than the presence of pagans. Canon 16, which prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews, was worded more strongly than canon 15, which prohibited marriage with pagans. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with [[ostracism]]. Canon 48 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.\n\nYet in comparison to Jewish life in [[Byzantium]] and [[Italia (Roman province)|Italy]], life for the early Jews in Hispania and the rest of southern Europe was relatively tolerable. This is due in large measure to the difficulty the Church had in establishing itself in its western frontier. In the west, [[Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Suevi]], the [[Vandals]], and especially the [[Visigoths]] had more or less disrupted the political and [[ecclesiastical]] systems of the Roman empire, and for several centuries the Jews enjoyed a degree of peace their brethren to the east did not.\n\n[[Germanic Wars|Barbarian invasions]] brought most of the Iberian peninsula under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]] by the early 5th century. Other than in their contempt for Trinitarian Christians, the [[Arianism|Arian]] Visigoths were largely uninterested in the religious creeds within their kingdom. It was not until 506, when [[Alaric II]] (484\u2013507) published his ''Brevarium Alaricianum'' ([[Breviary of Alaric]]) (wherein he adopted the laws of the ousted Romans), that a Visigothic king concerned himself with the Jews.\n\nThe situation of the Jews changed after the conversion of the Visigothic royal family under [[Recared]] from Arianism to Roman Catholicism in 587. In their desire to consolidate the realm under the new religion, the Visigoths adopted an aggressive policy towards Jews. As the king and the church acted in a single interest, the Jews' situation deteriorated. Under successive Visigothic kings and under [[ecclesiastical]] authority, many orders of expulsion, forced conversion, isolation, enslavement, execution, and other punitive measures were made. By 612\u2013621, the situation for Jews became intolerable and many left Spain for nearby northern Africa. In 711, thousands of Jews from North Africa accompanied the Moslems who invaded Spain, subsuming Catholic Spain and turning much of it into an Arab state, Al-Andalus.<ref>N. H. Finkelstein, p.&nbsp;13, 14.{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Jews of Hispania had been utterly embittered and alienated by Catholic rule by the time of the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim invasion]]. To them, the [[Moors]] were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force. Wherever they went, the Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. This began two centuries of Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula, which became known as the \"Golden Age\" of Sephardi Jewry.\n[[File:Al-andalus_229.png|thumb|13th century depiction of a Jew and Muslim playing chess in [[Al-Andalus]]]]\n\n=== Jews in Muslim Iberia ===\n{{see also|Al-Andalus|Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula}}\n\nWith the victory of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] in 711, the lives of the Sephardim changed dramatically. Though Islamic law placed restrictions on ''[[dhimmis]]'' (non-Muslim members of monotheistic faiths), the coming of the Moors was by and large welcomed by the Jews of Iberia.\n\nBoth Muslim and Christian sources claim that Jews provided valuable aid to the Muslim invaders. Once captured, the defense of Cordoba was left in the hands of Jews, and [[Granada]], [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], [[Seville]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] were left to a mixed army of Jews and Moors. Although in some towns Jews may have been helpful to Muslim success, because of their small numbers they were of limited impact.\n\nIn spite of the restrictions placed upon the Jews as ''dhimmis'', life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity and Jews flourished as they did not under the Christian Visigoths. Many Jews came to Iberia, seen as a land of tolerance and opportunity, from the Christian and Muslim worlds. Following initial Arab victories, and especially with the establishment of [[Umayyad]] rule by [[Abd-ar-rahman I|Abd al-Rahman I]] in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab lands, from Morocco to [[Babylon]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Jewish communities were enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the commingling of these diverse Jewish traditions.{{explain|date=October 2018}}\n\nArabic culture, of course, also made a lasting impact on Sephardic cultural development. General re-evaluation of [[scripture]] was prompted by Muslim anti-Jewish [[polemics]] and the spread of [[rationalism]], as well as the anti-[[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbanite]] polemics of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]. The cultural and intellectual achievements of the Arabs, and much of the scientific and philosophical speculation of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek culture]], which had been best preserved by Arab scholars, was made available to the educated Jew. The meticulous regard the Arabs had for grammar and style also had the effect of stimulating an interest in [[philology|philological]] matters in general among Jews. Arabic became the main language of Sephardic science, philosophy, and everyday business, as had been the case with Babylonian ''[[geonim]]''. This thorough adoption of the Arabic language also greatly facilitated the assimilation of Jews into Moorish culture, and Jewish activity in a variety of professions, including medicine, commerce, finance, and agriculture increased.\n\nBy the 9th century, some members of the Sephardic community felt confident enough to take part in [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] amongst Christians. This included the heated correspondences sent between [[Bishop Bodo|Bodo Eleazar]], a former Christian [[deacon]] who had converted to Judaism in 838, and the Bishop of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] [[\u00c1lvaro of C\u00f3rdoba (Mozarab)|Paulus Albarus]], who had converted from Judaism to Christianity. Each man, using such [[epithets]] as \"wretched compiler\", tried to convince the other to return to his former faith, to no avail.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe Golden Age is most closely identified with the reign of [[Abd al-Rahman III]] (882\u2013942), the first independent [[Caliph of Cordoba]], and in particular with the career of his Jewish councilor, [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]] (882\u2013942). Within this context of cultural [[patronage]], studies in Hebrew, literature, and linguistics flourished.\n\nHasdai benefitted world Jewry not only indirectly by creating a favorable environment for scholarly pursuits within Iberia, but also by using his influence to intervene on behalf of foreign Jews: in his letter to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Helena Lekapene|Princess Helena]], he requested protection for the Jews under Byzantine rule, attesting to the fair treatment of the Christians of ''al-Andalus'', and perhaps indicating that such was contingent on the treatment of Jews abroad.\n\nOne notable contribution to Christian intellectualism is [[Ibn Gabirol]]'s [[Neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] ''Fons Vitae'' (\"The Source of Life;\" \"Mekor Hayyim\"). Thought by many to have been written by a Christian, this work was admired by Christians and studied in monasteries throughout the Middle Ages, though the work of Solomon Munk in the 19th century proved that the author of ''Fons Vitae'' was the Jewish ibn Gabirol.<ref>Richard Gottheil, Stephen S.

Mainly in [[Toledo School of Translators|Toledo]], texts were translated between Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin. In translating the great works of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek into Latin, Iberian Jews were instrumental in bringing the fields of science and philosophy, which formed much of the basis of [[Renaissance]] learning, into the rest of Europe.\n\nIn the early 11th century centralized authority based at Cordoba broke down following the [[Berber people|Berber]] invasion and the ousting of the Umayyads. In its stead arose the independent ''[[taifa]]'' principalities under the rule of local [[Muladi]], Arab, Berber, or [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] leaders. Rather than having a stifling effect, the disintegration of the caliphate expanded the opportunities to Jewish and other professionals. The services of Jewish scientists, doctors, traders, poets, and scholars were generally valued by Christian and Muslim rulers of regional centers, especially as order was restored in recently conquered towns. Rabbi [[Samuel ha-Nagid]] (ibn Naghrela) was the Vizier of [[Granada]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] who was slain by an incited mob along with most of the Jewish community. The remnant fled to [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]].\n\n[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|Observing the [[Havdalah]] ritual, 14th-century Spain|alt=]]\nThe first major and most violent persecution in Islamic Spain was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city, after rumors spread that the powerful vizier was plotting to kill the weak-minded and drunk King [[Badis ibn Habus]].<ref> Nagdela (Nagrela), Abu Husain Joseph Ibn by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed.</ref> According to the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, \"More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day,<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref> a number contested by some historians who deem it to be an example of \"the usual hyperbole in numerical estimates, with which history abounds.\"<ref> Erika Spivakovsky (1971). \"The Jewish presence in Granada\".

These more intolerant sects abhorred the liberality of the Islamic culture of ''al-Andalus'', including the position of authority some ''dhimmis'' held over Muslims. When the Almohads gave the Jews a choice of either death or conversion to Islam, many Jews emigrated. Some, such as the family of [[Maimonides]], fled south and east to the more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''Reconquista'' continued in the north throughout the 12th century. As various Arab lands fell to the Christians, conditions for some Jews in the emerging Christian kingdoms became increasingly favorable. As had happened during the reconstruction of towns following the breakdown of authority under the Umayyads, the services of Jews were employed by the victorious Christian leaders. Sephardic knowledge of the language and culture of the enemy, their skills as diplomats and professionals, as well as their desire for relief from intolerable conditions&nbsp;\u2014 the very same reasons that they had proved useful to the Arabs in the early stages of the Muslim invasion&nbsp;\u2014 made their services very valuable.\n\nHowever, the Jews from the Muslim south were not entirely secure in their northward migrations. Old prejudices were compounded by newer ones. Suspicions of complicity with the Muslims were alive and well as Jews immigrated, speaking Arabic. However, many of the newly arrived Jews of the north prospered during the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The majority of Latin documentation regarding Jews during this period refers to their landed property, fields, and vineyards.\n\nIn many ways life had come full circle for the Sephardim of ''al-Andalus''. As conditions became more oppressive during the 12th and 13th centuries, Jews again looked to an outside culture for relief. Christian leaders of reconquered cities granted them extensive autonomy, and Jewish scholarship recovered somewhat and developed as communities grew in size and importance. However, the Reconquista Jews never reached the same heights as had those of the Golden Age.\n\n=== After the Reconquista ===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Communities}}\n\nAmong the Sephardim were many who were the descendants, or heads, of wealthy families and who, as ''[[Marranos]]'', had occupied prominent positions in the countries they had left. Some had been state officials, others had held positions of dignity within the Church; many had been the heads of large banking-houses and mercantile establishments, and some were physicians or scholars who had officiated as teachers in high schools.\nTheir Spanish or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was a [[lingua franca]] that enabled Sephardim from different countries to engage in commerce and diplomacy.\n\nWith their social equals they associated freely, without regard to religion and more likely with regard to equivalent or comparative education, for they were generally well read, which became a tradition and expectation. They were received at the courts of sultans, kings, and princes, and often were employed as ambassadors, envoys, or agents. The number of Sephardim who have rendered important services to different countries is considerable as [[Samuel Abravanel]] (or \"Abrabanel\"\u2014financial councilor to the viceroy of [[Naples]]) or Moses Curiel (or \"Jeromino Nunes da Costa\"-serving as Agent to the Crown of Portugal in the [[United Provinces (Low Countries)|United Provinces]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL|first=JONATHAN I.|date=1987|journal=Studia Rosenthaliana|volume=21|issue=1|pages=14\u201334|issn=0039-3347|jstor=41481641|title=Duarte Nunes da Costa (Jacob Curiel), of Hamburg, Sephardi Nobleman and Communal Leader (1585-1664)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UUUZ1fVWdvQC&pg=PA650&lpg=PA650&dq=geronimo+nunes+da+costa#v=onepage&q=geronimo%20nunes%20da%20costa&f=false|title=Cultures of the Jews: A New History|last=Biale|first=David|date=2012-08-29|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307483461|language=en}}</ref> Among other names mentioned are those of Belmonte, [[Joseph Nasi|Nasi]], [[Francisco Pacheco]], Blas, [[Pedro de Herrera]], [[Palache]], [[Pimentel (surname)|Pimentel]], [[Azevedo]], Sagaste, [[Joseph Salvador|Salvador]], [[Sasportas]], [[Costa (surname)|Costa]], [[Curiel]], [[Cansino]], [[Sch\u00f6nenberg (surname)|Sch\u00f6nenberg]], Sapoznik (Zapatero), [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], Miranda, [[Toledano]], [[Pereira (surname)|Pereira]], and [[Teixeira]].\n\nThe Sephardim distinguished themselves as physicians and statesmen, and won the favor of rulers and princes, in both the Christian and the Islamic world. That the Sephardim were selected for prominent positions in every country where they settled was only in part due to the fact that Spanish had become a world-language through the expansion of Spain into the world spanning Spanish Empire\u2014the cosmopolitan cultural background after long associations with Islamic scholars of the Sephardic families also made them extremely well educated for the [[historical era|times]], even well into the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]].\n\nFor a long time the Sephardim took an active part in [[Spanish literature]]; they wrote in prose and in rhyme, and were the authors of theological, philosophical, [[wikt:belletristic|belletristic]] (aesthetic rather than content based writing), pedagogic (teaching), and mathematical works. The rabbis, who, in common with all the Sephardim, emphasized a pure and euphonious pronunciation of Hebrew, delivered their sermons in Spanish or in Portuguese. Several of these sermons have appeared in print. Their thirst for knowledge, together with the fact that they associated freely with the outer world, led the Sephardim to establish new educational systems. Wherever they settled, they founded schools that used Spanish as the medium of instruction.\nTheatre in Constantinople was in Jud\u00e6o-Spanish since it was forbidden to Muslims.\n\n[[File:Massacre de lisboa.jpg|thumb|A representation of the 1506 [[Lisbon Massacre|Jewish Massacre]] in Lisbon.|alt=]]\nIn Portugal the Sephardim were given important roles in the sociopolitical sphere and enjoyed a certain amount of protection from the Crown (e.g. [[Yahia Ben Yahia]], first \"Rabino Maior\" of Portugal and supervisor of the public revenue of the first King of Portugal, [[Don (honorific)|D.]] [[Afonso Henriques]]). Even with the increasing pressure from the Catholic Church this state of affairs remained more or less constant and the number of Jews in Portugal grew with those running from Spain. This changed with the marriage of D. [[Manuel I of Portugal]] with the daughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of the newly born Spain. In 1497 the Decree ordering the expulsion or forced conversion of all the Jews was passed, and the Sephardim either fled or went into secrecy under the guise of \"Crist\u00e3os Novos\", i.e. [[New Christians]] (this Decree was symbolically revoked in 1996 by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Parliament]]). Those who fled to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] were only allowed to land provided they received baptism. Those who were fortunate enough to reach the [[Ottoman Empire]] had a better fate: the Sultan [[Bayezid II]] sarcastically{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} sent his thanks to Ferdinand for sending him some of his best subjects, thus \"impoverishing his own lands while enriching his (Bayezid's)\". Jews arriving in the Ottoman Empire were mostly resettled in and around [[Thessalonica]] and to some extent in [[Constantinople]] and [[\u0130zmir]]. This was followed by a [[Marrano#Massacre at Lisbon|great massacre of Jews in the city of]] [[Lisbon]] in 1506 and the establishment of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in 1536. This caused the flight of the Portuguese Jewish community, which continued until the extinction of the Courts of Inquisition in 1821; by then there were very few Jews in Portugal.\n\nIn [[Amsterdam]], where Jews were especially prominent in the 17th century on account of their number, wealth, education, and influence, they established poetical academies after Spanish models; two of these were the ''Academia de los Sitibundos'' and the ''Academia de los Floridos''. In the same city they also organized the first Jewish educational institution, with graduate classes in which, in addition to [[Talmud]]ic studies, instruction was given in the [[Hebrew language]]. The most important synagogue, or [[Synagogue|Esnoga]], as it is usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, is the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]]\u2014usually considered the \"mother synagogue\", and the historical centre of the Amsterdam [[minhag]].\n\nA sizable Sephardic community had settled in [[Morocco]] and other [[North Africa|Northern African]] countries, which were colonized by France in the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the ''d\u00e9cret Cr\u00e9mieux'' (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and laws, which many did not want to do). When France withdrew from [[Algeria]] in 1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some tensions between some of those communities and the earlier French Jewish population (who were mostly [[Ashkenazi Jews]]), and with Arabic-Muslim communities.\n\n=== In the Age of Discoveries ===\n[[File:Sepharadic Migrations.jpg|thumb|Migrations and Settlements of the Spanish Jews]]\n\nThe largest part of Spanish Jews expelled in 1492 fled to Portugal, where they eluded persecution for a few years. The [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Jewish community in Portugal]] was perhaps then some 15% of that country's population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They were declared Christians by Royal decree unless they left, but the King hindered their departure, needing their artisanship and working population for Portugal's overseas enterprises and territories. Later Sephardic Jews settled in many trade areas controlled by the Empire of Philip II and others. With various countries in Europe also the Sephardi Jews established commercial relations. In a letter dated 25 November 1622, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] invites Jews of Amsterdam to settle in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]], where, among other privileges, the free exercise of their religion would be assured to them.\n\n[[\u00c1lvaro Caminha]], in [[Cape Verde]] islands, who received the land as a grant from the crown, established a colony with Jews forced to stay on the island of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]. [[Pr\u00edncipe]] island was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, the Jewish settlement was a success and their descendants settled many parts of Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |title=The Expulsion 1492 Chronicles, section XI: \"The Vale of Tears\", quoting Joseph Hacohen (1496-1577); also, section XVII, quoting 16th century author Samuel Usque |publisher=Aish.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1579 [[Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva]] a Portuguese-born [[Converso]], Spanish-Crown officer, was awarded a large swath of territory in New Spain, known as [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Nuevo Reino de Le\u00f3n]]. He founded settlements with other conversos that would later become [[Monterrey]].\n\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - Interieur van de Portugese synagoge te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Portuguese synagogue]] in Amsterdam, c. 1680]]\n\nIn particular, Jews established the relations between the Dutch and South America. They contributed to the establishment of the Dutch West Indies Company in 1621, and some were members of the directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect through Francisco Ribeiro, a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. Some years afterward, when the Dutch in Brazil appealed to the Netherlands for craftsmen of all kinds, many Jews went to Brazil. About 600 Jews left Amsterdam in 1642, accompanied by two distinguished scholars&mdash;[[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] and [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]]. Jews supported the Dutch in the struggle between the Netherlands and Portugal for possession of Brazil.\n\n[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumbnail|right|Execution of Mariana de Carabajal in [[Mexico City]], daughter of [[Francisca Nu\u00f1ez de Carabajal]], in 1601 by the ''Santo Oficio''.]]\n\nIn 1642, Aboab da Fonseca was appointed rabbi at [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in the Dutch colony of [[Pernambuco]] ([[Recife]]), [[Brazil]]. Most of the white inhabitants of the town were Sephardic Jews from Portugal who had been banned by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] to this town at the other side of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1624, the colony had been occupied by the Dutch. By becoming the rabbi of the community, Aboab da Fonseca was the first appointed rabbi of the Americas. The name of his congregation was [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] and the community had a synagogue, a [[mikveh]] and a [[yeshiva]] as well. However, during the time he was rabbi in Pernambuco, the Portuguese re-occupied the place again in 1654, after a struggle of nine years. Aboab da Fonseca managed to return to Amsterdam after the occupation of the Portuguese. Members of his community immigrated to [[North America]] and were among the founders of [[New York City]], but some Jews took refuge in [[Serid\u00f3]].\n\nBesides merchants, a great number of physicians were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice (April 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing, bookselling, and the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery.\n\nJonathan Ray, a professor of Jewish theological studies, has argued that the community of Sephardim was formed more during the 1600s than the medieval period. He explains that prior to expulsion Spanish Jewish communities did not have a shared identity in the sense that developed in diaspora. They did not carry any particular Hispano-Jewish identity into exile with them, but certain shared cultural traits contributed to the formation of the diaspora community from what had historically been independent communities.<ref>Jonathan S Ray.

Sephardi Jewish communities from France and the Netherlands in the northwest to Yugoslavia and Greece in the southeast almost disappeared.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, the European Sephardi community was concentrated in Southeastern Europe countries of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Its leading centers were in [[Salonika]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Sofia]]. The experience of Jewish communities in those countries during the war varied greatly and depended on the type of regime under which they fell.\n\nThe Jewish communities of Yugoslavia and northern Greece, including the 50,000 Jews of Salonika, fell under direct [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation in April 1941]] and bore the full weight and intensity of Nazi repressive measures from dispossession, humiliation, and forced labor to hostage taking, and finally deportation to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006079|title=Sephardi Jews during the Holocaust|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Jewish population of southern Greece fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] who eschewed the enactment of anti-Jewish legislation and resisted whenever possible German efforts to transfer them to occupied Poland, until the surrender of Italy on 8 September 1943 brought the Jews under German control.\n\nSephardi Jews in Bosnia and Croatia were ruled by a German-created [[Independent State of Croatia]] state from April 1941, which subjected them to pogrom-like actions before herding them into local camps where they were murdered side by side with Serbs and Roma (see [[Porajmos]]). The Jews of Macedonia and Thrace were controlled by Bulgarian occupation forces, which after rendering them stateless, rounded them up and turned them over to the Germans for deportation.\n\nFinally, the Jews of Bulgaria proper were under the rule of a Nazi ally that subjected them to ruinous anti-Jewish legislation, but ultimately yielded to pressure from Bulgarian parliamentarians, clerics, and intellectuals not to deport them. More than 50,000 [[Bulgarian Jews]] were thus saved.\n\nThe Jews in North Africa identified themselves only as Jews or European Jews, having been westernized by French and Italian colonization. During World War II and until [[Operation Torch]], the Jews of [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], [[French Algeria|Algeria]], and [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunesia]], governed by pro-Nazi [[Vichy France]], suffered the same antisemitic legislation that Jews suffered in France mainland. They did not, however, directly suffer the more extreme Nazi Germany antisemitic policies, and nor did the Jews in [[Italian Libya]]. The Jewish communities in those European North Africa countries, in Bulgaria, and in Denmark were the only ones who were spared the mass deportation and mass murder that afflicted other Jewish communities. [[Operation Torch]] therefore saved more than 400,000 Jews in European North Africa.\n\n=== Later history and culture ===\nThe Jews in French North Africa were awarded French citizenship by the 1870 [[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree]]. They were therefore considered part of the European [[pieds noirs]] community in spite of having been established in North Africa for many centuries, rather than subject to the [[Indig\u00e9nat]] status imposed on their Muslim former neighbors. Most consequently moved to France in the late 1950s and early 1960s after [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] became independent, and they now make up a majority of the French Jewish community.\n\n{{Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}\n\nToday, the Sephardim have preserved the romances and the ancient melodies and songs of Spain and Portugal, as well as a large number of old [[Portuguese proverbs|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish proverbs]].<ref>For the largest online collection of Sephardic folk literature, visit [http://www.sephardifolklit.org/ Folk Literature of the Sephardic Jews.]</ref> A number of [[children's play]]s, like, for example, ''El Castillo'', are still popular among them, and they still manifest a fondness for the dishes peculiar to Iberia, such as the ''pastel'', or ''pastelico'', a sort of meat-pie, and the ''pan de Espa\u00f1a'', or ''pan de Le\u00f3n''. At their festivals they follow the Spanish custom of distributing ''dulces'', or ''dolces'', a confection wrapped in paper bearing a picture of the ''[[magen David]]'' (six pointed star).\n\nIn Mexico, the Sephardic community originates mainly from [[Turkey]], Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. In 1942 the ''[[Colegio Hebreo Tarbut]]'' was founded in collaboration with the [[Ashkenazi]] family and instruction was in [[Yiddish]]. In 1944 the Sephardim community established a separate \"[[Colegio Hebreo Sefarad\u00ed]]\" with 90 students where instruction was in Hebrew and complemented with classes on Jewish customs. By 1950 there were 500 students. In 1968 a group of young Sephardim created the group ''Tnuat Noar Jinujit Dor Jadash'' in support for the creation of the state of Israel. In 1972 the ''Majazike Tora'' institute is created aiming to prepare young male Jews for their [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaradi.org.mx/PaginaWebCHS/Presentacion_Institucional/ComunidadSefaradi4.htm|title=History of the Sephardim Community in Mexico|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023083604/http://sefaradi.org.mx/PaginaWebCHS/Presentacion_Institucional/ComunidadSefaradi4.htm|archivedate=23 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhile the majority of [[American Jews]] today are Ashkenazim, in Colonial times Sephardim made up the majority of the Jewish population. For example, the 1654 Jews who arrived in [[New Amsterdam]] fled from the colony of [[Recife]], Brazil after the Portuguese seized it from the Dutch. Through most of the 18th century, American synagogues conducted and recorded their business in Portuguese, even if their daily language was English. It was not until widespread German immigration to the United States in the 19th century that the tables turned and Ashkenazim (initially from Germany but by the 20th century from Eastern Europe) began to dominate the American Jewish landscape.\n\nThe Sephardim usually have followed the general rules for [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese name]]s. Many used to bear Portuguese and Spanish names; however, it is noteworthy that a large number of Sephardic names are of [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] roots and are totally absent in Iberian patronyms and are therefore often seen as typically Jewish. Many of the names are associated with non-Jewish (Christian) families and individuals, and are by no means exclusive to Jews. After 1492, many [[marranos]] changed their names to hide their Jewish origins and avoid persecution, adopting professions and even translating such patronyms to local languages like Arabic and even German.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It was common to choose the name of the Parish Church where they have been baptized into the Christian faith, such as Santa Cruz or the common name of the word \"Messiah\" (Savior/Salvador), or adopted the name of their Christian godparents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Cecil|title=A History of the Marranos|publisher=Schocken Books|isbn=978-0-8052-0463-6|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmarrano00roth|year=1975}}</ref> Dr. Mark Hilton's research demonstrated in IPS DNA testing that the last name of marranos linked with the location of the local parish were correlated 89.3%\n\nIn contrast to Ashkenazic Jews, who do not name newborn children after living relatives, Sephardic Jews often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if they are still alive. The first son and daughter are traditionally named after the paternal grandparents, then the maternal parents' names are next in line for the remaining children. After that, additional children's names are \"free\", so to speak, meaning that one can choose whatever name, without any more \"naming obligations.\" The only instance in which Sephardic Jews will not name after their own parents is when one of the spouses shares a common first name with a mother/father-in-law (since Jews will not name their children after themselves.) There are times though when the \"free\" names are used to honor the memory of a deceased relative who died young or childless. These conflicting naming conventions can be troublesome when children are born into mixed Ashkenazic-Sephardic households.\n\nA notable exception to the distinct Ashkenazi and Sephardi naming traditions is found among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim have for centuries followed the tradition otherwise attributed to Sephardim. See [[Chuts]].\n\n===Citizenship laws in Spain and Portugal===\nSince April 2013, Sephardim who are descendants of those expelled in the inquisition are entitled to claim Portuguese citizenship provided that they \"belong to a Sephardic community of Portuguese origin with ties to Portugal\".

This article deals with Sephardim within the narrower ethnic definition.\n\nHistorically, the [[vernacular]] languages of Sephardim and their descendants have been variants of either [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], though other tongues had been adopted and adapted throughout their history. The historical forms of Spanish that differing Sephardic communities spoke communally was determined by the date of their departure from Iberia, and their condition of departure as Jews or [[New Christians]].\n\n[[Judaeo-Spanish]], sometimes called \"Ladino Oriental\" (Eastern [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]]), is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] derived from [[Old Spanish language|Old Spanish]], incorporating elements from all the old Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]], and was spoken by what became the Eastern Sephardim, who settled in the Eastern Mediterranean, taken with them in the 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. This dialect was further influenced by [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]] vocabulary in the differing lands of their exile. [[Haketia]] (also known as \"Tetouani\" in Algeria), an Arabic-influenced Judaeo-Spanish variety also derived from Old Spanish, with numerous Hebrew and Aramaic terms was spoken by North African Sephardim, taken with them in the 15th century after the expulsion from Spain in 1492. The main feature of this dialect is the heavy influence of the Jebli Arabic dialect of northern Morocco. [[Early Modern Spanish]] and [[History of Portuguese|Early Modern Portuguese]], including in a mixture of the two was traditionally spoken or used liturgically by the [[Converso|ex-converso]] [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]], taken with them during their later migration out of Iberia between the 16th and 18th centuries as [[conversos]], after which they reverted to Judaism.

In its most basic form, this broad religious definition of a Sephardi refers to any Jew, of any ethnic background, who follows the customs and traditions of Sepharad. For religious purposes, and in modern Israel, \"Sephardim\" is most often used in this wider sense which encompasses most non-Ashkenazi Jews who are not ethnically Sephardi, but are in most instances of West Asian or North African origin, but who nonetheless commonly use a Sephardic style of liturgy, meaning a majority of [[Mizrahi Jews]].\n\nThe term ''Sephardi'' in the broad sense, thus describes the ''[[nusach]]'' ([[Hebrew language]], \"liturgical tradition\") used by Sephardi Jews in their [[Siddur]] (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, order of prayers, text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Sephardim traditionally pray using ''Minhag Sefarad.'' The term ''[[Nusach Sefard]]'' or ''Nusach Sfarad'' does not refer to the liturgy generally recited by Sephardim proper or even Sephardi in a broader sense, but rather to an alternative Eastern European liturgy used by many [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]] who are in fact [[Ashkenazi]].\n\nAdditionally, [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]], whose branch of practiced Judaism is known as [[Haymanot]], have recently come under the umbrella of Israel's already broad Sephardic [[Chief Rabbi]]nate.\n\n== Divisions ==\nThe divisions among Sephardim and their descendants today are largely a result of the consequences of the Royal edicts of expulsion. Both the Spanish and Portuguese edicts ordered their respective Jewish residents to choose one of only three options:\n# to convert to Catholicism and therefore to be allowed to remain within the kingdom,\n# to remain Jewish and to be expelled by the stipulated deadline, or \n# to be [[Summary execution|summarily executed]].\n\nIn the case of the Alhambra Decree of 1492, the primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large [[converso]] population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391, and as such were not subject to the Decree or to expulsion, yet remained under the watchful eye of the Spanish Inquisition. It has been argued by British scholar Henry Kamen, that \"the real purpose of the 1492 edict likely was not expulsion, but compulsory conversion and assimilation of all Spanish Jews, a process which had been underway for a number of centuries. Indeed, a further number of those Jews who had not yet joined the converso community finally chose to convert and avoid expulsion as a result of the edict. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution during the prior century, between 200,000 and 250,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between one third and one half of Spain's remaining 100,000 non-converted Jews chose exile, with an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=History of a Tragedy |last=P\u00e9rez |first=Joseph |author-link=Joseph P\u00e9rez |orig-year=2009 |year=2012 |page=17}}</ref>\n\nForeseeing the economic aftermath of a similar Jewish flight from Portugal, King Manuel's decree five years later was largely pro-forma to appease a precondition the Spanish monarchs had set for him if he wished to marry their daughter. While the stipulations were similar in the Portuguese decree, King Manuel then largely prevented Portugal's Jews from leaving, by blocking Portugal's ports of exit. This failure to leave Portugal was then reasoned by the king to signify a default acceptance of Catholicism by the Jews, and the king then proceeded to proclaim them New Christians. Actual physical [[forced conversion]]s, however, were also experienced throughout Portugal.\n\nSephardi Jews, therefore, encompass Jews descended from those Jews who left the Iberian Peninsula as Jews by the expiration of the respective decreed deadlines. This group is further divided between those who fled south to [[North Africa]], as opposed to those who fled eastwards to the [[Balkans]], [[West Asia]] and beyond. Also included among Sephardi Jews are those who descend from \"[[New Christian]]\" conversos, but then returned to Judaism after leaving Iberia, largely after reaching Southern and Western Europe.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} From these regions, many would again migrate, this time to the non-Iberian territories of the Americas. Additional to all these Sephardic Jewish groups are the descendants of those New Christian conversos who either remained in Iberia, or moved from Iberia directly to the Iberian colonial possessions across what are today the various [[Latin America]]n countries. The descendants of this group of conversos, for historical reasons and circumstances, were never able to formally return to the Jewish religion.\n\nAll these sub-groups are defined by a combination of geography, identity, religious evolution, language evolution, and the timeframe of their reversion (for those who had in the interim undergone a temporary nominal [[religious conversion|conversion]] to Catholicism) or non-reversion back to Judaism.\n\nThese Sephardic sub-groups are separate from any pre-existing local Jewish communities they encountered in their new areas of settlement. From the perspective of the present day, the first three sub-groups appeared to have developed as separate branches, each with its own traditions. <!-- Most Sephardic Jews, especially those from [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]], carry the tradition that they are the direct descendants of [[Pharez]] the son of [[Judah (biblical figure)]].--><!--Can we get a citation for that?-->\n\nIn earlier centuries, and as late as the editing of the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' at the beginning of the 20th century, they were usually regarded as together forming a continuum. The [[Jewish community of Livorno]] acted as the clearing-house of personnel and traditions among the first three sub-groups; it also developed as the chief publishing centre.{{Synthesis inline|date=February 2011}}\n\n=== Eastern Sephardim ===\n{{main|Eastern Sephardim}}\n[[File:1900 photo of a Sephardi couple from Sarajevo.png|thumb|Sephardi Jewish couple from [[Sarajevo]] in traditional clothing (1900)]]\n\nEastern Sephardim comprise the descendants of the expellees from Spain who left as Jews in 1492 or prior. This sub-group of Sephardim settled mostly [[History of the Jews in Turkey|in various parts of the Ottoman Empire]], which included areas in the [[Near East]] ([[West Asia]]'s [[Middle East]] such as [[Anatolia]], the [[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]), the [[Balkans]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. They settled particularly in European cities ruled by the Ottoman Empire including [[History of the Jews of Thessaloniki|Salonica]] in what is today [[Greece]], [[Constantinople]] which today is known as [[Istanbul]] on the European portion of modern [[Turkey]], and [[Sarajevo]] in what is today [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Sephardic Jews also lived in Bulgaria, where they incorporated into their community the [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] Jews they found already living there. They had a presence as well in [[Walachia]] in what is today southern [[Romania]], where there is still a functioning Sephardic Synagogue.<ref>[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Romania YIVO|Romania].</ref> Their traditional language is referred to as [[Judezmo]] (\"Jewish [language]\"); it is [[Judaeo-Spanish]] sometimes also known as Ladino,  which consisted of the medieval Spanish and Portuguese they spoke in Iberia, with admixtures of Hebrew, and the languages around them, especially Turkish. This Judeo-Spanish language was often written in [[Rashi script]].\n[[File:Epoca_1902_Issue.jpg|thumb|A 1902 Issue of ''La Epoca'', a Ladino newspaper from Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]])]]\nSome Sephardim went further east to West Asian territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]], settling among the long-established Arabic-speaking Jewish communities in [[History of the Jews in Syria|Damascus]] and [[History of the Jews in Syria|Aleppo]] in Syria, as well as in the [[Land of Israel]] itself, and as far as [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdad]] in Iraq. Although technically a North African Ottoman region, those who settled [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Alexandria]] in Egypt are also included due to its cultural proximity to the West Asian provinces.\n\nFor the most part, Eastern Sephardim did not maintain their own separate Sephardic religious and cultural institutions from the pre-existing Jews, but instead the local Jews came to adopt the liturgical customs of the recent Sephardic arrivals.\n\nAdditionally, Eastern Sephardim in European areas of the Ottoman Empire retained their culture and language, while those in the West Asian portion gave up their language and adopted the local Judeo-Arabic dialect. This latter phenomenon is just one of the factors which has today led to the broader religious definition of Sephardi.\n\nWhile on the one hand the Jewish communities in Lebanon, Syria and Egypt are partly of Spanish Jewish origin and they are therefore Sephardim proper, conversely the great majority of the Jewish communities in Iraq, and all of those from Iran, Eastern Syria, Yemen and Eastern Turkey are pre-existing indigenous Jewish populations who have adopted Sephardic rite and traditions through cultural diffusion, and are properly termed [[Mizrahi Jews]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} This has also been seen to be the case in modern DNA research, where Syrian Jews, while clustering within the various world Jewish groups (where most Jewish groups cluster closely together at large compared to non-Jews), the Syrian Jews nevertheless genetically cluster closest with Sephardim proper counterparts in other regions of Sephardic settlement rather than the Mizrahi Jews geographically closest to them.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nA few of the Eastern Sephardim followed the spice trade routes as far as the [[Malabar coast]] of southern [[India]], where they settled among the established [[Cochin Jews|Cochin Jewish]] community, again imparting their culture and customs to the local Jews.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. Additionally, there was a large presence of Jews and crypto-Jews of Portuguese origin in the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]]. Their presence aroused the anger of [[Gaspar Jorge de Le\u00e3o Pereira]], the first archbishop of Goa, who called for the initiation of the [[Goa Inquisition]] against the [[Sephardic Jews in India]].\n\nIn recent times, principally after 1948, most Eastern Sephardim have since relocated to Israel, and others to the US and Latin America.\n\nEastern Sephardim still often carry common Spanish surnames, as well as other specifically Sephardic surnames from 15th-century Spain with Arabic or Hebrew language origins (such as [[Azoulay]], [[Abulafia (surname)|Abulafia]], [[Abravanel]]) which have since disappeared from Spain when those that stayed behind as conversos adopted surnames that were solely Spanish in origin. Other Eastern Sephardim have since also translated their Hispanic surnames into the languages of the regions they settled in, or have modified them to sound more local.\n\n=== North African Sephardim ===\n[[File:Moroccan_wedding_dress,_19-20th_century_(3551817349).jpg|thumb|19th century Moroccan Sephardic wedding dress.]]\n{{main|North African Sephardim}}North African Sephardim consist of the descendants of the expellees from Spain who also left as Jews in 1492.

Settling mostly in [[Moroccan Jews|Morocco]] and [[History of the Jews in Algeria|Algeria]], they spoke a variant of [[Judaeo-Spanish]] known as [[Haketia]]. They also spoke [[Judeo-Arabic]] in a majority of cases. They settled in the areas with already established Arabic-speaking Jewish communities in North Africa and eventually merged with them to form new communities based solely on [[Sephardic]] customs.{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nSeveral of the [[Moroccan Jews]] emigrated back to the Iberian Peninsula to form the core of the [[History of the Jews in Gibraltar|Gibraltar Jews]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} \n\nIn the 19th century, modern Spanish, French and Italian gradually replaced Haketia and Judeo-Arabic as the mother tongue among most Moroccan Sephardim and other North African Sephardim.<ref>Samuel Toledano, ''Espagne: les retrouvailles'', in: ''Les Juifs du Maroc'' (Editions du Scribe, Paris 1992)</ref>\n\nIn recent times, with the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], principally after the creation of Israel in 1948, most North African Sephardim have relocated to Israel (total pop. est. 1,400,000 in 2015), and most others to France (361,000) and the US (300,000), as well as other countries.

Born into a large New York Sephardi family.]]\n[[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]] (also known more ambiguously as \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\", \"Spanish Jews\", \"Portuguese Jews\" and \"Jews of the Portuguese Nation\") are the community of Jewish ex-conversos whose families initially remained in Spain and Portugal as ostensible [[New Christians]], that is, as [[Anusim]] or \"forced [converts]\". Western Sephardim are further sub-divided into an [[Old World]] branch and a [[New World]] branch.\n\nHenry Kamen and Joseph Perez estimate that of the total Jewish origin population of Spain at the time of the issuance of the Alhambra Decree, those who chose to remain in Spain represented the majority, up to 300,000 of a total Jewish origin population of 350,000. Furthermore, a significant number returned to Spain in the years following the expulsion, on condition of converting to Catholicism, the Crown guaranteeing they could recover their property at the same price at which it was sold.\n\nDiscrimination against this large community of conversos nevertheless remained, and those who secretly practiced the Jewish faith specifically suffered severe episodes of persecution by the Inquisition. The last episode of persecution occurred in the mid-18th century. External migrations out of the Iberian peninsula coincided with these episodes of increased persecution by the Inquisition.\n\nAs a result of this discrimination and persecution, a small number of [[marranos]] (conversos who secretly practiced Judaism) later emigrated to more religiously tolerant Old World countries outside the [[Hispanosphere|Iberian cultural sphere]] such as the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[England]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} In these lands conversos reverted to Judaism, rejoining the Jewish community sometimes up to the third or even fourth generations after the initial decrees stipulating conversion, expulsion, or death. It is these returnees to Judaism which represent Old World Western Sephardim.\n\nNew World Western Sephardim, on the other hand, are the descendants of those Jewish-origin New Christian conversos who accompanied the millions of Old Christian Spaniards and Portuguese that emigrated to the Americas. More specifically, New World Western Sephardim are those Western Sephardim whose converso ancestors migrated to various of the non-Iberian colonies in the Americas in whose jurisdictions they could return to Judaism.\n\nNew World Western Sephardim are juxtaposed to yet another group of descendants of conversos who settled in the Iberian colonies of the Americas who could not revert to Judaism. These comprise the related but distinct group known as [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] (see section below).\n\nDue to the presence of the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisition in the Iberian American territories, initially converso immigration was barred throughout much of Ibero-America. Because of this, very few converso immigrants in Iberian American colonies ever reverted to Judaism. Of those conversos in the New World who did return to Judaism, it was principally those who had come via an initial respite of refuge in the [[Netherlands]] and/or who were settling the New World Dutch colonies such as [[Cura\u00e7ao]] and the area then known as New Holland (also called [[Dutch Brazil]]). Dutch Brazil was the northern portion of the colony of Brazil ruled by the Dutch for under a quarter of a century before it also fell to the Portuguese who ruled the remainder of Brazil. Jews who had only recently reverted in Dutch Brazil then again had to flee to other Dutch-ruled colonies in the Americas, including joining brethren in Cura\u00e7ao, but also migrating to [[New Amsterdam]], in what is today [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nAll of the oldest congregations in the non-Iberian colonial possessions in the Americas were founded by Western Sephardim, many who arrived in the then Dutch-ruled [[New Amsterdam]], with their synagogues being in the tradition of \"Spanish and Portuguese Jews\".\n\nIn the United States in particular, [[Congregation Shearith Israel]], established in 1654, in today's New York City, is the oldest Jewish congregation in the United States. Its present building dates from 1897. Congregation [[Jeshuat Israel]] in Newport, Rhode Island, is dated to sometime after the arrival there of Western Sephardim in 1658 and prior to the 1677 purchase of a communal cemetery, now known as [[Touro Cemetery]]. See also [[List of the oldest synagogues in the United States]].\n\nThe intermittent period of residence in Portugal (after the initial fleeing from Spain) for the ancestors of many Western Sephardim (whether Old World or New World) is a reason why the surnames of many Western Sephardim tend to be Portuguese variations of common Spanish surnames, though some are still Spanish.\n\nAmong a few notable figures with roots in Western Sephardim are the current president of Venezuela, [[Nicol\u00e1s Maduro]], and former [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]]. Both descend from Western Sephardim who left Portugal for the Netherlands, and in the case of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, from the Netherlands to [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and ultimately Venezuela.\n\n=== Sephardic Bnei Anusim ===\n{{See also|Sephardic Bnei Anusim|Conversos|New Christians}}\n[[File:Sephardi Jew family Argentina.jpg|thumb|Sephardi family from Misiones Province, Argentina, circa 1900.]]\nThe [[Sephardic Bnei Anusim]] consists of the contemporary and largely nominal [[Christianity|Christian]] descendants of assimilated 15th century Sephardic [[anusim]].

In the last 5 to 10 years, however, \"organized groups of [Sephardic] Benei Anusim in [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Dominican Republic]] and in [[Iberia|Sefarad]] [Iberia] itself\"<ref name=\"Moshe 2012 20\">{{cite book|first=ben Levi|last=Moshe|isbn=9781463327064|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OgzBQxoODWcC&pg=PA20&dq=Existen+ya+grupos+de+Benei+Anusim+organizados#v=onepage&q=Existen%20ya%20grupos%20de%20Benei%20Anusim%20organizados&f=false|title=La Yeshiv\u00e1 Benei Anusim: El Manual de Estudios Para Entender las Diferencias Entre el Cristianismo y el Judaismo|publisher=Palibrio|year=2012|page=20}}</ref> have now been established, some of whose members have formally reverted to [[Judaism]], leading to the emergence of Neo-Western Sephardim (see group below).\n\nThe [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] estimates the Sephardic Bnei Anusim population to number in the millions.<ref name=\"nytimes.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/14/world/europe/interest-in-israel-as-spain-weighs-citizenship-for-sephardic-jews.html|title=Prospect of Spanish Citizenship Appeals to Descendants of Jews Expelled in 1492|date=16 February 2014|work=The New York Times}}</ref> Their population size is several times larger than the three Jewish-integrated Sephardi descendant sub-groups combined, consisting of [[Sephardi Jews#Eastern Sephardim|Eastern Sephardim]], [[Sephardi Jews#North African Sephardim|North African Sephardim]], and the ex-converso [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Western Sephardim]] (both New World and Old World branches).\n\nAlthough numerically superior, Sephardic Bnei Anusim are, however, the least prominent or known sub-group of Sephardi descendants. Sephardic Bnei Anusim are also more than twice the size of the total world Jewish population as a whole, which itself also encompasses [[Ashkenazi Jews]], [[Mizrahi Jews]] and [[Jewish ethnic divisions|various other smaller groups]].\n\nUnlike the Anusim (\"forced [converts]\") who were the conversos up to the third, fourth or fifth generation (depending on the Jewish responsa) who later reverted to Judaism, the [[Bnei Anusim]] (\"[later] sons/children/descendants [of the] forced [converts]\") were the subsequent generations of descendants of the Anusim who remained hidden ever since the Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and its New World franchises. At least some Sephardic Anusim in the [[Hispanosphere]] (in Iberia, but especially in their colonies in Ibero-America) had also initially tried to revert to Judaism, or at least maintain crypto-Jewish practices in privacy. This, however, was not feasible long-term in that environment, as Judaizing conversos in Iberia and Ibero-America remained persecuted, prosecuted, and liable to conviction and execution. The Inquisition itself was only finally formally disbanded in the 19th century.\n\nHistorical documentation shedding new light on the diversity in the ethnic composition of the Iberian immigrants to the Spanish colonies of the Americas during the conquest era suggests that the number of [[New Christian]]s of Sephardi origin that actively participated in the conquest and settlement was more significant than previously estimated. A number of Spanish conquerors, administrators, settlers, have now been confirmed to have been of Sephardi origin.{{fact|date=October 2019}} Recent revelations have only come about as a result of modern DNA evidence and newly discovered records in Spain, which had been either lost or hidden, relating to conversions, marriages, baptisms, and Inquisition trials of the parents, grandparents and great grandparents of the Sephardi-origin Iberian immigrants.\n\nOverall, it is now estimated that up to 20% of modern-day Spaniards and 10% of colonial Latin America's Iberian settlers may have been of Sephardic origin, although the regional distribution of their settlement was uneven throughout the colonies. Thus, Iberian settlers of New Christian Sephardi-origin ranged anywhere from none in most areas, to as high as 1 in every 3 (approx. 30%) Iberian settlers in other areas. With Latin America's current population standing at close to 590 million people, the bulk of which consists of persons of full or partial Iberian ancestry (both [[Hispanic America|New World Hispanics]] and [[Brazilians]], whether they're [[Criollo people|criollos]], [[mestizos]] or [[mulattos]]), it is estimated that up to 50 million of these possess Sephardic Jewish ancestry to some degree.\n\nIn Iberia, settlements of known and attested populations of Bnei Anusim include those in [[Belmonte Jews|Belmonte]], in Portugal, and the [[Xuetes]] of [[Palma, Majorca|Palma de Mallorca]], in Spain. In 2011 Rabbi [[Nissim Karelitz]], a leading rabbi and Halachic authority and chairman of the Beit Din Tzedek [[Beit Din|rabbinical court]] in [[Bnei Brak]], Israel, recognized the entire Xuete community of Bnei Anusim in Palma de Mallorca, as Jews.<ref name=\"jpost.com\">[http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=228936 \"Chuetas of Majorca recognized as Jewish\"; ''Jerusalem Post'' 07/12/2011]</ref> That population alone represented approximately 18,000 people, or just over 2% of the entire population of the island. The proclamation of the Jews' default acceptance of Catholicism by the Portuguese king actually resulted in a high percentage being assimilated in the Portuguese population. Besides the Xuetas, the same is true of Spain.\n\nAlmost all Sephardic Bnei Anusim carry surnames which are known to have been used by Sephardim during the 15th century, however, per se, almost all of these surname are not specifically Sephardic, and are in fact mostly surnames of gentile Spanish or gentile Portuguese origin which only became common among Bnei Anusim because they deliberately adopted them during their conversions in an attempt to obscure their Jewish pedigrees. Very few Sephardic Bnei Anusim carry surnames that are specifically Sephardic in origin, or that are specifically found only among Bnei Ansuim.\n\n== Distribution ==\n\n===Pre-1492===\nPrior to 1492, substantial Jewish populations existed in most Spanish and Portuguese provinces. Among the larger Jewish populations in actual numbers were the Jewish communities in cities like [[Lisbon]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia|C\u00f3rdoba]], [[Seville]], [[M\u00e1laga]] and [[Granada]]. In these cities, however, Jews constituted only substantial [[Minority group|minorities]] of the overall population. In several smaller towns, however, Jews composed [[majority|majorities]] or [[wikt:plurality|pluralities]], as the towns were founded or inhabited principally by Jews. Among these towns were [[Oca\u00f1a, Spain|Oca\u00f1a]], [[Guadalajara, Castile-La Mancha|Guadalajara]], [[Buitrago del Lozoya]], [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]], [[Ribadavia]], [[Herv\u00e1s]], [[Llerena, Badajoz|Llerena]], and [[Almaz\u00e1n]].\n\nIn [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]], [[Aranda de Duero]], [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]], [[Alba de Tormes]], [[Ar\u00e9valo]], [[Burgos]], [[Calahorra]], [[Carri\u00f3n de los Condes]], [[Cu\u00e9llar]], [[Herrera del Duque]], [[Le\u00f3n (historical region)|Le\u00f3n]], [[Medina del Campo]], [[Ourense]], [[Salamanca]], [[Segovia]], [[Soria]], and [[Villal\u00f3n de Campos|Villal\u00f3n]] were home to large Jewish communities or ''[[aljama]]s''. [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] had substantial Jewish communities in the Calls of [[Girona]], [[Barcelona]], [[Tarragona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] ([[Majorca]]).\n\nThe first Jews to leave Spain settled in what is today [[Algeria]] after the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacre of 1391|various persecutions]] that took place in 1391.\n[[File:Expulsi\u00f3n_de_los_jud\u00edos.jpg|thumb|''The Expulsion of the Jews from Spain (in the year 1492)'' by [[Emilio Sala (painter)|Emilio Sala Franc\u00e9s]]]]\n\n=== Post-1492 ===\nThe [[Alhambra Decree]] (also known as the Edict of Expulsion) was an edict issued on 31 March 1492, by the joint [[Catholic Monarchs]] of [[Spain]] ([[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]) ordering the expulsion of practicing Jews from the [[Kingdom of Castile|Kingdoms of Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] and its territories and possessions by 31 July, of that year.<ref name=\"Decree-translation\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardicstudies.org/decree.html|title=The Edict of Expulsion of the Jews - 1492 Spain}}</ref> The primary purpose was to eliminate their influence on Spain's large [[converso]] population and ensure they did not revert to Judaism. Over half of Spain's Jews had converted as a result of the religious persecution and pogroms which occurred in 1391, and as such were not subject to the Decree or to expulsion. A further number of those remaining chose to avoid expulsion as a result of the edict. As a result of the Alhambra decree and persecution in prior years, over 200,000 Jews converted to Catholicism and between 40,000 and 100,000 were expelled, an indeterminate number returning to Spain in the years following the expulsion.<ref>{{cite book|title=History of a Tragedy|last=P\u00e9rez|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph P\u00e9rez|orig-year=2009|year=2012|page=17}}</ref>\n\nThe Spanish Jews who chose to leave Spain instead of converting [[Jewish diaspora|dispersed]] throughout the region of North Africa known as the [[Maghreb]]. In those regions, they often intermingled with the already existing [[Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]] Arabic-speaking communities, becoming the ancestors of the Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian and Libyan Jewish communities.\n\nMany Spanish Jews also fled to the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they were given refuge. Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], learning about the expulsion of Jews from Spain, dispatched the [[Ottoman Navy]] to bring the Jews safely to Ottoman lands, mainly to the cities of Salonika<!--Use the historical English names under the Ottomans--> (currently [[Thessaloniki]], now in [[Greece]]) and [[Smyrna]]<!--The city was known at the time in English as Smyrna until circa 1930, and the article should use the historical name even if it is now considered politically incorrect in Turkey. See Elhem Edhem's citations in [[:en:Names of Istanbul]]--> (now known in English as [[\u0130zmir]], currently in [[Turkey]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Turkey.html|title=Turkey Virtual Jewish History Tour}}</ref> Many of these Jews also settled in other parts of the Balkans ruled by the Ottomans such as the areas that are now Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia.\n\nThroughout history, scholars have given widely differing numbers of Jews expelled from Spain. However, the figure is likely to be below the 100,000 Jews who had not yet converted to Christianity by 1492, possibly as low as 40,000. Many went to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], gaining [[Expulsion of the Jews from Portugal|only a few years of respite from persecution]]. The Jewish community in Portugal (perhaps then some 10% of that country's population)<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Kayserling, Meyer. \"Hist\u00f3ria dos Judeus em Portugal\". Editora Pioneira, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1971</ref> were then declared Christians by Royal decree unless they left.\n\nSuch figures exclude the significant number of Jews who returned to Spain due to the hostile reception they received in their countries of refuge, notably Fez. The situation of returnees was legalized with the Ordinance of 10 November 1492 which established that civil and church authorities should be witness to baptism and, in the case that they were baptized before arrival, proof and witnesses of baptism were required. Furthermore, all property could be recovered by returnees at the same price at which it was sold. Returnees are documented as late as 1499. On the other hand, the Provision of the Royal Council of 24 October 1493 set harsh sanctions for those who slandered these New Christians with insulting terms such as ''tornadizos''.<ref>{{cite book|last=P\u00e9rez|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph P\u00e9rez|orig-year=1993|year=2013|page=115|title=Historia de una tragedia.

Other significant communities of Sephardim Tehorim also migrated in more recent times from the Near East to [[New York City]], [[Argentina]], Costa Rica, [[Mexico]], [[Montreal]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/sosua.html |title=Jews migration to the Dominican Republic to seek refuge from the Holocaust|accessdate=2013-05-15}}</ref> Because of poverty and turmoil in Latin America, another wave of Sephardic Jews joined other Latin Americans migrated to the United States, Canada, Spain, and other countries of Europe.\n\n====Permanence of Sephardim in Spain====\nAccording to the genetic study \"The Genetic Legacy of Religious Diversity and Intolerance: Paternal Lineages of Christians, Jews, and Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula\" at the University Pompeu Fabra of Barcelona and the University of Leicester, led by Briton Mark Jobling, Francesc Calafell and Elena Bosch, published by American Journal of Human Genetics, genetic markers show that less than 20% of Spaniards have Sephardic Jews markers (direct descent male for Y, equivalent weight for female mitochondria), Catalonia with approximately 6%.

It is a [[Romance languages|Romance language]] derived mainly from [[Old Castilian]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]), with many borrowings from Turkish, and to a lesser extent from Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and French.\nUntil recently, two different dialects of Judeo-Spanish were spoken in the Mediterranean region: Eastern Judeo-Spanish (in various distinctive regional variations) and Western or North African Judeo-Spanish (also known as [[Haketia|\u1e24akit\u00eda]]), once spoken, with little regional distinction, in six towns in Northern Morocco and, because of later emigration, also in [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] (Spanish cities in North Africa), [[Gibraltar]], [[Casablanca]] (Morocco), and [[Oran]] (Algeria). The Eastern Sephardic dialect is typified by its greater conservatism, its retention of numerous Old Spanish features in phonology, morphology, and lexicon, and its numerous borrowings from Turkish and, to a lesser extent, also from Greek and South Slavic. Both dialects have (or had) numerous borrowings from Hebrew, especially in reference to religious matters, but the number of [[Hebraism]]s in everyday speech or writing is in no way comparable to that found in [[Yiddish]].\n\nOn the other hand, the North African Sephardic dialect was, until the early 20th century, also highly conservative; its abundant [[Maghrebi Arabic|Colloquial Arabic]] loan words retained most of the Arabic phonemes as functional components of a new, enriched Hispano-Semitic phonological system. During the [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish colonial occupation of Northern Morocco]] (1912\u20131956), \u1e24akit\u00eda was subjected to pervasive, massive influence from Modern Standard Spanish and most Moroccan Jews now speak a colloquial, [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian form of Spanish]], with only an occasional use of the old language as a sign of in-group solidarity, somewhat as American Jews may now use an occasional [[Yinglish|Yiddishism]] in colloquial speech. Except for certain younger individuals, who continue to practice \u1e24akit\u00eda as a matter of cultural pride, this dialect, probably the most Arabized of the Romance languages apart from [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]], has essentially ceased to exist. By contrast, Eastern Judeo-Spanish has fared somewhat better, especially in Israel, where newspapers, radio broadcasts, and elementary school and university programs strive to keep the language alive. But the old regional variations (i.e. Bosnia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, and Turkey for instance) are already either extinct or doomed to extinction. Only time will tell whether Judeo-Spanish koin\u00e9, now evolving in Israel\u2014similar to that which developed among Sephardic immigrants to the United States early in the 20th century will prevail and survive into the next generation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sephardifolklit.org/flsj/sjjs/orallit/Oral_Lit_Sephardic.html |title=Samuel G.

The [[Portuguese Pidgin|pidgin forms of Portuguese]] spoken among slaves and their Sephardic owners were an influence in the development of [[Papiamento]] and the Creole [[Suriname#Demographics|languages of Suriname]].\n\nOther Romance languages with Jewish forms, spoken historically by Sephardim, include [[Judeo-Catalan]], often underestimated, this language was the main language used by the Jewish communities in [[Catalonia]], [[Balearic Isles]] and the [[Valencia]]n region. The [[Gibraltar]] community has had a heavy influence on the Gibraltar dialect [[Llanito]] contributing several words to this English/Spanish patois.\n\nOther languages associated with Sephardic Jews are mostly extinct, ''i.e.'', formerly spoken by some Sephardic communities in Italy. [[Judeo-Arabic]] and its dialects have been a large vernacular language for Sephardim who settled in North African kingdoms and Arabic-speaking parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Low German]] (Low Saxon), formerly used as the vernacular by Sephardim around [[Hamburg]] and [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] in Northern Germany, is also no longer in use as a specifically Jewish [[vernacular]].\n\nIn other words, through their diaspora, Sephardim have been a polyglot population, often learning or exchanging words with the language of their host population, most commonly [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and were easily integrated in the societies that hosted them. Within the last centuries and more particularly the 19th and 20th century, two languages have become dominant in the Sephardic diaspora; [[French language|French]] introduced first by the [[Alliance Isra\u00e9lite Universelle]] and then by migration to France after Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria became independent, and [[Hebrew]] by the state of [[Israel]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==Literature==\nThe doctrine of ''[[galut]]'' is considered by scholars to be one of the most important concepts in Jewish history, if not the most important. In Jewish literature ''galut'', the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word for [[diaspora]], invoked common motifs of oppression, martyrdom and suffering in discussing the collective experience of exile in [[diaspora]] that has been uniquely formative in Jewish culture. This literature was shaped for centuries by the expulsions from Spain and Portugal and thus featured prominently in a wide range of medieval [[Jewish literature]] from rabbinic writings to profane poetry. Even so, the treatment of ''galut''  diverges in Sephardic sources, which scholar David A. Wacks says \"occasionally belie the relatively comfortable circumstances of the Jewish community of Sefarad.\"<ref>David A.

Abrabanel surmises that the name may have been given to it by the Jewish exiles who arrived in Spain, in remembrance of the city Ashqelon in the Land of Israel. The spelling rendered by Abrabanel is \u05d0\u05d9\u05e9\u05e7\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d4. See: Abrabanel, ''Commentary on the First Prophets'', p. 680, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).</ref> France and Spain. The names \u1e62arfat and Sepharad are explicitly mentioned by him as being France and Spain, respectively. Some scholars think that, in the case of the place-name, \u1e62arfat (lit. [[Sarepta|\u1e62arfend]]) \u2013 which, as noted, was applied to the Jewish [[Diaspora]] in France, the association with France was made only exegetically because of its similarity in spelling with the name \u05e4\u05e8\u05e0\u05e6\u05d0 (France), by a reversal of its letters.\n\nSpanish Jew, [[Moses de Le\u00f3n]] (ca. 1250 \u2013 1305), mentions a tradition concerning the first Jewish exiles, saying that the vast majority of the first exiles driven away from the land of Israel during the Babylonian captivity refused to return, for they had seen that the Second Temple would be destroyed like the first.<ref>Moses de Le\u00f3n, in ''Ha-Nefesh Ha-\u1e24akhamah'' (also known as ''Sefer Ha-Mish\u1e33al''), end of Part VI which treats on the Resurrection of the Dead, pub. in Basel 1608 (Hebrew)</ref> In yet another teaching, passed down later by Moses ben Machir in the 16th century, an explicit reference is made to the fact that Jews have lived in Spain since the destruction of the First Temple:<ref>Moses ben Machir, in ''Seder Ha-Yom'', p. 15a, Venice 1605 (Hebrew)</ref>\n \n<blockquote>Now, I have heard that this praise, ''emet weya\u1e63iv'' [which is now used by us in the prayer rite] was sent by the exiles who were driven away from Jerusalem and who were not with Ezra in Babylon, and that Ezra had sent inquiring after them, but they did not wish to go up [there], replying that since they were destined to go off again into exile a second time, and that the Temple would once again be destroyed, why should we then double our anguish? It is best for us that we remain here in our place and to serve God. Now, I have heard that they are the people of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) and those who are near to them. However, that they might not be thought of as wicked men and those who are lacking in fidelity, may God forbid, they wrote down for them this magnanimous praise, etc.</blockquote>\n\nSimilarly, [[Gedaliah ibn Yahya ben Joseph|Gedaliah ibn Jechia]] the Spaniard has written:<ref>Gedaliah ibn Jechia in ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', p. 271, Venice 1585 (Hebrew)</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In [5,]252 ''anno mundi'' [1492 CE], the king Ferdinand and his wife, Isabella, made war with the Ishmaelites who were in Granada and took it, and while they returned they commanded the Jews in all of his kingdom that in but a short time they were to take leave from the countries [they had heretofore possessed], they being Castile, Navarre, Catalonia, Arag\u00f3n, Granada and Sicily. Then the [Jewish] inhabitants of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) answered that they were not present [in the land of Judea] at the time when their Christ was put to death. Apparently, it was written upon a large stone in the city's street which some very ancient sovereign inscribed and testified that the Jews of ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) did not depart from there during the building of the Second Temple, and were not involved in putting to death [the man whom they called] Christ. Yet, no apology was of any avail to them, neither unto the rest of the Jews, till at length six hundred-thousand souls had evacuated from there.</blockquote>\n\n[[Don Isaac Abrabanel]], a prominent Jewish figure in Spain in the 15th century and one of the king's trusted courtiers who witnessed the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, informs his readers<ref>Abrabanel's ''Commentary on the First Prophets'' (''Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim''), end of II Kings, pp. 680-681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).</ref> that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship to Spain by a certain Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. This man was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. He became related by marriage to a certain Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. This Heracles later renounced his throne because of his preference for his native country in Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, by whom the country of Espa\u00f1a (Spain) derives its name. The Jewish exiles transported there by the said Phiros were descended by lineage from Judah, Benjamin, Shimon and Levi, and were, according to Abrabanel, settled in two districts in southern Spain: one, Andalusia, in the city of [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]]&mdash;a city so-called by the Jewish exiles that had come there; the second, in the country around ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]).\n\nAbrabanel says that the name ''\u1e6culay\u1e6dulah'' ([[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]) was given to the city by its first Jewish inhabitants, and surmises that the name may have meant \u05d8\u05dc\u05d8\u05d5\u05dc (= wandering), on account of their wandering from Jerusalem. He says, furthermore, that the original name of the city was Pirisvalle, so-called by its early pagan inhabitants. He also writes there that he found written in the ancient annals of Spanish history collected by the kings of Spain that the 50,000 Jewish households then residing in the cities throughout Spain were the descendants of men and women who were sent to Spain by the Roman Emperor and who had formerly been subjected to him and whom Titus had originally exiled from places in or around Jerusalem. The two Jewish exiles joined together and became one.\n\nEvidence that suggests Jewish connections with the Iberian Peninsula includes:\n* References in the books of ''[[Book of Isiah|Isaiah]]'', ''[[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]]'', ''[[Book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]]'', ''[[First Book of Kings|I Kings]]'', and ''[[Book of Jonah|Jonah]]'' to the country of [[Tarshish]], which is thought by many to have been located in modern southern Spain (in ancient [[Tartessus]]).\n* A [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] found at [[Cadiz]], dating from the 8th-7th century BC. The inscription on the ring, generally accepted as [[Phoenician languages|Phoenician]], has been interpreted by a few scholars to be \"paleo-[[Hebrew language|hebraic]].\"\n* An [[amphora]] dating from at least the 1st century found in [[Ibiza]], which bears imprints of two Hebrew characters.\n* Several early Jewish writers wrote that their families had lived in Spain since the destruction of the first temple. Don [[Isaac Abravanel]] (1437\u20131508) stated that the [[Abravanel]] family had lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for 2,000 years.\n\nSome suggest that substantial Jewish immigration probably occurred during the Roman period of [[Hispania]]. The province came under Roman control with the fall of [[Carthage]] after the [[Second Punic War]] (218\u2013202 BC). Exactly how soon after this time Jews made their way onto the scene in this context is a matter of speculation. It is within the realm of possibility that they went there under the Romans as free men to take advantage of its rich resources. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] confirms that as early as 90 CE there was already a Jewish ''Diaspora'' living in Europe, made-up of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. Thus, he writes in his ''Antiquities'':<ref>Josephus Flavius, ''Antiquities'', xi.v.2</ref>  \"... there are but two tribes in Asia (Turkey) and Europe subject to the Romans, while the ten tribes are beyond Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude.\"\n\nAlthough the spread of Jews into Europe is most commonly associated with the [[Diaspora]] that ensued from the Roman conquest of [[Judea]], emigration from Judea into the greater Roman Mediterranean area antedated the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of Jerusalem]] at the hands of the Romans under [[Titus]]. Any Jews already in Hispania at this time would have been joined by those who had been enslaved by the Romans under [[Vespasian]] and [[Titus]], and dispersed to the extreme west during the period of the [[First Jewish-Roman War|Jewish Wars]], and especially after the defeat of Judea in 70. One account placed the number carried off to Hispania at 80,000. Subsequent immigrations came into the area along both the northern African and southern European sides of the Mediterranean.\n\nAmong the earliest records that may refer specifically to Jews in the Iberian peninsula during the Roman period is [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]'s [[Epistle to the Romans]]. Scholars such as [[Josephus|Josephus Flavius]] have taken Paul's intention to go to Hispania to preach the [[gospel]] (Romans 15:24, 28) to indicate the presence of Jewish communities there, as well as the fact that [[Herod Antipas]]'s banishment by [[Caligula]] in the year 39 may have been to Hispania.<ref>[[Josephus|Flavius Josephus]], ''[[The Wars of the Jews|Wars of the Jews]]'', 2.9.6. However, the place of banishment is identified in Josephus's ''[[Jewish Antiquities|Antiquities of the Jews]]'' as [[Gaul]]; for discussion, see {{cite book |author=Emil Sch\u00fcrer |authorlink=Emil Sch\u00fcrer |others=revised and edited by [[Geza Vermes]], [[Fergus Millar]] and Matthew Black |title=The History of the Jewish People in the Age of Jesus Christ: Volume I |edition=revised English |year=1973 |publisher=T&T Clark |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-567-02242-4 |pages=352 n. 41 }}</ref>\n\nFrom a slightly later period, ''[[Midrash Rabbah]]'' (Leviticus Rabba \u00a7 29.2), and ''[[Pesikta de-Rav Kahana]]'' (''Rosh Hashanna''), both, make mention of the Jewish Diaspora in Spain (Hispania) and their eventual return.\n\nPerhaps the most direct and substantial of early references are the several [[decrees]] of the [[Council of Elvira]], convened in the early 4th century, which address proper Christian behavior with regard to the Jews of Hispania.\n\nAs citizens of the Roman Empire, the Jews of Hispania engaged in a variety of occupations, including agriculture. Until the adoption of Christianity, Jews had close relations with non-Jewish populations, and played an active role in the social and economic life of the province. The [[edicts]] of the [[Synod of Elvira]], provide evidence of Jews who were integrated enough into the greater community to cause alarm among some. Of the Council's 80 [[Canon law|canonic]] decisions, those that pertain to Jews maintained separation between the two communities. It seems that by this time the presence of Jews was of greater concern to Christian authorities than the presence of pagans. Canon 16, which prohibited marriage of Christians with Jews, was worded more strongly than canon 15, which prohibited marriage with pagans. Canon 78 threatens Christians who commit adultery with Jews with [[ostracism]]. Canon 48 forbade the blessing of Christian crops by Jews, and canon 50 forbade the sharing of meals by Christians and Jews.\n\nYet in comparison to Jewish life in [[Byzantium]] and [[Italia (Roman province)|Italy]], life for the early Jews in Hispania and the rest of southern Europe was relatively tolerable. This is due in large measure to the difficulty the Church had in establishing itself in its western frontier. In the west, [[Germanic tribes]] such as the [[Suevi]], the [[Vandals]], and especially the [[Visigoths]] had more or less disrupted the political and [[ecclesiastical]] systems of the Roman empire, and for several centuries the Jews enjoyed a degree of peace their brethren to the east did not.\n\n[[Germanic Wars|Barbarian invasions]] brought most of the Iberian peninsula under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]] by the early 5th century. Other than in their contempt for Trinitarian Christians, the [[Arianism|Arian]] Visigoths were largely uninterested in the religious creeds within their kingdom. It was not until 506, when [[Alaric II]] (484\u2013507) published his ''Brevarium Alaricianum'' ([[Breviary of Alaric]]) (wherein he adopted the laws of the ousted Romans), that a Visigothic king concerned himself with the Jews.\n\nThe situation of the Jews changed after the conversion of the Visigothic royal family under [[Recared]] from Arianism to Roman Catholicism in 587. In their desire to consolidate the realm under the new religion, the Visigoths adopted an aggressive policy towards Jews. As the king and the church acted in a single interest, the Jews' situation deteriorated. Under successive Visigothic kings and under [[ecclesiastical]] authority, many orders of expulsion, forced conversion, isolation, enslavement, execution, and other punitive measures were made. By 612\u2013621, the situation for Jews became intolerable and many left Spain for nearby northern Africa. In 711, thousands of Jews from North Africa accompanied the Moslems who invaded Spain, subsuming Catholic Spain and turning much of it into an Arab state, Al-Andalus.<ref>N. H. Finkelstein, p.&nbsp;13, 14.{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe Jews of Hispania had been utterly embittered and alienated by Catholic rule by the time of the [[Al-Andalus|Muslim invasion]]. To them, the [[Moors]] were perceived as, and indeed were, a liberating force. Wherever they went, the Muslims were greeted by Jews eager to aid them in administering the country. In many conquered towns the garrison was left in the hands of the Jews before the Muslims proceeded further north. This began two centuries of Muslim rule in the Iberian peninsula, which became known as the \"Golden Age\" of Sephardi Jewry.\n[[File:Al-andalus_229.png|thumb|13th century depiction of a Jew and Muslim playing chess in [[Al-Andalus]]]]\n\n=== Jews in Muslim Iberia ===\n{{see also|Al-Andalus|Golden age of Jewish culture in the Iberian Peninsula|Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula}}\n\nWith the victory of [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] in 711, the lives of the Sephardim changed dramatically. Though Islamic law placed restrictions on ''[[dhimmis]]'' (non-Muslim members of monotheistic faiths), the coming of the Moors was by and large welcomed by the Jews of Iberia.\n\nBoth Muslim and Christian sources claim that Jews provided valuable aid to the Muslim invaders. Once captured, the defense of Cordoba was left in the hands of Jews, and [[Granada]], [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], [[Seville]], and [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] were left to a mixed army of Jews and Moors. Although in some towns Jews may have been helpful to Muslim success, because of their small numbers they were of limited impact.\n\nIn spite of the restrictions placed upon the Jews as ''dhimmis'', life under Muslim rule was one of great opportunity and Jews flourished as they did not under the Christian Visigoths. Many Jews came to Iberia, seen as a land of tolerance and opportunity, from the Christian and Muslim worlds. Following initial Arab victories, and especially with the establishment of [[Umayyad]] rule by [[Abd-ar-rahman I|Abd al-Rahman I]] in 755, the native Jewish community was joined by Jews from the rest of Europe, as well as from Arab lands, from Morocco to [[Babylon]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Jewish communities were enriched culturally, intellectually, and religiously by the commingling of these diverse Jewish traditions.{{explain|date=October 2018}}\n\nArabic culture, of course, also made a lasting impact on Sephardic cultural development. General re-evaluation of [[scripture]] was prompted by Muslim anti-Jewish [[polemics]] and the spread of [[rationalism]], as well as the anti-[[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbanite]] polemics of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]. The cultural and intellectual achievements of the Arabs, and much of the scientific and philosophical speculation of [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek culture]], which had been best preserved by Arab scholars, was made available to the educated Jew. The meticulous regard the Arabs had for grammar and style also had the effect of stimulating an interest in [[philology|philological]] matters in general among Jews. Arabic became the main language of Sephardic science, philosophy, and everyday business, as had been the case with Babylonian ''[[geonim]]''. This thorough adoption of the Arabic language also greatly facilitated the assimilation of Jews into Moorish culture, and Jewish activity in a variety of professions, including medicine, commerce, finance, and agriculture increased.\n\nBy the 9th century, some members of the Sephardic community felt confident enough to take part in [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] amongst Christians. This included the heated correspondences sent between [[Bishop Bodo|Bodo Eleazar]], a former Christian [[deacon]] who had converted to Judaism in 838, and the Bishop of [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|C\u00f3rdoba]] [[\u00c1lvaro of C\u00f3rdoba (Mozarab)|Paulus Albarus]], who had converted from Judaism to Christianity. Each man, using such [[epithets]] as \"wretched compiler\", tried to convince the other to return to his former faith, to no avail.{{fact|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe Golden Age is most closely identified with the reign of [[Abd al-Rahman III]] (882\u2013942), the first independent [[Caliph of Cordoba]], and in particular with the career of his Jewish councilor, [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]] (882\u2013942). Within this context of cultural [[patronage]], studies in Hebrew, literature, and linguistics flourished.\n\nHasdai benefitted world Jewry not only indirectly by creating a favorable environment for scholarly pursuits within Iberia, but also by using his influence to intervene on behalf of foreign Jews: in his letter to [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Helena Lekapene|Princess Helena]], he requested protection for the Jews under Byzantine rule, attesting to the fair treatment of the Christians of ''al-Andalus'', and perhaps indicating that such was contingent on the treatment of Jews abroad.\n\nOne notable contribution to Christian intellectualism is [[Ibn Gabirol]]'s [[Neo-Platonism|neo-Platonic]] ''Fons Vitae'' (\"The Source of Life;\" \"Mekor Hayyim\"). Thought by many to have been written by a Christian, this work was admired by Christians and studied in monasteries throughout the Middle Ages, though the work of Solomon Munk in the 19th century proved that the author of ''Fons Vitae'' was the Jewish ibn Gabirol.<ref>Richard Gottheil, Stephen S.

Retrieved 2011-11-20.</ref>\n\nIn addition to contributions of original work, the Sephardim were active as translators. Mainly in [[Toledo School of Translators|Toledo]], texts were translated between Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, and Latin. In translating the great works of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek into Latin, Iberian Jews were instrumental in bringing the fields of science and philosophy, which formed much of the basis of [[Renaissance]] learning, into the rest of Europe.\n\nIn the early 11th century centralized authority based at Cordoba broke down following the [[Berber people|Berber]] invasion and the ousting of the Umayyads. In its stead arose the independent ''[[taifa]]'' principalities under the rule of local [[Muladi]], Arab, Berber, or [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] leaders. Rather than having a stifling effect, the disintegration of the caliphate expanded the opportunities to Jewish and other professionals. The services of Jewish scientists, doctors, traders, poets, and scholars were generally valued by Christian and Muslim rulers of regional centers, especially as order was restored in recently conquered towns. Rabbi [[Samuel ha-Nagid]] (ibn Naghrela) was the Vizier of [[Granada]]. He was succeeded by his son [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] who was slain by an incited mob along with most of the Jewish community. The remnant fled to [[Lucena, C\u00f3rdoba|Lucena]].\n\n[[File:Havdal.jpg|thumb|Observing the [[Havdalah]] ritual, 14th-century Spain|alt=]]\nThe first major and most violent persecution in Islamic Spain was the [[1066 Granada massacre]], which occurred on 30 December, when a Muslim mob stormed the royal palace in [[Granada]], [[crucifixion|crucified]] [[Jew]]ish [[vizier]] [[Joseph ibn Naghrela]] and massacred most of the Jewish population of the city, after rumors spread that the powerful vizier was plotting to kill the weak-minded and drunk King [[Badis ibn Habus]].<ref> Nagdela (Nagrela), Abu Husain Joseph Ibn by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed.</ref> According to the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia, \"More than 1,500 Jewish families, numbering 4,000 persons, fell in one day,<ref>[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=412&letter=G&search=Granada Granada] by Richard Gottheil, [[Meyer Kayserling]], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''. 1906 ed.</ref> a number contested by some historians who deem it to be an example of \"the usual hyperbole in numerical estimates, with which history abounds.\"<ref> Erika Spivakovsky (1971). \"The Jewish presence in Granada\".

These fundamentalist sects abhorred the liberality of the Islamic culture of ''al-Andalus'', including the position of authority some ''dhimmis'' held over Muslims. When the Almohads gave the Jews a choice of either death or conversion to Islam, many Jews emigrated. Some, such as the family of [[Maimonides]], fled south and east to the more tolerant Muslim lands, while others went northward to settle in the growing Christian kingdoms.\n\nMeanwhile, the ''Reconquista'' continued in the north throughout the 12th century. As various Arab lands fell to the Christians, conditions for some Jews in the emerging Christian kingdoms became increasingly favorable. As had happened during the reconstruction of towns following the breakdown of authority under the Umayyads, the services of Jews were employed by the victorious Christian leaders. Sephardic knowledge of the language and culture of the enemy, their skills as diplomats and professionals, as well as their desire for relief from intolerable conditions&nbsp;\u2014 the very same reasons that they had proved useful to the Arabs in the early stages of the Muslim invasion&nbsp;\u2014 made their services very valuable.\n\nHowever, the Jews from the Muslim south were not entirely secure in their northward migrations. Old prejudices were compounded by newer ones. Suspicions of complicity with the Muslims were alive and well as Jews immigrated, speaking Arabic. However, many of the newly arrived Jews of the north prospered during the late 11th and early 12th centuries. The majority of Latin documentation regarding Jews during this period refers to their landed property, fields, and vineyards.\n\nIn many ways life had come full circle for the Sephardim of ''al-Andalus''. As conditions became more oppressive during the 12th and 13th centuries, Jews again looked to an outside culture for relief. Christian leaders of reconquered cities granted them extensive autonomy, and Jewish scholarship recovered somewhat and developed as communities grew in size and importance. However, the Reconquista Jews never reached the same heights as had those of the Golden Age.\n\n=== After the Reconquista ===\n{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Communities}}\n\nAmong the Sephardim were many who were the descendants, or heads, of wealthy families and who, as ''[[Marranos]]'', had occupied prominent positions in the countries they had left. Some had been state officials, others had held positions of dignity within the Church; many had been the heads of large banking-houses and mercantile establishments, and some were physicians or scholars who had officiated as teachers in high schools.\nTheir Spanish or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] was a [[lingua franca]] that enabled Sephardim from different countries to engage in commerce and diplomacy.\n\nWith their social equals they associated freely, without regard to religion and more likely with regard to equivalent or comparative education, for they were generally well read, which became a tradition and expectation. They were received at the courts of sultans, kings, and princes, and often were employed as ambassadors, envoys, or agents. The number of Sephardim who have rendered important services to different countries is considerable as [[Samuel Abravanel]] (or \"Abrabanel\"\u2014financial councilor to the viceroy of [[Naples]]) or Moses Curiel (or \"Jeromino Nunes da Costa\"-serving as Agent to the Crown of Portugal in the [[United Provinces (Low Countries)|United Provinces]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ISRAEL|first=JONATHAN I.|date=1987|journal=Studia Rosenthaliana|volume=21|issue=1|pages=14\u201334|issn=0039-3347|jstor=41481641|title=Duarte Nunes da Costa (Jacob Curiel), of Hamburg, Sephardi Nobleman and Communal Leader (1585-1664)}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UUUZ1fVWdvQC&pg=PA650&lpg=PA650&dq=geronimo+nunes+da+costa#v=onepage&q=geronimo%20nunes%20da%20costa&f=false|title=Cultures of the Jews: A New History|last=Biale|first=David|date=2012-08-29|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780307483461|language=en}}</ref> Among other names mentioned are those of Belmonte, [[Joseph Nasi|Nasi]], [[Francisco Pacheco]], Blas, [[Pedro de Herrera]], [[Palache]], [[Pimentel (surname)|Pimentel]], [[Azevedo]], Sagaste, [[Joseph Salvador|Salvador]], [[Sasportas]], [[Costa (surname)|Costa]], [[Curiel]], [[Cansino]], [[Sch\u00f6nenberg (surname)|Sch\u00f6nenberg]], Sapoznik (Zapatero), [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], Miranda, [[Toledano]], [[Pereira (surname)|Pereira]], and [[Teixeira]].\n\nThe Sephardim distinguished themselves as physicians and statesmen, and won the favor of rulers and princes, in both the Christian and the Islamic world. That the Sephardim were selected for prominent positions in every country where they settled was only in part due to the fact that Spanish had become a world-language through the expansion of Spain into the world spanning Spanish Empire\u2014the cosmopolitan cultural background after long associations with Islamic scholars of the Sephardic families also made them extremely well educated for the [[historical era|times]], even well into the [[Age of Enlightenment|European Enlightenment]].\n\nFor a long time the Sephardim took an active part in [[Spanish literature]]; they wrote in prose and in rhyme, and were the authors of theological, philosophical, [[wikt:belletristic|belletristic]] (aesthetic rather than content based writing), pedagogic (teaching), and mathematical works. The rabbis, who, in common with all the Sephardim, emphasized a pure and euphonious pronunciation of Hebrew, delivered their sermons in Spanish or in Portuguese. Several of these sermons have appeared in print. Their thirst for knowledge, together with the fact that they associated freely with the outer world, led the Sephardim to establish new educational systems. Wherever they settled, they founded schools that used Spanish as the medium of instruction.\nTheatre in Constantinople was in Jud\u00e6o-Spanish since it was forbidden to Muslims.\n\n[[File:Massacre de lisboa.jpg|thumb|A representation of the 1506 [[Lisbon Massacre|Jewish Massacre]] in Lisbon.|alt=]]\nIn Portugal the Sephardim were given important roles in the sociopolitical sphere and enjoyed a certain amount of protection from the Crown (e.g. [[Yahia Ben Yahia]], first \"Rabino Maior\" of Portugal and supervisor of the public revenue of the first King of Portugal, [[Don (honorific)|D.]] [[Afonso Henriques]]). Even with the increasing pressure from the Catholic Church this state of affairs remained more or less constant and the number of Jews in Portugal grew with those running from Spain. This changed with the marriage of D. [[Manuel I of Portugal]] with the daughter of the [[Catholic Monarchs]] of the newly born Spain. In 1497 the Decree ordering the expulsion or forced conversion of all the Jews was passed, and the Sephardim either fled or went into secrecy under the guise of \"Crist\u00e3os Novos\", i.e. [[New Christians]] (this Decree was symbolically revoked in 1996 by the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Parliament]]). Those who fled to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] were only allowed to land provided they received baptism. Those who were fortunate enough to reach the [[Ottoman Empire]] had a better fate: the Sultan [[Bayezid II]] sarcastically{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} sent his thanks to Ferdinand for sending him some of his best subjects, thus \"impoverishing his own lands while enriching his (Bayezid's)\". Jews arriving in the Ottoman Empire were mostly resettled in and around [[Thessalonica]] and to some extent in [[Constantinople]] and [[\u0130zmir]]. This was followed by a [[Marrano#Massacre at Lisbon|great massacre of Jews in the city of]] [[Lisbon]] in 1506 and the establishment of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in 1536. This caused the flight of the Portuguese Jewish community, which continued until the extinction of the Courts of Inquisition in 1821; by then there were very few Jews in Portugal.\n\nIn [[Amsterdam]], where Jews were especially prominent in the 17th century on account of their number, wealth, education, and influence, they established poetical academies after Spanish models; two of these were the ''Academia de los Sitibundos'' and the ''Academia de los Floridos''. In the same city they also organized the first Jewish educational institution, with graduate classes in which, in addition to [[Talmud]]ic studies, instruction was given in the [[Hebrew language]]. The most important synagogue, or [[Synagogue|Esnoga]], as it is usually called amongst Spanish and Portuguese Jews, is the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]]\u2014usually considered the \"mother synagogue\", and the historical centre of the Amsterdam [[minhag]].\n\nA sizable Sephardic community had settled in [[Morocco]] and other [[North Africa|Northern African]] countries, which were colonized by France in the 19th century. Jews in Algeria were given French citizenship in 1870 by the ''d\u00e9cret Cr\u00e9mieux'' (previously Jews and Muslims could apply for French citizenship, but had to renounce the use of traditional religious courts and laws, which many did not want to do). When France withdrew from [[Algeria]] in 1962, the local Jewish communities largely relocated to France. There are some tensions between some of those communities and the earlier French Jewish population (who were mostly [[Ashkenazi Jews]]), and with Arabic-Muslim communities.\n\n=== In the Age of Discoveries ===\n[[File:Sepharadic Migrations.jpg|thumb|Migrations and Settlements of the Spanish Jews]]\n\nThe largest part of Spanish Jews expelled in 1492 fled to Portugal, where they eluded persecution for a few years. The [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Jewish community in Portugal]] was perhaps then some 15% of that country's population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They were declared Christians by Royal decree unless they left, but the King hindered their departure, needing their artisanship and working population for Portugal's overseas enterprises and territories. Later Sephardic Jews settled in many trade areas controlled by the Empire of Philip II and others. With various countries in Europe also the Sephardi Jews established commercial relations. In a letter dated 25 November 1622, King [[Christian IV of Denmark]] invites Jews of Amsterdam to settle in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]], where, among other privileges, the free exercise of their religion would be assured to them.\n\n[[\u00c1lvaro Caminha]], in [[Cape Verde]] islands, who received the land as a grant from the crown, established a colony with Jews forced to stay on the island of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]]. [[Pr\u00edncipe]] island was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult, however, the Jewish settlement was a success and their descendants settled many parts of Brazil.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/h/9av/aas/52421817.html |title=The Expulsion 1492 Chronicles, section XI: \"The Vale of Tears\", quoting Joseph Hacohen (1496-1577); also, section XVII, quoting 16th century author Samuel Usque |publisher=Aish.com |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2013-12-16}}</ref>\n\nIn 1579 [[Luis de Carvajal y de la Cueva]] a Portuguese-born [[Converso]], Spanish-Crown officer, was awarded a large swath of territory in New Spain, known as [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n|Nuevo Reino de Le\u00f3n]]. He founded settlements with other conversos that would later become [[Monterrey]].\n\n[[File:Emanuel de Witte - Interieur van de Portugese synagoge te Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Portuguese Synagogue (Amsterdam)|Portuguese synagogue]] in Amsterdam, c. 1680]]\n\nIn particular, Jews established the relations between the Dutch and South America. They contributed to the establishment of the Dutch West Indies Company in 1621, and some were members of the directorate. The ambitious schemes of the Dutch for the conquest of Brazil were carried into effect through Francisco Ribeiro, a Portuguese captain, who is said to have had Jewish relations in the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]]. Some years afterward, when the Dutch in Brazil appealed to the Netherlands for craftsmen of all kinds, many Jews went to Brazil. About 600 Jews left Amsterdam in 1642, accompanied by two distinguished scholars&mdash;[[Isaac Aboab da Fonseca]] and [[Moses Raphael de Aguilar]]. Jews supported the Dutch in the struggle between the Netherlands and Portugal for possession of Brazil.\n\n[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumbnail|right|Execution of Mariana de Carabajal in [[Mexico City]], daughter of [[Francisca Nu\u00f1ez de Carabajal]], in 1601 by the ''Santo Oficio''.]]\n\nIn 1642, Aboab da Fonseca was appointed rabbi at [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] in the Dutch colony of [[Pernambuco]] ([[Recife]]), [[Brazil]]. Most of the white inhabitants of the town were Sephardic Jews from Portugal who had been banned by the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] to this town at the other side of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. In 1624, the colony had been occupied by the Dutch. By becoming the rabbi of the community, Aboab da Fonseca was the first appointed rabbi of the Americas. The name of his congregation was [[Kahal Zur Israel Synagogue]] and the community had a synagogue, a [[mikveh]] and a [[yeshiva]] as well. However, during the time he was rabbi in Pernambuco, the Portuguese re-occupied the place again in 1654, after a struggle of nine years. Aboab da Fonseca managed to return to Amsterdam after the occupation of the Portuguese. Members of his community immigrated to [[North America]] and were among the founders of [[New York City]], but some Jews took refuge in [[Serid\u00f3]].\n\nBesides merchants, a great number of physicians were among the Spanish Jews in Amsterdam: Samuel Abravanel, David Nieto, Elijah Montalto, and the Bueno family; Joseph Bueno was consulted in the illness of Prince Maurice (April 1623). Jews were admitted as students at the university, where they studied medicine as the only branch of science of practical use to them, for they were not permitted to practise law, and the oath they would be compelled to take excluded them from the professorships. Neither were Jews taken into the trade-guilds: a resolution passed by the city of Amsterdam in 1632 (the cities being autonomous) excluded them. Exceptions, however, were made in the case of trades that related to their religion: printing, bookselling, and the selling of meat, poultry, groceries, and drugs. In 1655 a Jew was, exceptionally, permitted to establish a sugar-refinery.\n\nJonathan Ray, a professor of Jewish theological studies, has argued that the community of Sephardim was formed more during the 1600s than the medieval period. He explains that prior to expulsion Spanish Jewish communities did not have a shared identity in the sense that developed in diaspora. They did not carry any particular Hispano-Jewish identity into exile with them, but certain shared cultural traits contributed to the formation of the diaspora community from what had historically been independent communities.<ref>Jonathan S Ray.

Sephardi Jewish communities from France and the Netherlands in the northwest to Yugoslavia and Greece in the southeast almost disappeared.\n\nOn the eve of World War II, the European Sephardi community was concentrated in Southeastern Europe countries of [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. Its leading centers were in [[Salonika]], [[Sarajevo]], [[Belgrade]], and [[Sofia]]. The experience of Jewish communities in those countries during the war varied greatly and depended on the type of regime under which they fell.\n\nThe Jewish communities of Yugoslavia and northern Greece, including the 50,000 Jews of Salonika, fell under direct [[Axis occupation of Greece|German occupation in April 1941]] and bore the full weight and intensity of Nazi repressive measures from dispossession, humiliation, and forced labor to hostage taking, and finally deportation to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10006079|title=Sephardi Jews during the Holocaust|website=www.ushmm.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-22}}</ref>\n\nThe Jewish population of southern Greece fell under the jurisdiction of the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italians]] who eschewed the enactment of anti-Jewish legislation and resisted whenever possible German efforts to transfer them to occupied Poland, until the surrender of Italy on 8 September 1943 brought the Jews under German control.\n\nSephardi Jews in Bosnia and Croatia were ruled by a German-created [[Independent State of Croatia]] state from April 1941, which subjected them to pogrom-like actions before herding them into local camps where they were murdered side by side with Serbs and Roma (see [[Porajmos]]). The Jews of Macedonia and Thrace were controlled by Bulgarian occupation forces, which after rendering them stateless, rounded them up and turned them over to the Germans for deportation.\n\nFinally, the Jews of Bulgaria proper were under the rule of a Nazi ally that subjected them to ruinous anti-Jewish legislation, but ultimately yielded to pressure from Bulgarian parliamentarians, clerics, and intellectuals not to deport them. More than 50,000 [[Bulgarian Jews]] were thus saved.\n\nThe Jews in North Africa identified themselves only as Jews or European Jews, having been westernized by French and Italian colonization. During World War II and until [[Operation Torch]], the Jews of [[French protectorate in Morocco|Morocco]], [[French Algeria|Algeria]], and [[French protectorate of Tunisia|Tunesia]], governed by pro-Nazi [[Vichy France]], suffered the same antisemitic legislation that Jews suffered in France mainland. They did not, however, directly suffer the more extreme Nazi Germany antisemitic policies, and nor did the Jews in [[Italian Libya]]. The Jewish communities in those European North Africa countries, in Bulgaria, and in Denmark were the only ones who were spared the mass deportation and mass murder that afflicted other Jewish communities. [[Operation Torch]] therefore saved more than 400,000 Jews in European North Africa.\n\n=== Later history and culture ===\nThe Jews in French North Africa were awarded French citizenship by the 1870 [[Cr\u00e9mieux Decree]]. They were therefore considered part of the European [[pieds noirs]] community in spite of having been established in North Africa for many centuries, rather than subject to the [[Indig\u00e9nat]] status imposed on their Muslim former neighbors. Most consequently moved to France in the late 1950s and early 1960s after [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] became independent, and they now make up a majority of the French Jewish community.\n\n{{Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries}}\n\nToday, the Sephardim have preserved the romances and the ancient melodies and songs of Spain and Portugal, as well as a large number of old [[Portuguese proverbs|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish proverbs]].<ref>For the largest online collection of Sephardic folk literature, visit [http://www.sephardifolklit.org/ Folk Literature of the Sephardic Jews.]</ref> A number of [[children's play]]s, like, for example, ''El Castillo'', are still popular among them, and they still manifest a fondness for the dishes peculiar to Iberia, such as the ''pastel'', or ''pastelico'', a sort of meat-pie, and the ''pan de Espa\u00f1a'', or ''pan de Le\u00f3n''. At their festivals they follow the Spanish custom of distributing ''dulces'', or ''dolces'', a confection wrapped in paper bearing a picture of the ''[[magen David]]'' (six pointed star).\n\nIn Mexico, the Sephardic community originates mainly from [[Turkey]], Greece and [[Bulgaria]]. In 1942 the ''[[Colegio Hebreo Tarbut]]'' was founded in collaboration with the [[Ashkenazi]] family and instruction was in [[Yiddish]]. In 1944 the Sephardim community established a separate \"[[Colegio Hebreo Sefarad\u00ed]]\" with 90 students where instruction was in Hebrew and complemented with classes on Jewish customs. By 1950 there were 500 students. In 1968 a group of young Sephardim created the group ''Tnuat Noar Jinujit Dor Jadash'' in support for the creation of the state of Israel. In 1972 the ''Majazike Tora'' institute is created aiming to prepare young male Jews for their [[Bar and Bat Mitzvah|Bar Mitzvah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sefaradi.org.mx/PaginaWebCHS/Presentacion_Institucional/ComunidadSefaradi4.htm|title=History of the Sephardim Community in Mexico|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023083604/http://sefaradi.org.mx/PaginaWebCHS/Presentacion_Institucional/ComunidadSefaradi4.htm|archivedate=23 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nWhile the majority of [[American Jews]] today are Ashkenazim, in Colonial times Sephardim made up the majority of the Jewish population. For example, the 1654 Jews who arrived in [[New Amsterdam]] fled from the colony of [[Recife]], Brazil after the Portuguese seized it from the Dutch. Through most of the 18th century, American synagogues conducted and recorded their business in Portuguese, even if their daily language was English. It was not until widespread German immigration to the United States in the 19th century that the tables turned and Ashkenazim (initially from Germany but by the 20th century from Eastern Europe) began to dominate the American Jewish landscape.\n\nThe Sephardim usually have followed the general rules for [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese name]]s. Many used to bear Portuguese and Spanish names; however, it is noteworthy that a large number of Sephardic names are of [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] roots and are totally absent in Iberian patronyms and are therefore often seen as typically Jewish. Many of the names are associated with non-Jewish (Christian) families and individuals, and are by no means exclusive to Jews. After 1492, many [[marranos]] changed their names to hide their Jewish origins and avoid persecution, adopting professions and even translating such patronyms to local languages like Arabic and even German.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} It was common to choose the name of the Parish Church where they have been baptized into the Christian faith, such as Santa Cruz or the common name of the word \"Messiah\" (Savior/Salvador), or adopted the name of their Christian godparents.<ref>{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Cecil|title=A History of the Marranos|publisher=Schocken Books|isbn=978-0-8052-0463-6|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofmarrano00roth|year=1975}}</ref> Dr. Mark Hilton's research demonstrated in IPS DNA testing that the last name of marranos linked with the location of the local parish were correlated 89.3%\n\nIn contrast to Ashkenazic Jews, who do not name newborn children after living relatives, Sephardic Jews often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if they are still alive. The first son and daughter are traditionally named after the paternal grandparents, then the maternal parents' names are next in line for the remaining children. After that, additional children's names are \"free\", so to speak, meaning that one can choose whatever name, without any more \"naming obligations.\" The only instance in which Sephardic Jews will not name after their own parents is when one of the spouses shares a common first name with a mother/father-in-law (since Jews will not name their children after themselves.) There are times though when the \"free\" names are used to honor the memory of a deceased relative who died young or childless. These conflicting naming conventions can be troublesome when children are born into mixed Ashkenazic-Sephardic households.\n\nA notable exception to the distinct Ashkenazi and Sephardi naming traditions is found among [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim have for centuries followed the tradition otherwise attributed to Sephardim.

The bone matrix consists of [[protein]] and [[mineral]]. The protein forms the ''organic matrix.'' It is synthesized and then the mineral is added. The vast majority of the organic matrix is [[collagen]], which provides [[tensile strength]]. The matrix is mineralized by deposition of hydroxyapatite (alternative name, hydroxylapatite). This mineral is hard, and provides [[compressive strength]]. Thus, the collagen and mineral together are a [[composite material]] with excellent tensile and compressive strength, which can bend under a strain and recover its shape without damage. This is called [[elastic deformation]]. Forces that exceed the capacity of bone to behave elastically may cause failure, typically [[bone fracture]]s.\n\n==Bone remodeling==\nBone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being [[bone remodeling|reshaped by osteoblasts]], which produce and secrete matrix proteins and transport mineral into the matrix, and [[osteoclasts]], which break down the tissues.\n\n=== Osteoblasts ===\nOsteoblasts are the major cellular component of bone. Osteoblasts arise from [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s (MSC). MSC give rise to osteoblasts, [[adipocyte]]s, and [[myocyte]]s among other cell types. Osteoblast quantity is understood to be inversely proportional to that of marrow adipocytes which comprise [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|marrow adipose tissue (MAT)]]. Osteoblasts are found in large numbers in the [[periosteum]], the thin connective tissue layer on the outside surface of bones, and in the [[endosteum]].\n\nNormally, almost all of the bone matrix, in the air breathing [[vertebrate]]s, is mineralized by the osteoblasts. Before the organic matrix is mineralized, it is called the [[osteoid]]. Osteoblasts buried in the matrix are called [[osteocytes]]. During bone formation, the surface layer of osteoblasts consists of cuboidal cells, called ''active osteoblasts'''''.''' When the bone-forming unit is not actively synthesizing bone, the surface osteoblasts are flattened and are called ''inactive osteoblasts''. Osteocytes remain alive and are connected by cell processes to a surface layer of osteoblasts. Osteocytes have important functions in skeletal maintenance.\n\n=== Osteoclasts ===\nOsteoclasts are multinucleated cells that derive from hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow which also give rise to monocytes in peripheral blood.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loutit |first1=J.F. |last2=Nisbet |first2=N.W. |title=The Origin of Osteoclasts |journal=Immunobiology |date=January 1982 |volume=161 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=193\u2013203 |doi=10.1016/S0171-2985(82)80074-0 |pmid=7047369 }}</ref> Osteoclasts break down bone tissue, and along with osteoblasts and osteocytes form the structural components of bone.

Bone is a highly vascular tissue, and active formation of blood vessel cells, also from mesenchymal stem cells, is essential to support the metabolic activity of bone.

Endochondral ossification is the process of forming bone from cartilage and this is the usual method. This form of [[Bone#Development|bone development]] is the more complex form: it follows the formation of a first skeleton of [[cartilage]] made by [[chondrocyte]]s, which is then removed and replaced by bone, made by osteoblasts. Intramembranous ossification is the direct ossification of [[mesenchyme]] as happens during the formation of the [[membrane bone]]s of the skull and others.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Larsen|first1=William J.|title=Human embryology|date=2001|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=0-443-06583-7|pages=355\u2013357|edition=3.}}</ref>\n\nDuring osteoblast [[cellular differentiation|differentiation]], [[Osteochondroprogenitor cell|the developing progenitor cell]]s express the regulatory [[transcription factor]] [[Cbfa1|Cbfa1/Runx2]].

The system of cartilage replacement by bone has a complex regulatory system. [[Bone morphogenetic protein 2|BMP2]] also regulates early skeletal patterning. [[transforming growth factor beta]] (TGF-\u03b2), is part of a superfamily of proteins that include BMPs, which possess common signaling elements in the [[TGF beta signaling pathway]]. TGF-\u03b2 is particularly important in [[cartilage]] differentiation, which generally precedes bone formation for endochondral ossification. An additional family of essential regulatory factors is the [[fibroblast growth factor]]s (FGFs) that determine where skeletal elements occur in relation to the skin\n\n===Steroid and protein hormones===\nMany other regulatory systems are involved in the transition of cartilage to bone and in bone maintenance. A particularly important bone-targeted hormonal regulator is [[parathyroid hormone]] (PTH). Parathyroid hormone is a protein made by the [[parathyroid]] gland under the control of serum calcium activity.<ref name=\"pmid18710437\"/> PTH also has important systemic functions, including to keep serum calcium concentrations nearly constant regardless of calcium intake. Increasing dietary calcium results in minor increases in blood calcium. However, this is not a significant mechanism supporting osteoblast bone formation, except in the condition of low dietary calcium; further, abnormally high dietary calcium raises the risk of serious health consequences not directly related to bone mass including [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and [[stroke]].<ref name=\"pmid25491763\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Reid IR, Bristow SM, Bolland MJ | title = Cardiovascular complications of calcium supplements | journal = J.

The bone matrix consists of [[protein]] and [[mineral]]. The protein forms the ''organic matrix.'' It is synthesized and then the mineral is added. The vast majority of the organic matrix is [[collagen]], which provides [[tensile strength]]. The matrix is mineralized by deposition of hydroxyapatite (alternative name, hydroxylapatite). This mineral is hard, and provides [[compressive strength]]. Thus, the collagen and mineral together are a [[composite material]] with excellent tensile and compressive strength, which can bend under a strain and recover its shape without damage. This is called [[elastic deformation]]. Forces that exceed the capacity of bone to behave elastically may cause failure, typically [[bone fracture]]s.\n\n==Bone remodeling==\nBone is a dynamic tissue that is constantly being [[bone remodeling|reshaped by osteoblasts]], which produce and secrete matrix proteins and transport mineral into the matrix, and [[osteoclasts]], which break down the tissues.\n\n=== Osteoblasts ===\nOsteoblasts are the major cellular component of bone. Osteoblasts arise from [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s (MSC). MSC give rise to osteoblasts, [[adipocyte]]s, and [[myocyte]]s among other cell types. Osteoblast quantity is understood to be inversely proportional to that of marrow adipocytes which comprise [[Marrow Adipose Tissue|marrow adipose tissue (MAT)]]. Osteoblasts are found in large numbers in the [[periosteum]], the thin connective tissue layer on the outside surface of bones, and in the [[endosteum]].\n\nNormally, almost all of the bone matrix, in the air breathing [[vertebrate]]s, is mineralized by the osteoblasts. Before the organic matrix is mineralized, it is called the [[osteoid]]. Osteoblasts buried in the matrix are called [[osteocytes]]. During bone formation, the surface layer of osteoblasts consists of cuboidal cells, called ''active osteoblasts'''''.''' When the bone-forming unit is not actively synthesizing bone, the surface osteoblasts are flattened and are called ''inactive osteoblasts''. Osteocytes remain alive and are connected by cell processes to a surface layer of osteoblasts. Osteocytes have important functions in skeletal maintenance.\n\n=== Osteoclasts ===\nOsteoclasts are multinucleated cells that derive from hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow which also give rise to monocytes in peripheral blood.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loutit |first1=J.F. |last2=Nisbet |first2=N.W. |title=The Origin of Osteoclasts |journal=Immunobiology |date=January 1982 |volume=161 |issue=3\u20134 |pages=193\u2013203 |doi=10.1016/S0171-2985(82)80074-0 |pmid=7047369 }}</ref> Osteoclasts break down bone tissue, and along with osteoblasts and osteocytes form the structural components of bone.
