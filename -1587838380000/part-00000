He is a [[crystal meth]] cook and dealer, and works with his former high school chemistry teacher, [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walter White]] ([[Bryan Cranston]]) in a meth operation. Jesse is the only character besides Walt to appear in every episode of the show. Paul reprised the role for the 2019 spin-off film ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a sequel to the series set after the events of the show's series finale.\n\nDespite plans to kill off the character at the end of the first season, Paul's performance convinced showrunner and head writer [[Vince Gilligan]] to keep Jesse in the show. The character and Paul's performance have received acclaim from critics and fans. Critics especially praised Jesse's character development from an unsympathetic drug dealer to the moral compass of the show as he becomes increasingly guilty and remorseful for his and Walter White's actions while involved in the drug trade.<ref name=\"Schultz\">{{cite web|first=Robert Downs|last=Schultz|url=https://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/174327-its-all-about-the-weight-yo-a-meditation-on-jesse-pinkmans-long-road/|title=It's All About the Weight, Yo: A Meditation on Jesse Pinkman's Long Road Down|work=[[PopMatters]]|date=August 21, 2013|accessdate=August 23, 2013}}</ref> For his portrayal, Paul won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]] in 2010, 2012, and 2014\u2014which makes him one of two actors to win the category three times, since its separation into drama and comedy.

Walt uses student records to track down Jesse, his former pupil, now aged 23, and [[blackmail]]s Jesse into letting Walt \"cook\" in the production side of Jesse's illegal drug trade.

Krazy-8 is suspicious and Emilio and he make Jesse bring them to meet Walt.

Dissatisfied with the amount of money Jesse is making as a low-level dealer, Walt convinces him to find a high-end distributor.

The landlord, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]] ([[Krysten Ritter]]), is a part-time tattoo artist and a recovering [[heroin]] addict. She and Jesse soon become romantically involved. Jane, however, tries to hide this relationship from her father, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Donald Margolis|Donald]] ([[John de Lancie]]), who owns their building.\n\nWhen Skinny Pete is robbed by a pair of addicts, Walt tells Jesse to \"handle it\". Jesse goes to the addicts' house to confront them, but the plan goes awry when one kills the other in front of him. While traumatic for Jesse, the incident ultimately helps his business; a rumor quickly spreads that Jesse killed the addict, giving him a fearsome reputation on the streets. Jesse is also instrumental in retaining the services of corrupt lawyer [[Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to help him and Walt [[money laundering|launder]] their money and get out of legal trouble.\n\nAfter Combo is murdered by rival dealers, Jesse starts using heroin with Jane to cope with his grief. His behavior nearly costs Walt a $1.2 million drug transaction with the powerful meth distributor [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]). Angered, Walt refuses to give Jesse his half of the money until he enters [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. When Jane learns about the money, she [[blackmail]]s Walt into giving Jesse his share, hoping to use the money to escape to [[New Zealand]]. Walt later returns to Jesse's apartment hoping to reconcile and finds Jesse and Jane asleep after getting high. He accidentally rolls Jane onto her back, and when she starts to choke on her vomit, Walt does nothing to help her. Jane dies and when Jesse awakes the next morning, he blames himself and goes on another drug binge. Walt rescues him from a [[crack house]] and checks him in to a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWhile in rehab, Jesse is told by a [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Group Leader|counselor]] ([[Jere Burns]]) to accept himself for who he is. At this point, Jesse has learned that Jane's father, an [[air traffic controller]], was so distraught over her death that he inadvertently caused a deadly [[mid-air collision]]. Jesse tells Walt that he has taken the counselor's advice and accepted himself as the \"bad guy\". Jesse leaves rehab clean and sober, and decides to settle unfinished business. First, with help from Saul, Jesse dupes his parents into selling him his aunt's house, at a drastically reduced price.\n\nHank correctly deduces that Jesse's RV is the [[rolling meth lab]] he has been looking for and tracks it down to a local junkyard, where Walt has brought it so it can be destroyed before Hank searches it. Jesse believes that Walt is stealing the RV from him, and goes to the junkyard as Hank follows.  Walt and Jesse lock themselves inside, and Walt and Saul arrange a fake emergency phone call to Hank, which says his wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) is in the hospital.  Hank leaves without searching the RV, giving Walt and Jesse enough time to destroy it in a vehicle compactor. A furious Hank follows Jesse home and beats him into unconsciousness. The incident leads to Hank not only getting suspended, but Jesse promising to sue him. While Jesse is hospitalized, Walt\u2014who is now working for Gus as a meth cook\u2014persuades Gus to renew Jesse and Walt's partnership so Jesse will drop the lawsuit. Jesse and Walt cook larger amounts of meth in Gus' underground \"superlab\", earning considerably more money.\n\nJesse becomes romantically involved with [[Andrea Cantillo]] ([[Emily Rios]]), a single mother and recovering meth addict from his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings. He eventually discovers that her 11-year-old brother, Tomas, had killed Combo on behalf of two dealers competing with Combo. Jesse concocts a plan to kill the dealers with [[ricin]] that Walt had earlier created, but Jesse is forced to cancel the plan after learning the dealers work for Gus. However, after Tomas is found murdered, an enraged Jesse sets out to kill the dealers anyway. Walt intervenes at the last moment, killing the two dealers and telling Jesse to run.\n\nAfter Jesse goes into hiding, Gus replaces him with [[Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]), Walt's previous assistant in the superlab. Walt realizes Gus is plotting to have Gale master his and Jesse's meth formula as part of a larger plan to be rid of him. To prevent this, Walt plots to have Jesse pre-emptively kill Gale. Jesse begs Walt to go to the police instead, insisting that he does not have it in him to kill someone. When Walt is cornered by Gus' men [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]) and [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Victor|Victor]] ([[Jeremiah Bitsui]]) at the superlab, he calls Jesse and tells him that he will have to kill Gale. Jesse shows up at Gale's apartment and, after a moment's hesitation, shoots him dead.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nImmediately after Gale's murder, Walt and Jesse are brought back to the superlab. Stuck with Walt and Jesse because he does not have Gale, and angry at Victor for being recognized at the scene of Gale's murder, Gus slices Victor's throat with a [[utility knife|box cutter]] in a gruesome show of force. Jesse dismisses Walt's fears that Gus is planning to kill them. He attempts to distract himself from the trauma of killing Gale by setting up a perpetual drug [[rave]] at his house. He also places a large amount of drug money in Andrea's mailbox, urging her to leave Albuquerque with her young son, Brock (Ian Posada). Jesse becomes increasingly indifferent to his own welfare, and steals meth from the superlab to fuel his drug-laden parties.\n\nMike informs Gus of Jesse's recklessness, but instead of ordering Jesse's death, Gus has Mike take Jesse on an errand to collect drop money. On the last pickup, Jesse sees a man with a shotgun approaching the car and attempts to run him over, then rams the man's car and drives away. It is revealed that the man with the shotgun was working for Mike, and this was designed to get Jesse out of his state of depression and make him more loyal to Gus. Walt correctly guesses that Gus is trying to drive a wedge into their partnership, but Jesse dismisses him. During Jesse's next assignment with Mike, which involves the retrieval of stolen meth from two addicts, Jesse gets one addict fixated on digging a hole in the yard and disarms the other, which impresses Gus. Shortly afterward, Jesse resumes his relationship with Andrea and becomes a father figure to Brock.\n\nWalt tasks Jesse with killing Gus with a vial of [[ricin]], which Jesse hides in a cigarette. Later on, when Gus is meeting with members of the cartel, Jesse considers spiking Gus' coffee with the ricin but refrains from doing so upon realizing that he could poison the third parties present (and might end up drinking the coffee himself). Walt pushes Jesse to try to set up a meeting, when Walt learns Hank is investigating Gus, but Walt backs off when he sees a text message implying that Jesse has been lying about not meeting Gus. Walt puts a tracking device on Jesse's vehicle and learns that Jesse had dinner at Gus' house the night before. Walt confronts Jesse, leading to a physical fight. Jesse gains the upper hand and commands Walt to leave and never come back.\n\nGus and Mike take Jesse on a trip to Mexico to have him teach Walt's formula to the cartel's chemists. Impressed with Jesse's skill, Gus seemingly arranges to have Jesse become their permanent cook. However, during a party, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of [[tequila]] to kill off the cartel's leadership, including its chieftain, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio|Don Eladio]] ([[Steven Bauer]]). Jesse saves Mike, who is shot during the chaos, and Gus, who purposely drank the poisoned tequila to get the cartel to do the same. Afterward, Gus offers to hire Jesse as his full-time cook. Jesse accepts on the condition that Gus spare Walt's life. When Walt's wife [[Skyler White|Skyler]] ([[Anna Gunn]]) and his children receive protection from the DEA following a threat on Hank's life, Gus uses the information to portray Walt as an informant, further attempting to widen the gap between Walt and Jesse. Walt goes to Jesse's house to plead for help, but Jesse throws him off his property.\n\nShortly afterward, Brock falls deathly ill. Jesse guesses that Brock has been poisoned by ricin and immediately assumes Walt is responsible. Jesse shows up at Walt's house and confronts him at gunpoint. However, Walt convinces Jesse that it was Gus who poisoned Brock, reminding him of Gus' willingness to kill children. Jesse eventually tells Saul about Gus' visits to Hector's retirement home, leading Walt to visit Hector himself and talk him into luring Gus to the location. Gus is subsequently killed when Walt sets up and Hector activates a [[pipe bomb]] beneath the elderly drug lord's wheelchair. After learning of Gus' death, Walt storms Gus' superlab and rescues Jesse.\n\nAfter they destroy the superlab, Jesse reveals that Brock was not poisoned by ricin, but by [[Lily of the Valley]] berries. Jesse realizes that Gus could not have poisoned Brock, but Walt assures him that killing Gus was the only course of action they could have taken. The final scene of the fourth season shows a potted Lily of the Valley in Walt's backyard, revealing that Walt had poisoned Brock in order to regain Jesse's loyalty and spur him into action as part of Walt's plan to kill Gus.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n====Part 1====\nJesse is torn up about what happened to Brock and becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to the ricin.

While both characters damage the lives of their loved ones, only Jesse is consumed by guilt, remorse, and self-hatred. Schultz writes that Jesse knows he is a bad person who can never properly repent for his sins. A life of crime, however, seems to be the only way for Jesse to not be a failure. Schultz disagrees, saying that Jesse is simply the \"conscience of the show, the moral center, the heart,\" but rather a more complex character.<ref name=\"Schultz\"/>\n\nAlyssa Rosenberg of

The landlord, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Jane Margolis|Jane Margolis]] ([[Krysten Ritter]]), is a part-time tattoo artist and a recovering [[heroin]] addict. She and Jesse soon become romantically involved. Jane, however, tries to hide this relationship from her father, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Donald Margolis|Donald]] ([[John de Lancie]]), who owns their building.\n\nWhen Skinny Pete is robbed by a pair of addicts, Walt tells Jesse to \"handle it\". Jesse goes to the addicts' house to confront them, but the plan goes awry when one kills the other in front of him. While traumatic for Jesse, the incident ultimately helps his business; a rumor quickly spreads that Jesse killed the addict, giving him a fearsome reputation on the streets. Jesse is also instrumental in retaining the services of corrupt lawyer [[Saul Goodman]] ([[Bob Odenkirk]]) to help him and Walt [[money laundering|launder]] their money and get out of legal trouble.\n\nAfter Combo is murdered by rival dealers, Jesse starts using heroin with Jane to cope with his grief. His behavior nearly costs Walt a $1.2 million drug transaction with the powerful meth distributor [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]). Angered, Walt refuses to give Jesse his half of the money until he enters [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]]. When Jane learns about the money, she [[blackmail]]s Walt into giving Jesse his share, hoping to use the money to escape to [[New Zealand]]. Walt later returns to Jesse's apartment hoping to reconcile and finds Jesse and Jane asleep after getting high. He accidentally rolls Jane onto her back, and when she starts to choke on her vomit, Walt does nothing to help her. Jane dies and when Jesse awakes the next morning, he blames himself and goes on another drug binge. Walt rescues him from a [[crack house]] and checks him in to a rehabilitation clinic.\n\n===Season 3===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWhile in rehab, Jesse is told by a [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Group Leader|counselor]] ([[Jere Burns]]) to accept himself for who he is. At this point, Jesse has learned that Jane's father, an [[air traffic controller]], was so distraught over her death that he inadvertently caused a deadly [[mid-air collision]]. Jesse tells Walt that he has taken the counselor's advice and accepted himself as the \"bad guy\". Jesse leaves rehab clean and sober, and decides to settle unfinished business. First, with help from Saul, Jesse dupes his parents into selling him his aunt's house, at a drastically reduced price.\n\nHank correctly deduces that Jesse's RV is the [[rolling meth lab]] he has been looking for and tracks it down to a local junkyard, where Walt has brought it so it can be destroyed before Hank searches it. Jesse believes that Walt is stealing the RV from him, and goes to the junkyard as Hank follows.  Walt and Jesse lock themselves inside, and Walt and Saul arrange a fake emergency phone call to Hank, which says his wife Marie ([[Betsy Brandt]]) is in the hospital.  Hank leaves without searching the RV, giving Walt and Jesse enough time to destroy it in a vehicle compactor. A furious Hank follows Jesse home and beats him into unconsciousness. The incident leads to Hank not only getting suspended, but Jesse promising to sue him. While Jesse is hospitalized, Walt\u2014who is now working for Gus as a meth cook\u2014persuades Gus to renew Jesse and Walt's partnership so Jesse will drop the lawsuit. Jesse and Walt cook larger amounts of meth in Gus' underground \"superlab\", earning considerably more money.\n\nJesse becomes romantically involved with [[Andrea Cantillo]] ([[Emily Rios]]), a single mother and recovering meth addict from his [[Narcotics Anonymous]] meetings. He eventually discovers that her 11-year-old brother, Tomas, had killed Combo on behalf of two dealers competing with Combo. Jesse concocts a plan to kill the dealers with [[ricin]] that Walt had earlier created, but Jesse is forced to cancel the plan after learning the dealers work for Gus. However, after Tomas is found murdered, an enraged Jesse sets out to kill the dealers anyway. Walt intervenes at the last moment, killing the two dealers and telling Jesse to run.\n\nAfter Jesse goes into hiding, Gus replaces him with [[Gale Boetticher]] ([[David Costabile]]), Walt's previous assistant in the superlab. Walt realizes Gus is plotting to have Gale master his and Jesse's meth formula as part of a larger plan to be rid of him. To prevent this, Walt plots to have Jesse pre-emptively kill Gale. Jesse begs Walt to go to the police instead, insisting that he does not have it in him to kill someone. When Walt is cornered by Gus' men [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]) and [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Victor|Victor]] ([[Jeremiah Bitsui]]) at the superlab, he calls Jesse and tells him that he will have to kill Gale. Jesse shows up at Gale's apartment and, after a moment's hesitation, shoots him dead.\n\n===Season 4===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nImmediately after Gale's murder, Walt and Jesse are brought back to the superlab. Stuck with Walt and Jesse because he does not have Gale, and angry at Victor for being recognized at the scene of Gale's murder, Gus slices Victor's throat with a [[utility knife|box cutter]] in a gruesome show of force. Jesse dismisses Walt's fears that Gus is planning to kill them. He attempts to distract himself from the trauma of killing Gale by setting up a perpetual drug [[rave]] at his house. He also places a large amount of drug money in Andrea's mailbox, urging her to leave Albuquerque with her young son, Brock (Ian Posada). Jesse becomes increasingly indifferent to his own welfare, and steals meth from the superlab to fuel his drug-laden parties.\n\nMike informs Gus of Jesse's recklessness, but instead of ordering Jesse's death, Gus has Mike take Jesse on an errand to collect drop money. On the last pickup, Jesse sees a man with a shotgun approaching the car and attempts to run him over, then rams the man's car and drives away. It is revealed that the man with the shotgun was working for Mike, and this was designed to get Jesse out of his state of depression and make him more loyal to Gus. Walt correctly guesses that Gus is trying to drive a wedge into their partnership, but Jesse dismisses him. During Jesse's next assignment with Mike, which involves the retrieval of stolen meth from two addicts, Jesse gets one addict fixated on digging a hole in the yard and disarms the other, which impresses Gus. Shortly afterward, Jesse resumes his relationship with Andrea and becomes a father figure to Brock.\n\nWalt tasks Jesse with killing Gus with a vial of [[ricin]], which Jesse hides in a cigarette. Later on, when Gus is meeting with members of the cartel, Jesse considers spiking Gus' coffee with the ricin but refrains from doing so upon realizing that he could poison the third parties present (and might end up drinking the coffee himself). Walt pushes Jesse to try to set up a meeting, when Walt learns Hank is investigating Gus, but Walt backs off when he sees a text message implying that Jesse has been lying about not meeting Gus. Walt puts a tracking device on Jesse's vehicle and learns that Jesse had dinner at Gus' house the night before. Walt confronts Jesse, leading to a physical fight. Jesse gains the upper hand and commands Walt to leave and never come back.\n\nGus and Mike take Jesse on a trip to Mexico to have him teach Walt's formula to the cartel's chemists. Impressed with Jesse's skill, Gus seemingly arranges to have Jesse become their permanent cook. However, during a party, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of [[tequila]] to kill off the cartel's leadership, including its chieftain, [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Don Eladio|Don Eladio]] ([[Steven Bauer]]). Jesse saves Mike, who is shot during the chaos, and Gus, who purposely drank the poisoned tequila to get the cartel to do the same. Afterward, Gus offers to hire Jesse as his full-time cook. Jesse accepts on the condition that Gus spare Walt's life. When Walt's wife [[Skyler White|Skyler]] ([[Anna Gunn]]) and his children receive protection from the DEA following a threat on Hank's life, Gus uses the information to portray Walt as an informant, further attempting to widen the gap between Walt and Jesse. Walt goes to Jesse's house to plead for help, but Jesse throws him off his property.\n\nShortly afterward, Brock falls deathly ill. Jesse guesses that Brock has been poisoned by ricin and immediately assumes Walt is responsible. Jesse shows up at Walt's house and confronts him at gunpoint. However, Walt convinces Jesse that it was Gus who poisoned Brock, reminding him of Gus' willingness to kill children. Jesse eventually tells Saul about Gus' visits to Hector's retirement home, leading Walt to visit Hector himself and talk him into luring Gus to the location. Gus is subsequently killed when Walt sets up and Hector activates a [[pipe bomb]] beneath the elderly drug lord's wheelchair. After learning of Gus' death, Walt storms Gus' superlab and rescues Jesse.\n\nAfter they destroy the superlab, Jesse reveals that Brock was not poisoned by ricin, but by [[Lily of the Valley]] berries. Jesse realizes that Gus could not have poisoned Brock, but Walt assures him that killing Gus was the only course of action they could have taken. The final scene of the fourth season shows a potted Lily of the Valley in Walt's backyard, revealing that Walt had poisoned Brock in order to regain Jesse's loyalty and spur him into action as part of Walt's plan to kill Gus.\n\n===Season 5===\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\n\n====Part 1====\nJesse is torn up about what happened to Brock and becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to the ricin.

Walt calls it off when he sees Hank and Gomez are accompanying Jesse, and Walt surrenders to Hank. Walt is arrested and Jesse spits in his face. Jack's crew then arrive despite being told not to, and a gunfight ensues in which Hank and Gomez are killed. Jesse hides under Walt's car, but Walt gives away Jesse's location.

The Italian attack failed, with only one merchant ship being slightly damaged. The destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} sank the Italian destroyer ''[[Sauro-class destroyer|Francesco Nullo]]''. ''Kimberley'' was hit, disabled by Italian [[shore batteries]] at [[Harmil|Harmil Island]] and towed to safety by the cruiser {{HMS|Leander||6}}.\n\nThe Italian ships had carried out their plan but lost one destroyer for no result; separating increased the chance of intercepting the convoy but sacrificed the benefits of concentration against the escorts. The British command at Aden criticised the escorts (excepting ''Kimberley'') for a lack of aggression but leaving the convoy to chase ships at night and in misty weather was risky. The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after [[Italian destroyer Daniele Manin|''Daniele Manin'']] was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January sortied again with no result.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Red Sea Force===\n[[File:Bab-el-Mandeb.png|thumb|{{centre|Bab-el-Mandeb (Gate of Tears) Strait}}]]\nThe approaches to the Red Sea through the Gulf of Aden, the {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} wide Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb (Gate of Tears) and the {{cvt|1200|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} passage to Suez, became the main sea route to the Middle East when hostilities began with Italy. South of Suez the British held [[Port Sudan]] on the west coast of the Red Sea (about halfway down) and [[Aden]], {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east of Bab-el-Mandeb. About {{cvt|350|nmi|abbr=on}} north of the Strait, on the west side of the Red Sea, was the Italian naval base of [[Massawa]] (Rear-Admiral [[Mario Bonetti]]), well placed for attacks by submarine and destroyer on British convoys. The Red Sea Force (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Murray, based at Aden) was established in April 1940, by Vice-Admiral [[Ralph Leatham]], the Commander-in-Chief [[East Indies Station]]. The British closed the Red Sea to merchant ships on 24 May 1940, until convoys could be organised.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=296, 426}}\n\n===Red Sea Flotilla===\n\n{{main|Red Sea Flotilla}}\n\nThe [[scout cruiser]]s ({{lang|it|esploratori}}, also [[Leone-class destroyer]]s) [[Italian destroyer Pantera|''Pantera'']] and [[Italian destroyer Leone|''Leone'']] (Commander Paolo Aloisi) had an unusually powerful armament of eight [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19|{{cvt|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns]], in four turrets on the centre line. Only two turrets could aim fore and aft but the eight-gun [[broadside]] was unique for destroyers. The class also carried two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-pom anti-aircraft guns, four {{nowrap|20 mm}} machine-guns,  four {{cvt|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes and {{nowrap|60 mines.}} The [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s had an armament of four [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Vickers Terni 1924|{{cvt|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns]], two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-poms, two {{nowrap|13.2 mm}} machine-guns, six {{cvt|533|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and {{nowrap|52 mines.}}{{sfn|Campbell|1985|pp=335\u2013338}} Once war was declared, the fuel stored for the Italian ships based at Massawa could only diminish under a British blockade.{{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}} Mechanical faults, fuel depletion and the enervating effect of the climate, hampered operations of the Red Sea Flotilla.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Convoy BN 7===\n[[File:HMAS Yarra (AWM 016263).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Australian sloop HMAS ''Yarra''}}]]\nConvoy BN 7 was northbound through the Red Sea and consisted of {{nowrap|32 British,}} Norwegian, French, Greek and Turkish merchant ships. The escort consisted of the light cruiser {{HMNZS|Leander}} (Commander James Rivett-Carnac), the destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} (Commander J. S. M. Richardson), the [[Egret-class sloop]] {{HMS|Auckland|L61|6}}, the [[Grimsby-class sloop]]s {{HMAS|Yarra|U77|6}} and {{HMIS|Indus|U67|6}} and the [[Hunt-class minesweeper (1916)|Hunt-class minesweepers]] {{HMS|Derby|J90|6}} and {{HMS|Huntley||}}.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}{{efn|After joining the Red Sea Force, ''Yarra'' had escorted convoys in the Red Sea and intercepted blockade-running [[dhow]]s.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|p=227}}}} Convoy BN 7 was nearing Perim, a [[volcanic island]] in the Bab-el-Mandeb, off the south-west coast of [[Yemen]], in the afternoon of 19 October, when an aircraft dropped four bombs close astern of one of the merchantmen. ''Leander'' and ''Auckland'' opened fire on the aircraft as it flew off to the west; shortly before dark, an undercarriage wheel of an Italian aircraft was picked up {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of the island. Next morning, Italian aircraft dropped four bombs, two of which fell ahead of the convoy and two bombs harmlessly astern of the French liner {{lang|fr|[[List of ships of the Free French Naval Forces|Felix Roussel]]}}, carrying New Zealand troops to Suez. At dusk ''Leander'' took station on the port beam of the convoy between it and the Italian base at Massawa, which flanked the line of advance; the convoy zig-zagged through the night.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}}\n\n===Italian sortie===\n\n[[File:Destroyer Pantera.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Italian destroyer ''Pantera''}}]]\nThe Italian flotilla sailed on 20 October, the destroyers operating in pairs, Section I, comprised the faster [[Italian destroyer Nazario Sauro|''Nazario Sauro'']] (Commander Moretti degli Adimari) and [[Italian destroyer Francesco Nullo (1925)|''Francesco Nullo'']] (Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]]). Section II, the slower, more heavily armed ''Pantera'' and ''Leone'' were to divert the convoy escort and would then attack the convoy with torpedoes. At 21:15 the two sections separated and at 23:21, ''Pantera'' sighted smoke from the convoy.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n''Pantera'' signalled ''Sauro'' and moved ahead of the convoy to intercept, with ''Leone'' following {{cvt|875|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} The convoy was about {{cvt|35|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north-north-west of [[Jabal al-Tair Island]] at 02:19 on 21 October, when ''Leander'' sighted two patches of smoke bearing north. ''Auckland'' reported two destroyers {{cvt|4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} off and ''Leander'' altered course to intercept, the captain assuming that they would run for home through the South Massawa Channel. After a challenge from ''Auckland'', ''Pantera'' fired over ''Yarra'' at the convoy, inflicting some splinter damage to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] on the convoy commodore's ship. ''Auckland'' opened fire and the ships separated and turned away at full speed, west-south-west, towards Massawa, firing their aft guns. The destroyers were broad on the port bow of HMAS ''Yarra'' when ''Pantera'' fired two torpedoes at 23:31 and another pair at 23:34.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Yarra'' avoided two torpedoes by turning towards them and \"combing\" their tracks.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}} Observers in ''Yarra'' thought that the leading enemy vessel was hit by their fourth or fifth salvo.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n''Sauro'' and ''Nullo'' had been manoeuvring to a more favourable position after receiving ''Pantera's'' sighting report, turned towards the convoy and spotted ''Leander'' at 01:48 (21 October). ''Sauro'' fired a torpedo at ''Leander'' which missed and ''Leander'' opened fire but lost sight of ''Sauro'' after two minutes. ''Sauro'' made another torpedo attack at 02:07 and turned away towards Massawa. (''Nullo'' was not able to attack after its rudder jammed for several minutes and lost contact with ''Sauro''.){{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} Borsini ordered ''Nullo'' towards the Italian batteries on Harmil Island.\nWhen the gunfire ceased, ''Leander'' altered course to north-west, to intercept the ships at the South Massawa Channel (Harmil Island Passage) and at 02:45, opened fire with {{nowrap|6-inch}} and star shells, on a ship that was firing red and green tracer. The range was increasing and the ship was lost to sight after the first salvoes. ''Leander'' altered course westwards to bring all guns to bear if the ships were making for the South Massawa Channel. At 02:20 ''Leander'' spotted ''Nullo'' by searchlight and exchanged fire for about ten minutes at about {{cvt|4600|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}}, ''Leander'' scoring several hits which damaged ''Nullo''{{'}}s [[gyrocompass]] and gunnery director. At 02:51, ''Leander'' lost contact in the haze and ceased fire (having fired a hundred and twenty-nine 6-inch rounds).{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=89\u201390}} ''Nullo'' headed toward Harmil Island with ''Leander'' in pursuit and at 03:00, ''Leander'' challenged a destroyer which turned out to be ''Kimberley'', also in pursuit. After five minutes, the cruiser altered course east to rejoin the convoy, since the Italian ship was drawing away at the rate of {{cvt|7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the convoy would be vulnerable to attack during a pursuit.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=90}}{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Harmil Island===\n\n[[File:Bab el Mandeb NASA with description.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Perim Island in the Bab el Mandeb (NASA)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' continued at maximum speed and at 03:50, sighted smoke ahead, apparently from two ships retiring at high speed. At 05:40 (21 October), off Harmil Island, lookouts on ''Kimberley'' and ''Nullo'' spotted each other at {{cvt|7|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}}. Borsini assumed that the ship was ''Sauro'' and then ''Kimberley'' opened fire at 05:53, taking ''Nullo'' by surprise, ''Nullo'' not returning fire for four minutes.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}} ''Kimberley'' closed the range to {{cvt|5000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} and at 06:20, ''Nullo'' scraped a reef, which damaged a propeller and sprung a leak. As ''Nullo'' rounded the island at about 06:25, it was hit once in the forward engine room and once in aft engine room. ''Nullo'' lost all power; Borsini gave the order to abandon ship and steered towards Harmil Island. The upper works were hit by shell splinters and the crew abandoned the ship, while Borsini tried to run the ship aground on the island. ''Nullo'' was then hit by the second of two torpedoes at 06:35, which broke it in two.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}} (Borsini and his assistant declined to leave the ship and were drowned.){{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}}{{efn|Borsini and his attendant Ciaravolo were awarded the Gold Medal by the Italian Navy, which then ordered that thenceforth, captains were to abandon ship.}} At 06:15 the four [[120 mm Italian naval gun|120 mm guns]] on Harmil Island engaged ''Kimberley'' and hit the engine-room, wounding three men and holing the steam pipes. While adrift {{cvt|10000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} from the shore battery, ''Kimberley'' silenced two of the guns and wounding four gunners with 45 HE shells from No. 3 mount.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}}\n\n[[File:HMS Kimberley.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|HMS ''Kimberley'' (photographed in 1942)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' managed to get under way, its speed reduced to {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the shore battery ceased fire when ''Kimbrley'' was {{cvt|19000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} away. ''Kimberley'' had fired 596 rounds of [[Armor-piercing shell|Semi-Armour Piercing]] and 97 [[High Explosive]] shells. ''Leander'' left the convoy and at 06:54 increased speed to {{cvt|26|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. By 07:34, ''Leander'' was making {{cvt|28.7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and soon after, ''Kimberley'' reported that it was steaming east at {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} on one engine.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}} At 08:25, ''Leander'' was {{cvt|16|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east by north of the Harmil South beacon and slowed to {{cvt|10|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Leander'' circled near ''Kimberley'' to keep freedom of manoeuvre, in case Italian bombers appeared. ''Kimberley'' had lost water in its boilers and ''Leander'' sent a boat with three shipwrights and an engine-room artificer; a wounded rating was transferred to the cruiser for medical attention. At about 10:00, ''Leander'' took ''Kimberley'' in tow.{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nThe British found that they were at a disadvantage in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by the flash of their guns, while the Italian ships carried flashless cordite and good tracer ammunition.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|pp=227\u2013228}} The escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden for a lack of aggression, excepting ''Kimberley'', despite the risk of abandoning the convoy at night in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two units, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, had meant that neither had the firepower to face the British escorts.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOf the {{nowrap|120 crew}} of ''Nullo'', Borsini declined to abandon ship and when his assistant Seaman Ciaravolo realised, jumped from his lifeboat to accompany his captain and both were drowned.

No damage was done and ''Leander'' and ''Kimberley'' re-joined Convoy BN 7 just after noon. (As they passed ''Felix Roussel'' they were cheered by hundreds of New Zealand soldiers.) In the afternoon, ''Leander'' transferred the tow to ''Kingston'' which left the convoy with ''Kimberley'' next morning, for Port Sudan. The southbound convoy BS 7 with {{nowrap|20 ships,}} was met by the convoy escorts in the afternoon of 23 October and after an uneventful passage, dispersed east of Aden on 28 October.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=91}} Later on 21 October, three [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 Squadron]] found and bombed the wreck of ''Francesco Nullo''.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=248}} The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after ''Daniele Manin'' was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January, sortied again with no result.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Attack on Convoy BN 14===\nOn the night of {{nowrap|2/3 February}} 1941, the Italian destroyers ''Pantera'', ''Tigre'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed from Massawa, to intercept a convoy known to be in the area. BN 14 consisted of 39 merchant ships escorted by the cruiser {{HMS|Caledon|D53|6}}, the destroyer {{HMS|Kingston|F64|6}} and the sloops ''Indus'' and ''Shoreham''. ''Sauro'' sighted the convoy and fired three torpedoes, then fired again at a ship seen in a cloud of smoke, before turning away at high speed. The two other ships did not receive the sighting report from ''Sauro'' but ten minutes later ''Pantera'' saw the ships and fired torpedoes, hearing explosions and claiming probables on two merchantmen; ''Tigre'' never made contact. Close to the Massawa South Channel, ''Nazario Sauro'' ran into ''Kingston'' and fearful of an ambush, the other Italian ships converged and called by wireless for air cover at dawn, reaching port unharmed. Local Italian press reports claimed that two ships had been hit but this had not occurred.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Red Sea Flotilla]]\n* [[Costantino Borsini]]\n* [[Attack on Convoy AN 14]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bragadin|1957}}\n|last=Bragadin |first=Marc' Antonio |title=The Italian Navy in World War II |translator-last=Hoffman |translator-first=G. |year=1957 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis Maryland |oclc=924029600 |lccn=57-6515}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Campbell|1985}}\n|last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink= |title =Naval Weapons of World War Two |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-87021-459-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Hermon|1957}}\n|last=Gill |first=G.

The Italian attack failed, with only one merchant ship being slightly damaged. The destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} sank the Italian destroyer ''[[Sauro-class destroyer|Francesco Nullo]]''. ''Kimberley'' was hit, disabled by Italian [[shore batteries]] at [[Harmil|Harmil Island]] and towed to safety by the cruiser {{HMS|Leander||6}}.\n\nThe Italian ships had carried out their plan but lost one destroyer for no result; separating increased the chance of intercepting the convoy but sacrificed the benefits of concentration against the escorts. The British command at Aden criticised the escorts (excepting ''Kimberley'') for a lack of aggression but leaving the convoy to chase ships at night and in misty weather was risky. The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after [[Italian destroyer Daniele Manin|''Daniele Manin'']] was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January sortied again with no result.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Red Sea Force===\n[[File:Bab-el-Mandeb.png|thumb|{{centre|Bab-el-Mandeb (Gate of Tears) Strait}}]]\nThe approaches to the Red Sea through the Gulf of Aden, the {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} wide Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb (Gate of Tears) and the {{cvt|1200|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} passage to Suez, became the main sea route to the Middle East when hostilities began with Italy. South of Suez the British held [[Port Sudan]] on the west coast of the Red Sea (about halfway down) and [[Aden]], {{cvt|100|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east of Bab-el-Mandeb. About {{cvt|350|nmi|abbr=on}} north of the Strait, on the west side of the Red Sea, was the Italian naval base of [[Massawa]] (Rear-Admiral [[Mario Bonetti]]), well placed for attacks by submarine and destroyer on British convoys. The Red Sea Force (Senior Naval Officer Red Sea, Rear-Admiral Murray, based at Aden) was established in April 1940, by Vice-Admiral [[Ralph Leatham]], the Commander-in-Chief [[East Indies Station]]. The British closed the Red Sea to merchant ships on 24 May 1940, until convoys could be organised.{{sfn|Roskill|1957|pp=296, 426}}\n\n===Red Sea Flotilla===\n\n{{main|Red Sea Flotilla}}\n\nThe [[scout cruiser]]s ({{lang|it|esploratori}}, also [[Leone-class destroyer]]s) [[Italian destroyer Pantera|''Pantera'']] and [[Italian destroyer Leone|''Leone'']] (Commander Paolo Aloisi) had an unusually powerful armament of eight [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Schneider-Canet-Armstrong 1918/19|{{cvt|4.7|in|mm|abbr=on}} guns]], in four turrets on the centre line. Only two turrets could aim fore and aft but the eight-gun [[broadside]] was unique for destroyers. The class also carried two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-pom anti-aircraft guns, four {{nowrap|20 mm}} machine-guns,  four {{cvt|533|mm|in|abbr=on}} torpedo tubes and {{nowrap|60 mines.}} The [[Sauro-class destroyer]]s had an armament of four [[120 mm Italian naval gun#45-calibre Vickers Terni 1924|{{cvt|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} guns]], two {{nowrap|40 mm}} pom-poms, two {{nowrap|13.2 mm}} machine-guns, six {{cvt|533|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} [[torpedo tube]]s and {{nowrap|52 mines.}}{{sfn|Campbell|1985|pp=335\u2013338}} Once war was declared, the fuel stored for the Italian ships based at Massawa could only diminish under a British blockade.{{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}} Mechanical faults, fuel depletion and the enervating effect of the climate, hampered operations of the Red Sea Flotilla.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Convoy BN 7===\n[[File:HMAS Yarra (AWM 016263).jpg|thumb|{{centre|Australian sloop HMAS ''Yarra''}}]]\nConvoy BN 7 was northbound through the Red Sea and consisted of {{nowrap|32 British,}} Norwegian, French, Greek and Turkish merchant ships. The escort consisted of the light cruiser {{HMNZS|Leander}} (Commander James Rivett-Carnac), the destroyer {{HMS|Kimberley|F50|6}} (Commander J. S. M. Richardson), the [[Egret-class sloop]] {{HMS|Auckland|L61|6}}, the [[Grimsby-class sloop]]s {{HMAS|Yarra|U77|6}} and {{HMIS|Indus|U67|6}} and the [[Hunt-class minesweeper (1916)|Hunt-class minesweepers]] {{HMS|Derby|J90|6}} and {{HMS|Huntley||}}.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=102}}{{efn|After joining the Red Sea Force, ''Yarra'' had escorted convoys in the Red Sea and intercepted blockade-running [[dhow]]s.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|p=227}}}} Convoy BN 7 was nearing Perim, a [[volcanic island]] in the Bab-el-Mandeb, off the south-west coast of [[Yemen]], in the afternoon of 19 October, when an aircraft dropped four bombs close astern of one of the merchantmen. ''Leander'' and ''Auckland'' opened fire on the aircraft as it flew off to the west; shortly before dark, an undercarriage wheel of an Italian aircraft was picked up {{cvt|15|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} south of the island. Next morning, Italian aircraft dropped four bombs, two of which fell ahead of the convoy and two bombs harmlessly astern of the French liner {{lang|fr|[[List of ships of the Free French Naval Forces|Felix Roussel]]}}, carrying New Zealand troops to Suez. At dusk ''Leander'' took station on the port beam of the convoy between it and the Italian base at Massawa, which flanked the line of advance; the convoy zig-zagged through the night.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}}\n\n===Italian sortie===\n\n[[File:Destroyer Pantera.JPG|thumb|{{centre|Italian destroyer ''Pantera''}}]]\nThe Italian flotilla sailed on 20 October, the destroyers operating in pairs, Section I, comprised the faster [[Italian destroyer Nazario Sauro|''Nazario Sauro'']] (Commander Moretti degli Adimari) and [[Italian destroyer Francesco Nullo (1925)|''Francesco Nullo'']] (Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]]). Section II, the slower, more heavily armed ''Pantera'' and ''Leone'' were to divert the convoy escort and would then attack the convoy with torpedoes. At 21:15 the two sections separated and at 23:21, ''Pantera'' sighted smoke from the convoy.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n''Pantera'' signalled ''Sauro'' and moved ahead of the convoy to intercept, with ''Leone'' following {{cvt|875|yd|m|abbr=on}} behind.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} The convoy was about {{cvt|35|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} north-north-west of [[Jabal al-Tair Island]] at 02:19 on 21 October, when ''Leander'' sighted two patches of smoke bearing north. ''Auckland'' reported two destroyers {{cvt|4|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} off and ''Leander'' altered course to intercept, the captain assuming that they would run for home through the South Massawa Channel. After a challenge from ''Auckland'', ''Pantera'' fired over ''Yarra'' at the convoy, inflicting some splinter damage to a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]] on the convoy commodore's ship. ''Auckland'' opened fire and the ships separated and turned away at full speed, west-south-west, towards Massawa, firing their aft guns. The destroyers were broad on the port bow of HMAS ''Yarra'' when ''Pantera'' fired two torpedoes at 23:31 and another pair at 23:34.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} ''Yarra'' avoided two torpedoes by turning towards them and \"combing\" their tracks.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=89}} Observers in ''Yarra'' thought that the leading enemy vessel was hit by their fourth or fifth salvo.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\n''Sauro'' and ''Nullo'' had been manoeuvring to a more favourable position after receiving ''Pantera's'' sighting report, turned towards the convoy and spotted ''Leander'' at 01:48 (21 October). ''Sauro'' fired a torpedo at ''Leander'' which missed and ''Leander'' opened fire but lost sight of ''Sauro'' after two minutes. ''Sauro'' made another torpedo attack at 02:07 and turned away towards Massawa. (''Nullo'' was not able to attack after its rudder jammed for several minutes and lost contact with ''Sauro''.){{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}} Borsini ordered ''Nullo'' towards the Italian batteries on Harmil Island.\nWhen the gunfire ceased, ''Leander'' altered course to north-west, to intercept the ships at the South Massawa Channel (Harmil Island Passage) and at 02:45, opened fire with {{nowrap|6-inch}} and star shells, on a ship that was firing red and green tracer. The range was increasing and the ship was lost to sight after the first salvoes. ''Leander'' altered course westwards to bring all guns to bear if the ships were making for the South Massawa Channel. At 02:20 ''Leander'' spotted ''Nullo'' by searchlight and exchanged fire for about ten minutes at about {{cvt|4600|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}}, ''Leander'' scoring several hits which damaged ''Nullo''{{'}}s [[gyrocompass]] and gunnery director. At 02:51, ''Leander'' lost contact in the haze and ceased fire (having fired a hundred and twenty-nine 6-inch rounds).{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=89\u201390}} ''Nullo'' headed toward Harmil Island with ''Leander'' in pursuit and at 03:00, ''Leander'' challenged a destroyer which turned out to be ''Kimberley'', also in pursuit. After five minutes, the cruiser altered course east to rejoin the convoy, since the Italian ship was drawing away at the rate of {{cvt|7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the convoy would be vulnerable to attack during a pursuit.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=90}}{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=103}}\n\n===Battle of Harmil Island===\n\n[[File:Bab el Mandeb NASA with description.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Perim Island in the Bab el Mandeb (NASA)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' continued at maximum speed and at 03:50, sighted smoke ahead, apparently from two ships retiring at high speed. At 05:40 (21 October), off Harmil Island, lookouts on ''Kimberley'' and ''Nullo'' spotted each other at {{cvt|7|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}}. Borsini assumed that the ship was ''Sauro'' and then ''Kimberley'' opened fire at 05:53, taking ''Nullo'' by surprise, ''Nullo'' not returning fire for four minutes.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}} ''Kimberley'' closed the range to {{cvt|5000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} and at 06:20, ''Nullo'' scraped a reef, which damaged a propeller and sprung a leak. As ''Nullo'' rounded the island at about 06:25, it was hit once in the forward engine room and once in aft engine room. ''Nullo'' lost all power; Borsini gave the order to abandon ship and steered towards Harmil Island. The upper works were hit by shell splinters and the crew abandoned the ship, while Borsini tried to run the ship aground on the island. ''Nullo'' was then hit by the second of two torpedoes at 06:35, which broke it in two.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=104}} (Borsini and his assistant declined to leave the ship and were drowned.){{sfn|Bragadin|1957|p=41}}{{efn|Borsini and his attendant Ciaravolo were awarded the Gold Medal by the Italian Navy, which then ordered that thenceforth, captains were to abandon ship.}} At 06:15 the four [[120 mm Italian naval gun|120 mm guns]] on Harmil Island engaged ''Kimberley'' and hit the engine-room, wounding three men and holing the steam pipes. While adrift {{cvt|10000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} from the shore battery, ''Kimberley'' silenced two of the guns and wounding four gunners with 45 HE shells from No. 3 mount.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}}\n\n[[File:HMS Kimberley.jpg|thumb|left|{{centre|HMS ''Kimberley'' (photographed in 1942)}}]]\n''Kimberley'' managed to get under way, its speed reduced to {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and the shore battery ceased fire when ''Kimbrley'' was {{cvt|19000|yd|nmi+km|abbr=on}} away. ''Kimberley'' had fired 596 rounds of [[Armor-piercing shell|Semi-Armour Piercing]] and 97 [[High Explosive]] shells. ''Leander'' left the convoy and at 06:54 increased speed to {{cvt|26|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. By 07:34, ''Leander'' was making {{cvt|28.7|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} and soon after, ''Kimberley'' reported that it was steaming east at {{cvt|15|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}} on one engine.{{sfnm|1a1=Waters|1y=1956|1p=90|2a1=O'Hara|2y=2009|2p=105}} At 08:25, ''Leander'' was {{cvt|16|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} east by north of the Harmil South beacon and slowed to {{cvt|10|kn|mph+km/h|abbr=on}}. ''Leander'' circled near ''Kimberley'' to keep freedom of manoeuvre, in case Italian bombers appeared. ''Kimberley'' had lost water in its boilers and ''Leander'' sent a boat with three shipwrights and an engine-room artificer; a wounded rating was transferred to the cruiser for medical attention. At about 10:00, ''Leander'' took ''Kimberley'' in tow.{{sfn|Waters|1956|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\n\nThe British found that they were at a disadvantage in night fighting as they were temporarily blinded by the flash of their guns, while the Italian ships carried flashless cordite and good tracer ammunition.{{sfn|Hermon|1957|pp=227\u2013228}} The escorts were blamed by the headquarters at Aden for a lack of aggression, excepting ''Kimberley'', despite the risk of abandoning the convoy at night in poor visibility. The Italians had managed to make two torpedo attacks as planned but the division of the destroyers into two units, after previous sorties had failed to find any ships, had meant that neither had the firepower to face the British escorts.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Casualties===\nOf the {{nowrap|120 crew}} of ''Nullo'', Borsini declined to abandon ship and when his assistant Seaman Ciaravolo realised, jumped from his lifeboat to accompany his captain and both were drowned.

No damage was done and ''Leander'' and ''Kimberley'' re-joined Convoy BN 7 just after noon. (As they passed ''Felix Roussel'' they were cheered by hundreds of New Zealand soldiers.) In the afternoon, ''Leander'' transferred the tow to ''Kingston'' which left the convoy with ''Kimberley'' next morning, for Port Sudan. The southbound convoy BS 7 with {{nowrap|20 ships,}} was met by the convoy escorts in the afternoon of 23 October and after an uneventful passage, dispersed east of Aden on 28 October.{{sfn|Waters|1956|p=91}} Later on 21 October, three [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers of [[No. 45 Squadron RAF|45 Squadron]] found and bombed the wreck of ''Francesco Nullo''.{{sfn|Playfair|1954|p=248}} The Italians made another fruitless sortie on 3 December, cancelled one in January 1941 after ''Daniele Manin'' was damaged by a bomb and on 24 January, sortied again with no result.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|p=105}}\n\n===Attack on Convoy BN 14===\nOn the night of {{nowrap|2/3 February}} 1941, the Italian destroyers ''Pantera'', ''Tigre'' and ''Nazario Sauro'' sailed from Massawa, to intercept a convoy known to be in the area. BN 14 consisted of 39 merchant ships escorted by the cruiser {{HMS|Caledon|D53|6}}, the destroyer {{HMS|Kingston|F64|6}} and the sloops ''Indus'' and ''Shoreham''. ''Sauro'' sighted the convoy and fired three torpedoes, then fired again at a ship seen in a cloud of smoke, before turning away at high speed. The two other ships did not receive the sighting report from ''Sauro'' but ten minutes later ''Pantera'' saw the ships and fired torpedoes, hearing explosions and claiming probables on two merchantmen; ''Tigre'' never made contact. Close to the Massawa South Channel, ''Nazario Sauro'' ran into ''Kingston'' and fearful of an ambush, the other Italian ships converged and called by wireless for air cover at dawn, reaching port unharmed. Local Italian press reports claimed that two ships had been hit but this had not occurred.{{sfn|O'Hara|2009|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Red Sea Flotilla]]\n* [[Costantino Borsini]]\n* [[Attack on Convoy AN 14]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Bragadin|1957}}\n|last=Bragadin |first=Marc' Antonio |title=The Italian Navy in World War II |translator-last=Hoffman |translator-first=G. |year=1957 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis Maryland |oclc=924029600 |lccn=57-6515}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Campbell|1985}}\n|last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink= |title =Naval Weapons of World War Two |publisher=Naval Institute Press |location=Annapolis, Maryland |year=1985 |isbn=978-0-87021-459-2}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Hermon|1957}}\n|last=Gill |first=G.

Mieszko was [[Prince of Cracow]] from 1086 until his death in 1089.\n\n== Biography ==\nMieszko was, in all likelihood, born in Cracow sometime around or during A.D. 1069. He was the eldest son of the king of Poland [[Boles\u0142aw II the Bold]] and his wife Wyszeslawa. According to the Chronicler [[Gallus Anonymus]], Mieszko was being groomed for the responsibilities of a monarch from an early age. At the age of ten, his father, Boles\u0142aw, was deposed by a rebellion led by his brother, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman]]. Mieszko was forced to leave his country and his education behind and seek refuge at the friendly court of [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]]. The king of Hungary was apparently very fond of young Mieszko and treated him like a son.<ref>Gallus Anonymus \u2013 ''\u201cCronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum\u201d'' (c.1115)</ref>\n\n== Return to Poland ==\nFollowing the death of his father in 1081, Mieszko remained in Hungary until 1086 when he is known to have returned to his homeland. There are two conflicting versions explaining the circumstances of this return. Chronicler Gallus Anonymus simply states that Mieszko was peacefully summoned to Poland by his uncle [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman]]. It is likely that this was facilitated by a deal between Ladislaus I of Hungary and W\u0142adys\u0142aw I Herman. Another version, publicized by a Hungarian chronicler, claims that in 1086 Ladislaus I of Hungary invaded the Kingdom of [[Poland]], took control of [[Cracow]], and installed Mieszko as its ruler.<ref>Mark of Kalt - ''\"Chronicon pictum, Marci de Kalt, Chronica de gestis Hungarorum\"'' (c.1360)</ref>\n\n== Prince of Cracow ==\nThough there is no direct primary source evidence for this, notes in Cracow almanacs strongly suggest that during the years 1086 - 1089 Mieszko was [[prince]] of [[Cracow]]. However, sometime during this time he accepted over-lordship of his uncle Wladyslaw I Herman, and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in the way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring border residents. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and the United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for [[Tejanos]]. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Eventually, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. Cortez then shot Morris with his pistol.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref> The killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]], left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville]], close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) /> <ref>Paredes 91</ref>. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)>[https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref><ref>Paredes 94</ref> . The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death <ref>Paredes 91</ref>.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a ruling emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nCortez's hearings continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris; saying he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n*[[Manifest Destiny]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.

After an altercation in which he killed [[Sheriff]] W.T.(Brack) Morris, Cortez went on the run from the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] for thirteen days. He became the target of the largest manhunt in U.S. history from June 14, 1901 to June 22, 1901. He was accused of murdering two sheriffs and finally convicted of horse theft.<ref>{{harvnb|Alvear|2006|page= 1}}</ref>\n\nCelebrated by fellow Mexican-Americans for his ability to evade the authorities, as well as his impassioned words in court, Cortez's life was converted into a [[legend]] by people on the [[Rio Grande]] border.<ref name=\"rodriguez\">{{harvnb|Rodr\u00edguez}}</ref> This legend, which took shape in a popular song, the \"Corrido de Gregorio Cortez,\" dramatized Cortez's fight against the authorities and transformed him into an inspiration for the [[Mexican-American border]] communities. This [[corrido]] (or [[border ballad]]), sung at local cantinas, resonated with its listeners, and ignited pride in the way of life on the border. The conversion of Cortez into myth was analyzed by [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in his book ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', which examines the many versions of this corrido as well as the story's historical basis in order to understand how an average man such as Gregorio Cortez was canonized into a folkloric hero inspiring border residents. Cortez's story was also depicted in the movie ''[[The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez]]'', starring [[Edward James Olmos]].\n\n==Background==\n\nTexas was part of newly independent Mexico from 1821 until 1836 when it declared its independence. The annexation by the United States was approved by the congresses of Texas and the United States in 1845, and the transfer of authority from the republic to the state of Texas took place in 1846. However, Mexico's rejection of this annexation and a disagreement over the location of the new border, namely, a dispute over the area between [[the Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River]], led to the [[Mexican-American War]]. In the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], signed on February 2, 1848, Mexico gave up its claim to [[Texas]] and the new border between Mexico and the United States was settled along the [[Rio Grande]].<ref>{{harvnb|Campbell|2003|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. annexation brought land loss and limitations to political access for [[Tejanos]]. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised American citizenship to residents who wanted to stay in Texas, but Tejanos in the lower Rio Grande Valley were relegated to second-class status. Also, while it provided that the property rights of Mexican subjects would be inviolable, these rights were later challenged by the United States authorities. <ref name= Valerio-Jimenez2012> Valerio-Jim\u00e9nez, Omar S., and e-Duke Books Scholarly Collection 2012.

An antagonistic relationship between [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican-Americans]] has developed in Texas due to a cycle of revenge involving Bandit Gang, Texas Rangers and innocent [[Mexican-Americans]] collaterals victims.<ref>{{harvnb|Levario|2012|page= 18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Alonzo|1998|page= 132}}</ref> However, the role of the Texas Rangers in discrimination is a subject of historical controversy. On the one hand, the Texas Rangers were portrayed as heroic figures protecting settlers from Indian raids and Mexican banditry. On the other hand, they have been described as the main tool of [[Anglo]] expansion on lands formerly occupied by Mexicans and Native Americans.<ref>{{harvnb|Weiss Jr|2012|page= 41}}</ref> To move beyond this dichotomy, historian Robert M. Utley exposes the complex nature of the relationship between the [[Mexican Americans]] and the Texas Rangers. While some rangers may have been \"ruthless, brutal and more lawless than the criminals they were prosecuting,\" he argues that there is no systematic evidence of persecution of Mexican-Americans by this police force <ref>Utley, page xii</ref>.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nGregorio Cortez Lira was born in the state of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Mexico]]<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>, near the U.S.-Mexico border, the son of Roman Cortez Garza, a rancher, and Rosalia Lira Cortinas. Cortez and his first wife divorced in 1903, and in 1905 he married Estefana Garza<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>. They had no children and later separated.<ref name=\"orozco\">{{harvnb|Orozco}}</ref>\n\nIn 1887, his family moved to [[Manor, Texas]] near [[Austin]]. Two years later, Cortez joined his older brother, Romaldo Cortez, in finding seasonal employment on the farms and ranches of South Texas. Eventually, Cortez married Leonor D\u00edaz; they had four children. After eleven years as ''vaqueros'', or cowboys, and farmhands, Cortez and his brother settled on a farm in [[Karnes County]], renting land from a local rancher. It is known that he spoke [[English language|English]] and owned horses.<ref name=\"orozco\" />\n\nAt the time that Cortez and his family had immigrated to South Texas, [[Anglo]]s had also begun to penetrate the region in increasing numbers, particularly with the arrival of the railroad. As political and economic power shifted to the newcomers, most Mexican Americans, like Cortez, lived as hired agricultural workers or as tenant farmers. Class and ethnicity relegated them to the bottom of a discriminatory Anglo-dominated Texas society.<ref name= \"jastrzembski\">{{harvnb|Jastrzembski|2000}}</ref>\n\n== Adventure of Cortez ==\n\n=== Incident ===\nThe visit to Cortez followed their interrogation of Villareal in connection with a reported [[horse theft]]. Villareal had already acknowledged his recent trade of a horse for a [[mare]] belonging to Gregorio Cortez. And it was exactly this distinction made in Spanish, between a male horse (''caballo'') and a female horse or mare (''yegua''), that Choate misunderstood when questioning Gregorio. The latter answered negatively when asked on behalf of the Sheriff whether he had recently traded for a horse. For, in truth, he had traded a mare.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nCourt records show that the killings of Romaldo (also known as Rom\u00e1n) Cortez, Gregorio's brother, and [[Sheriff]] W.T. (Brack) Morris were related to the subject of a horse trade.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref> Morris arrived accompanied by one of his [[deputies]], Boone Choate, who could speak Spanish and would thus serve as an interpreter.<ref name=\"sorell154\">{{harvnb|Sorell|1983|page=154}}</ref>\n\nInterpreting the response as a lie, the Sheriff made clear his intention to arrest the Cortez brothers. More words were exchanged and a gun battle followed. The sheriff was the first to draw a pistol despite the suspicion on his part that both Cortezes were probably unarmed. Gregorio killed Sheriff Morris in [[self-defense]] after the Sheriff had fired repeatedly on his brother Romaldo who, thinking that Gregorio was unarmed, ran at the Sheriff trying to protect Gregorio.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nThe Sheriff shot Romaldo and he fell away from the door. Cortez then shot Morris with his pistol.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 40}}</ref> The killing occurred on June 14, 1901.<ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\n=== Escape to the Robledo ranch ===\n\nAfter the run-in with [[Sheriff]] Morris and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Deputy]] Boone, Cortez wanted to take his injured brother to the closest town, [[Kenedy, Texas]], for medical assistance about 10 miles away. Both on [[horseback]], Cortez and his brother, Romaldo, struggled on their journey as Romaldo was severely hurt and kept falling off his horse. However, Gregorio eventually reached [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]], left Romaldo in town to be taken care of, and began his flight from the authorities.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 66}}</ref> \n\nAs officers thought Cortez would be heading south to the border to escape, he decided to head north instead to confuse his pursuers. <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> He traveled 55 miles from [[Kenedy, Texas|Kenedy]] to [[Belmont, Texas|Belmont]] in hopes of hiding at the house of his friend, Mart\u00edn Robledo. After spending a couple of days at the Robledo ranch, authorities discovered Cortez's whereabouts and thus begun the Battle of Belmont.\n\n=== Battle of Belmont ===\nAfter escaping, Cortez went to the ranch of Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo near [[Belmont, Texas]]. There were seven persons at the Robledo house. Mart\u00edn and Refugia Robledo, their three sons, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez (a boy living with the Robledos) and a visitor, Mart\u00edn Sandoval. Gonzales County Sheriff Robert M. Glover, a friend of Sheriff Morris, knew where Cortez was hiding, probably from information obtained under duress. This information would have been either provided by Cortez's mother, wife or sister-in-law as they were the only people who knew where Cortez was going.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals report of facts, on June 15, 1904, at the time Sheriff Morris was killed, Sheriff Glover was in [[Cuero]], [[DeWitt County, Texas]]. Glover proceeded with a [[deputy sheriff]] of De Witt County to Kennedy, in [[Karnes County]], and there for the first time learned that Cortez was the man who had killed Sheriff Morris. Glover, knowing the rendezvous of Cortez, boarded a train in about twenty minutes after receiving the information that Cortez had done the killing and proceeded as expeditiously as he could to the town of Ottine, in Gonzales County; there secured horses, and accompanied by two deputy sheriffs of [[Gonzales County]], including Deputy Swift, and other parties, went a few miles in the country to the Schnable ranch; and there learned that Cortez was at the home of Martin Roblero. He and his posse went to Roblero's. The posse divided as they approached the house from the north side; Glover and one or more companions going on the east side of the house around to the south side; and the other parties going on the west side around to the south side of the house. According to the Court, Some of the testimony tends to show that the sheriff's posse shot first; but the preponderance of the evidence shows that Cortez and Bonafacio fired the first shot. Just before the time that the sheriff's posse arrived at the house, Cortez informed Bonafacio that the Sheriff's troop would be on his tail and asked him what he should do, whether to fight or surrender. Bonafacio would have said, \"We will fight\". Immediately upon Glover getting around to a point opposite the gallery on the south side of the house, Cortez and Bonafacio Roblero (the Roblero's eldest son), who were in the gallery, allegedly fired upon Glover and killed him. There was a general fusillade of shots on the part of the posse and Cortez and Bonafacio. On the other hand, in his testimony, Cortez asserts that the officers came up and immediately fired upon him; that he returned this fire. <ref name= TexasAppeals />\n\nThe San-Antonio Express called the Battle of Belmont, as it came to be known, \u201ca tale of bravery unsurpassed on the part of the officers and of desperation on the part of the Mexicans.\u201d. According to this version of the story, Cortez was waiting in ambush, and as Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel approached, he opened fire. Sheriff Glover and Posseman Schnabel were killed <ref>San Antonio Express, June 16, 1901</ref>\n\nThe actual story, according to the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]], was less heroic. Just hours after Cortez arrived at the ranch, Glover and his posse had surrounded the house and began to attack. Cortez fired at Glover who fell dead before running into the brush behind the house to hide. Robledo, his eldest son, and Sandoval were involved in the shooting, while Robledo's wife, his two younger sons and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez stayed unarmed inside the house. Shots were exchanged and Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez was wounded, as well as Robledo\u2019s wife. Another member of the posse shot and killed accidentally his companion, Henry Schnabel. In the end, the posse captured five of the Mexicans, including the two wounded. Cortez, however, escaped.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= ??}}</ref>\n\n=== Flight ===\n\nAfter narrowly escaping the [[Mexican standoff|standoff]] on the Robledo [[ranch]], Cortez \"walked directly south to the [[Bank (geography)|banks]] of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] [...] to another friend, Ceferino Flores.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 72}}</ref> Flores gave Cortez a horse and saddle to continue his journey. Cortez would frequently ride in circles and create paths in different directions to throw off the authorities. After days of travel, the [[mare]] grew weary and dropped dead. Soon saddling another small horse, Cortez continued south, just outside of [[Floresville, Texas|Floresville]], close to [[Cotulla]]. Though Cortez succeeded in creating disorientating routes for officers to follow, he traveled close to the Corpus Christi-to-Laredo [[railroad]] and made it evident that he was moving toward [[Laredo\u2013Nuevo Laredo|Laredo]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> As the law was close behind him, Cortez took risks; having his newfound horse jump over sharp wire fences or pretending he was a [[cattle]] [[herder]]. But on June 20, as the mare could not continue, Cortez left the horse and snuck into [[Cotulla]] and received food and new clothes from locals. Cortez did not have a horse and was essentially surrounded by authorities. However, he went unnoticed, authorities believed he had acquired yet another horse, and that their only chance of catching Cortez would be by accident. Over his 10 day journey, Cortez had ridden three horses, traveled over 500 hundred miles, and had seemingly blended in with the townspeople of [[Cotulla]] <ref name= SanAntonio2016> [https://www.mysanantonio.com/opinion/commentary/article/Gregorio-Cortez-the-myth-and-the-man-7420445.php L\u00f3pez, Jos\u00e9 A. \"Gregorio Cortez, the myth and the man.\" ''San Antonio Express-News,'' 7 May 2016.] </ref>.\n\nDuring those 10 days, Cortez was pursued by a posse that at times included up to 300 men. He traveled nearly 400 miles on horseback and more than 100 miles on foot. His story was symbolic of the struggles between the [[Anglo-Americans]] and [[Mexican Americans]] in [[South Texas]].<ref>Afterword by Bill Crider. Elmer Kelton. ''Manhunters''. Texas Christian University Press, 1994</ref>\n\n=== Capture ===\n\nGregorio managed to elude hundreds of men in parties of up to three hundred by riding four hundred miles on mares and walking at least 120 miles along the [[Mexico-Texas border]] before ultimately being captured on June 22.<ref name=\"sorell154\" />\n\nSuspecting Gregorio\u2019s presence nearby, Glover and eight other Rangers approached the Martin Robledo home at dawn after drinking a bottle of whiskey together. He divided his posse to the east and west sides to surround the house. With the confusion from the alcohol and darkness of night, the shooting began as Glover reached the southeast corner of the home. Glover and Gregorio fired at each other until Glover fell dead from his horse. With two lawmen dead, an extensive manhunt began for Gregorio. The [[Texas Ranger Division]] became involved when the sheriff of [[Atascosa County]] and Ranger Robert M. Glover were shot on the Thulemeyer ranch. \n\nFrom June 15 to June 25, 1901, the story was front-page news of the [[Daily Express]]. Through the newspaper, Cortez, a lone Mexican vaquero, was transformed into a dynamic leader of well-organized thieves. While the [[Euro-American]] public viewed Cortez as a guilty Mexican, Mexican-Americans transformed Cortez into a heroic figure that could outrun the renowned Texas Rangers, and stand up to his oppressors.<ref>Alvear, 28</ref>\n\n== Trials ==\n=== Court proceedings ===\n\n==== Supporters ====\n\nAfter the capture of Cortez, before court proceedings would begin, [[Mexican-Americans]] across the country started a defense fund for Cortez, saying that without the support it would be impossible for him to get a fair trial <ref name= GarberCourts />. The amount of money raised is unknown, however, the fund was largely advertised by a newspaper publisher, Pablo Cruz, and the Sociedad Trabajador Miguel Hidalgo in [[San Antonio]] and saw donations flood in from rich landowners and even local \"rancheros\".<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though Cortez's support was mainly from those of Mexican descent, some [[Anglo-Americans]] admired his \"intellect, wisdom and ingenuity <ref name= SanAntonio2016 />. Some prominent Anglo-Texans aiding Cortez were then [[Texas Secretary of State]], F.C. Weinert, and [[defense lawyer]], R.B Abernathy, who Cortez remembered as one of his most vital attorneys, defending him for over four years <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />.\n\n==== Gonzales trial ====\nThe first of Cortez's trials began on July 24, 1901, in [[Gonzales, Texas]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> Though many [[Mexicans]] were vocal about and attended the [[trial]] in Gonzales, the [[jury]] consisted of eleven [[Anglo-Americans]] and one [[African-American]]. At Gonzales, \"a gallery full of lawmen filled the courtroom\" <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" /> and wanted to see Cortez sentenced. The [[prosecution]] tried Cortez for the murder of [[Constable]] Schnabel, one of the men killed at the Battle of Belmont (see above) <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The prosecution had originally claimed the murder to have been done by Mrs. Robledo during the fight, but they shifted the blame to Cortez and told Robledo to testify that she had seen Cortez shoot and kill both Schnabel and Glover<ref name= Algren1997>Algren, Nelson. ''The Last Carousel''. New York, Seven Stories Press, 1997. </ref>. Another [[witness]], Manuel Tom, strengthened the claim, saying that Cortez had confessed to him about killing the two men near a [[barn]] where Robledo described. However, when asked what was the Spanish word for barn (granero) the best Tom could do was say ''casa'', the word for house <ref name= CortezAppeals1902> [https://law.jrank.org/pages/2731/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04-Appeals-Challenge-Convictions.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Appeals Challenge Convictions.]</ref>. The trial swayed all jurors, besides an A.L Sanders who believed Cortez to be innocent. However, as a family member of Sanders's soon developed a serious illness and the juror needed to return home. Sanders succumbed to the jury's pressure and agreed with the others that Cortez was guilty; ultimately sentencing Cortez to 50 years in prison for [[second-degree murder]] <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) /> <ref>Paredes 91</ref>. Though Sanders later told the defense he voted \"guilty\" to be there for his sick family member and the attorneys motioned for a new trial, however, their plea was struck down and Sanders was fined $100 for [[contempt of court]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 91}}</ref>\n\nMany local officers were enraged about the [[verdict]] as they wanted to see Cortez face the [[death penalty]]. A few months later, as Cortez was in a Gonzales jail, over 300 men arranged a [[lynching]] of the recently sentenced prisoner <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2)>[https://law.jrank.org/pages/2733/Gregorio-Cortez-Appeals-1902-04.html Gregorio Cortez Appeals: 1902-04 Convictions Upheld In Glover Shooting] </ref><ref>Paredes 94</ref> . The hate-filled attempts were unsuccessful, but tensions grew further as soon thereafter, on January 15, 1902, the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed Cortez's sentence <ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />. The appeal was upheld as the court doubted that Cortez could have murdered both officers within quick succession, as he would have been in two places at the same time, and denied Manuel Tom's crude translation of the word ''barn'' <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. The Gonzales Trial was ultimately a win for Cortez and his defense team, as he would not be tried for the murder of Schnabel again. However, the prosecution backed by the rage of local police forces continued working to see Cortez serve life behind bars or be sentenced to death <ref>Paredes 91</ref>.\n\n==== Further legal battles ====\nThough Cortez's sentence for the killing of Schnabel was reversed in early 1902 <ref name=GarberCourts> Garber, Margorie B.; Matlock, Jann; Walkowitz, Rebecca (1993). Media Spectacles. New York: Routledge. pp. 91\u2013116.</ref>, Cortez had faced a previous trial from Oct 7-11, 1901 in [[Karnes City, Texas]] and was sentenced to death for the murder of Sherrif Morris <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. At this trial, \"the families of both Morris and Glover were sat in the front row, where the prosecution could point them out to the jury.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 92}}</ref> However, eight months after the Karnes verdict, the [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] reversed the sentence on the grounds of [[prejudice]] <ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />. Legal proceedings transferred to [[Pleasanton, Texas]] where a ruling emprisoned Cortez for two years for [[horse theft]]. The court ruling was soon reversed.<ref>Brown 146</ref>\n\nCortez's hearings continued to [[Goliad, Texas]] where the jury could not agree on a sentence for Cortez with \"seven for first-degree murder, four for second-degree murder, and one for acquittal.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 93}}</ref> The trials soon went to [[Wharton County]], where it was dismissed almost immediately, and then to Corpus Christi where Cortez was tried April 25-30, 1904. The jury, consisting of twelve white farmers, found Cortez not guilty for the killing of Morris; saying he acted in [[self-defense]].<ref name= CortezAppeals1902 />\n\nHowever, there was no celebration of the [[acquittal]], as soon thereafter, a court in [[Columbus, Texas]] found Cortez guilty for the murder of Sheriff Glover and sentenced him to life in prison <ref name= CortezAppeal1902(2) />. Though the defense was optimistic about their [[appeal]] being upheld, Cortez's lawyers had built a case saying that Cortez had not fired shots anywhere near Glover in the Battle of Belmont which many witnesses denied.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 94}}</ref>. The [[Court of Criminal Appeals]] soon upheld the [[conviction]], and on Jan 1, 1905, Gregorio Cortez began his [[life sentence]] in the [[Huntsville Penitentiary]] for the murder of Sheriff Glover.<ref name= TexasAppeals>[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4148411/cortez-v-state/ Cortez v. State, 83 S.W. 812 (Tex. Crim. App. 1904)] </ref>\n\n=== Prison and pardon ===\nCortez was sentenced not for the death of Morris (which sparked the entire escapade), but for his alleged murder of Sheriff Robert M. Glover, who was killed during the pursuit. Efforts to have Cortez pardoned began with his incarceration and finally succeeded in 1913 when Governor [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Oscar Colquitt]] issued him a conditional [[pardon]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> He was freed on July 14 of that year.\n\n== Post-prison life and death ==\n\nAfter his pardon in 1913, Cortez thanked those who helped secure his freedom, spent his later years in [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico]], and joined the losing [[Victoriano Huerta|Huertist]] forces of the [[Mexican Revolution]].<ref name=\"orozco\" /> After being wounded in the war, Cortez began living with one of his sons in [[Manor, Texas]] then later resided in [[Anson, Texas]].<ref>Brown, 150</ref><ref name= Deutsch2012>[https://repository.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/19510/cfch_Deutsch_GregorioCortez.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y Deutsch, James I. 2012. \"Gregorio Cortez.\" in Great Lives from History: Latinos.]</ref>. Then on February 28, 1916, having been recently married for the third time to an assumed Esther Mart\u00ednez, Cortez died suddenly at the age of 40.<ref name=\"orozco\" /><ref name=\"jastrzembski\" />\n\nTo this day, the [[cause of death]] of Cortez is contested.

In [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]]'s book, ''With His Pistol in His Hand'', he recites eleven versions of ''El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez'' each sung by numerous ''guitarreros'' (guitarists) near the [[Mexican-American border]].<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 175}}</ref> Though each [[corrido]] had their own style, flair, or message wanting to be relayed, they all exaggerated the life of Cortez to transform him into a Mexican [[folk hero]].\n\n=== With His Pistol in His Hand ===\n\nThe life and legend of Gregorio Cortez were studied by the scholar [[Am\u00e9rico Paredes]] in a doctoral thesis on corridos that was later published in a revised version by the University of Texas Press in 1958 under the title ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016}}</ref> Paredes's work is about the life of Cortez, his legend, the formal aspects and variants of the corrido, and the cultural significance reflected in these products. \n\nThe book is one of the most influential books in  [[Chicano]] cultural studies and has received wide recognition and outstanding success in the academic world.<ref>Lopez Mor\u00edn, Jos\u00e9 R., and Project Muse University Press Archival eBooks.

''Am\u00e9rico Paredes.'']</ref>. The first chapter and the third chapters are historical. In the first one, he retraces the social and political background of the former Spanish province of [[Nuevo Santander]] to explain the origin of ethnic tensions. In the third chapter, through extensive corpus sources (judicial reports, newspapers, and testimonies) he reconstructs in detail the whole life of Cortez. The second chapter could be classified as a study of regional folklore because he describes \"an idealized and formalized version of the legend.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Paredes|2016|page= 108}}</ref> In the second part of the book \"El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez, a Ballad of Border Conflict,\u201d Paredes provides a study of the narrative form of the corrido.

It was directed by [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], and based on Paredes's  ''With His Pistol in His Hand''.<ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p 64</ref>. The film deals with the creation of the myth as well as the reconstruction of the historical reality of the life and adventure of Gregorio Cortez.<ref>{{harvnb|Elitzik|1984|page= 38}}</ref>\n\nThe film is classified as a Western, but it is different from other films of the genre due to its historical realism. While classic elements of a western are present in the film such as horse racing, a lynch mob, a heroic sheriff and the vast desert space of Texas, the film's authenticity is a profound departure from this genre <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.P64</ref> <ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> The magazine ''Cin\u00e9aste'' described the film as \"the true history of the West\".<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref> and the movie has been considered the most authentic Westerns in the history of American cinema by the United States Historical Society <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018.p64</ref>. This sense of authenticity is due in part to the documentary-style used by the director to tell the life of Gregorio Cortez, but also to the choice made by Villasenor to develop the point of view of the people involved in the story, regardless of their ethnicity, thus presenting real historical characters and not the stereotypes of a myth. This process makes it possible to represent the hostility between communities in South Texas and the violation of the land rights of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers or lynch mobs <ref>Sandlin, Michael. The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez. vol. 44, Cineaste Publishers, Inc, NEW YORK, 2018. p65</ref>. On the other hand, through this process, the scriptwriters were able to highlight the origins of the myth as well as the stages of its construction. The myth is presented as an episode in the history of the conflict between the Anglo-Americans and The Mexican-Americans.<ref>Sunness, page 40</ref>\n\nIn an interview, the film's director, [[Robert M. Young (director)|Robert Young]], suggested that he wanted to represent the different interpretations surrounding life and legend. He declared \"I thought the important thing was, first, to tell a story that wasn't linear- I don't believe in those kinds of stories, things are always more complicated - and then to deal with the differing interpretations.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref> Young wanted to represent the fantasies created by the two ethnic groups, namely the exaggeration of Cortez's exploits for the Mexicans and the belief that Cortez was at the head of an entire gang for the Anglos. He declared to the Cin\u00e9aste that he \" tried to take the audience into the story so they would make the same mistakes as the Anglos and, later, when they find out what happened, they wouldn't feel superior to the Anglo characters but realize that they'd made the same error\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>.\n\nIf racism is portrayed throughout the film, the director downplays it. It was a deliberate choice to keep the humanity of the characters and to denounce it more vigorously. According to Young, \"The people who perpetuate the racism are people, too, they're human. If you go too heavy on the racism, it makes it difficult to see them as people.\"<ref>Sunness, page 39</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Juan Cortina]]\n* [[Joaquin Murietta]]\n* [[Tiburcio Vasquez]]\n*[[Manifest Destiny]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}} \n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation|last= Alonzo |first= A.
