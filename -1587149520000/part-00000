However, Albert's undignified personality (ubiquitously called \"Albert the One-Eyed\", due to an open eye socket from a battle injury;) and his bad attitude dismayed the [[prince elector]]s. Mostly, though they feared too strong a kingship of the son of former king Rudolph I, who controlled one of the strongest domestic power bases in the empire. At the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] near [[Frankfurt]] the following year, they resolved to elect Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg, a cousin of one of the electors, a man with very little domestic power. Although Albert publicly recognized Adolf's election with good grace, he was driven by irreconcilable anger and plotted against him. Once king, Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg was determined to forge his own power base and attempted to seize [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]] and [[March of Meissen|Meissen]] from the [[House of Wettin|Wettins]].

Adolf was thrown off his horse, and was butchered by his opponent. It is believed that Albert killed Adolf with a [[ballock-knife]], rising from the ground completely stained in Adolf's blood.<ref name=sue/>\n\nAfter the gruesome battle, Albert was reluctantly elected [[King of the Romans]].
