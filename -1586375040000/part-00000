He was known for his long residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and association with other literary figures there.\n\n==Early life==\nBynner was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of Thomas Edgarton Bynner and the former Annie Louise Brewer. His domineering mother separated from his alcoholic father in December 1888 and moved with her two sons to Connecticut. The father died in 1891, and in 1892 the family moved to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. Bynner attended Brookline High School and was editor of its literary magazine. He entered [[Harvard University]] in 1898, where he was the first member of his class invited to join the student literary magazine, ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', by its editor [[Wallace Stevens]]. He was also published in another of Harvard's literary journals, ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.  His favorite professor was [[George Santayana]]. While a student he took on the nickname \"Hal\" by which his friends would know him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed theater, opera, and symphony performances in Boston, and he became involved in the suffrage movement. He graduated from Harvard with honors in 1902. His first book of poems, ''An Ode to Harvard'' (later changed to ''Young Harvard''), came out in 1907.<ref name=kraft>{{cite book |last1=Kraft |first1=James |title=Who Is Witter Bynner?

He had an opportunity to meet and socialize with many New York writers and artists. He next turned to independent writing and lecturing, living in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]].<ref name=kraft />\n\nIn 1916 he and [[Arthur Davison Ficke]], a friend from Harvard, were among the perpetrators of an elaborate [[literary hoax]]. They created a purported \"Spectrist\" school of poets, along the lines of the [[Imagists]], but based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. ''[[Spectra (book)|Spectra]]'', a slim collection, was published under the [[pseudonym]]s of Anne Knish (Ficke) and Emanuel Morgan (Bynner).

He was hired to teach Oral English to the Students' Army Training Corps as a form of [[conscientious objector]] alternative service. After World War I ended, Bynner was invited to stay on in the English department to teach poetry. His students included several who became published poets of some note, such as [[Stanton A. Coblentz]], [[Hildegarde Flanner]], [[Idella Purnell]], and [[Genevieve Taggard]].  In celebration of the end of the war, he composed ''A Canticle of Praise,'' performed in the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] before some 8,000 (eight thousand) people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bynner|first1=Witter|title=A Canticle of Pan and Other Poems|date=1920|publisher=Alfred A.

His teaching contract was not renewed, but his students continued to meet as a group and he occasionally joined them. An elaborate dinner honoring him was held at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. A ''[[festschrift]]'', a book of poems by students and friends, ''W.B. in California'', was given to all who were present.<ref name=\"berkeley\">[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/gaybears/bynner/ \"Hidden History of the Berkeley Campus\" project], University of California web site.

He embarked on another lecture tour, reaching [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in February 1922. Exhausted and suffering from a lingering cold, he decided to cancel the rest of his tour and rest there.<ref name=\"kraft\" />\n\n==Santa Fe and Mexico==\nFinding the small city very appealing, in June 1922 Bynner moved permanently to Santa Fe. He first returned to Berkeley, where he recruited his former student [[Walter Willard Johnson|Walter Willard 'Spud' Johnson]] to join him as his secretary (and lover). [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] introduced the two men to [[D.H. Lawrence]] and his wife Frieda. \n\n[[File:Robert Hunt and Witter Bynner.jpg|thumb|Robert Hunt and Witter Bynner]]\n\nThe following year, Bynner and Johnson joined the Lawrences on a trip through Mexico. Lawrence was inspired to write several essays related to the trip, and his novel ''[[The Plumed Serpent]],'' includes characters based on Bynner and Johnson. Bynner also produced related writings: three poems about Lawrence, and his memoir ''Journey with Genius'', published in 1951.<ref name=\"kraft\" />\n\nLuhan was not pleased that the two couples had traveled together, as she wanted to be at the center of the community. She is said to have taken revenge on Bynner by hiring Johnson to be her own secretary. Bynner in turn wrote a play, ''Cake'', satirizing her lifestyle. \n\nIn 1930 [[Robert Hunt (died 1964)|Robert \"Bob\" Hunt]] (1906-1964) arrived in Santa Fe, originally for a visit while recuperating from an illness. He and Bynner began a relationship, and he stayed as the poet's lifelong companion. Together they entertained artists and literary figures such as [[Ansel Adams]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Martha Graham]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and his wife, [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[James Merrill]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Carl Van Vechten]], and [[Thornton Wilder]]. They also made frequent visits to their second home in [[Chapala, Mexico|Chapala]], Mexico.<ref name=\"kraft\" />  They bought it from Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.  \n\nBynner spent much of the 1940s and early 1950s in Chapala, until he began to lose his eyesight.

He was known for his long residence in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], and association with other literary figures there.\n\n==Early life==\nBynner was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the son of Thomas Edgarton Bynner and the former Annie Louise Brewer. His domineering mother separated from his alcoholic father in December 1888 and moved with her two sons to Connecticut. The father died in 1891, and in 1892 the family moved to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]]. Bynner attended Brookline High School and was editor of its literary magazine. He entered [[Harvard University]] in 1898, where he was the first member of his class invited to join the student literary magazine, ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]'', by its editor [[Wallace Stevens]]. He was also published in another of Harvard's literary journals, ''[[The Harvard Monthly]]''.  His favorite professor was [[George Santayana]]. While a student he took on the nickname \"Hal\" by which his friends would know him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed theater, opera, and symphony performances in Boston, and he became involved in the suffrage movement. He graduated from Harvard with honors in 1902. His first book of poems, ''An Ode to Harvard'' (later changed to ''Young Harvard''), came out in 1907.<ref name=kraft>{{cite book |last1=Kraft |first1=James |title=Who Is Witter Bynner?

He had an opportunity to meet and socialize with many New York writers and artists. He next turned to independent writing and lecturing, living in [[Cornish, New Hampshire]].<ref name=kraft />\n\nIn 1916 he and [[Arthur Davison Ficke]], a friend from Harvard, were among the perpetrators of an elaborate [[literary hoax]]. They created a purported \"Spectrist\" school of poets, along the lines of the [[Imagists]], but based in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. ''[[Spectra (book)|Spectra]]'', a slim collection, was published under the [[pseudonym]]s of Anne Knish (Ficke) and Emanuel Morgan (Bynner).

He was hired to teach Oral English to the Students' Army Training Corps as a form of [[conscientious objector]] alternative service. After World War I ended, Bynner was invited to stay on in the English department to teach poetry. His students included several who became published poets of some note, such as [[Stanton A. Coblentz]], [[Hildegarde Flanner]], [[Idella Purnell]], and [[Genevieve Taggard]].  In celebration of the end of the war, he composed ''A Canticle of Praise,'' performed in the [[Hearst Greek Theatre]] before some 8,000 (eight thousand) people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bynner|first1=Witter|title=A Canticle of Pan and Other Poems|date=1920|publisher=Alfred A.

His teaching contract was not renewed, but his students continued to meet as a group and he occasionally joined them. An elaborate dinner honoring him was held at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. A ''[[festschrift]]'', a book of poems by students and friends, ''W.B. in California'', was given to all who were present.<ref name=\"berkeley\">[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/gaybears/bynner/ \"Hidden History of the Berkeley Campus\" project], University of California web site.

He embarked on another lecture tour, reaching [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] in February 1922. Exhausted and suffering from a lingering cold, he decided to cancel the rest of his tour and rest there.<ref name=\"kraft\" />\n\n==Santa Fe and Mexico==\nFinding the small city very appealing, in June 1922 Bynner moved permanently to Santa Fe. He first returned to Berkeley, where he recruited his former student [[Walter Willard Johnson|Walter Willard 'Spud' Johnson]] to join him as his secretary (and lover). [[Mabel Dodge Luhan]] introduced the two men to [[D.H. Lawrence]] and his wife Frieda. \n\n[[File:Robert Hunt and Witter Bynner.jpg|thumb|Robert Hunt and Witter Bynner]]\n\nThe following year, Bynner and Johnson joined the Lawrences on a trip through Mexico. Lawrence was inspired to write several essays related to the trip, and his novel ''[[The Plumed Serpent]],'' includes characters based on Bynner and Johnson. Bynner also produced related writings: three poems about Lawrence, and his memoir ''Journey with Genius'', published in 1951.<ref name=\"kraft\" />\n\nLuhan was not pleased that the two couples had traveled together, as she wanted to be at the center of the community. She is said to have taken revenge on Bynner by hiring Johnson to be her own secretary. Bynner in turn wrote a play, ''Cake'', satirizing her lifestyle. \n\nIn 1930 [[Robert Hunt (died 1964)|Robert \"Bob\" Hunt]] (1906-1964) arrived in Santa Fe, originally for a visit while recuperating from an illness. He and Bynner began a relationship, and he stayed as the poet's lifelong companion. Together they entertained artists and literary figures such as [[Ansel Adams]], [[W. H. Auden]], [[Willa Cather]], [[Robert Frost]], [[Martha Graham]], [[Aldous Huxley]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and his wife, [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]], [[James Merrill]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[Carl Sandburg]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Carl Van Vechten]], and [[Thornton Wilder]]. They also made frequent visits to their second home in [[Chapala, Mexico|Chapala]], Mexico.<ref name=\"kraft\" />  They bought it from Mexican architect Luis Barrag\u00e1n.  \n\nBynner spent much of the 1940s and early 1950s in Chapala, until he began to lose his eyesight.  He returned to the U.S., received treatment, and traveled to Europe with Hunt. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hunt took increasing responsibility for the ailing poet. Hunt died of a heart attack in January 1964.\n\nOn January 18, 1965, Bynner had a severe stroke. He never recovered, and required constant care until he died on June 1, 1968.

Its forerunner, the [[League of Nations]], had been championed by [[Woodrow Wilson]] after [[World War I]] to prevent future conflicts. While it was supported by most [[Europe|nations of Europe]], it was never ratified by the [[United States Congress]] due to the inability to reach a compromise regarding the [[Lodge Reservations]] or the [[Hitchcock Reservations]].\n\nShortly after the establishment of the United Nations, the United States came into conflict with another member of the Security Council. Since the [[Soviet Union]] was a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent]] [[Soviet Union and the United Nations|member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], it had the power to [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] any binding UN resolution. In fact, Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|foreign minister]] and UN [[ambassador]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] used veto power twice as often as any other permanent member, earning him the title \"Mr. Veto\".\n\nRelations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (later Russia) within the UN have evolved in step with the larger geopolitical situation between the two powers. While the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council and [[China and the United Nations|China's seat]] was represented by U.S.-friendly [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (instead of the [[Communism|communist]] [[China|People's Republic of China]] which would replace the ROC in the UN in 1971), the U.S. and UN jointly condemned the invasion of South Korea by North Korean troops, leading to the UN sanctioned [[Korean War]]. Later, the U.S. persuaded all permanent members of the Security Council to authorize force against [[Iraq]] after it [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] [[Kuwait]] in 1991. This was a major step toward U.S. and Russian reconciliation after the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\n== Sources of conflict ==\nSince 1991, the [[United States]] has been the world's dominant military, economic, social, and political power (not to mention hosting the UN Headquarters itself in New York City); the [[United Nations]] was not designed for such a unipolar world with a single [[superpower]], and conflicts between an ascendant U.S. and other UN members have increased.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nConflict between the U.S. and the UN predates the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1971, the UN adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]]\u2014which affected the admission of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the removal of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]\u2014despite objections by the U.S. government (see [[China and the United Nations]]). The U.S. government changed its own China policy shortly afterward, however, so the conflict between the UN and US foreign policy was short-lived.\n\nThe U.S. government's repeated opposition to Arab military actions has created much more tension between the U.S. government and the United Nations. The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]] (determining that [[Zionism]] is a form of [[racism]] and racial discrimination) of 1975 was strongly opposed by U.S. officials{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. In 1991, the General Assembly adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379#Revocation|Resolution 4686]], which effectively negated Resolution 3379. Use of its veto power to prevent the Security Council from issuing resolutions condemning Israeli military action has frequently divided the U.S. from the Soviet Union, China and France in the Security Council; since 1989, the U.S. government has dissented against Security Council resolutions on 12 occasions out of 17 total instances when a permanent member vetoed. Of these 12 occasions, only two related to issues other than the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2009, the U.S. government abstained from [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860|Security Council Resolution 1860]], which called for a halt to Israel's military response to Hamas rocket attacks, and the opening of the border crossings into the [[Gaza Strip]].\n\nUnder the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], the U.S. withdrew from [[UNESCO]], and withheld its dues to encourage the UN to repeal [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which it did in 1991. The U.S. was\u2014and continues to be\u2014the member state levied most heavily by the UN{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, so U.S. policymakers expected this strategy to be an effective way to oppose Soviet and Arab influence over the UN{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. When the UN repealed Resolution 3379, the U.S. resumed dues payments, but not before the U.S. had accumulated significant and controversial arrears.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== The U.S. arrears issue  {{anchor|Arrearage}} ==\nThe UN has always had problems with [[United Nations arrears|members refusing to pay $100,000,000,000,000,000,000]] the assessment levied upon them under the United Nations Charter, {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} but the most significant refusal in recent times has been that of the United States.\n\nAfter prolonged negotiations, the U.S. and the UN negotiated an agreement whereby the United States would pay a large part of the money it owes, and in exchange the UN would reduce the assessment rate ceiling from 25% to 22%. The reduction in the assessment rate ceiling was among the reforms contained in the United Nations Reform Act of 1999 or [[Helms-Biden Act]], which links payment of $926 million in U.S. arrears to the UN and other international organizations to a series of reform benchmarks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOf the U.S. arrears to the UN totaling over $1.3 billion, $612 million was payable under Helms-Biden. The remaining $700 million resulted from various legislative and policy withholdings.\n\nUnder Helms-Biden, the U.S. paid $100 million in arrears to the UN in December 1999; release of the next $582 million awaited a legislative revision to Helms-Biden, necessary because the benchmark requiring a 25 percent peacekeeping assessment rate ceiling was not quite achieved. The U.S. also sought elimination of the legislated 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping payments in effect since 1995, which continued to generate additional UN arrears. Of the final $244 million under Helms-Biden, $30 million was payable to the UN and $214 million to other international organizations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn February 2001, Congress authorized the second Helms-Biden payment, but because of an eight-month delay in appropriations, the U.N. chose not to re-elect the United States to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], on 6 October 2001, Bush signed the second Helms-Biden appropriation into law and in March 2002, the U.S. was voted back onto the commission. In October 2002, Congress lifted the 25% cap on peacekeeping assessments and in November 2002, the U.S. made the final Helms-Biden appropriation.<ref>International law, the power of the purse, and speaking with one voice: the legal cacophony created by withholding U.S. dues from the United Nations Schnoor, Britta A.

A series of inspections by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] failed to find conclusive evidence that proved allegations that Iraq was continuing to develop or harbour such weapons.

On April 9, Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown and Iraq was placed under occupation, marked by the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]]. The U.S. argued that this action was authorized by Resolution 1441, since Iraq had failed to comply by co-operating fully in the identification and destruction of its weapons programs, and since Resolution 1441 promised 'serious consequences' for lack of full compliance and achievement of its objective.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOther countries, led by [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], maintained that Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force without passage of a further Resolution. [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] stated \"My position is that, whatever the circumstances, France will vote 'no' because this evening it considers that it is not necessary to make war to achieve the stated goal of the disarmament of Iraq\".<ref>[http://www.radiofrance.fr/reportage/dossiers/irak/actu.php?i_id=318 Radio France > Dossiers > Conflit USA - Irak<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nRightly or wrongly the \"this evening\" qualification was ignored, perhaps because the implications of its English translation are ambiguous. The statement was widely interpreted in the English-speaking world as meaning that France would exercise its right as a Permanent Member of the Security Council to veto any resolution at any time (\"whatever the circumstances\") to use force against Iraq.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the former Iraqi government, the [[Iraq Survey Group]] led an exhaustive search of Iraq for WMD. Ultimately, while over 500 \"degraded\" chemical warheads were found,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/Iraq_WMD_Declassified.pdf | work=Fox News}}</ref> no deployable WMD of any kind were found and all WMD production facilities had been found to be inactive since 1991.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Reform of the United Nations ==\nThe [[United States Congress]] has shown particular concern with reforms related to UN effectiveness and efficiency. In November 2004, the bill H.R. 4818 mandated the creation of a bipartisan Task Force to report to Congress on how to make the UN more effective in realizing the goals of its Charter. The Task Force came into being in January 2005, co-chaired by former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] and former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], [[George J. Mitchell]]. In June 2005, the task force released \"American Interests and UN Reform: Report of the Task Force on the United Nations,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/un/|title=Task Force on the United Nations}}</ref> with numerous recommendations on how to improve the UN.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[United Nations Reform Act of 2005]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h2745:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) H.R.2745}}</ref> to slash funds to the UN in half by 2008 if it does not meet certain criteria. This reflects years of complaints about anti-American and anti-Israeli bias in the UN, particularly the exclusion of Israel from many decision-making organizations. The U.S. is estimated to contribute about 22% of the UN's yearly budget due to the UN's ability-to-pay scale, making this bill potentially devastating to the United Nations. The [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and several former U.S. ambassadors to the UN have warned that this may only strengthen anti-American sentiment around the world and serve to hurt current UN reform movements. The bill passed the House in June 2005, and a parallel bill was introduced in the Senate by [[Gordon H. Smith]] on July 13, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s1394:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) S.1394}}\n</ref> However, a number of leading Senate Republicans objected to the requirement that the U.S. contributions be halved if the UN failed to meet all of the criteria. The UN Management, Personnel, and Policy Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1394), introduced on July 12, 2005 into the Senate by Sen. [[Norm Coleman]] [R-MN] and Sen. [[Richard Lugar]] [R-IN], called for similar reforms but left the withholding of dues to the discretion of the President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s1383:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) S.1383}}</ref> Neither piece of legislation made it into law.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== Visa refusal controversy ==\nIn April 2007, the U.S. government refused to give an entry visa to the foreign minister of the ''[[de facto]]'' independent Republic of [[Abkhazia]] (''de jure'' part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) [[Sergei Shamba]] who was due to speak at the UN headquarters in New York City.

Its forerunner, the [[League of Nations]], had been championed by [[Woodrow Wilson]] after [[World War I]] to prevent future conflicts. While it was supported by most [[Europe|nations of Europe]], it was never ratified by the [[United States Congress]] due to the inability to reach a compromise regarding the [[Lodge Reservations]] or the [[Hitchcock Reservations]].\n\nShortly after the establishment of the United Nations, the United States came into conflict with another member of the Security Council. Since the [[Soviet Union]] was a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent]] [[Soviet Union and the United Nations|member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]], it had the power to [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] any binding UN resolution. In fact, Soviet [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|foreign minister]] and UN [[ambassador]] [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] used veto power twice as often as any other permanent member, earning him the title \"Mr. Veto\".\n\nRelations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union (later Russia) within the UN have evolved in step with the larger geopolitical situation between the two powers. While the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council and [[China and the United Nations|China's seat]] was represented by U.S.-friendly [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (instead of the [[Communism|communist]] [[China|People's Republic of China]] which would replace the ROC in the UN in 1971), the U.S. and UN jointly condemned the invasion of South Korea by North Korean troops, leading to the UN sanctioned [[Korean War]]. Later, the U.S. persuaded all permanent members of the Security Council to authorize force against [[Iraq]] after it [[Invasion of Kuwait|invaded]] [[Kuwait]] in 1991. This was a major step toward U.S. and Russian reconciliation after the end of the [[Cold War]].\n\n== Sources of conflict ==\nSince 1991, the [[United States]] has been the world's dominant military, economic, social, and political power (not to mention hosting the UN Headquarters itself in New York City); the [[United Nations]] was not designed for such a unipolar world with a single [[superpower]], and conflicts between an ascendant U.S. and other UN members have increased.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nConflict between the U.S. and the UN predates the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1971, the UN adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|Resolution 2758]]\u2014which affected the admission of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the removal of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]]\u2014despite objections by the U.S. government (see [[China and the United Nations]]). The U.S. government changed its own China policy shortly afterward, however, so the conflict between the UN and US foreign policy was short-lived.\n\nThe U.S. government's repeated opposition to Arab military actions has created much more tension between the U.S. government and the United Nations. The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]] (determining that [[Zionism]] is a form of [[racism]] and racial discrimination) of 1975 was strongly opposed by U.S. officials{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. In 1991, the General Assembly adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379#Revocation|Resolution 4686]], which effectively negated Resolution 3379. Use of its veto power to prevent the Security Council from issuing resolutions condemning Israeli military action has frequently divided the U.S. from the Soviet Union, China and France in the Security Council; since 1989, the U.S. government has dissented against Security Council resolutions on 12 occasions out of 17 total instances when a permanent member vetoed. Of these 12 occasions, only two related to issues other than the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 2009, the U.S. government abstained from [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1860|Security Council Resolution 1860]], which called for a halt to Israel's military response to Hamas rocket attacks, and the opening of the border crossings into the [[Gaza Strip]].\n\nUnder the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], the U.S. withdrew from [[UNESCO]], and withheld its dues to encourage the UN to repeal [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379|Resolution 3379]], which it did in 1991. The U.S. was\u2014and continues to be\u2014the member state levied most heavily by the UN{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, so U.S. policymakers expected this strategy to be an effective way to oppose Soviet and Arab influence over the UN{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. When the UN repealed Resolution 3379, the U.S. resumed dues payments, but not before the U.S. had accumulated significant and controversial arrears.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== The U.S. arrears issue  {{anchor|Arrearage}} ==\nThe UN has always had problems with [[United Nations arrears|members refusing to pay]] the assessment levied upon them under the United Nations Charter, {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} but the most significant refusal in recent times has been that of the United States.\n\nAfter prolonged negotiations, the U.S. and the UN negotiated an agreement whereby the United States would pay a large part of the money it owes, and in exchange the UN would reduce the assessment rate ceiling from 25% to 22%. The reduction in the assessment rate ceiling was among the reforms contained in the United Nations Reform Act of 1999 or [[Helms-Biden Act]], which links payment of $926 million in U.S. arrears to the UN and other international organizations to a series of reform benchmarks.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOf the U.S. arrears to the UN totaling over $1.3 billion, $612 million was payable under Helms-Biden. The remaining $700 million resulted from various legislative and policy withholdings.\n\nUnder Helms-Biden, the U.S. paid $100 million in arrears to the UN in December 1999; release of the next $582 million awaited a legislative revision to Helms-Biden, necessary because the benchmark requiring a 25 percent peacekeeping assessment rate ceiling was not quite achieved. The U.S. also sought elimination of the legislated 25 percent cap on U.S. peacekeeping payments in effect since 1995, which continued to generate additional UN arrears. Of the final $244 million under Helms-Biden, $30 million was payable to the UN and $214 million to other international organizations.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn February 2001, Congress authorized the second Helms-Biden payment, but because of an eight-month delay in appropriations, the U.N. chose not to re-elect the United States to the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]]. Following the [[September 11 attacks]], on 6 October 2001, Bush signed the second Helms-Biden appropriation into law and in March 2002, the U.S. was voted back onto the commission. In October 2002, Congress lifted the 25% cap on peacekeeping assessments and in November 2002, the U.S. made the final Helms-Biden appropriation.<ref>International law, the power of the purse, and speaking with one voice: the legal cacophony created by withholding U.S. dues from the United Nations Schnoor, Britta A.

Bush addressed the General Assembly on September 12, 2002 on Iraq prior to the passage of Resolution 1441.]]\n\nFurther conflict between the U.S. and some UN members arose in 2002 and 2003 over the issue of [[Iraq]]. [[George W. Bush]] maintained that Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] had not fulfilled the obligations he had entered into at the end of the [[Gulf War]] in 1991, namely to rid Iraq of all [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] (WMDs) and to renounce their further use. A series of inspections by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]] failed to find conclusive evidence that proved allegations that Iraq was continuing to develop or harbour such weapons. The findings were conveyed by the leading weapons inspector, [[Hans Blix]], who noted Iraq's failure to cooperate with the inspections on several counts.<ref>[https://www.un.org/Depts/unmovic/SC7asdelivered.htm Security Council 7 March 2003<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The U.S. replied by saying that the responsibility of proof of disarmament was upon Iraq, not on the UN or the U.S.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nIn November 2002, the [[United Nations Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|Resolution 1441]], giving Iraq an ultimatum to co-operate in disarmament within an unstated timeframe of a few months. However, in March 2003, the U.S., supported by fifty countries (including the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Poland]]) which the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] referred to as the \"[[coalition of the willing]]\" [[2003 invasion of Iraq|launched military operations against Iraq]]. On April 9, Saddam Hussein's regime was overthrown and Iraq was placed under occupation, marked by the [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|fall of Baghdad]]. The U.S. argued that this action was authorized by Resolution 1441, since Iraq had failed to comply by co-operating fully in the identification and destruction of its weapons programs, and since Resolution 1441 promised 'serious consequences' for lack of full compliance and achievement of its objective.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOther countries, led by [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], maintained that Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force without passage of a further Resolution. [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] stated \"My position is that, whatever the circumstances, France will vote 'no' because this evening it considers that it is not necessary to make war to achieve the stated goal of the disarmament of Iraq\".<ref>[http://www.radiofrance.fr/reportage/dossiers/irak/actu.php?i_id=318 Radio France > Dossiers > Conflit USA - Irak<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nRightly or wrongly the \"this evening\" qualification was ignored, perhaps because the implications of its English translation are ambiguous. The statement was widely interpreted in the English-speaking world as meaning that France would exercise its right as a Permanent Member of the Security Council to veto any resolution at any time (\"whatever the circumstances\") to use force against Iraq.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nFollowing the overthrow of the former Iraqi government, the [[Iraq Survey Group]] led an exhaustive search of Iraq for WMD. Ultimately, while over 500 \"degraded\" chemical warheads were found,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/projects/pdf/Iraq_WMD_Declassified.pdf | work=Fox News}}</ref> no deployable WMD of any kind were found and all WMD production facilities had been found to be inactive since 1991.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n== Reform of the United Nations ==\nThe [[United States Congress]] has shown particular concern with reforms related to UN effectiveness and efficiency. In November 2004, the bill H.R. 4818 mandated the creation of a bipartisan Task Force to report to Congress on how to make the UN more effective in realizing the goals of its Charter. The Task Force came into being in January 2005, co-chaired by former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] and former [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], [[George J. Mitchell]]. In June 2005, the task force released \"American Interests and UN Reform: Report of the Task Force on the United Nations,\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/un/|title=Task Force on the United Nations}}</ref> with numerous recommendations on how to improve the UN.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\nOn June 17, 2005, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed the [[United Nations Reform Act of 2005]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h2745:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) H.R.2745}}</ref> to slash funds to the UN in half by 2008 if it does not meet certain criteria. This reflects years of complaints about anti-American and anti-Israeli bias in the UN, particularly the exclusion of Israel from many decision-making organizations. The U.S. is estimated to contribute about 22% of the UN's yearly budget due to the UN's ability-to-pay scale, making this bill potentially devastating to the United Nations. The [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and several former U.S. ambassadors to the UN have warned that this may only strengthen anti-American sentiment around the world and serve to hurt current UN reform movements. The bill passed the House in June 2005, and a parallel bill was introduced in the Senate by [[Gordon H. Smith]] on July 13, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s1394:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) S.1394}}\n</ref> However, a number of leading Senate Republicans objected to the requirement that the U.S. contributions be halved if the UN failed to meet all of the criteria. The UN Management, Personnel, and Policy Reform Act of 2005 (S. 1394), introduced on July 12, 2005 into the Senate by Sen. [[Norm Coleman]] [R-MN] and Sen. [[Richard Lugar]] [R-IN], called for similar reforms but left the withholding of dues to the discretion of the President.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:s1383:|title=Bill Summary & Status 109th Congress (2005 - 2006) S.1383}}</ref> Neither piece of legislation made it into law.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n== Visa refusal controversy ==\nIn April 2007, the U.S. government refused to give an entry visa to the foreign minister of the ''[[de facto]]'' independent Republic of [[Abkhazia]] (''de jure'' part of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]) [[Sergei Shamba]] who was due to speak at the UN headquarters in New York City.

In 2005, [[Money (magazine)|''Money'']] magazine named it No. 91 on its list of best places in America to live.<ref name=\"cnn_2005_cityrank\" /> In 2016, WalletHub ranked Vancouver the 89th best place in the U.S. for families to live.<ref name=\"wallethub_2019_cityrank\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nVancouver shares its name with the larger city of [[Vancouver]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, approximately {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north. Both cities were named after sea captain [[George Vancouver]], but the American city is older. Vancouver, British Columbia was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington, and more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic [[Fort Vancouver]] trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the U.S. city's name to Fort Vancouver to reduce confusion with its larger and better-known northern neighbor. Many [[Pacific Northwest]] residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as \"Vancouver, B.C.\" and the United States city as \"Vancouver, Washington,\" or \"Vancouver, USA.\"<ref name=\"columbian_20180511_tourismrevenue\" /><ref name=\"businesswire_20180206_\" /><ref name=\"ajot_20180502_vancouverusa\" /> Local nicknames include \"Vantucky\" (though this is often used as a derogatory term)<ref name=\"bloomberg_20120529_fisherstatetax\" /><ref name=\"vanvoice_20090601_lincolnsbeardvantuckey\" /><ref name=\"vanvoice_2012_deadlink1\" /><ref name=\"oregonian_20110517_cafevantuckyshirt\" /><ref name=\"clarkcountyblog_20110516_cafevantuckyshirt\" /><ref name=\"stumped_20110529_portlandneighborcities\" /><ref name=\"columbian_20110605_vantuckyderogatory\" /> and \"The 'Couv(e)\".<ref name=\"wweek_20070321_welcometothecouve\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fort Vancouver1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Vancouver]] in 1859]]\n[[File:Marshall House Officers Row.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshall House in [[Officers Row]], built in 1886 and later named after [[George              C.

From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a \"joint occupation\" agreement. Joint occupation led to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] and ended on June 15, 1846, with the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]], which gave the United States full control of the area. Before 1845, American Henry Williamson laid out a large claim west of the Hudson's Bay Company (including part of the present-day Port of Vancouver), called Vancouver City and properly registered his claim at the U.S. courthouse in Oregon City, before leaving for California.<ref name=\"jollata\" />{{rp|42}}  In 1848, Williamson had it surveyed and platted by [[Peter Crawford (land surveyor)|Peter Crawford]]. In 1850, Amos Short traced over the claim of Williamson and named the town Columbia City.<ref name=\"dahp_20140330_vancouversurveyor\" /> It changed to Vancouver in 1855. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23, 1857.<ref name=\"historylink_20090807_vancouvernamehistory\" />\n\nBased on an act in the 1859\u201360 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of [[Washington Territory]], before capital status was returned to [[Olympia, Washington]] by a 2\u20131 ruling of the territory's supreme court, in accordance with [[Isaac Stevens]]' preference and concern that proximity to the border with Oregon might give some of the state's influence away to Oregon.<ref name=\"columbian_2006ish_capitoldispute\" /><ref name=\"historylink_20030115_capitoldispute\" /><ref name=\"wasenate_2005_honorolympia\" />\n\nU.S. Army Captain (and future President) [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was quartermaster at what was then known as Columbia Barracks for 15 months beginning in September 1852. Soon after leaving Vancouver, he resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include [[George B. McClellan]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[Oliver O. Howard]] and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [[George Marshall]].<ref name=\"cityofvancouver_2007ish_150thanniversary\" />\n\nArmy presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to Vancouver Barracks, the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by [[Fort Lewis]], {{convert|120|mi|km|-1}} to the north. Built on the old company gardens and skirmish range, Pearson Army Field (later [[Pearson Field]]) was a key facility, and at one point the [[United States Army Signal Corps|US Army Signal Corps]] operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, [[USSR]] over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by [[Valery Chkalov]] in 1937 on a [[Tupolev ANT-25]]RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby [[Portland, Oregon]], but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. Today there is a street named for him in Vancouver. In 1975 an obelisk was erected at Pearson Field commemorating this event.{{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for Chkalov flight and Signal Corps presence|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe neighborhood of Sifton was the terminus of an early electric [[Tram|trolley]] operated by the Northcoast Power Company that also served nearby [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] from 1910 until 1926. The trolleys made ten stops and ran once per hour, charging 15 cents each way. A mural in the heart of Orchards depicts the trolley and the rural character of the area at the time it was operating. The community was named after Doctor Sifton, a promoter of the trolley service.<ref name=\"origin\" />\n\nAccording to the archives of the Vancouver ''[[The Columbian|Columbian]]'' newspaper, the Orchards-Sifton route went along Vancouver's Main Street to 26th, then out 26th to K Street and thence north to 33rd. From there, it ran on 33rd over Burnt Bridge Creek and past the city limits. At that point the trolley became more like a regular train as followed a cut through the wilderness. Few houses were seen between Vancouver and Orchards. The public's preference for motor cars in the 1920s heralded the end of the trolley.\n\nSeparated from Oregon until 1917, when the [[Interstate Bridge]] began to replace ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for World War I before World War II brought an enormous economic boom. An [[Alcoa]] aluminum plant opened on September 2, 1940, using inexpensive power from the nearby [[New Deal]] hydropower turbines at [[Bonneville Dam]]. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, [[Henry J. Kaiser|Henry Kaiser]] opened a [[Kaiser Shipyards|shipyard]] next to the U.S. Army base, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of [[Liberty ships]], [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing ship tanks]], and [[Casablanca-class escort carrier|escort carriers]]. This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new [[tract housing|residential developments]]: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring \"shipyard city\" of [[Vanport, Oregon]], would be destroyed by the [[Memorial Day]] flood of 1948.{{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for lack of bridge with Oregon until 1917, 1940 aluminum plant, and WWII boom towns|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{Recentism|date=November 2019}}\nVancouver has recently experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. The city's first annexation more than doubled its size in 1909, with the largest annexation of 1997 adding {{convert|11258|acre|km2}} and 58,171 residents.<ref name=\"cityofvancouver_2006ish_annexationhistory\" /> As a result of urban growth and the 1997 annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and some of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development. East Vancouver includes the communities of Cascade Park East and West, which had populations of 6,996 and 6,956 in 1990 before annexation.\n\nMore than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population lives in unincorporated urban area north of the city limits, including the communities of [[Hazel Dell, Washington|Hazel Dell]], [[Felida, Washington|Felida]], [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] and [[Salmon Creek, Washington|Salmon Creek]]. If county leaders had approved a major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have passed [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to become the state's second-largest city.<ref name=\"komotv_20051223_annexation\" />\n\n==Geography and climate==\nVancouver is located just north of the [[Columbia River]], just west of where the [[Columbia River Gorge]] bisects the volcanic [[Cascade Range]] and just east of where the [[Willamette River]] enters the Columbia. The city of Vancouver is in the Western Lowlands region of Washington. When clouds do not blanket the Puget-Willamette trough formed by the Cascade and [[Oregon Coast Range|Coast Range]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Saint Helens]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] are all visible from Vancouver.\n\n[[File:Interstate Bridge and Columbia River.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbia River]] waterfront]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|3.40|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\" />\n\nVancouver lies just north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate. Both are classified as warm-summer Mediterranean (Csb) on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the [[Cascade Range]] create something of a [[venturi effect]], leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the [[Willamette Valley]], Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including \"silver thaw\" storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power in the city for almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|42|in|mm}}. Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2\u20134 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as [[Celilo Falls]]. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May 1948. The 1948 [[Memorial Day]] flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby [[Vanport, Oregon]]. Other unusual storms include the [[Columbus Day]] windstorm of 1962 and [[1972 Portland\u2013Vancouver tornado|an April 5, 1972 tornado]] which rated F3 on the [[Fujita scale]], striking a local school. An EF1 tornado struck on January 10, 2008 just after noon causing moderate damage along a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} path from Vancouver Lake to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.{{citation needed|reason=Need sources for various climate events mentioned|date=November 2019}}\n\nBecause many Vancouver residents work in Portland, there is typically significant rush hour traffic congestion on two bridges that cross the Columbia River \u2013 the [[Interstate Bridge]] and the [[Glenn Jackson Bridge]].  In 2017 there were 297,932 weekday vehicle crossings on the two bridges.<ref name=\"swwrtc_2019_columbiariverbridgestats\" />\n\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Vancouver, Washington, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1891\u2013present\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 66\n|Feb record high F = 73\n|Mar record high F = 83\n|Apr record high F = 90\n|May record high F = 99\n|Jun record high F = 105\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 105\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 90\n|Nov record high F = 72\n|Dec record high F = 65\n|year record high F= \n|Jan high F = 47.7\n|Feb high F = 51.7\n|Mar high F = 56.9\n|Apr high F = 61.5\n|May high F = 68.1\n|Jun high F = 73.4\n|Jul high F = 80.0\n|Aug high F = 81.5\n|Sep high F = 75.7\n|Oct high F = 63.4\n|Nov high F = 53.1\n|Dec high F = 46.7\n|Jan low F = 35.4\n|Feb low F = 35.3\n|Mar low F = 39.1\n|Apr low F = 42.6\n|May low F = 48.2\n|Jun low F = 53.3\n|Jul low F = 56.9\n|Aug low F = 56.9\n|Sep low F = 51.6\n|Oct low F = 44.1\n|Nov low F = 39.8\n|Dec low F = 34.5\n|Jan record low F = \u22128\n|Feb record low F = \u22123\n|Mar record low F = 18\n|Apr record low F = 24\n|May record low F = 28\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 37\n|Aug record low F = 35\n|Sep record low F = 28\n|Oct record low F = 21\n|Nov record low F = 6\n|Dec record low F = \u221210\n|year record low F= \u221210\n|Jan precipitation inch = 5.50\n|Feb precipitation inch = 4.03\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.57\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.01\n|May precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Jun precipitation inch = 1.79\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.69\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.77\n|Sep precipitation inch = 1.56\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.07\n|Nov precipitation inch = 5.91\n|Dec precipitation inch = 6.77\n|year precipitation inch= \n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan snow inch = 0.5\n|Feb snow inch = 1.1\n|Mar snow inch = 0.4\n|Apr snow inch = 0\n|May snow inch = 0\n|Jun snow inch = 0\n|Jul snow inch = 0\n|Aug snow inch = 0\n|Sep snow inch = 0\n|Oct snow inch = 0\n|Nov snow inch = trace\n|Dec snow inch = 0.5\n|year snow inch= 0.9\n|Jan precipitation days = 20.1\n|Feb precipitation days = 16.0\n|Mar precipitation days = 18.4\n|Apr precipitation days = 17.6\n|May precipitation days = 14.3\n|Jun precipitation days = 9.4\n|Jul precipitation days = 4.5\n|Aug precipitation days = 3.8\n|Sep precipitation days = 7.6\n|Oct precipitation days = 14.4\n|Nov precipitation days = 20.5\n|Dec precipitation days = 19.8\n|year precipitation days = 163.7\n|Jan snow days = 0.3\n|Feb snow days = 0.8\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0\n|May snow days = 0\n|Jun snow days = 0\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 0\n|Oct snow days = 0\n|Nov snow days = 0.5\n|Dec snow days = 1.4\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref name=\"noaa_2018_weatherdata\" />\n|date=April 2018\n<!-- Note: NOAA website produces data in dynamic fashion not compatible with archive.org and archive-url tag. -->\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 1722\n|1890= 3545\n|1900= 3126\n|1910= 9300\n|1920= 12637\n|1930= 15766\n|1940= 18788\n|1950= 41664\n|1960= 32464\n|1970= 41859\n|1980= 42834\n|1990= 46380\n|2000= 143560\n|2010= 161791\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=183012\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\" />\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"uscensus_popest\" /><br>2018 Estimate<ref name=\"2018 Pop Estimate\" />\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the census<ref name=\"FactFinder\" /> of 2010, there were 161,791 people, 65,691 households, and 40,246 families residing in the city.

The state of Washington levies no individual or corporate income taxes and levies a property tax below the national average and a sales tax above the national median.<ref name=\"taxfoundation_taxsumwa\" /> The State of Oregon has even lower property taxes and no sales tax but one of the highest state income taxes.<ref name=\"taxfoundation_taxsumor\" /> As a result, many Vancouver residents prefer to shop in neighboring Portland where they do not pay sales taxes<ref name=\"pew_20120418_portlandwashtax\" />, then live and work in Vancouver where they do not pay state income tax. (Washington residents who work in Oregon must pay Oregon income tax.) For the same reasons, the city is popular with retirees. Conversely, the city is less favored by students and young adults.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. There is a risk in sales tax avoidance because Washington has a use tax due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents \"shop at their own risk\" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Washington, although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} except for purchases requiring registration, such as motor vehicles.\n\nThe taxation and demographics of the area depresses the retail sector of Vancouver's economy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Oregon has stricter development laws to protect the timber industry;{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} therefore, Vancouver tends to attract a higher proportion of the region's sprawling development.

Moving from a salmon- and trade-based indigenous economy by the [[Chinookan|Chinook]] people, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] pioneered extractive industries such as the [[fur trade]] and timber. Subsistence agricultural gave way to market and export crops such as apples, strawberries and prunes. Largely bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s, when the Oregon Steam Navigation company would ferry trains across the river downstream from [[St. Helens, Oregon]] to [[Kalama, Washington]], early downtown development was focused around Washington Street (where ferries arrived), lumber and Vancouver Barracks activities such as a large spruce mill for manufacturing airplanes. A 1908 railroad [[swing bridge]] across the Columbia allowed greater industrial developments such as the Standifer Shipyard during the first world war. With the Interstate Bridge and [[Bonneville Dam]] Vancouver saw an industrial boom in the 1940s, including the [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser shipyard]] and [[Alcoa]], as well as a [[Boise Cascade]] paper mill, just west of the Interstate Bridge.<ref name=\"jollata\" />\n\nAs the [[old-growth forest]]s were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy has largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland. Vancouver contains the corporate headquarters for [[Nautilus, Inc.]] and The Holland (parent company of the [[Burgerville, USA]] restaurant chain).<ref name=\"vbjbol2007\" />\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Vancouver, WA.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city]]\nThe [[Port of Vancouver USA]] operates a port on the Columbia River, which separates [[Oregon]] to the south and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to the north.

The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall [[condominium]] structures around [[Esther Short Park]]. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel directly across from the park.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Clark County Historical Museum - Vancouver Washington.jpg|thumb|The Clark County Historical Museum]]\n''[[The Columbian]]'' newspaper finished building a new seven-story building adjacent to the Hilton in 2008. Early in 2010, ''The Columbian'' filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy and the building defaulted to [[Bank of America]]. In June 2010, the City of Vancouver agreed to purchase the former downtown Columbian office building for use as a new city hall. The city bought the two-year-old building and {{convert|5.14|acre|m2}} for $18.5&nbsp;million, a fraction of the $41.5&nbsp;million sale price the owners of The Columbian office building had been asking prior to filing for bankruptcy. In 2011, the city consolidated five separate buildings housing 300 employees into one at the new City Hall, located at 415 W. 6th St. The move is saving the city approximately $1&nbsp;million a year in facility lease and maintenance costs.<ref name=\"brettman\" />\n\nThe Fort Vancouver Regional Library District opened a new library on C Street at Evergreen Boulevard in 2011. Future plans on C Street include a new [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel and roughly 250 new condominiums. Other planned projects in the downtown area include:\n* Library Square, a mixed-use project which includes a condominiums building, hotel/condominiums building, office building, and a new main library.\n* The Luxe, a six-story office and condominium building.\n* Waterfront Redevelopment, which includes 10K Residents Envision, retail, offices, and parks.\n* Prestige Plaza, a six-story building which includes condominiums and offices.\n\n==Education==\n{{see also|Fort Vancouver Regional Library District}}\n[[File:ClarkCollegeChimeTower.jpg|thumb|[[Clark College]] chime tower, with the Cannell library in the background]]\n[[File:Skyview HS Main Entrance.JPG|thumb|[[Skyview High School (Vancouver, Washington)|Skyview High School]]]]\n[[File:WSU Vancouver.jpg|thumb|[[Washington State University Vancouver]] in January 2014]]\n\n===Public schools===\nVancouver has two school districts: [[Vancouver Public Schools]] and [[Evergreen School District]].\n\nThe Vancouver Public Schools cover most of west Vancouver and has seven high schools: [[Hudson's Bay High School]], [[Columbia River High School]], [[Fort Vancouver High School]], Lewis and Clark High School, [[Skyview High School (Vancouver, Washington)|Skyview High School]], [[Vancouver School of Arts and Academics]], and [[Vancouver iTech Preparatory]] (grades 6\u201312). It also has six middle schools: [[Alki Middle School]], Discovery Middle School, Gaiser Middle School, [[Jason Lee Middle School (Vancouver)|Jason Lee Middle School]], [[Thomas Jefferson Middle School (Vancouver, Washington)|Thomas Jefferson Middle School]], and McLoughlin Middle School.\n\nVancouver Public Schools' elementary schools include [[Sarah J.

Ogden, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sacajawea, Salmon Creek, Truman, Walnut Grove, and Washington.\n\nThe Evergreen School District covers most of east Vancouver and has seven high schools: [[Evergreen High School (Vancouver, Washington)|Evergreen High School]], [[Mountain View High School (Washington)|Mountain View High School]], Henrietta Lacks Health and Bioscience High School, Heritage High School, [[Union High School (Camas, Washington)|Union High School]], Legacy High School, and Cascadia Technical Academy (formerly Clark County Vocational Skills Center).<ref name=\"esd112_20170113_vocationschoolrename\" />\n\nThe district has six middle schools: Cascade, Covington, Frontier, Pacific, Shahala, and Wy'East.\n\nEvergreen School District's 21 elementary schools are: Burton, Burnt Bridge Creek, Columbia Valley, Crestline, Ellsworth, Endeavour, Fircrest, Fisher's Landing, Harmony, Hearthwood, Illahee, Image, Marrion, Mill Plain, Orchards, Pioneer, Riverview, Sifton, Silver Star, Sunset, and York.\n\nVancouver is also home to the [[Washington School for the Deaf]] and [[Washington School for the Blind]], and (through Evergreen School District) Home Choice Academy, for home-schoolers.\n\n===Colleges and universities===\n* [[Clark College (Washington)|Clark College]] (two-year)\n* [[Gateway Seminary]]\n* [[Washington State University, Vancouver]]\n\n==Architecture and notable buildings==\n{{see also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Washington}}\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:Evergreen Hotel - Vancouver Washington.jpg|Evergreen Hotel\nFile:West 5th and Columbia Street, Looking East.jpg|Smith Tower\nFile:Elks Building in Vancouver, WA.JPG|Elks Building\nFile:Heritage Building, Vancouver, WA (2013) - 5.JPG|Heritage Building\nFile:House of Providence in Vancouver, WA (2).JPG|House of Providence\nFile:U.s. nat. bank bldg 1912 - Copy.jpg|U.S. National Bank Building\n</gallery>\n\n[[Mother Joseph]] was one of the first architects in the region, and because of its relatively long history, Vancouver contains a variety of buildings.{{citation needed|reason=Need citation supporting Mother Joseph as architect.|date=November 2019}} Homes vary from [[Victorian architecture|Victorians]] and craftsman bungalows downtown, to small wartime [[tract housing]] and [[ranch-style house|ranch-styles]] mid-town, with rural styles and larger homes in the outer ring. In addition to the reconstructed [[Fort Vancouver]] at the [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site]], the city was named one of the [[National Register of Historic Places]]' \"Dozen Distinctive Destinations\" for 2003.<ref name=\"swwa_2006ish_quickfacts\" />\n\nOther notable buildings in Vancouver include:\n* The [[Covington House (Vancouver, Washington)|Covington House]] at 4201 Main Street, a [[log cabin]] and boarding school built 1846\u20131848\n* [[Officers Row]], including the Grant House (first house on the Columbia Barracks) and the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]]-style 1866 Marshall House\n* [[Mother Joseph]]'s Providence Academy, dedicated in 1873, where Evergreen Boulevard crosses [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]]\n* The [[Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater]] (formerly St. James Church) saw its first Roman Catholic Mass celebrated August 16, 1885\n* The [[List of Carnegie libraries in Washington|Carnegie library]] at Sixteenth and Main, which opened on New Year's Eve 1909, to showcase its unusual electric lights; it is now the site of the [[Clark County Historical Museum]]\n* The 1914 [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago-style]] U.S. National Bank (now the Heritage Building) at sixth and Main\n* The 1916 [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] at 1211 Daniels Street\n* The [[Vertical lift bridge|vertical-lift]] [[Interstate Bridge]], which opened on February 14, 1917, [[Oregon]]'s 58th anniversary\n* The 1935 [[art deco]] telephone exchange building at Eleventh and Washington\n* The 1941 Clark County Courthouse, designed by prolific local architect Day Hillborn\n* Smith Tower, a round downtown apartment building for the elderly, built in 1965\n* The Hilton Hotel and Vancouver Convention Center across from [[Esther Short Park]]\n\nMany of these buildings have been re-purposed. The 1867 Slocum House, an [[Italianate]] villa-style residence originally built one block south of its current location in [[Esther Short Park]], was moved to its present location in 1966 and now houses a winery and art gallery.<ref name=\"efs_deadlink\" /> The Carnegie Library was expanded in the 1940s, becoming the [[Clark County Historical Museum]] after a new library was built in 1963. Other buildings have been torn down for urban renewal or renovated to house professional offices for lawyers and accountants.\n\n==Art and culture==\n[[File:Kiggins Theatre-9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kiggins Theatre]] was designed by architect [[Day Walter Hilborn]].]]\nIn the early 2000s, Vancouver began seeing a revitalization of local art scene and cultural events. In 2010 there was a movement among local artists to form cooperatives and meet with established local gallery owners for a monthly forum known as \"Art Conversations.\" Many of Vancouver's art galleries are located in downtown Vancouver, and in 2014, the City Council formally designated an \"Arts District\" in the downtown core.<ref name=\"cityofvancouver_20140418_citycouncilartdistrict\" />\n\nThe [[Kiggins Theatre]] located within the Downtown Vancouver Art District, was built in 1936 by architect Day Hillborn. It was named for J.P. Kiggins, an entrepreneur and politician who cut a swath through town in the early 20th century, serving as Vancouver's mayor for 15 non-consecutive years between 1908 and 1935. It was renovated and reopened in 2011 as an independent film and community event venue.\n\nThe Vancouver Symphony Orchestra first formed in the late 1970s. Conducted and directed by Dr. Salvadore Brotons, the Symphony regularly performs concerts.<ref name=\"vso_2019ish_history\" />\n\n==Annual events==\nEvery June since 2006, the Recycled Arts Festival held in Esther Short Park has featured the work of dozens of artists whose creations are made from at least 75% reused or recycled materials, along with live music and food.<ref name=\"columbian_20180622_recyclingart\" />\n\nSince the mid-1960s, Vancouver hosted a [[Fourth of July]] [[fireworks]] display on the grounds of [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site]] that draws many people to the city. The display routinely ran to 45 minutes, attracted up to 60,000 visitors and was broadcast on area television, one of the largest west of the Mississippi River. Due to the death of key organizer \"Mister Fireworks\" Jim Larson and a [[Financial crisis of 2007\u20132010|poor economy]], the show was not held in 2009.<ref name=\"mrfireworks\" /> A shorter, redesigned show debuted in 2010 and brought in approximately 35,000 people.<ref name=\"2010fireworks\" /> As of 2019, The Historic Trust (formerly the \"Fort Vancouver National Trust\"<ref name=\"historictrust_2019ish_rebrand\" />) continues to organize the fireworks event.<ref name=\"historictrust_2019_2020fireworks\" />\n\n4 Days of Aloha, also known as the Hawaiian Festival, takes place in late July in Esther Short Park, Clark College, and Fort Vancouver. Started in 2012 by \"Aunty\" Deva Yamashiro, a hula dancer and self-appointed cultural ambassador for Hawaii, the festival features live music, dance performances, craft workshops, and a celebration of Hawaiian food, arts, and culture.<ref name=\"columbian_20190726_hawaiianfestival\" />\n\nLate August features the [[Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival]] in Esther Short Park, which brought 13,500 attendees in 2012 and which is considered the largest jazz festival in the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=\"clarkcountylive_20110725_winejazzfest\" /><ref name=\"columbian_20120827_winejazzfest\" />\n\n==Local media==\nVancouver is located within the Portland media market for print, radio, and television media. It does, however, serve as the hometown for some media, including:\n* ''[[The Columbian]]''\n* ''[[The Oregonian]]'' (based in Portland, Oregon; also covers some southwest Washington news)\n* ''[[The Vancouver Voice]]'' was, at one time, southwest Washington's only alternative periodical, published from 2006 to 2011.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{see also|Port of Vancouver USA}}\n[[File:C-Tran Gillig low-floor hybrid bus on Washington St in downtown (2017).jpg|thumb|Vancouver's [[public transit]] service is provided by [[C-Tran (Washington)|C-Tran]].]]\n\nVancouver has two interstate freeways, [[Interstate 5 in Washington|I-5]] and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|I-205]], both of which run north\u2013south, across the [[Columbia River]] into Portland and toward [[Seattle]]. It also has two heavily travelled [[state highway]]s within the city limits. [[Washington State Route 14|SR 14]] begins at I-5 in downtown Vancouver and makes its way east. It is a freeway all the way until [[Camas, Washington|Camas]]. [[Washington State Route 500|SR 500]] begins from I-5 at 39th Street in north Vancouver, travels east connecting with I-205, and continues east into the suburb of Orchards where the freeway terminates at Fourth Plain Boulevard, and meets with the south end of north\u2013south-oriented 117th Ave., [[Washington State Route 503|SR 503]]. A third state highway, [[Washington State Route 501|SR 501]], starts at I-5 and heads west through downtown and continues along a path that runs between the Columbia River and [[Vancouver Lake]].  Route 501 \u2013 SR501 dead ends a few miles north of Vancouver.\n\nThe area's mass transit system is [[C-Tran (Washington)|C-Tran]], the Clark County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority, which operates 135 buses, vanpools, and paratransit vehicles. There are also a number of express routes into Portland's downtown.\n\nIn 1995, Clark County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded extension of Portland's [[MAX Light Rail]] system north into Vancouver.<ref name=\"oregonian_19950208_lightrailrejected\" /> Opposition to paying for light rail was strong at that time, but slowly declined over the following several years, eventually leading Vancouver officials to begin discussing the idea again.<ref name=\"oregonian_20010326_lightrail\" /><ref name=\"secondlook\" /> Meanwhile, [[TriMet]] reconstituted its planned MAX line to Vancouver as a shorter line running only within Portland, which could potentially be extended across the river and into Clark County at a later date. This extension of the MAX system opened in 2004 as the [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow Line]],<ref name=\"makingtracks\" /> running as far north as the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]], approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} south of downtown Vancouver. Vancouver voters have rejected light rail operations monies in connection with the [[Columbia River Crossing]] proposal.<ref name=\"columbian_20121106_lightrailrejected\" />\n\nVancouver has always been well served by rail; current freight railroads operating in Vancouver include the [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]], [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], and the local shortline [[Lewis and Clark Railway]].  [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to [[Vancouver station (Washington)|Vancouver Station]]. The long-distance [[Coast Starlight]] and [[Empire Builder]] serve the city, as well as the regional [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']].\n\n[[Pearson Field]], located near downtown Vancouver, is the main airport serving the city. The airport is intended primarily for general aviation without any commercial air service. The nearest commercial airport is [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX).\n\nIn 2008, Vancouver passed a citywide law requiring anyone on a wheeled device such as a bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates to wear a helmet while on any sidewalk, street, trail or other public property. Many local cyclists opposed the law as a misuse of city funds and police efforts, as well as encroachment on personal freedoms. Despite opposition from the public, the Vancouver City Council passed the measure 5\u20131 with then Mayor Royce Pollard saying, \"...statistics be damned. I support this.\"<ref name=\"bikeportland_20080225_helmetlaw\" /><ref name=\"columbian_20080226_helmetlaw\" />\n\n==Sister cities==\nVancouver has one [[Twin towns and sister cities|sister city:]]<ref name=\"waltgov_2006ish_sistercities\" />\n\n* [[Joyo, Kyoto|Joyo]], [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], [[Kansai region|Kansai]], Japan\n\nVancouver previously had a sister-city relationship with [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]], between 1961 and 1993, but that relationship ended.<ref name=\"Rice\" />\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Mary Barnard]], poet\n*[[Greg Biffle]], [[NASCAR]] driver\n*[[Don Bonker]], Congressman who while in office resided in Vancouver.<ref name=\"barone_1987_donbonker\" />\n*[[Jason V.

It is the largest suburb of [[Portland, Oregon]].<ref name=\"Aberdeen Herald\" /><ref name=\"The Oregonian's Handbook of the Pacific Northwest\" /> Incorporated in 1857, Vancouver had a population of 161,791 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 U.S. census]], making it the fourth-largest city in Washington state.<ref name=\"2010 Census (City)\" /> Vancouver is the [[county seat]] of [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] and forms part of the [[Portland metropolitan area|Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area]], the 23rd largest metropolitan area in the United States. Originally established in 1825 around [[Fort Vancouver]], a [[fur trading|fur-trading]] outpost, the city is located on the Washington/Oregon border along the [[Columbia River]], directly north of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. In 2005, [[Money (magazine)|''Money'']] magazine named it No. 91 on its list of best places in America to live.<ref name=\"cnn_2005_cityrank\" /> In 2016, WalletHub ranked Vancouver the 89th best place in the U.S. for families to live.<ref name=\"wallethub_2019_cityrank\" />\n\n==Etymology==\nVancouver shares its name with the larger city of [[Vancouver]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, approximately {{convert|300|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the north. Both cities were named after sea captain [[George Vancouver]], but the American city is older. Vancouver, British Columbia was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington, and more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic [[Fort Vancouver]] trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the U.S. city's name to Fort Vancouver to reduce confusion with its larger and better-known northern neighbor. Many [[Pacific Northwest]] residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as \"Vancouver, B.C.\" and the United States city as \"Vancouver, Washington,\" or \"Vancouver, USA.\"<ref name=\"columbian_20180511_tourismrevenue\" /><ref name=\"businesswire_20180206_\" /><ref name=\"ajot_20180502_vancouverusa\" /> Local nicknames include \"Vantucky\" (though this is often used as a derogatory term)<ref name=\"bloomberg_20120529_fisherstatetax\" /><ref name=\"vanvoice_20090601_lincolnsbeardvantuckey\" /><ref name=\"vanvoice_2012_deadlink1\" /><ref name=\"oregonian_20110517_cafevantuckyshirt\" /><ref name=\"clarkcountyblog_20110516_cafevantuckyshirt\" /><ref name=\"stumped_20110529_portlandneighborcities\" /><ref name=\"columbian_20110605_vantuckyderogatory\" /> and \"The 'Couv(e)\".<ref name=\"wweek_20070321_welcometothecouve\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fort Vancouver1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Vancouver]] in 1859]]\n[[File:Marshall House Officers Row.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshall House in [[Officers Row]], built in 1886 and later named after [[George C.

From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a \"joint occupation\" agreement. Joint occupation led to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] and ended on June 15, 1846, with the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]], which gave the United States full control of the area. Before 1845, American Henry Williamson laid out a large claim west of the Hudson's Bay Company (including part of the present-day Port of Vancouver), called Vancouver City and properly registered his claim at the U.S. courthouse in Oregon City, before leaving for California.<ref name=\"jollata\" />{{rp|42}}  In 1848, Williamson had it surveyed and platted by [[Peter Crawford (land surveyor)|Peter Crawford]]. In 1850, Amos Short traced over the claim of Williamson and named the town Columbia City.<ref name=\"dahp_20140330_vancouversurveyor\" /> It changed to Vancouver in 1855. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23, 1857.<ref name=\"historylink_20090807_vancouvernamehistory\" />\n\nBased on an act in the 1859\u201360 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of [[Washington Territory]], before capital status was returned to [[Olympia, Washington]] by a 2\u20131 ruling of the territory's supreme court, in accordance with [[Isaac Stevens]]' preference and concern that proximity to the border with Oregon might give some of the state's influence away to Oregon.<ref name=\"columbian_2006ish_capitoldispute\" /><ref name=\"historylink_20030115_capitoldispute\" /><ref name=\"wasenate_2005_honorolympia\" />\n\nU.S. Army Captain (and future President) [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was quartermaster at what was then known as Columbia Barracks for 15 months beginning in September 1852. Soon after leaving Vancouver, he resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include [[George B. McClellan]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[Oliver O. Howard]] and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [[George Marshall]].<ref name=\"cityofvancouver_2007ish_150thanniversary\" />\n\nArmy presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to Vancouver Barracks, the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by [[Fort Lewis]], {{convert|120|mi|km|-1}} to the north. Built on the old company gardens and skirmish range, Pearson Army Field (later [[Pearson Field]]) was a key facility, and at one point the [[United States Army Signal Corps|US Army Signal Corps]] operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, [[USSR]] over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by [[Valery Chkalov]] in 1937 on a [[Tupolev ANT-25]]RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip in nearby [[Portland, Oregon]], but redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. Today there is a street named for him in Vancouver. In 1975 an obelisk was erected at Pearson Field commemorating this event.{{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for Chkalov flight and Signal Corps presence|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe neighborhood of Sifton was the terminus of an early electric [[Tram|trolley]] operated by the Northcoast Power Company that also served nearby [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] from 1910 until 1926. The trolleys made ten stops and ran once per hour, charging 15 cents each way. A mural in the heart of Orchards depicts the trolley and the rural character of the area at the time it was operating. The community was named after Doctor Sifton, a promoter of the trolley service.<ref name=\"origin\" />\n\nAccording to the archives of the Vancouver ''[[The Columbian|Columbian]]'' newspaper, the Orchards-Sifton route went along Vancouver's Main Street to 26th, then out 26th to K Street and thence north to 33rd. From there, it ran on 33rd over Burnt Bridge Creek and past the city limits. At that point the trolley became more like a regular train as followed a cut through the wilderness. Few houses were seen between Vancouver and Orchards. The public's preference for motor cars in the 1920s heralded the end of the trolley.\n\nSeparated from Oregon until 1917, when the [[Interstate Bridge]] began to replace ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for World War I before World War II brought an enormous economic boom. An [[Alcoa]] aluminum plant opened on September 2, 1940, using inexpensive power from the nearby [[New Deal]] hydropower turbines at [[Bonneville Dam]]. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, [[Henry J. Kaiser|Henry Kaiser]] opened a [[Kaiser Shipyards|shipyard]] next to the U.S. Army base, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of [[Liberty ships]], [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing ship tanks]], and [[Casablanca-class escort carrier|escort carriers]]. This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new [[tract housing|residential developments]]: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring \"shipyard city\" of [[Vanport, Oregon]], would be destroyed by the [[Memorial Day]] flood of 1948.{{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for lack of bridge with Oregon until 1917, 1940 aluminum plant, and WWII boom towns|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{Recentism|date=November 2019}}\nVancouver has recently experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. The city's first annexation more than doubled its size in 1909, with the largest annexation of 1997 adding {{convert|11258|acre|km2}} and 58,171 residents.<ref name=\"cityofvancouver_2006ish_annexationhistory\" /> As a result of urban growth and the 1997 annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and some of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development. East Vancouver includes the communities of Cascade Park East and West, which had populations of 6,996 and 6,956 in 1990 before annexation.\n\nMore than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population lives in unincorporated urban area north of the city limits, including the communities of [[Hazel Dell, Washington|Hazel Dell]], [[Felida, Washington|Felida]], [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] and [[Salmon Creek, Washington|Salmon Creek]]. If county leaders had approved a major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have passed [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to become the state's second-largest city.<ref name=\"komotv_20051223_annexation\" />\n\n==Geography and climate==\nVancouver is located just north of the [[Columbia River]], just west of where the [[Columbia River Gorge]] bisects the volcanic [[Cascade Range]] and just east of where the [[Willamette River]] enters the Columbia. The city of Vancouver is in the Western Lowlands region of Washington. When clouds do not blanket the Puget-Willamette trough formed by the Cascade and [[Oregon Coast Range|Coast Range]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount Saint Helens]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] are all visible from Vancouver.\n\n[[File:Interstate Bridge and Columbia River.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbia River]] waterfront]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|49.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|46.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|3.40|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\" />\n\nVancouver lies just north of Portland, Oregon and shares a similar climate. Both are classified as warm-summer Mediterranean (Csb) on the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], with certain key exceptions. High pressures east of the [[Cascade Range]] create something of a [[venturi effect]], leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the [[Willamette Valley]], Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including \"silver thaw\" storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power in the city for almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|42|in|mm}}. Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2\u20134 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as [[Celilo Falls]]. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive in June 1894 and May 1948. The 1948 [[Memorial Day]] flood almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby [[Vanport, Oregon]]. Other unusual storms include the [[Columbus Day]] windstorm of 1962 and [[1972 Portland\u2013Vancouver tornado|an April 5, 1972 tornado]] which rated F3 on the [[Fujita scale]], striking a local school.

The state of Washington levies no individual or corporate income taxes and levies a property tax below the national average and a sales tax above the national median.<ref name=\"taxfoundation_taxsumwa\" /> The State of Oregon has even lower property taxes and no sales tax but one of the highest state income taxes.<ref name=\"taxfoundation_taxsumor\" /> As a result, many Vancouver residents prefer to shop in neighboring Portland where they do not pay sales taxes<ref name=\"pew_20120418_portlandwashtax\" />, then live and work in Vancouver where they do not pay state income tax. (Washington residents who work in Oregon must pay Oregon income tax.) For the same reasons, the city is popular with retirees. Conversely, the city is less favored by students and young adults.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. There is a risk in sales tax avoidance because Washington has a use tax due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents \"shop at their own risk\" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Washington, although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} except for purchases requiring registration, such as motor vehicles.\n\nThe taxation and demographics of the area depresses the retail sector of Vancouver's economy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Oregon has stricter development laws to protect the timber industry;{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} therefore, Vancouver tends to attract a higher proportion of the region's sprawling development. The voting base also led to rejection of extension of Portland's light-rail system into the city for several years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2013, Washington transitioned away from being a [[Alcoholic beverage control state|control state]].\n\nThe economic history of Vancouver reflects the region. Moving from a salmon- and trade-based indigenous economy by the [[Chinookan|Chinook]] people, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] pioneered extractive industries such as the [[fur trade]] and timber. Subsistence agricultural gave way to market and export crops such as apples, strawberries and prunes. Largely bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s, when the Oregon Steam Navigation company would ferry trains across the river downstream from [[St. Helens, Oregon]] to [[Kalama, Washington]], early downtown development was focused around Washington Street (where ferries arrived), lumber and Vancouver Barracks activities such as a large spruce mill for manufacturing airplanes. A 1908 railroad [[swing bridge]] across the Columbia allowed greater industrial developments such as the Standifer Shipyard during the first world war. With the Interstate Bridge and [[Bonneville Dam]] Vancouver saw an industrial boom in the 1940s, including the [[Kaiser Shipyards|Kaiser shipyard]] and [[Alcoa]], as well as a [[Boise Cascade]] paper mill, just west of the Interstate Bridge.<ref name=\"jollata\" />\n\nAs the [[old-growth forest]]s were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy has largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland. Vancouver contains the corporate headquarters for [[Nautilus, Inc.]] and The Holland (parent company of the [[Burgerville, USA]] restaurant chain).<ref name=\"vbjbol2007\" />\n\n[[File:Aerial view of Vancouver, WA.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the city]]\nThe [[Port of Vancouver USA]] operates a port on the Columbia River, which separates [[Oregon]] to the south and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to the north. It handles over 400 ocean-going vessels annually, as well as a number of barges which ply the river and its tributaries as far as [[Lewiston, Idaho]].\n\nThe Vancouver Energy project was a proposed crude oil transport hub in the [[Port of Vancouver USA]].  It was estimated to produce the equivalent of $1.6&nbsp;billion in employment income during the terminal's construction and for its first 15 years of operation.<ref name=\"nlr_20140901_vancouverenergystudy\" />.

The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall [[condominium]] structures around [[Esther Short Park]]. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel directly across from the park.{{cn|date=March 2019}}\n\n[[File:Clark County Historical Museum - Vancouver Washington.jpg|thumb|The Clark County Historical Museum]]\n''[[The Columbian]]'' newspaper finished building a new seven-story building adjacent to the Hilton in 2008. Early in 2010, ''The Columbian'' filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy and the building defaulted to [[Bank of America]]. In June 2010, the City of Vancouver agreed to purchase the former downtown Columbian office building for use as a new city hall. The city bought the two-year-old building and {{convert|5.14|acre|m2}} for $18.5&nbsp;million, a fraction of the $41.5&nbsp;million sale price the owners of The Columbian office building had been asking prior to filing for bankruptcy. In 2011, the city consolidated five separate buildings housing 300 employees into one at the new City Hall, located at 415 W. 6th St. The move is saving the city approximately $1&nbsp;million a year in facility lease and maintenance costs.<ref name=\"brettman\" />\n\nThe Fort Vancouver Regional Library District opened a new library on C Street at Evergreen Boulevard in 2011.

There are also a number of express routes into Portland's downtown.\n\nIn 1995, Clark County voters defeated a ballot measure that would have funded extension of Portland's [[MAX Light Rail]] system north into Vancouver.<ref name=\"oregonian_19950208_lightrailrejected\" /> Opposition to paying for light rail was strong at that time, but slowly declined over the following several years, eventually leading Vancouver officials to begin discussing the idea again.<ref name=\"oregonian_20010326_lightrail\" /><ref name=\"secondlook\" /> Meanwhile, [[TriMet]] reconstituted its planned MAX line to Vancouver as a shorter line running only within Portland, which could potentially be extended across the river and into Clark County at a later date. This extension of the MAX system opened in 2004 as the [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow Line]],<ref name=\"makingtracks\" /> running as far north as the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Portland Expo Center]], approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} south of downtown Vancouver. Vancouver voters have rejected light rail operations monies in connection with the [[Columbia River Crossing]] proposal.<ref name=\"columbian_20121106_lightrailrejected\" />\n\nVancouver has always been well served by rail; current freight railroads operating in Vancouver include the [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]], [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], and the local shortline [[Lewis and Clark Railway]].  [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to [[Vancouver station (Washington)|Vancouver Station]]. The long-distance [[Coast Starlight]] and [[Empire Builder]] serve the city, as well as the regional [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']].\n\n[[Pearson Field]], located near downtown Vancouver, is the main airport serving the city. The airport is intended primarily for general aviation without any commercial air service. The nearest commercial airport is [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX).\n\nIn 2008, Vancouver passed a citywide law requiring anyone on a wheeled device such as a bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates to wear a helmet while on any sidewalk, street, trail or other public property. Many local cyclists opposed the law as a misuse of city funds and police efforts, as well as encroachment on personal freedoms. Despite opposition from the public, the Vancouver City Council passed the measure 5\u20131 with then Mayor Royce Pollard saying, \"...statistics be damned. I support this.\"<ref name=\"bikeportland_20080225_helmetlaw\" /><ref name=\"columbian_20080226_helmetlaw\" />\n\n==Sister cities==\nVancouver has one [[Twin towns and sister cities|sister city:]]<ref name=\"waltgov_2006ish_sistercities\" />\n\n* [[Joyo, Kyoto|Joyo]], [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto]], [[Kansai region|Kansai]], Japan\n\nVancouver previously had a sister-city relationship with [[Arequipa]], [[Peru]], between 1961 and 1993, but that relationship ended.<ref name=\"Rice\" />\n\n==Notable people==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Mary Barnard]], poet\n*[[Greg Biffle]], [[NASCAR]] driver\n*[[Don Bonker]], Congressman who while in office resided in Vancouver.<ref name=\"barone_1987_donbonker\" />\n*[[Jason V.

His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978. He remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\".\n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days.\n\n==== Palm Mortuary, Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary.\n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct.

The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room.

He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

This behavior included hearing his car arrive and depart in the early hours of the morning; noting lights switching on and off in his home at odd hours and his keeping company with young males.<ref name=\"autogenerated28\" /> One neighbor later recollected that, for several years, she and her son had repeatedly been awoken by the repeated sounds of muffled screaming, shouting, and crying in the early morning hours, which she and her son identified as emanating from a house adjacent to theirs on Summerdale Avenue.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=274}}\n\n===Modus operandi===\nGacy typically abducted his victims from Chicago's Greyhound Bus station, from [[Washington Square Park (Chicago)|Bughouse Square]], or simply off the streets.

Gacy would then produce a pair of handcuffs, occasionally as part of a clowning routine. He typically cuffed his own hands behind his back, then surreptitiously released himself with the key, which he hid between his fingers,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=18}} before offering to show his intended victim how to release himself from the handcuffs.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=169\u2013170}} With his victim manacled and unable to free himself, Gacy then made a statement to the effect of: \"The trick is, you have to have the key\", before proceeding to rape and torture his captive.<ref name=\"Kozenczak\">Kozenczak (2012), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> Some victims were partly drowned in his bathtub before Gacy revived them, enabling him to continue his prolonged assault.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=331}} The victims were usually lured alone to his house, although on approximately three occasions, Gacy had what he called \"[[Double murder|doubles]]\"\u2014occasions wherein he killed two victims on the same evening.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} With only two exceptions, all his victims were murdered between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=179}}\n\nGacy typically murdered his victim by placing a rope around his victim's neck, forming a makeshift tourniquet which he repeatedly tightened with a hammer handle{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=21}} until the victim was strangled to death.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 201-203</ref> He referred to this act as the \"rope trick.\" Occasionally, the victim had [[convulse]]d for an \"hour or two\" after the rope trick before dying. In several instances, cloth gags stuffed into the victim's mouth caused Gacy's victim to die of asphyxiation as opposed to strangulation.<ref name=\"Kozenczak\" />\n\nAfter death, the victims' bodies were typically stored beneath his bed for up to 24 hours before Gacy buried his victim in the crawl space, where he periodically poured [[Calcium oxide|quicklime]] to hasten the decomposition of the bodies.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=177}} The bodies of some victims would be taken to his garage and [[embalming|embalmed]] prior to their burial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=345}}\n\n===1976===\n[[File:CousinKevinscreenshot1980.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Victims Darrell Samson and Gregory Godzik.

Less than three weeks later, on November 24, a 20-year-old [[Elmwood Park, Illinois|Elmwood Park]] resident, James Mazzara, disappeared after sharing Thanksgiving dinner with his family; his body was found on December 28. The cause of death in the case of Landingin was certified as suffocation through the youth's own underwear being lodged down his throat, plugging his airway{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=275}} and effectively causing him to drown in his own vomit.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=276}} Mazzara had been strangled with a ligature.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=225}}\n\n=====Murder of Robert Piest=====\n[[File:Piest1.jpg|200px|thumb|Robert Piest, whose abduction and murder ultimately led to Gacy's arrest and the discoveries upon his property.]]\nOn the afternoon of December 11, 1978, Gacy visited the Nisson Pharmacy in [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] to discuss a potential remodeling deal with store owner Phil Torf. While Gacy was within earshot of 15-year-old, part-time employee Robert Piest, he mentioned that his firm hired teenage boys at a starting wage of $5 per hour\u2014almost double the pay Piest earned at the pharmacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=4}}\n\nShortly after Gacy left the pharmacy, Piest informed his mother\u2014who had arrived at the pharmacy to drive her son home\u2014that \"some contractor wants to talk to me about a job\". Piest left the store, promising to return shortly.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=7}}\n\n==Investigation==\nWhen Piest failed to return, his family filed a [[missing person]] report on their son with the Des Plaines police. Torf named Gacy as the contractor Piest had most likely left the store to talk with about a job.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 25-26</ref> Convinced Piest had not run away from home, Lieutenant [[Joseph R. Kozenczak|Joseph Kozenczak]] chose to investigate Gacy further.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), pp. 26-27</ref>\n\nKozenczak and two other Des Plaines police officers visited Gacy at his home the following evening. Gacy indicated he had seen two youths working at the pharmacy and that he had asked one of them\u2014whom he believed to be Piest\u2014whether any remodeling materials were present in the rear of the store.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=19\u201321}} He was adamant, however, that he had not offered Piest a job and promised to come to the station later that evening to make a statement confirming this, indicating he was unable to do so at that moment as his uncle had just died. When questioned as to how soon he could come to the police station, he responded: \"You guys are very rude. Don't you have any respect for the dead?\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=240}}\n\nAt 3:20&nbsp;a.m., Gacy, covered in mud, arrived at the police station, claiming he had been involved in a car accident.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=23}} Upon returning to the police station later that day, Gacy denied any involvement in the disappearance of Piest and repeated that he had not offered him a job. When asked why he had returned to the pharmacy at 8 p.m. Gacy claimed he had done so in response to a phone call from Torf informing him he had left his appointment book at the store. Detectives had already spoken with Torf, who had stated he had placed no such call to Gacy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=27}} At the request of detectives, Gacy prepared a written statement detailing his movements on December 11.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=28}}\n\n===Revelations===\nDes Plaines police were convinced Gacy was behind Piest's disappearance and checked Gacy's record, discovering that he had an outstanding battery charge against him in Chicago and had served a prison sentence in Iowa for the sodomy of a 15-year-old boy.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=17}} A search of Gacy's house on December 13 was ordered by a judge at the request of detectives and revealed several suspicious items. These included a [[syringe]], several police badges, and a 6mm Brevettata [[starter pistol]]. They also found handcuffs, books on homosexuality and [[pederasty]], a 39 inch long [[Dimensional lumber#Dimensional lumber|two-by-four]] with two holes drilled into each end,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=33}} several driver's licenses, a blue hooded parka and underwear too small to fit Gacy.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nIn the northwest bedroom, investigators found a [[Maine West High School]] ring. This item initially interested investigators as Piest had attended Maine West, but the ring was not his. It was a class of 1975 ring engraved with the initials J.A.S.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=243}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=87}} A photo receipt from Nisson Pharmacy was also recovered from a trash can.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 61</ref>\n\nGacy's Oldsmobile and other PDM work vehicles were confiscated by the Des Plaines police, who assigned two two-man [[surveillance]] teams to monitor Gacy on a rotational twelve-hour basis as they continued their investigation into his background and potential involvement in Piest's disappearance.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Murder casebook number 84 {{ISBN|0-7485-1454-6}}, p. 1915</ref> These surveillance teams consisted of officers Mike Albrecht and David Hachmeister, and Ronald Robinson and Robert Schultz.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=41}} The following day, investigators received a phone call from Michael Rossi, who informed the investigators both of Gregory Godzik's disappearance and the fact that another PDM employee, Charles Hattula, had been found drowned in an Illinois river the previous year.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=53}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=123}}\n\nOn December 15, Des Plaines investigators obtained further details upon Gacy's battery charge, learning the complainant, Jeffrey Rignall, had reported that Gacy had lured him into his car, chloroformed him, raped him and dumped him, with severe chest and facial burns and rectal bleeding, in Lincoln Park the following morning. In an interview with Gacy's former wife the same day, they learned of the disappearance of John Butkovich.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=84}} The same day, the Maine West High School ring was traced to a John Alan Szyc.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=53\u201355}} In an interview with Szyc's mother the same day, she informed officers of the January 1977 disappearance of her son and that several items from his apartment were also missing, including a Motorola TV set.<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 117</ref>\n\nBy December 16, Gacy was becoming affable with the surveillance detectives, regularly inviting them to join him for meals in restaurants and occasionally for drinks in bars or within his home. He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform. {{ISBN|978-1401095314}} p. 148</ref> Upon hearing this question, Rossi refused to continue the polygraph questioning, although he did discuss further his digging trenches in the crawl space and remarked upon Gacy's insistence that he not deviate from where he was instructed to dig.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nCram himself informed investigators of Gacy's attempts to rape him in 1976 and stated that after he and Gacy had returned to his home after the December 13 search of his property, Gacy had turned pale upon noting a clot of mud on his carpet which he suspected had come from his crawl space. Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacycrawlspace.png|thumb|260px|Gacy's diagram of the burial locations of his victims within his basement and the investigators' subsequent diagram of the crawl space.]]After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

Those doctors refuted the defense doctors' claims of multiple personality and insanity. Cram and Rossi both confessed that Gacy had made them dig trenches in his crawl space. Cram testified that in August 1977, Gacy had marked a location in the crawl space with sticks and told him to dig a [[Drainage#Drainage in construction|drainage]] trench.<ref name=\"The Montreal Gazette Feb. 13, 1980\" />{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}}\n\nImmediately after Cram had completed his testimony, Rossi testified for the state. When asked where he had dug in the crawl space, Rossi turned to a diagram of Gacy's home on display in the courtroom. This diagram showed where the bodies were found in the crawl space and elsewhere on the property. Rossi pointed to the location of the remains of an unidentified victim known as \"Body 13\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=311}} Rossi stated he had not dug any other trenches, but\u2014at Gacy's request\u2014had supervised other PDM employees digging trenches in the crawl space.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=181}}\n\nBoth Rossi and Cram also testified that Gacy periodically looked into the crawl space to ensure they and other employees ordered to dig trenches in the crawl space did not deviate from the precise locations he had marked.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=312}} Gacy had testified after his arrest that he had only dug five of the victims' graves in his crawl space{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=142}} and had his employees (including Gregory Godzik) dig the remaining trenches so that he would \"have graves available\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=360}}\n\nOn February 18, Dr. Robert Stein,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=321}} the Cook County medical examiner appointed to supervise the exhumation of the victims' bodies from Gacy's home, testified as to how he and his colleagues had conducted the recovery of the remains. Stein testified that the excavation was conducted in an \"archaeological fashion\", adding that all the bodies recovered were \"markedly decomposed, putrefied, skeletalized remains\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mother Cries at Description of Son's Grave|date=February 19, 1980 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VHVkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mn4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=2366,5212913 |newspaper=The Calgary Herald |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}</ref> In relation to the cause of death of each victim upon which he had later performed an autopsy, Stein stated he had concluded that thirteen victims had died of asphyxiation; six had died of ligature strangulation and one victim of multiple stab wounds to the chest.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=102}} Stein testified that the cause of death in ten cases could not be determined, although all were ruled as homicides.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=322}}\n\nUpon cross-examination, Gacy's defense team attempted to raise the possibility that all 33 murders were accidental [[erotic asphyxia]] deaths: Dr. Stein countered this [[Proof by assertion|assertion]] by stating that this claim was highly improbable.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=322\u2013323}}{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=233}}\n\nThree days after the testimony of Dr. Robert Stein, Jeffrey Rignall testified on behalf of the prosecution, recounting the abuse and torture he had endured at Gacy's hands in March 1978. Rignall repeatedly wept as he recounted his ordeal. In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims. Gacy neither confirmed nor denied Ressler's suspicions.{{efn|Gacy is known to have given Ressler a painting with a written inscription reading: \"Dear Bob Ressler, You cannot hope to enjoy the harvest, without first laboring in the fields\".<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} p 343</ref>}}\n\nJeffrey Rignall, who had been assaulted and tortured by Gacy in March 1978, was adamant that at one point during his abuse and torture, a young man with brown hair, kneeling before him, watched his abuse.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=209}} When this youth realized Rignall had regained consciousness, he was again chloroformed into unconsciousness. Rignall also informed police that as Gacy was raping and assaulting him, a light was switched on in another part of the house.<ref name=\"google2963\">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=19790101&id=PEEsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v80EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2963,232748|title=Herald-Journal \u2013 Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, on one occasion during the surveillance of Gacy prior to his arrest, two of the surveillance officers followed Gacy to a bar to which Gacy had driven to meet two of his employees. At the bar, the surveillance officers overheard a hushed conversation between Gacy and one of his employees in which the youth asked Gacy the question: \"And what? Buried like the other five?\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}}\n\nIn interviews following his arrest and conviction, Gacy repeatedly claimed that he was not present in Chicago when 16 of the identified victims had disappeared. In one interview, he stated that at the time of his arrest, four PDM employees were also considered suspects in the disappearances of the missing boys investigators had linked to Gacy\u2014all of whom he stated were in possession of keys to his house.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp=341\u2013342</ref> One of these employees was Philip Paske, a young man who is known to have been a close associate of John Norman.

To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared.

His first murder occurred in 1972 and at least 30 of his subsequent murders were committed after the divorce of his second wife in 1976. Investigation into the case of missing [[Des Plaines, Illinois|Des Plaines]] teenager Robert Piest led to Gacy's arrest on December 21, 1978. He remained active in his community, regularly performing at events as his own characters, \"Pogo the [[Clown]]\" or \"Patches the Clown\", and so is known as the \"Killer Clown\". \n\nGacy was convicted of the [[sodomy]] of a teenage boy in Iowa in 1968. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment, but was released from prison on good behavior; and returned to his home state of Illinois. It is believed all of his known murders were committed inside his [[Ranch-style house|ranch house]] in [[Norwood Park Township, Cook County, Illinois|Norwood Park]], a part of [[Chicago metropolitan area|metropolitan Chicago]]. Once lured to his home by force or deception, his victims were typically duped into donning [[handcuffs]] on the pretext of being shown a [[Magic (illusion)|magic trick]] and then raped and tortured before being murdered by either [[asphyxiation]] or [[strangulation]] with a makeshift [[garrote]].\n\n26 of Gacy's victims were buried in the [[Crawl space (basement)|crawl space]] of his home. Three other victims were buried elsewhere on his property, while the bodies of his last four known victims were discarded in the [[Des Plaines River]]. The conviction for 33 murders was then the largest number of murders charged to one individual in United States history. Gacy was sentenced to death on March 13, 1980 for 12 of those murders. He spent 14 years on death row at [[Menard Correctional Center]], spending much of his time painting, and was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[Stateville Correctional Center]] on May 10, 1994.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Wayne Gacy was born in Chicago, [[Illinois]] on March 17, 1942, the second child and only son of John Stanley Gacy (June 20, 1900 \u2013 December 25, 1969) and Marion Elaine Robinson (May 4, 1908 \u2013 December 6, 1989).<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 63.</ref> His father was an auto repair machinist and [[World War I]] veteran,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=24}} and his mother was a homemaker.<ref>Cook County marriage records provide his mother's name as Marion E.

He was close to his two sisters and mother but endured a difficult relationship with his father, an [[alcoholic]] who was [[physical abuse|physically abusive]] to his wife and children.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=256\u2013257}} Gacy seldom received his father's approval, later recollecting that, no matter what he achieved, he was \"never good enough\" in his father's eyes.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=31}}  His father regularly belittled him, calling him \"dumb and stupid\" and comparing him unfavorably with his sisters.<ref>''Serial Killers.'' pp. 54\u201355.</ref> Despite this, Gacy always denied ever hating his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=21}} \n\nOne of Gacy's earliest childhood memories was of being beaten with a leather belt at the age of four for accidentally disarranging car engine components his father had assembled.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=18\u201319}} On another occasion, he was struck across the head with a broomstick and rendered [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]].<ref>{{cite book | first1=Jason| last1=Moss| first2=Jeffrey| last2=Kottler| title=The Last Victim: A True-life Journey into the Mind of the Serial Killer| publisher=Grand Central Publishing| location=New York City| date=2000|isbn=0-7535-0398-0| p=103}}</ref> When he was six years old, Gacy stole a toy truck from a neighborhood store. His mother made him walk back to the store, return the toy and apologize to the owners. His mother informed his father, who beat Gacy with a belt as punishment. After this incident, Gacy's mother attempted to shield her son from his father's verbal and physical abuse,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=26}} yet this only succeeded in Gacy earning accusations that he was a \"[[sissy]]\" and a \"Mama's boy\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} who would \"probably grow up [[queer]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=40}}\n\nIn 1949, Gacy's father was informed that his son and another boy had been caught sexually fondling a young girl.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=218}} Gacy's father whipped him with a [[razor strop]] as punishment. The same year,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=17}} Gacy was [[child molestation|molested]] by a family friend,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=257}} a contractor who would take Gacy for rides in his truck and then fondle him. Gacy never told his father about these incidents, afraid that his father would blame him.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\">''Serial Killers''. p. 54.</ref>\n\nBecause of a heart condition, Gacy was ordered to avoid all sports at school.<ref name=\"Serial Killers. p. 54\" /> During the fourth grade, Gacy began to experience [[Syncope (medicine)|blackout]]s. He was occasionally hospitalized because of these seizures, and also in 1957 for a [[appendicitis|burst appendix]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=18}} Gacy later estimated that between the ages of 14 and 18, he had spent almost a year in the hospital for these episodes, and attributed the decline of his grades to his missing school. His father suspected the episodes were an effort to gain sympathy and attention, and openly accused his son of faking the condition as the boy lay in a hospital bed.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |issn=1364-5803 |page=5}}</ref> Although his mother, sisters, and few close friends never doubted his illness, Gacy's medical condition was never conclusively diagnosed.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=32}}\n\nOne of Gacy's friends at high school recalled several instances in which his father ridiculed or beat his son without provocation. On one occasion in 1957, the same friend witnessed an incident at the Gacy household in which Gacy's father began shouting at his son for no reason, then began hitting him.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=33}} Gacy's mother attempted to intervene. The friend recalled that Gacy simply \"put up his hands to defend himself\", adding that he never struck his father back during these physical altercations.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=32\u201333}}\n\n===Career origins===\nIn 1960, at the age of 18, Gacy became involved in politics, working as an assistant [[precinct captain]] for a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] candidate in his neighborhood. This decision earned more criticism from his father, who accused his son of being a \"[[wikt:Special:Search/dupe|patsy]]\". Gacy later speculated the decision may have been an attempt to seek the acceptance from others that he never received from his father.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=36}}\n\nThe same year Gacy became a Democratic candidate, his father bought him a car, with the title of the vehicle being in his father's name until Gacy had completed the monthly repayments.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=42}} These repayments took several years to complete, and his father would confiscate the keys to the vehicle if Gacy did not do as his father said. On one occasion in 1962, Gacy bought an extra set of keys after his father confiscated the original set. In response, his father removed the [[distributor cap]] from the vehicle, withholding the component for three days. \n\n==== Palm Mortuary, Las Vegas ====\nGacy recalled that as a result of this incident, he felt \"totally sick; drained\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=44}} When his father replaced the distributor cap, Gacy left the family home and drove to [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he found work within the ambulance service before he was transferred to work as an attendant at Palm Mortuary. \n\nIn his role as a mortuary attendant, Gacy slept on a cot behind the [[embalming]] room.<ref>{{cite book|first=Tim|last=Cahill|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OF6itYw0HT0C&pg=PT30&lpg=PT30#v=onepage&q/ |title=Buried Dreams: Inside the Mind of a Serial Killer|publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |location=New York City|date=1986|access-date=March 14, 2013|isbn=978-0553051155}}</ref> He worked in this role for three months.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} In this role, he observed morticians embalming dead bodies and later confessed that, on one evening while alone, he had clambered into the coffin of a deceased teenage male, embracing and caressing the body before experiencing a sense of shock.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}}{{efn|Gacy later claimed to have engaged in acts of [[necrophilia]] on approximately two occasions while he worked at Palm Mortuary. He justified his actions by claiming the bodies he had defiled were \"just dead things\" who \"couldn't tell anybody\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=346}}}} This prompted Gacy to call his mother the next day and ask whether his father would allow him to return home.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=46}} His father agreed and the same day, Gacy drove back to live with his family in Chicago.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=347}}\n\n==== Nunn-Bush Shoe Company ====\nUpon his return, despite the fact he had failed to graduate from high school, Gacy successfully enrolled in the [[Northwestern College (Illinois)|Northwestern Business College]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=47}} from which he graduated in 1963. Gacy subsequently took a management trainee position within the Nunn-Bush Shoe Company.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=18\u201319}} In 1964, the shoe company transferred Gacy to [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]] to work as a salesman.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=258}} He was eventually promoted to manager of his department. In March of that year, he became engaged to Marlynn Myers, a co-worker in the department he managed.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}\n\n==== Springfield Jaycees ====\nDuring his courtship with Marlynn, Gacy joined the local [[Jaycees]] and became a tireless worker for the organization, being named Key Man for the organization in April 1964.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 58.</ref> The same year, Gacy had his second homosexual experience. According to Gacy, he acquiesced to this incident after one of his colleagues in the Springfield Jaycees plied him with drinks and invited him to spend the evening upon his sofa; the colleague then performed [[oral sex]] upon him while he was drunk.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal |title=Murder In Mind |issue=11 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish Printworks|location=London, England|issn=1364-5803 |page=7}}</ref> By 1965, Gacy had risen to the position of vice-president of the Springfield Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=20\u201322}} The same year, he was named as the third most outstanding Jaycee within the state of Illinois.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=48}}\n\n==Waterloo, Iowa==\nAfter a nine-month courtship, Gacy and Myers married in September 1964. Marlynn's father subsequently purchased three [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]] restaurants in [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]], [[Iowa]], and the couple moved to Waterloo so he could manage the restaurants, with the understanding that they would move into Marlynn's parents' home (which was vacated for the couple).{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=21}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=261\u2013262}} The offer was lucrative: Gacy would receive $15,000 per year (the equivalent of $115,513 {{as of|2020|lc=y|df=US}}), plus a share of profits earned via the restaurants.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=50}} Following his obligatory completion of a managerial course, Gacy relocated to Waterloo with his wife later that year.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=23\u201325}}\n\n=== Waterloo Jaycees ===\nIn Waterloo, Gacy joined the local chapter of the Jaycees, regularly offering extended hours to the organization in addition to the 12- and 14-hour days he worked managing three restaurants. Although considered ambitious and something of a braggart by his colleagues in the Jaycees, he was highly regarded as a worker on several fund-raising projects. In 1967, he was named \"outstanding vice-president\" of the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=28}} At Jaycee meetings, Gacy often provided free fried chicken to his colleagues and insisted upon being given the nickname \"[[Colonel Sanders|Colonel]]\".{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=51}} The same year, Gacy served on the Board of Directors for the Waterloo Jaycees.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=51}}\n\nGacy's wife gave birth to two children: a son was born in February 1966, followed by a daughter in March 1967. Gacy himself later described this period of his life as \"perfect\", adding that he finally earned the long-sought approval of his father. On one occasion in July 1966, Gacy's parents paid a visit to Iowa, during which his father apologized privately to him for the physical and emotional abuse he had inflicted on him throughout his childhood, before proudly informing him: \"Son, I was wrong about you.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=53}}\n\nHowever, there was an unseemlier side of Jaycee life in Waterloo that involved [[wife swapping]],<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> [[prostitution]], [[pornography]], and drug use. Gacy was deeply involved in many of these activities and regularly cheated on his wife with local prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=263}} Much of this  happened at the Clayton House Motel. He is also known to have opened a \"club\" in his basement, where he allowed his employees to drink alcohol and play pool. Although Gacy employed teenagers of both sexes at his restaurants, he socialized only with his young male employees. Many were given alcohol before Gacy made sexual advances toward them, which, if rebuffed, he would claim were jokes or a test of morals.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}}\n\n====Assault of Donald Voorhees====\nIn August 1967, Gacy committed his first known [[sexual assault]] upon a teenage boy. The victim was 15-year-old Donald Voorhees, the son of a fellow Jaycee. Gacy lured Voorhees to his house with the promise of showing him pornographic films.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=55}} Gacy plied Voorhees with alcohol and persuaded the youth to perform oral sex upon him. Over the following months, several other youths were sexually abused in a similar manner, including one whom Gacy encouraged to have sex with his own wife before [[blackmail]]ing the youth into performing oral sex upon him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=265}} Gacy tricked several teenagers into believing he was commissioned with conducting homosexual experiments in the interests of \"scientific research\", for which each was paid up to $50.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=266}}\n\nIn March 1968, Voorhees reported to his father that Gacy had sexually assaulted him. Voorhees Sr. immediately informed the police and Gacy was arrested and subsequently charged with oral [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] in relation to Voorhees and the attempted assault of 16-year-old Edward Lynch.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=267}} Gacy vehemently denied the charges and demanded to take a [[polygraph test]]. This request was granted, although the results indicated Gacy was nervous when he denied any wrongdoing in relation to either Voorhees or Lynch.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n\nGacy publicly denied any wrongdoing and insisted the charges against him were politically motivated \u2013 Voorhees Sr. had opposed Gacy's nomination for appointment as president of the Iowa Jaycees.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=66}} Several fellow Jaycees found Gacy's story credible and rallied to his support. However, on May 10, 1968, Gacy was indicted on the sodomy charge.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=65}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = ''\"The most striking aspect of the test results is the patient's total denial of responsibility for everything that has happened to him. He can produce an 'alibi' for everything.

Schroeder agreed to lure Voorhees to a secluded spot, spray [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] in his face and beat him. Gacy promised to pay Schroeder $300 if he followed through on the plot. In early September, Schroeder lured Voorhees to an isolated county park, sprayed Mace supplied by Gacy into the youth's eyes, then beat him, all the while shouting that he was not to testify against Gacy at his upcoming trial.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=72}}<ref name=\"Michael H.

The New Evil: Understanding the Emergence of Modern Violent Crime (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 2019), pp. 196-203.</ref>\n\nVoorhees managed to escape, and immediately reported the assault to the police, identifying Schroeder as his attacker. Schroeder was arrested the following day. Despite initially denying any involvement, he soon confessed to having assaulted Voorhees, indicating that he had done so at Gacy's request. Gacy was arrested and additionally charged in relation to hiring Schroeder to assault and [[Witness tampering|intimidate]] Voorhees.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\nOn September 12, Gacy was ordered to undergo a [[Psychological evaluation|psychiatric evaluation]] at the Psychiatric Hospital of the State University of Iowa.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=270}} Two doctors had examined Gacy over a period of 17 days before concluding he had an [[antisocial personality disorder]] (a disorder which incorporates constructs such as [[sociopathy]] and [[psychopathy]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/antisocial-personality-disorder |title=Antisocial Personality Disorder |magazine=[[Psychology Today]]|publisher=Sussex Publishers|location=New York City |date=April 19, 2017 |accessdate=January 13, 2018 }}</ref> was unlikely to benefit from any therapy or medical treatment, and that his behavior pattern was likely to bring him into repeated conflict with society.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} The doctors also concluded he was mentally competent to stand trial.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}}\n\n=====Conviction and imprisonment=====\n[[File:John Wayne Gacy (mugshot).jpg|thumb|[[Mug shot]]s of Gacy, following his December 1968 sodomy conviction.]]\nUpon advice from his attorney, Gacy entered a plea of guilty to one count of sodomy in relation to the charges filed against him by Donald Voorhees. He pleaded not guilty to the other charges lodged against him by other youths at a formal [[arraignment]] held on November 7, 1968. Before the judge, Gacy contended that he and Voorhees had indeed engaged in sexual relations, yet he insisted Voorhees had offered his sexual services to him and that he had acted out of curiosity.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} His story was not believed. Despite his lawyers' recommendations for [[probation]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=84}} Gacy was convicted of sodomy on December 3, 1968,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=272}} and sentenced to 10 years at the [[Anamosa State Penitentiary]].{{sfn|Peck|Dolch|2001|p=260}} On the day Gacy was convicted and sentenced, his wife petitioned for [[divorce]],{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=85}} requesting possession of the couple's home, property, sole custody of their two children and subsequent [[alimony]] payments.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=40}} The Court ruled in her favor and the divorce was finalized on September 18, 1969. Gacy never saw his first wife or children again.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=274}}\n\nDuring his incarceration in the Anamosa State Penitentiary, Gacy rapidly acquired a reputation as a model prisoner.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=273}} Within months of his arrival, he had risen to the position of head cook. He also joined the inmate Jaycee chapter and increased their membership figure from 50 to 650 in the span of less than 18 months. He is also known to have both secured an increase in the inmates' daily pay in the prison mess hall{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=88}} and to have supervised several projects to improve conditions for inmates at the prison.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=89}} On one occasion, Gacy oversaw the installation of a [[miniature golf]] course in the prison's recreation yard.<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 62.</ref>\n\nIn June 1969, Gacy first applied to the State of Iowa Board of Parole for early release: this application was denied. In preparation for a second scheduled parole hearing in May 1970, Gacy completed 16 high school courses, for which he obtained his diploma in November 1969.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}}\n\nOn [[Christmas Day]] 1969, Gacy's father died from [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=275}} Gacy was not informed that his father had died until two days after his death.

However, within 24 hours of his release, Gacy relocated to Chicago to live with his mother.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=276}} He arrived in Chicago on June 19 and shortly thereafter obtained a job as a [[short-order cook]] in a restaurant.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=49}}\n\nOn February 12, 1971, Gacy was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage boy.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=95}} The youth claimed that Gacy had lured him into his car at Chicago's [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound bus]] terminal and driven him to his home, where he had attempted to force the youth into sex. This complaint was subsequently dismissed when the youth failed to appear in court. The Iowa Board of Parole did not learn of this incident (which violated the conditions of his parole) and eight months later, in October 1971, Gacy's parole ended.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=96}} The following month, records of Gacy's previous criminal convictions in Iowa were subsequently [[Record sealing|sealed]].{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=53}}{{efn|Gacy successfully hid his [[criminal record]] from friends, business associates and political acquaintances; they only learned the truth of his past after police had begun investigating him for his later murders.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=72}}{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=73}}}}\n\n===8213 West Summerdale Avenue===\nWith financial assistance from his mother, Gacy bought a house in Norwood Park Township, an [[unincorporated area]] of [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], a part of metropolitan Chicago. The address, 8213 West Summerdale Avenue, is where he resided until his arrest in December 1978 and where all his known murders were committed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=175}} He became active in his local community, and his neighbors considered him helpful; willing to loan his construction tools and plowing snow from neighborhood walks free of charge.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=86\u201387}} Between 1974 and 1978, he hosted annual summer parties attended by hundreds of people, including politicians.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=150}} \n\nIn August 1971, shortly after Gacy and his mother moved into the house, he became engaged to Carole Hoff, a [[divorcee]] with two young daughters. Hoff, whom he had briefly dated in high school, had been a friend of his younger sister. His fianc\u00e9e and stepdaughters moved into his home soon after the couple announced their engagement.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=55\u201359}} Gacy's mother subsequently moved out of the house shortly before his wedding, which was held on July 1, 1972.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=278}}\n\nOne week before Gacy's wedding, on June 22, he was arrested and charged with aggravated [[Sexual battery|battery]] and reckless conduct. The arrest was in response to a complaint filed by a youth, Jackie Dee, who informed police that Gacy, [[impersonating a police officer]], had flashed a sheriff's badge, lured him into his car, and forced him to perform oral sex.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=112}} These charges were later dropped after the complainant attempted to blackmail Gacy into paying money in exchange for dropping the charges.{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n===PDM Contractors===\nIn 1971, Gacy established a part-time construction business, PDM Contractors (PDM being the initials for 'Painting, Decorating, and Maintenance').{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=65}} With the approval of his probation officer, he was allowed to work evenings to commit to his employment contracts while working as a cook during the day. The business initially undertook minor repair work, such as sign-writing, pouring concrete, and redecorating, but later expanded to include projects such as interior design, [[remodeling]], installation, assembly, and [[landscaping]]. In mid-1973, Gacy quit his job as a cook in order that he could fully commit to his construction business.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=115}}\n\nMuch of the labor workforce consisted of high school students and young men.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=1}} In 1973, Gacy and a teenage employee of PDM Contractors traveled to [[Florida]] to view property Gacy had purchased. On the first night in Florida, Gacy raped the youth in their hotel room.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=118}} As a result, the youth refused to stay in the same hotel room as Gacy and instead slept on the beach. Upon returning to Chicago, he drove to Gacy's house and beat him in his yard. Gacy's mother-in-law stopped the assault and he drove away. Gacy explained to his wife that the attack happened because he had refused to pay the youth for poor quality painting work.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=117\u2013118}}\n\nAnother employee of Gacy's was 15-year-old Anthony Antonucci, whom he had hired in May 1975. In July 1975, Gacy arrived at Antonucci's home while the youth was alone, having injured his foot at work the day prior. Gacy plied him with alcohol, wrestled him to the floor and cuffed his hands behind his back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} The cuff upon Antonucci's right wrist was loose: Antonucci freed his arm from the [[handcuffs|handcuff]] after Gacy left the room. When Gacy returned, Antonucci\u2014a member of his high school wrestling team\u2014pounced upon him. He wrestled Gacy to the floor, obtained possession of the handcuff key and cuffed Gacy's hands behind his back. Gacy screamed threats, then calmed down and promised to leave if Antonucci removed the handcuffs. The youth agreed and Gacy left the house.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=122-123}} Antonucci later recalled that Gacy had told him as he lay prone on the floor: \"Not only are you the only one who got out of the cuffs; you got them on me.\"{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=123}}\n\nBy 1975, PDM Contractors was expanding rapidly; by his own later admission, he began working 12- and 16-hour days to fulfill agreed commitments upon an increasing number of contracts.

Gacy took McCoy\u2014who was traveling from [[Michigan]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]\u2014on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then drove him to his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station in time to catch his bus.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB36D062F6AA91B&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D | date=May 20, 1986 |title=Gacy Victim's Remains Going Home to Iowa |first=Andrew |last=Herrmann |newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> \n\nGacy claimed he woke early the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=348}} He then jumped from his bed and McCoy raised both arms in a gesture of surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=110}}{{efn|Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account}} He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him.

He repeatedly denied that he had anything to do with Piest's disappearance and accused the officers of harassing him because of his political connections or because of his recreational drug use. Knowing these officers were unlikely to arrest him on anything trivial, he openly taunted them by flouting traffic laws and succeeded in losing his pursuers on more than one occasion.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=89}}\n\nOn December 17, investigators conducted a formal interview of Michael Rossi, who informed them Gacy had sold Szyc's vehicle to him with the explanation that he had bought the car from Szyc because the youth needed money to move to California. A further examination of Gacy's Oldsmobile was conducted on this date. In the course of examining the trunk of the car, the investigators discovered a small cluster of fibers which may have been human hair. These fibers were sent for further analysis. That evening, officers conducted a test using three trained [[German shepherd]] [[Search and rescue dog|search dogs]] to determine whether Piest had been present in any of Gacy's vehicles.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}} The dogs were allowed to examine each of Gacy's vehicles, whereupon one dog approached Gacy's Oldsmobile and lay upon the passenger seat in what the dog's handler informed investigators was a \"death reaction\", indicating the body of Robert Piest had been present in this vehicle.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=93}}\n\nThat evening, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives to a restaurant for a meal. In the early hours of December 18, he invited the same officers into another restaurant where, over breakfast, he talked of his business, his marriages and his activities as a registered clown. At one point during this conversation, Gacy remarked to one of the two surveillance detectives: \"You know\u2026 clowns can get away with murder.\"{{sfn|Linedecker|1980|p=226}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=90}}\n\n===Civil suit===\nBy December 18, Gacy was beginning to show visible signs of strain as a result of the constant surveillance: he was unshaven, looked tired, appeared anxious and was drinking heavily. That afternoon, he drove to his lawyers' office to prepare a $750,000 [[civil suit]] against the Des Plaines police,{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=102}} demanding that they cease their surveillance. The same day, the serial number of the Nisson Pharmacy photo receipt found in Gacy's kitchen was traced to 17-year-old Kim Byers, a colleague of Piest at Nisson Pharmacy, who admitted when contacted in person the following day that she had worn the jacket and had placed the receipt in the [[Anorak|parka]] pocket just before she gave the parka to Piest as he left the store to talk with a contractor.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=110}} This revelation contradicted Gacy's previous statements that he had had no contact with Robert Piest on the evening of December 11.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|pp=116\u2013117}}\n\nThe same evening, Michael Rossi was interviewed a second time: on this occasion, Rossi was more cooperative, informing detectives that in the summer of 1977, Gacy had had him spread ten bags of [[Lime (material)|lime]] in the crawl space of the house.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}}\n\nOn December 19, investigators began compiling evidence for a second search warrant of Gacy's house. The same day, Gacy's lawyers filed the civil suit against the Des Plaines police. The hearing of the suit was scheduled for December 22. That afternoon, Gacy invited two of the surveillance detectives inside his house. On this occasion, as one officer distracted Gacy with conversation, another officer walked into Gacy's bedroom in an unsuccessful attempt to write down the serial number of the Motorola TV set they suspected belonged to John Szyc. While flushing Gacy's toilet, this officer noticed a smell he suspected could be that of rotting corpses emanating from a [[heating duct]]; the officers who previously searched Gacy's house had failed to notice this, as on that occasion the house had been cold.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nBoth David Cram and Michael Rossi were interviewed by investigators on December 20. Rossi had agreed to be interviewed in relation to his possible links with John Szyc as well as the disappearance of Robert Piest. When questioned by Kozenczak as to where he believed Gacy had placed Piest's body, Rossi replied: \"In the crawl space; he could have put him in the crawl space.\"<ref>Kozenczak (2012), p. 147</ref> A polygraph test showed his responses to questions to be inconclusive; however, upon his agreeing to a subsequent visual test in which a map of Cook County was divided into 12 [[Grid plan|grid sections]] numbered 1 to 12, with Gacy's home marked in the fourth grid section, Kozenczak noted an extreme response in Rossi's [[blood pressure]] when asked: \"Is the body of Robert Piest buried in grid number 4?\"<ref>Kozenczak, Joseph R.; Kozenczak, Karen M.

Cram then stated Gacy had grabbed a flashlight and immediately entered the crawl space to look for evidence of digging. When asked whether he had been to the crawl space, Cram replied he had been asked by Gacy to spread lime down there and also dug trenches upon Gacy's behest with the explanation they were for plumbing.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=143}} Cram stated these trenches were {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} wide, {{convert|6|ft|m|sp=us}} long and {{convert|2|ft|m|sp=us}} deep\u2014the size of graves.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=143\u2013145}}\n\n===Verbal confession===\nOn the evening of December 20, Gacy drove to his lawyers' office in [[Park Ridge, Illinois|Park Ridge]] to attend a pre-scheduled meeting he had arranged with them, ostensibly to discuss the progress of his civil suit. Upon his arrival, Gacy appeared disheveled and immediately asked for an alcoholic drink, whereupon Sam Amirante fetched a bottle of whiskey from his car. Upon his return, Amirante asked Gacy what he had to discuss with them. Gacy picked up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Daily Herald|Daily Herald]]'' from Amirante's desk; he pointed to a front-page article covering the disappearance of Robert Piest and informed his lawyers: \"This boy is dead. He's in a river.\"{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=136}}\n\nOver the following hours, Gacy gave a rambling confession that ran into the early hours of the following morning. He began by informing Amirante and Stevens he had \"been the judge ... jury and executioner of many, many people\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 127</ref> most of whom he stated were buried in his crawl space, and others in the Des Plaines River. Some victims he referred to by name; most he dismissed as \"[[Male prostitution|male prostitutes]]\", \"hustlers\" and \"liars\" to whom he gave \"the rope trick\". On other occasions, he stated he woke up to find \"dead, strangled kids\" on his floor, with their hands cuffed behind their back.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=171}} In reference to Robert Piest, Gacy stated that as he placed the tourniquet around his neck, that Piest was \"crying, scared\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 140</ref>\n\nAs a result of the alcohol he had consumed, Gacy fell asleep midway through his confession and Amirante immediately arranged a psychiatric appointment for Gacy at 9 a.m. that morning. Upon awakening several hours later, Gacy simply shook his head when informed by Amirante he had earlier confessed to killing approximately 30 people, stating: \"Well, I can't think about this right now. I've got things to do.\"<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\">Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150</ref> Ignoring his lawyers' advice regarding his scheduled appointment, Gacy left their office to attend to the needs of his business.<ref name=\"Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 150\" />\n\nGacy later recollected his memories of his final day of freedom as being \"hazy\", adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable and that, in his final hours of freedom, he intended to visit his friends and say his final farewells.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|pp=255\u2013258}} Upon leaving his lawyers' office, Gacy drove to a Shell gas station where, in the course of filling his rental car, he handed a small bag of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to the attendant, Lance Jacobson. Jacobson immediately handed the bag to the surveillance officers, adding that Gacy had told him: \"The end is coming (for me). These guys are going to kill me.\" Gacy then drove to the home of a fellow contractor, Ronald Rhode. Inside Rhode's living room, Gacy hugged Rhode before bursting into tears and saying: \"I killed thirty people, give or take a few.\" Gacy then left Rhode's home to meet with Michael Rossi and David Cram. As he drove along the expressway, the surveillance officers noted he was holding a [[Catholic rosary|rosary]] to his chin as he prayed while driving.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=152}}\n\nAfter talking with Cram and Rossi at Cram's home, Gacy had Cram drive him to a scheduled meeting with Leroy Stevens. As he spoke with his lawyer, Cram informed the officers that Gacy had earlier divulged to both himself and Rossi that the previous evening, he had confessed to his lawyers his guilt in over thirty murders. Upon concluding his meeting with his lawyer, Gacy had Cram drive him to Maryhill Cemetery, where his father was buried.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=259}}\n\nAs Gacy drove to various locations that morning, police outlined their formal draft of their second search warrant. The purpose of the warrant was specifically to search for the body of Robert Piest in the crawl space. Upon hearing radioed reports from the surveillance detectives that, in light of his erratic behavior, Gacy might be about to commit suicide, police decided to arrest him upon a charge of possession and distribution of marijuana{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=157}} in order to hold him in custody as the formal request for a second search warrant was presented. At 4:30 on the afternoon of December 21, the eve of the hearing of Gacy's civil suit, the request for a second search warrant was granted by Judge Marvin J. Peters.<ref>Kozenczak, (2012) p. 158</ref>\n\nArmed with the signed search warrant, police and evidence technicians quickly drove to Gacy's home. Upon their arrival, officers found that Gacy had unplugged his [[sump pump]] and that the crawl space was flooded with water; to clear the water they simply replaced the plug and waited for the water to drain. After it had done so, evidence technician Daniel Genty entered the {{convert|28|x|38|ft|adj=on}} crawl space,<ref>''Serial Killers''. p. 50.</ref> crawled to the southwest area, and began digging. Within minutes, he had uncovered [[putrefaction|putrefied]] flesh and a human arm bone. Genty immediately shouted to the investigators that they could charge Gacy with murder.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}} Genty added the remark: \"I think this place is full of kids.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=167}}\n\n==Arrest and confession==\n[[File:Gacycrawlspace.png|thumb|260px|Gacy's diagram of the burial locations of his victims within his basement and the investigators' subsequent diagram of the crawl space.]]After being informed that the police had found human remains in his crawl space and that he would now face murder charges, Gacy told officers he wanted to \"clear the air\",{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} adding that he knew his arrest was inevitable since he had spent the previous evening on the couch in his lawyers' office.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=170}}\n\nIn the early hours of December 22, 1978, Gacy confessed to police that since 1972, he had committed 25 to 30 murders, all of whom he falsely claimed were of teenage male [[Runaway (dependent)|runaway]]s or male prostitutes.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=174}} When asked where he drew the inspiration for the two-by-four attached with manacles at either end found at his house, Gacy stated he had been inspired to construct the device from reading about the [[Dean Corll|Houston Mass Murders]].{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=197}}{{efn|The Houston Mass Murders were a series of killings uncovered in 1973 in which Dean Corll, with two teenaged accomplices, had also used a wooden device (in their case a board fitted with handcuffs at each corner) to restrain their male victims throughout their sexual abuse and torture.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Man with the Candy: The Story of the Houston Mass Murders|last = Olsen|first = Jack|publisher = Simon and Schuster|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-439-12870-1 |page = 146}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = How to Make a Serial Killer: The Twisted Development of Innocent Children Into the World's Most Sadistic Murderers|last = Berry-Dee|first = Christopher|publisher = Ulysses Press|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-569-75943-1|location = |page = 202}}</ref> Gacy was likely inspired by press coverage relating to the Houston Mass Murders to construct this device to restrain his victims, and to dupe his victim into donning handcuffs, as several victims of the Houston Mass Murders had been.{{sfn|Berry-Dee|2009|p=138}}}} In January 1979, he had planned to further conceal the corpses by covering the entire crawl space with concrete.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=222}} \n\nWhen specifically questioned about Piest, Gacy confessed to strangling him at his house on the evening of December 11 after luring him there.

In response to questioning relating to whether Gacy appreciated the criminality of his actions, Rignall stated his belief that Gacy was unable to conform his actions to the conduct of law because of the \"beastly and animalistic ways he attacked me\".<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 290</ref> Upon specific cross-examination relating to the torture he had endured, Rignall vomited before he was excused from further testimony.{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=300}}\n\nOn February 29, Donald Voorhees, whom Gacy had sexually assaulted in 1967, testified to his ordeal at Gacy's hands, and that Gacy had subsequently paid another youth to beat him and spray Mace in his face so he would not testify against him.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}} Voorhees felt unable to testify, but did briefly attempt to do so, before being asked to step down.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=340}}\n\nRobert Donnelly testified the week after Voorhees, recounting his ordeal at Gacy's hands in December 1977. Donnelly was visibly distressed as he recollected the abuse he endured at Gacy's hands and came close to breaking down on several occasions. As Donnelly testified, Gacy repeatedly laughed at him,{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=333}} but Donnelly finished his testimony. One of Gacy's defense attorneys, Robert Motta, during Donnelly's cross-examination, attempted to discredit his testimony, but Donnelly did not waver from his testimony of what had occurred.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=345}}\n\nDuring the fifth week of the trial, Gacy wrote a personal letter to Judge Garippo requesting a [[mistrial]]{{sfn|Cahill|1986|p=342}} on a number of bases, including that he did not approve his lawyers' insanity plea approach; that his lawyers had not allowed him to take the witness stand (as he had desired to do); that his defense had not called enough witnesses, and that the police were lying about statements he had purportedly made to detectives after his arrest and that, in any event, the statements were \"self-serving\" for use by the prosecution.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|pp=350\u2013351}} Judge Garippo addressed Gacy's letter by informing him that under the law he had the choice as to whether he wished to testify, and he was free to indicate as much to the judge if he wished to do so.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=312}}\n\n===Closing arguments===\nOn March 11, final arguments from both prosecution and defense attorneys began, with the arguments concluding on the following day. Prosecuting attorney Terry Sullivan argued first, outlining Gacy's history of abusing youths, the testimony of his efforts to avoid detection and describing Gacy's surviving victims\u2014Voorhees and Donnelly\u2014as \"living dead\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}} Referring to Gacy as the \"worst of all murderers\",<ref>Amirante & Broderick 2011, p. 324</ref> Sullivan stated: \"John Gacy has accounted for more human devastation than many earthly catastrophes, but one must tremble. I tremble when thinking about just how close he came to getting away with it all.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=361}}\n\nAfter the state's four-hour closing, counsel Sam Amirante argued for the defense. Amirante argued against the testimony delivered by the doctors who had testified for the prosecution, repeatedly citing the testimony of the four psychiatrists and psychologists who had testified on behalf of the defense.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=360}} Amirante also accused Sullivan of scarcely referring to the evidence presented throughout the trial in his own closing argument, and of arousing hatred against his client. The defense lawyer attempted to portray Gacy as a \"man driven by compulsions he was unable to control\".{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=363}}\n\nIn support of these arguments, the defense counsel repeatedly referred to the testimony of the doctors who had appeared for the defense, in addition to the testimony of defense witnesses such as Jeffrey Rignall and Gacy's former business associate Mickel Reed\u2014both of whom had testified to their belief that Gacy had been unable to control his actions.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=359}} Amirante then urged the jury to put aside any prejudice they held against his client, and requested they deliver a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, adding that the psychology of Gacy's behavior would be of benefit to scientific research and that the psychology of his mind should be studied.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=361}}\n\n[[File:Kunkletrial.jpg|200px|thumb|William Kunkle, prosecutor at Gacy's trial, standing before a board depicting the 22 victims identified by February 1980.]]\nOn the morning of March 12,{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|p=364}} William Kunkle continued to argue for the prosecution. Kunkle referred to the defense's contention of insanity as \"a [[falsity|sham]]\", arguing that the facts of the case demonstrated Gacy's ability to think logically and control his actions. Kunkle also referred to the testimony of a doctor who had examined Gacy in 1968. This doctor had diagnosed Gacy as an [[antisocial personality]], capable of committing crimes without remorse. Kunkle indicated that had the recommendations of this doctor been heeded, Gacy would have not been freed.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}}\n\nAt the close of his argument, Kunkle pulled each of the 22 photos of Gacy's identified victims off a board displaying the images and asked the jury not to show sympathy but to \"show justice\". Kunkle then asked the jury to \"show the same sympathy this man showed when he took these lives and put them ''there!''{{-\"}}{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=368}} before throwing the stack of photos into the opening of the trap door of Gacy's crawl space, which had been introduced as evidence and was on display in the courtroom.

The following year, Gacy filed a further post-conviction petition, seeking a new trial. His then-defense lawyer, [[Richard Kling]], argued that Gacy had been provided with ineffective legal counsel at his 1980 trial.

Amirante has since stated that the primary inspiration for this legislation was the fact that at the time of the Gacy murders, there had been a 72-hour period which police in Illinois had to allow to elapse before initiating a search for a missing child or adolescent.{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\nThe Illinois Missing Child Recovery Act of 1984 removed this 72-hour waiting period. Other states across America subsequently adopted similar procedures and sensibilities, as a result of which a national network aimed at locating missing children was gradually formed. This national network has since developed into the Child Abduction Emergency\u2014commonly known today as an [[Amber Alert]].{{sfn|Amirante|Broderick|2011|page= 395}}\n\n==Potential accomplices and connections==\nOne of the first things Gacy told investigators after his arrest was that he had not acted alone in several of the murders: he asked whether \"my associates\" had also been arrested.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} When questioned as to whether these associates had participated directly or indirectly in the killings, Gacy replied, \"Directly.\"{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}}\n\nGacy specifically named Cram and Rossi as being involved in several of the murders.{{sfn|Sullivan|Maiken|2000|p=171}} In the 1980s, he also informed [[Robert Ressler]] that \"two or three\" PDM employees had assisted him in several murders.<ref>Whoever Fights Monsters {{ISBN|0-671-71561-5}} pp 341\u2013342</ref> Ressler replied that he believed there were unexplained avenues to the case and stated his belief that Gacy had killed more than 33 victims.

In the letter, he suggested that the board would be responsible for formulation of rules and regulations which will govern the international matches between the three members: Australia, England and South Africa. Bailey, wanted to host a Triangular Test series between the participant countries in South Africa. Australia rejected the offer. However, Bailey did not lose hope. He saw an opportunity of getting the three members together during the Australia's tour of England in 1909. After continued lobbying and efforts, Bailey was successful.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/the-icc/history-of-icc/1909-1963|title=International Cricket Council|website=www.icc-cricket.com|language=en|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 June 1909, representatives from [[English cricket team|England]], [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]] met at [[Lord's]] and founded the ''Imperial Cricket Conference''.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped.

This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays.

The independent ICC was funded initially by commercial exploitation of the rights to the World Cup of One Day International cricket. As not all Member countries had [[Double taxation|double-tax agreements]] with the United Kingdom, it was necessary to protect cricket's revenues by creating a company, ICC Development (International) Pvt. Ltd \u2013 known as IDI, outside the UK. This was established in January 1994 and was based in Monaco.\n\nFor the remainder of the nineties, the administration of IDI was a modest affair. But with the negotiation of a bundle of rights to all ICC events from 2001\u20132008, revenues available to International cricket and the ICC member countries rose substantially. This led to a growth in the number of commercial staff employed by IDI in Monaco. It also had the disadvantage that the Council's cricket administrators, who remained at Lord's, were separated from their commercial colleagues in Monaco. The Council decided to seek ways of bringing all of their staff together in one office while protecting their commercial income from tax.\n\nThe option of staying at Lord's was investigated and a request was made, through [[Sport England]], to the British Government to allow the ICC to have all its personnel (including those working on commercial matters) in London \u2013 but be given special exemption from paying UK [[corporation tax]] on its commercial income. The British Government was unwilling to create a precedent and would not agree to this request. As a consequence, the ICC examined other locations and eventually settled on the emirate of [[Dubai]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. ICC is registered in [[British Virgin Islands]]. In August 2005, the ICC moved its offices to [[Dubai]], and subsequently closed its offices at Lord's and Monaco. The move to Dubai was made after an 11\u20131 vote by the ICC's Executive Board in favour.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/4326601.stm | work=BBC News | title=Cricket chiefs move base to Dubai | date=7 March 2005}}</ref>\n\nWhile the principal driver of the ICC's move to [[Dubai]] was the wish to bring its main employees together in one tax efficient location, a secondary reason was the wish to move offices closer to the increasingly important new centres of cricketing power in South Asia. Lord's had been a logical venue when the ICC had been administered by the [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC) (a situation that lasted until 1993). But the growing power of India and Pakistan in world cricket had made the continued control of international cricket by a British private members club (the MCC) anachronistic and unsustainable. A direct consequence of the changes and reforms instituted in 1993 was eventually to be the move away from Lord's to a more neutral venue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/GD23Df05.html|title= Cricket's home moves closer to the money|work=[[Asia Times Online]]| date=23 April 2005|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Income generation==\n[[File:ICC logo 2010.jpg|thumb|Variant ICC Logo with old motto]]\nThe ICC generates income from the tournaments it organises, primarily the [[Cricket World Cup]], and it distributes the majority of that income to its members.

In contrast, event income was [[US$]]285.87 million, including $239 million from the 2007 World Cup. There was also investment income of $6.695 million in the period.{{Update inline|reason=There have been 3 World Cups since this date|date=July 2019}}\n\nThe ICC has no income streams from the bilateral international cricket matches ([[Test cricket|Test matches]], [[One Day International]] and [[Twenty20|Twenty20 Internationals]]), that account for the great majority of the international playing schedule, as they are owned and run by its members. It has sought to create other new events to augment its World Cup revenues. These include the [[ICC Champions Trophy]] and the [[ICC Super Series]] played in Australia in 2005. However these events have not been as successful as the ICC hoped. The Super Series was widely seen as a failure and is not expected to be repeated, and India called for the Champions Trophy to be scrapped in 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/cricket/biggest-player-in-the-game-flexes-muscle/2006/01/06/1136387626870.html | location=Melbourne | work=[[The Age]] | title=Biggest player in the game flexes muscle | date=7 January 2006}}</ref> The [[2004 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy 2004]] event was referred to in ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden 2005]]'' by the editor as a \"turkey of a tournament\" and a \"fiasco\"; although the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|2006 edition]] was seen as a greater success due to a new format.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=ICC President thanks India for \"outstanding\" ICC Champions Trophy | author=Murgatroyd, Brian / ICC|publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 6 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/267074.html |title=When the cricket did all the talking |publisher=ESPN | work=Cricinfo |date= 7 November 2006|accessdate=18 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ICC World Twenty20]], first played [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|in 2007]], was a success. The ICC's current plan is to have an international tournament every year, with a Twenty20 World Cup played in even number years, the World Cup continuing to be held the year before the [[Summer Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and the ICC Champions Trophy in the remaining year of the cycle. This cycle will begin [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|in 2010]], one year after the [[2009 ICC World Twenty20|2009 edition]].\n\n== Rules and regulation ==\nThe International Cricket Council oversees playing conditions, bowling reviews, and other ICC regulations. The ICC does not have copyright to the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'': only the MCC may change the Laws, though this is usually done in consultation with the game's global governing body. The ICC maintains a set of playing conditions for international cricket which make slight amendments to the Laws. They also have a \"[[ICC Code of Conduct|Code of Conduct]]\" to which teams and players in international matches are required to adhere. Where breaches of this code occur the ICC can apply sanctions, usually fines. In 2008, the ICC imposed 19 penalties on players.\n\n==Umpires and referees==\nThe ICC appoints international [[umpire (cricket)|umpires]] and [[Match referee]]s who officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. The ICC operates 3 panels of umpires: namely the [[Elite Panel of ICC Umpires|Elite Panel]], the [[International Panel of Umpires and Referees|International Panel]], and the [[ICC Associates and Affiliates umpire panel|Associates and Affiliates Panel]].\n\nAs of April 2012, the Elite Panel includes twelve umpires. In theory, two umpires from the Elite Panel officiate at every Test match, while one Elite Panel umpire stands in ODI matches together with an umpire from the International Panel. In practice, members of the International Panel stand in occasional Test matches, as this is viewed as a good opportunity to see whether they can cope at the Test level, and whether they should be elevated to the Elite Panel. The Elite Panel are full-time employees of the ICC, although do still, very occasionally umpire [[first-class cricket]] in their country of residence. The average, annual, officiating schedule for Elite Umpires is 8\u201310 Test matches and 10\u201315 ODIs, a potential on-field workload of 75 days plus travel and preparation time per year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Match officials|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003001326/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/42/match-officials|archivedate=3 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe International Panel is made up of officials nominated from each of the ten Test-playing cricket boards. The Panel Members officiate in ODI matches in their home country, and assist the Elite Panel at peak times in the cricket calendar when they can be appointed to overseas ODI and Test matches. International Panel members also undertake overseas umpiring assignments such as the ICC [[U/19 Cricket World Cup|Under 19 Cricket World Cup]] to improve their knowledge and understanding of overseas conditions, and help them prepare for possible promotion onto the Elite Panel. Some of these umpires also officiate in the Cricket World Cup. Each of the Test cricket boards nominates a \"third umpire\" who can be called upon to review certain on-field decisions through instant television replays. All third umpires are first-class umpires in their own county, and the role is seen as a step onto the International Panel, and then the Elite Panel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Emirates International Panel of ICC Umpires|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044124/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/88/match-officials/emirates-international-panel-of-icc-umpires|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe inaugural ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel was formed in June 2006.\nIt superseded the ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel, created in 2005, and serves as the pinnacle for umpires from non-Test playing Members, with selection achieved through each of the five ICC Development Program Regional Umpires Panels.\nMembers of the Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel are eligible for appointments to ODIs involving ICC Associate Members, ICC Intercontinental Cup matches and other Associate and Affiliate tournaments. High-performing umpires may also be considered for other ICC events, including the ICC U/19 Cricket World Cup, and could also be invited to be involved in the ICC Champions Trophy and ICC Cricket World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|title=ICC Associate and Affiliate International Umpires Panel|url=http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|publisher=www.icc-cricket.com|accessdate=18 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602070629/http://www.icc-cricket.com/about/89/match-officials/icc-associate-and-affiliate-international-umpires-panel|archivedate=2 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThere is also an [[Elite Panel of ICC Referees]] who act as the independent representative of the ICC at all Test and ODI matches. As of January 2009, it has 6 members, all highly experienced former international cricketers. The Referees do not have the power to report players or officials (which has to be done by the umpires), but they are responsible for conducting hearings under the ICC Code of Conduct and imposing penalties as required at matches, ranging from an official reprimand to a lifetime ban from cricket. Decisions can be appealed, but the original decision is upheld in most cases.\n\nThe Council failed to achieve consensus among the cricket playing nations \u2013 as of June 2012 \u2013 on the universal application of Umpire's Decision Review System, due to opposition by BCCI. It will continue to be applied subject to mutual agreement of the playing countries.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-06-27/top-stories/32440276_1_drs-ball-tracking-icc-executive-board| title= No decision yet on universal application of DRS\n|work=Times of India |date=27 June 2012}}</ref> In July 2012, ICC decided to send a delegation to show the ball tracking research done by Dr Ed Rosten, an expert on computer vision and technology, to BCCI to remove the scepticism about the use of DRS technology.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-07-10/top-stories/32617106_1_expert-in-computer-vision-icc-management-decision-review-system| title= Research on DRS to be shown to BCCI\n| date= 10 July 2012 |work=Times of India}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ireland and Afghanistan ICC newest full members amid wide-ranging governance reform|url=https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/422449|website=icc-cricket.com|publisher=ICC|accessdate=22 June 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Regional bodies==\nThese regional bodies aim to organise, promote and develop the game of cricket:\n* [[African Cricket Association]]\n* [[Asian Cricket Council]]\n* [[ICC Americas]]\n* [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]]\n* [[European Cricket Council]]\n\nTwo further regional bodies were disestablished following the creation of the African Cricket Association:\n* [[East and Central Africa Cricket Council]]\n* [[West Africa Cricket Council]]\n\n==Competitions and awards==\n{{Main|International cricket}}\n\n=== Rankings ===\n\n* [[ICC Test Championship]] (Notional league for Test rankings)\n* [[ICC ODI Championship]] (Notional league for ODI rankings)\n* [[ICC T20I Championship]] (Notional league for T20I rankings)\n\n=== Tournaments ===\nThe ICC organises various international '''''test''''', '''''one-day''''' and '''''Twenty20''''' cricket competitions:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Format\n! colspan=\"2\" |Men\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Women\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Youth\n|-\n!Full Members\n!Associates Members\n|-\n|[[Test cricket|Test]]\n|[[ICC World Test Championship]]\n|[[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] (defunct)\n|\n|\n|-\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[One-day cricket|One-day]]\n|[[Cricket World Cup|ICC Cricket World Cup]]\n|[[ICC World Cricket League]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Women's Cricket World Cup]]\n| rowspan=\"3\" |[[Under-19 Cricket World Cup|ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup]]\n|-\n|[[ICC Champions Trophy]] (defunct)\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's Championship]]\n|-\n|[[2020\u201322_ICC_Cricket_World_Cup_Super_League|ICC Cricket World Cup Super League]]\n|[[ICC Cricket World Cup League 2]]<br />[[ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Twenty20]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup]]\n|[[ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier]]\n|[[ICC Women's T20 World Cup]]\n|\n|}\nThe ICC has instituted the '''[[ICC Awards]]''' to recognise and honour the best international cricket players of the previous 12 months.

Following the corruption scandals by cricketers connected with the legal and illegal [[bookmaking]] markets, the ICC set up an Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) in 2000 under the retired [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the [[London Metropolitan Police]], [[Paul Condon, Baron Condon|Lord Condon]]. Among the corruption on which they have reported was that of former [[South African national cricket captains|South African captain]] [[Hansie Cronje]] who had accepted substantial sums of money from an Indian bookmaker for under-performing or ensuring that certain matches had a pre-determined result. Similarly, the former [[Indian national cricket captains|Indian captain]] [[Mohammad Azharuddin]] and [[Ajay Jadeja]] were investigated, found guilty of match-fixing, and banned from playing cricket (for life and for five years, respectively).  The ACSU continues to monitor and investigate any reports of corruption in cricket and protocols have been introduced, which for example prohibit the use of [[mobile telephone]]s in [[Changeroom|dressing room]]s.\n\nPrior to the 2007 [[Cricket World Cup]] ICC chief executive [[Malcolm Speed]] warned against any corruption and said that the ICC would be vigilant and intolerant against it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |work=The Jamaica Star |title=Speed warns against corruption during World Cup |date=13 February 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201121545/http://www.jamaica-star.com/thestar/20070213/sports/sports3.html |archivedate=1 February 2009  }}</ref>\n\nFollowing a [[Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal|scandal that occurred]] during the 2010 Pakistan tour of England, 3 Pakistani players, [[Mohammad Amir]], [[Mohammad Asif (cricketer)|Mohammad Asif]] and [[Salman Butt]] were found to be guilty of spot-fixing, and were banned for 5 years, 7 years and 10 years respectively.
