It is powered by a single [[Turbomeca Astazou]] [[turbine engine]] and was the first helicopter to feature a [[fenestron]] tail instead of a conventional [[tail rotor]]. It was designed by [[Sud Aviation]], later [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], and manufactured in France and the United Kingdom through a joint production agreement with [[Westland Aircraft]]. Further [[Licensed production|manufacturing under license]] was performed by [[SOKO]] in Yugoslavia and the [[Arab British Helicopter Company]] (ABHCO) in Egypt.\n\nSince being introduced to service in 1973, the Gazelle has been procured and operated by a number of export customers. It has also participated in numerous conflicts around the world, including by [[Syria]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], by [[Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan Civil War]] in the 1990s, and by numerous participants on both sides of the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. In French service, the Gazelle has been supplemented as an attack helicopter by the larger [[Eurocopter Tiger]], but remains in use primarily as a scout helicopter.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:A\u00e9rospatiale SA 340 Gazelle prototype in 1967, with a conventional tail rotor.jpg|thumb|The SA 340 Gazelle prototype in 1967 with its original conventional tail rotor]]\n\nThe Gazelle originated in a [[French Army]] requirement for a lightweight observation helicopter intended to replace the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]]; early on in the aircraft's development, the decision was taken to enlarge the helicopter to enable greater versatility and make it more attractive for the export market.<ref name=\"aidec77 p277-8\">''Air International'' December 1977, pp. 277\u2013278.</ref> In 1966, [[Sud Aviation]] began working on a light observation helicopter to replace its [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] with seating for five people.<ref name=\"Giorgio_p98\">Giorgio 1984, p. 98.</ref> \n\nEarly on, the Gazelle attracted British interest, which resulted in a major joint development and production work share agreement between Sud Aviation and Westland. The deal, signed in February 1967, allowed the production in Britain of 292 Gazelles and 48 [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma|Sud Aviation SA 330 Puma]] medium transport helicopters ordered by the British armed forces; in return Sud Aviation was given a work share in the manufacturing programme for the 40 [[Westland Lynx]] naval helicopters for the [[French Navy]]. Additionally, Westland would have a 65% work share in the manufacturing, and be a joint partner to Sud Aviation on further refinements and upgrades to the Gazelle. Westland would produce a total of 262 Gazelles of various models, mainly for various branches of the British armed forces, Gazelles for the civil market were also produced.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\">McGowen 2005, p. 125.</ref><ref name=\"field 585\">Field 1973, p. 585.</ref>\n\nThe first prototype SA 340 flew for the first time on 7 April 1967, it initially flew with a conventional tail rotor taken from the Alouette II.  The tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive [[fenestron]] tail on the second prototype.<ref name=\"Giorgio_p98\" /><ref name=\"mcgowen 124\"/> Four SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm [[Westland Aircraft|Westland Helicopters]]. On 6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight.<ref name=\"mcgowen 124\">McGowen 2005, p. 124.</ref> On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307&nbsp;km/h over 3 kilometres and 292&nbsp;km/h over 100 kilometres.<ref name=\"euro 1967\"/>\n\n[[File:1643BDF SA.341F Gazelle of the French Army's training school at Dax.jpg|thumb|French Army Gazelle in flight, 2004]]\n\nIn service with the [[French Army Light Aviation]] (ALAT), the Gazelle is used primarily as an anti-tank gunship (''SA 342M'') armed with [[HOT (missile)|Euromissile HOT missiles]].

Four versions of the Gazelle were used by the British forces. The ''SA 341D'' was [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] ''Gazelle HT.3'' in RAF service, equipped as a helicopter pilot trainer (hence HT). The ''SA 341E'' was used by the RAF for communications duties and [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] transport as the ''Gazelle HCC.4''. The ''SA 341C'' was purchased as the ''Gazelle HT.2'' pilot trainer for the Royal Navy; training variants have been replaced by the [[Eurocopter AS350|Squirrel HT1]].<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/squirrelht1.cfm \"Squirrel HT1.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617042748/http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/squirrelht1.cfm |date=17 June 2013 }} ''Royal Air Force'', Retrieved: 25 June 2013.</ref> The ''SA 341B'' was equipped to a specification for the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] as the ''Gazelle AH.1'' (from ''A''rmy ''H''elicopter Mark ''1'').\n\nThe Gazelle proved to be a commercial success, which led A\u00e9rospatiale, as Sud Aviation had become, to quickly develop and introduce the SA 342 Gazelle series, which was equipped with uprated powerplants. Licensed production of the type did not just take place in the UK, domestic manufacturing was also conducted by Egyptian firm [[ABHCO]]. [[Yugoslavia]]n production by [[SOKO]] reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\"/> As the Gazelle became progressively older, newer combat helicopters were brought into service in the anti-tank role; thus those aircraft previously configured as attack helicopters were often repurposed for other, secondary support duties, such as an [[Air Observation Post]] (AOP) for directing artillery fire, airborne [[forward air control]]ler (ABFAC) to direct [[ground-attack aircraft]], casualty evacuation, liaison, and [[Airborne radio relay|communications relay]] missions.<ref>Crawford 2003, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Westland SA-341D Gazelle HT3.jpg|thumb|Westland SA-341D Gazelle, 1975]]\nOriginally developed as a replacement to A\u00e9rospatiale's [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette]] helicopter, some aspects of the Gazelle such as its purpose and layout were based on the previous model. The Gazelle featured several important innovations. It was the first helicopter to carry a [[fenestron]] or fantail; this is a shrouded multi-blade [[torque|anti-torque]] device housed internally upon the vertical surface of the Gazelle's tail, which replaces a conventional tail rotor entirely.<ref name=\"mcgowen 124\"/> The fenestron, while requiring a small increase in power at slow speeds, has advantages such as being considerably less vulnerable and with low power requirements during cruise speeds, and has been described as \"far more suitable for high-speed flight\".<ref name=\"fricker 73\">Fricker 1973, p. 73.</ref><ref>Mouille, Rene'.

The difficulties experienced with the early design of the main rotor was one of the factors contributing to the lengthy development time of the Gazelle.<ref name=\"field 194\">Field 1973, p. 194.</ref> The individual rotor blades were crafted out of [[composite materials]], primarily composed of fiberglass, and had been designed for an extremely long operational lifespan; composite rotor blades would become a common feature of later helicopters.<ref name=\"fricker 73\"/><ref name=\"field 587\">Field 1973, p. 587.</ref> The main rotor maintains a constant speed in normal flight, and is described as having a \"wide range of tolerance\" for [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]].<ref name=\"fricker 76\">Fricker 1973, p. 76.</ref>\n\nThe Gazelle is capable of transporting up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space in the rear of the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four [[HOT (missile)|HOT]] (Haut subsonique Optiquement T\u00e9l\u00e9guid\u00e9 Tir\u00e9 d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin.<ref>Tucker 2010, p. 49.</ref> Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems.<ref>Fricker 1973, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well.<ref name=\"field 193\">Field 1973, p. 193.</ref> The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator [[Vought Helicopters]] at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\"/><ref name=\"field 589\">Field 1973, p. 589.</ref> Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.<ref name=\"field 588\">Field 1973, p. 588.</ref>\n\n[[File:SA-341G Gazelle.jpg|thumb|Civil SA 341G Gazelle]]\nThe Gazelle was the first helicopter to be adapted for single-pilot operations under [[instrument flight rules]]. An advanced [[wikt:duplex|duplex]] autopilot system was developed by [[Honeywell]] in order to allow the pilot to not be overworked during solo flights; the Gazelle was chosen as the platform to develop this capability as it was one of the faster and more stable helicopters in service at that point and had a reputation for being easy to fly.<ref>McClellan 1989, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> The docile flying abilities of the Gazelle are such that it has been reported as being capable of comfortably flying without its main hydraulic system operation at speeds of up to 100 knots.<ref name=\"fricker 75\">Fricker 1973, p. 75.</ref> The flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a [[throttle]] or a [[Trim (aircraft)|trimming]] system. Hydraulic servo boosters are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure.<ref name=\"field 589\"/><ref name=\"fricker 75\"/>\n\nThe Gazelle was designed to be easy to maintain, all [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] were life-rated without need for continuous application of lubrication and most fluid reservoirs to be rapidly inspected.<ref name=\"fricker 75\"/> The emphasis in the design stage of achieving minimal maintenance requirements contributed towards the helicopter's low running costs; many of the components were designed to have a service life in excess of 700 flying hours, and in some cases 1,200 flight hours, before requiring replacement.<ref>Field 1973, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref> Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle's subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.<ref name=\"field 194\"/><ref>Vuillet, A. and F.

Employed extensively in the gunship role by providing [[close air support]] to General [[Michel Aoun]]'s troops during the final phase of the [[Lebanese Civil War]], combat losses and maintenance problems reduced the Gazelle fleet to just four operational helicopters by 1990,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201423.html|title=World Air Forces 1983|page=359|publisher=flightglobal.com|accessdate=30 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521152445/http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%201423.html|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> with three of the machines reportedly being apprehended by the [[Lebanese Forces (militia)|Lebanese Forces militia]] who illegally sold them to [[Serbia]] in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://first.sipri.org/index.php?page=step2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918235038/http://first.sipri.org/index.php?page=step2 |archive-date=18 September 2008 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> \n\nAfter the War, the [[Lebanese Air Force]] Command made consistent efforts to rebuild its attack helicopter squadron with the help of the [[United Arab Emirates]] and nine SA 342L Gazelles formerly in service with the [[United Arab Emirates Air Force]] were delivered in 2007.<ref name=\"arab aero\">Lake, Jon.

It is powered by a single [[Turbomeca Astazou]] [[turbine engine]] and was the first helicopter to feature a [[fenestron]] tail instead of a conventional [[tail rotor]]. It was designed by [[Sud Aviation]], later [[A\u00e9rospatiale]], and manufactured in France and the United Kingdom through a joint production agreement with [[Westland Aircraft]]. Further [[Licensed production|manufacturing under license]] was performed by [[SOKO]] in Yugoslavia and the [[Arab British Helicopter Company]] (ABHCO) in Egypt.\n\nSince being introduced to service in 1973, the Gazelle has been procured and operated by a number of export customers. It has also participated in numerous conflicts around the world, including by [[Syria]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]], by [[Rwanda]] during the [[Rwandan Civil War]] in the 1990s, and by numerous participants on both sides of the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. In French service, the Gazelle has been supplemented as an attack helicopter by the larger [[Eurocopter Tiger]], but remains in use primarily as a scout helicopter.\n\n==Development==\n[[File:A\u00e9rospatiale SA 340 Gazelle prototype in 1967, with a conventional tail rotor.jpg|thumb|The SA 340 Gazelle prototype in 1967 with its original conventional tail rotor]]\n\nThe Gazelle originated in a [[French Army]] requirement for a lightweight observation helicopter intended to replace the [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III]]; early on in the aircraft's development, the decision was taken to enlarge the helicopter to enable greater versatility and make it more attractive for the export market.<ref name=\"aidec77 p277-8\">''Air International'' December 1977, pp. 277\u2013278.</ref> In 1966, [[Sud Aviation]] began working on a light observation helicopter to replace its [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette II|Alouette II]] with seating for five people.<ref name=\"Giorgio_p98\">Giorgio 1984, p. 98.</ref> \n\nEarly on, the Gazelle attracted British interest, which resulted in a major joint development and production work share agreement between Sud Aviation and Westland. The deal, signed in February 1967, allowed the production in Britain of 292 Gazelles and 48 [[A\u00e9rospatiale SA 330 Puma|Sud Aviation SA 330 Puma]] medium transport helicopters ordered by the British armed forces; in return Sud Aviation was given a work share in the manufacturing programme for the 40 [[Westland Lynx]] naval helicopters for the [[French Navy]]. Additionally, Westland would have a 65% work share in the manufacturing, and be a joint partner to Sud Aviation on further refinements and upgrades to the Gazelle. Westland would produce a total of 262 Gazelles of various models, mainly for various branches of the British armed forces, Gazelles for the civil market were also produced.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\">McGowen 2005, p. 125.</ref><ref name=\"field 585\">Field 1973, p. 585.</ref>\n\nThe first prototype SA 340 flew for the first time on 7 April 1967, it initially flew with a conventional tail rotor taken from the Alouette II.  The tail was replaced in early 1968 with the distinctive [[fenestron]] tail on the second prototype.<ref name=\"Giorgio_p98\" /><ref name=\"mcgowen 124\"/> Four SA 341 prototypes were flown, including one for British firm [[Westland Aircraft|Westland Helicopters]]. On 6 August 1971, the first production Gazelle conducted its first flight.<ref name=\"mcgowen 124\">McGowen 2005, p. 124.</ref> On 13 May 1967, a Gazelle demonstrated its speed capabilities when two separate world speed records were broken on a closed course, achieving speeds of 307&nbsp;km/h over 3 kilometres and 292&nbsp;km/h over 100 kilometres.<ref name=\"euro 1967\"/>\n\n[[File:1643BDF SA.341F Gazelle of the French Army's training school at Dax.jpg|thumb|French Army Gazelle in flight, 2004]]\n\nIn service with the [[French Army Light Aviation]] (ALAT), the Gazelle is used primarily as an anti-tank gunship (''SA 342M'') armed with [[HOT (missile)|Euromissile HOT missiles]]. A light support version (''SA 341F'') equipped with a 20&nbsp;mm cannon is used as well as anti-air variants carrying the [[Mistral (missile)|Mistral air-to-air missile]] (''Gazelle Celtic'' based on the ''SA 341F'', ''Gazelle Mistral'' based on the ''SA 342M''). The latest anti-tank and [[reconnaissance]] versions carry the Viviane [[thermal imaging|thermal imagery]] system and so are called ''Gazelle Viviane''.<ref>[http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/equipements/helicopteres-et-avions/gazelle-viviane-sa-342-m1 \"Gazelle viviane sa 342 M1.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918060812/http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/equipements/helicopteres-et-avions/gazelle-viviane-sa-342-m1 |date=18 September 2013 }} ''defense.gouv.fr'', Retrieved: 24 June 2013.</ref> The Gazelle is being replaced in frontline duties by the [[Eurocopter Tiger]], but will continue to be used for light transport and liaison roles.\n\nIt also served with all branches of the British armed forces\u2014the [[Royal Air Force]], [[Royal Navy]] (including in support of the [[Royal Marines]]) and the [[British Army]] in a variety of roles. Four versions of the Gazelle were used by the British forces. The ''SA 341D'' was [[British military aircraft designation systems|designated]] ''Gazelle HT.3'' in RAF service, equipped as a helicopter pilot trainer (hence HT). The ''SA 341E'' was used by the RAF for communications duties and [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]] transport as the ''Gazelle HCC.4''. The ''SA 341C'' was purchased as the ''Gazelle HT.2'' pilot trainer for the Royal Navy; training variants have been replaced by the [[Eurocopter AS350|Squirrel HT1]].<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/squirrelht1.cfm \"Squirrel HT1.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617042748/http://www.raf.mod.uk/equipment/squirrelht1.cfm |date=17 June 2013 }} ''Royal Air Force'', Retrieved: 25 June 2013.</ref> The ''SA 341B'' was equipped to a specification for the [[Army Air Corps (United Kingdom)|Army Air Corps]] as the ''Gazelle AH.1'' (from ''A''rmy ''H''elicopter Mark ''1'').\n\nThe Gazelle proved to be a commercial success, which led A\u00e9rospatiale, as Sud Aviation had become, to quickly develop and introduce the SA 342 Gazelle series, which was equipped with uprated powerplants. Licensed production of the type did not just take place in the UK, domestic manufacturing was also conducted by Egyptian firm [[ABHCO]]. [[Yugoslavia]]n production by [[SOKO]] reportedly produced a total of 132 Gazelles.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\"/> As the Gazelle became progressively older, newer combat helicopters were brought into service in the anti-tank role; thus those aircraft previously configured as attack helicopters were often repurposed for other, secondary support duties, such as an [[Air Observation Post]] (AOP) for directing artillery fire, airborne [[forward air control]]ler (ABFAC) to direct [[ground-attack aircraft]], casualty evacuation, liaison, and [[Airborne radio relay|communications relay]] missions.<ref>Crawford 2003, p. 35.</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Westland SA-341D Gazelle HT3.jpg|thumb|Westland SA-341D Gazelle, 1975]]\nOriginally developed as a replacement to A\u00e9rospatiale's [[A\u00e9rospatiale Alouette III|Alouette]] helicopter, some aspects of the Gazelle such as its purpose and layout were based on the previous model. The Gazelle featured several important innovations. It was the first helicopter to carry a [[fenestron]] or fantail; this is a shrouded multi-blade [[torque|anti-torque]] device housed internally upon the vertical surface of the Gazelle's tail, which replaces a conventional tail rotor entirely.<ref name=\"mcgowen 124\"/> The fenestron, while requiring a small increase in power at slow speeds, has advantages such as being considerably less vulnerable and with low power requirements during cruise speeds, and has been described as \"far more suitable for high-speed flight\".<ref name=\"fricker 73\">Fricker 1973, p. 73.</ref><ref>Mouille, Rene'.

The difficulties experienced with the early design of the main rotor was one of the factors contributing to the lengthy development time of the Gazelle.<ref name=\"field 194\">Field 1973, p. 194.</ref> The individual rotor blades were crafted out of [[composite materials]], primarily composed of fiberglass, and had been designed for an extremely long operational lifespan; composite rotor blades would become a common feature of later helicopters.<ref name=\"fricker 73\"/><ref name=\"field 587\">Field 1973, p. 587.</ref> The main rotor maintains a constant speed in normal flight, and is described as having a \"wide range of tolerance\" for [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]].<ref name=\"fricker 76\">Fricker 1973, p. 76.</ref>\n\nThe Gazelle is capable of transporting up to five passengers and up to 1,320 pounds of cargo on the underside cargo hook, or alternatively up to 1,100 pounds of freight in 80 cubic feet of internal space in the rear of the cabin. Armed variants would carry up to four [[HOT (missile)|HOT]] (Haut subsonique Optiquement T\u00e9l\u00e9guid\u00e9 Tir\u00e9 d'un Tube) wire-guided anti-tank missiles, or a forward firing 20mm cannon mounted to the fuselage sides with its ammunition supply placed in the cabin.<ref>Tucker 2010, p. 49.</ref> Various optional equipment can be installed upon the Gazelle, such as fittings for engine noise suppression, 53 gallon ferry tanks, a rescue winch capable of lifting up to 390 pounds, emergency flotation gear, particle filter, high landing skids, cabin heater, adjustable landing lights, and engine anti-icing systems.<ref>Fricker 1973, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> While the Gazelle had been developed under a military-orientated design programme, following the type's entry to service increasing attention to the commercial market was paid as well.<ref name=\"field 193\">Field 1973, p. 193.</ref> The type was marketed to civil customers; notably, civilian operator [[Vought Helicopters]] at one point had a fleet of at least 70 Gazelles.<ref name=\"mcgowen 125\"/><ref name=\"field 589\">Field 1973, p. 589.</ref> Civil-orientated Gazelles often included an external baggage access door mounted beneath the main cabin.<ref name=\"field 588\">Field 1973, p. 588.</ref>\n\n[[File:SA-341G Gazelle.jpg|thumb|Civil SA 341G Gazelle]]\nThe Gazelle was the first helicopter to be adapted for single-pilot operations under [[instrument flight rules]]. An advanced [[wikt:duplex|duplex]] autopilot system was developed by [[Honeywell]] in order to allow the pilot to not be overworked during solo flights; the Gazelle was chosen as the platform to develop this capability as it was one of the faster and more stable helicopters in service at that point and had a reputation for being easy to fly.<ref>McClellan 1989, pp. 30\u201331.</ref> The docile flying abilities of the Gazelle are such that it has been reported as being capable of comfortably flying without its main hydraulic system operation at speeds of up to 100 knots.<ref name=\"fricker 75\">Fricker 1973, p. 75.</ref> The flight controls are highly responsive; unusually, the Gazelle lacks a [[throttle]] or a [[Trim (aircraft)|trimming]] system. Hydraulic servo boosters are present on all flight control circuits to mitigate control difficulties in the event of equipment failure.<ref name=\"field 589\"/><ref name=\"fricker 75\"/>\n\nThe Gazelle was designed to be easy to maintain, all [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] were life-rated without need for continuous application of lubrication and most fluid reservoirs to be rapidly inspected.<ref name=\"fricker 75\"/> The emphasis in the design stage of achieving minimal maintenance requirements contributed towards the helicopter's low running costs; many of the components were designed to have a service life in excess of 700 flying hours, and in some cases 1,200 flight hours, before requiring replacement.<ref>Field 1973, pp. 193\u2013194.</ref> Due to the performance of many of the Gazelle's subsystems, features pioneered upon the Gazelle such as the fenestron would appear upon later Aerospatiale designs.<ref name=\"field 194\"/><ref>Vuillet, A. and F.

A lifelong music enthusiast, by the age of 16 he was DJing at many of the city's biggest nightclubs, as well as holding one of the original resident spots alongside [[King Britt]] at the legendary Back 2 Basics party. After graduating from high school, Cosmo moved to [[Brooklyn]] and began working at Eightball Records. During this time in New York he threw himself into the underground [[House music]] scene, surrounding himself with legends such as [[Frankie Knuckles]], [[Little Louie Vega]], [[David Morales]] and [[Armand Van Helden]]. At the same time, his diverse DJ sets quickly made him a fixture on the downtown scene alongside DJs like [[Mark Ronson]] and [[DJ Stretch Armstrong|Stretch Armstrong]]. After moving back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1996 to continue his college studies, he soon started a party named The Remedy with fellow DJ Rich Medina. Lasting until 2003, this party was at the center of Philadelphia's burgeoning [[Neo soul]] community, frequently hosting luminaries of the scene such as [[The Roots]] and [[J Dilla]].\n\nBy the early 2000s baker had moved back to [[Brooklyn]] and helped form the collective known as The Rub: a classics and hip-hop party, as well as a DJ crew and remix collective. The Rub crew was instrumental in helping propel the [[Mashup (music)|Mashup]] craze as well as helping to legitimize the style of \"open format\" DJing, made most famous by [[Adam Goldstein]] aka DJ AM and the Hollertronix crew of [[Diplo]] and Low Budget. In 2012, Baker left the group in mid-2012 to pursue solo opportunities.\n\nBaker frequently performs across The United States and Canada. He has also performed in Brazil, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark, Netherlands, England, Scotland, Germany, Belgium, France, Spain, Israel, United Arab Emirates, China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand, & New Zealand.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20061124074946/http://www.montrealmirror.com/2006/042006/music1.html\n*http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0420,caramanica,53538,22.html\n*http://brooklynradio.net/the-rub\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20080906005003/http://remixmag.com/artists/hiphop_R%26B/remix_cosmo_baker/\n*https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004456/http://www.soulstrut.com/ubbthreads/showflat.php?Cat=0&Board=crates&Number=904426&page=0&fpart=1\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Baker, Cosmo}}\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American hip hop record producers]]\n[[Category:American hip hop DJs]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Philadelphia]]\n[[Category:Remixers]]\n[[Category:Record producers from Pennsylvania]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Cosmo Baker\n| image               = Cosmo Baker1.jpg\n| caption             = Cosmo Baker \n| background          = non_performing_personnel\n| alias               = Cosmo Baker\n| origin              = [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States\n| instrument          =\n| genre               = [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[electronic music|Electronic]], [[Electronic dance music]], [[funk]], [[Disco]], [[Soul Music]]\n| occupation          = [[disc jockey|DJ]], [[record producer|producer]], [[remixer]]\n| years_active        = 1990\u2013present\n| label               = \n| associated_acts     = [[A-Trak]], [[Questlove]], [[Skratch Bastid]], The Rub, The Sheen Brothers\n| website             = [http://www.cosmobaker.com]\n}}\n\n'''Cosmo Baker''' is a [[Philadelphia]] based [[DJ]], music producer, and turntablist.\n\nBaker grew up in Philadelphia, and is the younger brother of acclaimed photographer [[Zoe Strauss]].

It stars [[Gena Rowlands]] as a philosophy professor who accidentally overhears the private analysis of a stranger, and finds the woman's regrets and despair awaken something personal in her.\n\n''Another Woman'' is viewed favorably by modern film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nMarion Post is a New York [[philosophy]] professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book.  Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet.\n\nHer work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis.  She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty.  Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way.\n\nShe comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.\n\nShe also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry.  She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a [[Klimt]] painting called \"[[Hope 1|Hope]]\".  Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an [[abortion]] years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore.\n\nShe leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura.  By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Marion Post\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Ken Post\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Hope\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Lydia\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Kathy\n* [[John Houseman]] as Marion's Father\n* [[Sandy Dennis]] as Claire\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Lynn\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Sam\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Laura\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Paul\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Larry Lewis\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Young Marion's Father\n}}\n\n==Background==\n''Another Woman'' borrows heavily from the films of Allen's idol [[Ingmar Bergman]], particularly ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', whose main character is an elderly professor who learns from a close relative that his family hates him. Allen also recreates some of ''Wild Strawberries'''s dream sequences, and puts Marion into a similar situation as Isak Borg: both characters reexamine their life after friends and family accuse them of being cold and unfeeling. This film has many of Allen's signature features, particularly the [[New York City]] setting; only a few scenes are shot outside the city, in the [[Hamptons]]. It also uses classical music ([[Claude Debussy]]'s orchestral arrangement of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnop\u00e9die|Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1]]'', renamed ''Gymnop\u00e9die No. 3''), and poetry ([[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\") to serve its narrative, as do earlier and later films such as ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', and ''[[Husbands and Wives]]''. It focuses primarily on [[upper middle class]] [[intellectual]]s, as nearly all of Allen's 1980s films do.\n\n==Reception==\n''Another Woman'' received modest praise from critics and holds a 64% positive \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 25 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Another Woman (1988) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_woman/ |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the film as \"one of [Allen's] shortest, least funny, and very best films\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/recommendations/10046469/Tim-Robey-recommends...-Another-Woman-1988.html| title=Tim Robey recommends...

It stars [[Gena Rowlands]] as a philosophy professor who accidentally overhears the private analysis of a stranger, and finds the woman's regrets and despair awaken something personal in her.\n\n''Another Woman'' is viewed favorably by modern film critics.\n\n==Plot==\nMarion Post is a New York [[philosophy]] professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book.  Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet.\n\nHer work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis.  She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty.  Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way.\n\nShe comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness.\n\nShe also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry.  She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a [[Klimt]] painting called \"[[Hope 1|Hope]]\".  Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an [[abortion]] years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore.\n\nShe leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura.  By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Gena Rowlands]] as Marion Post\n* [[Ian Holm]] as Ken Post\n* [[Mia Farrow]] as Hope\n* [[Blythe Danner]] as Lydia\n* [[Betty Buckley]] as Kathy\n* [[John Houseman]] as Marion's Father\n* [[Sandy Dennis]] as Claire\n* [[Frances Conroy]] as Lynn\n* [[Philip Bosco]] as Sam\n* [[Martha Plimpton]] as Laura\n* [[Harris Yulin]] as Paul\n* [[Gene Hackman]] as Larry Lewis\n* [[David Ogden Stiers]] as Young Marion's Father\n}}\n\n==Background==\n''Another Woman'' borrows heavily from the films of Allen's idol [[Ingmar Bergman]], particularly ''[[Wild Strawberries (film)|Wild Strawberries]]'', whose main character is an elderly professor who learns from a close relative that his family hates him. Allen also recreates some of ''Wild Strawberries'''s dream sequences, and puts Marion into a similar situation as Isak Borg: both characters reexamine their life after friends and family accuse them of being cold and unfeeling. This film has many of Allen's signature features, particularly the [[New York City]] setting; only a few scenes are shot outside the city, in the [[Hamptons]]. It also uses classical music ([[Claude Debussy]]'s orchestral arrangement of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Gymnop\u00e9die|Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1]]'', renamed ''Gymnop\u00e9die No. 3''), and poetry ([[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s \"Archaic Torso of Apollo\") to serve its narrative, as do earlier and later films such as ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]'', ''[[Crimes and Misdemeanors]]'', and ''[[Husbands and Wives]]''. It focuses primarily on [[upper middle class]] [[intellectual]]s, as nearly all of Allen's 1980s films do.\n\n==Reception==\n''Another Woman'' received modest praise from critics and holds a 64% positive \"Fresh\" rating on the review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] from 25 reviews.<ref>{{cite web |title=Another Woman (1988) |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/another_woman/ |accessdate=September 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nTim Robey of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described the film as \"one of [Allen's] shortest, least funny, and very best films\".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/recommendations/10046469/Tim-Robey-recommends...-Another-Woman-1988.html| title=Tim Robey recommends...

The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante.

CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good. I also think you'll drink yourself to death if you go through what you just went through again.\"<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" />\n\n=== Pre-production ===\n[[File:Robert Pattinson Premiere of The Lost City of Z at Zoo Palast Berlinale 2017 02.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Robert Pattinson]] (pictured in 2017) was cast to replace Affleck in May 2019]]\nBy May 2019, [[Robert Pattinson]], [[Nicholas Hoult]], [[Armie Hammer]], and [[Aaron Taylor-Johnson]] were on the shortlist to replace Affleck as Batman, Pattinson being the frontrunner.<ref name=\"PattinsonFrontrunner\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonEyed\" /><ref name=\"BatmanShortlist\" /> Reeves began to consider Pattinson early in development, but was unsure if he would want to take the part and did not contact him.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Pattinson's avoidance of \"big studio franchise films\" meant he had not appeared in any of rival [[Marvel Studios]]' projects, something that made him desirable to Warner Bros. Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thinking about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in future DC films.<ref name=\"DCFilmsFutureNov2019\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!-- CAST -->\n\n<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\">{{Cite web

Produced by [[DC Films]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]], it was developed as <!-- DO NOT REMOVE! Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU.

Reeves said in 2017 and 2018 that it will be set in the DCEU. Until we get further confirmation there is consensus that this is not to be removed.--> a [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film franchise]]. The film is directed by [[Matt Reeves]], who wrote the screenplay with [[Mattson Tomlin]]. It stars [[Robert Pattinson]] as Bruce Wayne / Batman, with [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]], [[Paul Dano]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Sarsgaard]], [[Jayme Lawson]], [[Andy Serkis]], and [[Colin Farrell]] rounding out the [[ensemble cast]].\n\nAfter he was cast as Batman in ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016), [[Ben Affleck]] began developing a DCEU Batman film with [[Geoff Johns]], and was attached to direct, write, produce, and star. In January 2017, Affleck stepped down from directing and writing after struggling with the story and so he could focus on playing Batman. Reeves took over directorial and scripting duties the following month and reworked the story to focus on a younger Batman, hoping to emphasize the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films. Affleck stepped down from starring in January 2019, and Pattinson was cast the following May. [[Principal photography]] began in [[London, England]] in January 2020, although production has been indefinitely suspended due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released on October 1, 2021.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Robert Pattinson]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]]:<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><br />A billionaire socialite and heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]] who dedicates himself to protecting [[Gotham City]] from its criminal underworld as a masked vigilante. Batman is around 30 years old in the film and neither an experienced superhero nor a beginning crime fighter.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> Director [[Matt Reeves]] stated: \"I just felt like well, what I'd love to do is to get a version of this Batman character where he's not yet fully formed. Where there's something to do in this context with who that guy would be in this world today, and to ground him in all of these broken ways. Because at the end of the day, this guy is doing all of this to deal with trauma in his past.\"<ref name=\"NerdistReeves\" /> Pattinson had avoided major franchises since his ''[[The Twilight Saga (film series)|Twilight]]'' films, wanting to avoid paparazzi and finding those roles dull, but signed on to play Batman because he found the character's lack of superpowers interesting.<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" /> He described his Batman as flawed, unlike traditional comic book characters,<ref name=\"PattinsonIGN\" /> and said his voice was inspired by his ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|Lighthouse]]'' costar [[Willem Dafoe]]'s voice in that film.<ref name=\"PattinsonDafoe\" /> In preparation, Pattinson trained in [[Brazilian jiu-jitsu]] with instructor and ''[[John Wick]]'' alumnus [[Rigan Machado]].<ref name=\"PattinsonJiuJitsu\" /> [[Christian Bale]], who played Batman in ''[[The Dark Knight Trilogy]]'' (2005\u20132012), supported Pattinson,<ref name=\"BaleSupport\" /> encouraging him to \"make [the role] his own\" and ignore critics.<ref name=\"BaleAdvice\" /> Pattinson also received advice from ''The Dark Knight Trilogy''{{'s}} director, [[Christopher Nolan]], whom he worked with on ''[[Tenet (film)|Tenet]]''.<ref name=\"NolanAdvice\" /> [[Ben Affleck]] portrayed the character in previous [[DC Extended Universe]] (DCEU) films<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian\" /> and was set to reprise his role before stepping down in January 2019.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n* [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]]:<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><br />Kravitz, who previously voiced the character in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'' (2017),<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> was chosen over a number of actresses, including [[Zazie Beetz]], [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Ella Balinska]], [[Ana de Armas]], and [[Alicia Vikander]].<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /><ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" /> Kravitz said that in contrast to Batman, who represents masculinity, Catwoman represents femininity, and \"femininity represents power, and I think it's a different kind of power than masculine power... slightly more complicated, and softer, too.\" Kravitz drew inspiration from [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], who portrayed the character in ''[[Batman Returns]]'' (1992).<ref name=\"KravitzVariety\" />\n* [[Paul Dano]] as [[Riddler|Edward Nashton / Riddler]]<ref name=\"DanoCast\" />\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]]:<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> The [[Gotham City Police Department]] commissioner and an ally of Batman.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /> Wright is the first actor of color to portray the character,<ref name=\"WrightGordon\" /> who was previously portrayed by [[J.

According to ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'', Affleck and Johns were expected to turn in a draft by October 2015, and that production would begin after Affleck finished work on ''[[Live by Night (film)|Live by Night]]''. The plot was to be set after the events of ''Batman v Superman'' and ''Justice League'';<ref name=\"July2015Deadline\" /><ref name=\"July2015Variety\" /> Affleck stated that the film would feature a \"mostly original\" story that used elements of comic books for inspiration, like what director [[Zack Snyder]] did with ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"AffleckMovieWeb\" /> According to [[Robert Richardson (cinematographer)|Robert Richardson]], who was attached as cinematographer early in development, Affleck's script was set in [[Arkham Asylum]] and dealt with [[insanity]].<ref name=\"RichardsonCollider\" />\n\nAffleck and Johns finished the first draft in March 2016, with Johns implying that the film would explore the death of [[Robin (character)|Robin]] which was hinted at in ''Batman v Superman''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /> At [[CinemaCon]] in April, Warner Bros. CEO [[Kevin Tsujihara]] confirmed the film was moving forward, with Affleck directing.<ref name=\"AffleckDirect\" /><ref name=\"AffleckDirect2\" /> In the following months, [[Jeremy Irons]] and [[Joe Manganiello]] were confirmed to appear\u2014with Manganiello playing [[Deathstroke]]<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" />\u2014and [[Jared Leto]] expressed interest in reprising his role as the [[Joker (character)|Joker]] from ''Suicide Squad''.<ref name=\"LetoAffleck\" /> Affleck revealed the title of the film was ''The Batman'' in October, and in December he said filming was on track to begin in mid-2017 for a release date in 2018.<ref name=\"TheBatmanTitle\" /> That month, a planned ''Justice League'' sequel was delayed to accommodate ''The Batman''.<ref name=\"JL2Delayed\" /> However, in January 2017, Affleck said the film had no script and that he may end up not directing it.<ref name=\"AffleckGuardian2\" /> While Affleck reaffirmed his commitment to direct in an appearance on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'',<ref name=\"AffleckKimmel\" /> by the end of the month he decided to step down; nonetheless, he stated he would still star and produce.<ref name=\"AffleckVariety\" /> By this point, [[Chris Terrio]] had turned in a rewrite of the script.<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" />\n\nAffleck initially cited his intentions to step down as director were to focus more on starring as Batman, later acknowledging that after various attempts to get the script where he wanted it, it simply became \"time to let someone else have a shot at it\".<ref name=\"AffleckExit\" /> Borys Kit of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' added that Affleck's film was \"sidelined\" after Warner Bros. began re-evaluating its approach to superhero films.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> [[Matt Ross (actor)|Matt Ross]], [[Ridley Scott]], and [[Fede \u00c1lvarez]] were considered to replace Affleck,<ref name=\"TerrioRewrite\" /><ref name=\"BatmanDirectorShortlist2\" /> before [[Matt Reeves]] joined to direct and produce in February 2017, and production was delayed until 2018 so he could complete ''[[War for the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref name=\"EverythingIGN\" /><ref name=\"ReevesDirector\" /> By March, Reeves had begun working on a completely new script, and would not meet potential actors until at least July.<ref name=\"Reeves/Film\" /> Reeves stated in an interview that the film would feature \"an almost-[[film noir|noir]] driven, detective version of Batman\" emphasizing the heart and mind of the character and taking inspiration from [[Alfred Hitchcock]].<ref name=\"ReevesNoir\" /><ref name=\"ReevesHitchcock\" /> Reeves also reworked the story to focus on Batman earlier in his career as a vigilante,<ref name=\"WBShiftTHR\" /> and said it would explore the detective aspect of the character to a greater extent than previous films.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> In August, Reeves said the film would still take place within the DCEU, but that \"it wouldn't be filled with [[Cameo appearance|cameos]] servicing other stories\". After Reeves began rewriting the script, Manganiello said he was unsure if Deathstroke would still appear.<ref name=\"ReevesDCEU\" />\n\nIn August 2018, Reeves appeared on a [[Television Critics Association]] panel and revealed many details about the film. He confirmed that ''The Batman'' would be an original, noir-driven story and not an origin story. He also revealed that the script was nearing completion and that the film's connections to the DCEU would be minimal but present.<ref name=\"ReevesUpdate\" /> Reeves said that he was \"working on getting our draft in the next couple of weeks and things are progressing,\" hoping to begin production in early-to-mid 2019.<ref name=\"ReevesDeadline\" /> Reeves submitted his first draft to Warner Bros. the following month.<ref name=\"ReevesFirstDraft\" /> Affleck's involvement was in doubt; Kim Masters of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' reported in July 2017 that Warner Bros. was looking to replace him.<ref name=\"AffleckReplace\" /> This was strengthened by further reports indicating that Reeves wanted a younger actor to play Batman. In August 2018, Affleck went to rehabilitation for alcohol abuse, casting further doubt that he would be reprising his role.<ref name=\"BIAffleck\" /> In January 2019, Warner Bros. set a June 25, 2021 release date for ''The Batman'', and Affleck confirmed that he was departing.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> Affleck revealed in 2020 that he stepped down due to a combination of factors, including his divorce from [[Jennifer Garner]], the tumultuous production of ''Justice League'', his personal lack of enjoyment in the role, and his alcohol problems.<ref name=\"AffleckDrop\" /><ref name=\"AffleckAnother\" /> \"I showed [my friend] the ''Batman'' script,\" he recalled. \"They said, 'I think the script is good.

Hoult was the other major contender for the role. While Hoult had appeared in the [[Marvel Comics]]-based ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' films, those did not take place in Marvel Studios' [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], and, as Kit noted, \"Hoult spent large chunks of those movies unrecognizable\" due to his makeup.<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" />\n\nReeves \"spent hours poring over the two actors' work\", and in April met with them both. By May 20, they were the only contenders, and both flew to [[Burbank, California]] for a [[screen test]]. Reeves, who \"wanted very specific things\" for the role, chose Pattinson,<ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /> and on May 31 Pattinson was cast.<ref name=\"PattinsonOfficial\" /><ref name=\"THRPattinsonHow\" /><ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> News of Pattinson's casting leaked shortly before he screen-tested, with Pattinson recalling: \"I was fucking furious. Everyone was so upset. Everyone was panicking from my team. I sort of thought that had blown up the whole thing.\" The casting was also met with backlash from Batman fans\u2014with some setting up a [[Change.org]] petition to have it reversed\u2014but Pattinson said he found responses \"less vitriolic than I was expecting [...] it's much more fun when you're an underdog. There's no expectation of you.\"<ref name=\"PattinsonFurious\" />\n\n[[Jeffrey Wright]] entered negotiations to play [[James Gordon (character)|James Gordon]] in September, and [[Jonah Hill]] entered negotiations to play either the [[Riddler]] or the [[Penguin (character)|Penguin]].<ref name=\"WrightTalks\" /><ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> In October, Wright was cast, but Hill exited negotiations.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /><ref name=\"JonahHillNo\" /> According to ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''{{'s}} Justin Kroll, Hill wanted to be paid $10 million\u2014more than double the amount that Pattinson would make<ref name=\"PattinsonPay\" />\u2014while Kit wrote that Warner Bros. and Hill could not decide which role he would take.<ref name=\"HillTalks\" /> Additionally, [[Zo\u00eb Kravitz]] was cast as [[Catwoman|Selina Kyle / Catwoman]] (reprising her role from 2017's ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]'')<ref name=\"KravitzCast\" /> following a screen test with Pattinson; [[Ana de Armas]], [[Ella Balinska]], and [[Eiza Gonz\u00e1lez]] also auditioned for the role.<ref name=\"KravitzTHR\" /> [[Paul Dano]] was cast as the Riddler shortly afterward.<ref name=\"DanoCast\" /> In November, [[Andy Serkis]], [[Colin Farrell]], and [[John Turturro]] were cast as [[Alfred Pennyworth]], the Penguin, and [[Carmine Falcone]], respectively.<ref name=\"SerkisCast\" /><ref name=\"FarrellTalks\" /><ref name=\"TurturroCast\" /> [[Jayme Lawson]] also joined the cast as a politician,<ref name=\"LawsonCast\" /> while [[Peter Sarsgaard]] was cast in December.<ref name=\"SarsgaardCast\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] began in January 2020 in [[London]],<ref name=\"SlashFilmJan2020\" /><ref name=\"ScreenRantJan2020\" /><ref name=\"SyfyWireJan2020\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Vengeance''.<ref name=\"NMEBatman\" /> Later in the month, Warner Bros. confirmed the main cast;<ref name=\"NewsaramaCast\" /> Gil Perez-Abraham was revealed to have a role in February, as were [[Charlie Carver|Charlie]] and [[Max Carver]] in March.<ref name=\"AbrahamCast\" /><ref name=\"CarversCast\" /> [[Greig Fraser]] is serving as cinematographer, reuniting with Reeves after they worked together on ''[[Let Me In (film)|Let Me In]]'' (2010).<ref name=\"FraserDP\" /> Scenes at a cemetery were filmed at the [[Glasgow Necropolis]] in mid-February.<ref name=\"SyfyWireFeb2020\" /> In March, Warner Bros. decided to move production to [[Liverpool]]<ref name=\"Liverpool2020\" /> due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" /> Unlike other studios with films in production, Warner Bros. did not plan to suspend shooting on ''The Batman'',<ref name=\"NoProductionHalt\" /><ref name=\"CoronavirusHandling\" /> but eventually did so for two weeks on March 14.<ref name=\"ShootingDelayed\" />\n\nOn March 25, Reeves announced that filming had been suspended indefinitely, with plans to resume once it was safe to do so.<ref name=\"DelayedIndefinitely\" /> ''Variety'' reported that production was unlikely to restart until around mid-May, and that the release date was expected to be delayed as a result.<ref name=\"Variety: PossibleDelay\"/> In April, Warner Bros. pushed the release date back until October 1, 2021.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" /> Reeves stated that around a quarter of the film had been shot prior to suspension and that he had been taking time to look over what had already been shot as well as thing about \"what's to come.\" Reeves said that he was not planning to perform script rewrites in the meantime, but was using the opportunity to explore the film's tone.<ref name=\"DeadlineDailies\" />\n\n== Music ==\nIn October 2019, Reeves announced that his frequent collaborator [[Michael Giacchino]] would be composing the film's score.<ref name=\"GiacchinoTHR\" /> Later that month, Giacchino confirmed that he had already finished writing the main theme because he was so excited to do so.<ref name=\"Giacchino/Film\" /> In film production, the music is not written until later, but since Giacchino wrote the music early on, he and Reeves were able to use it in promotional materials. Giacchino said he \"felt total freedom to do whatever I want. Matt always agreed, this is our Batman, this is our vision. In the same way that I always loved, what I still do about Batman comics and graphic novels is that each of these artists, each of these authors, they take their own crack at what they want this to be. It's their version of Batman.\"<ref name=\"GiacchinoCollider\" />\n\n== Marketing ==\nOn February 13, 2020, Reeves released \"moody, red-saturated\" test footage revealing Pattinson in his Batman costume and Giacchino's theme.<ref name=\"TestFootage\" /><ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /> The one-minute video generated a great deal of speculation and discussion of what approach the film would take in depicting Batman's world.<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> Chris Evangelista of ''[[/Film]]'' thought Pattinson \"looks much different than any onscreen Batman we\u2019ve seen before\",<ref name=\"/Film: Test\" /> while Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' identified the Batsuit's various references to previous incarnations. Newby also noted that the bat emblem on the costume's chest bore a resemblance to a pistol, and wondered if it was the pistol used to kill Batman's parents in [[Origin of Batman|his origin story]].<ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> The footage's use of the color red also led to discussion of how ''The Batman'' would differ tonally from previous Batman adaptations.<ref name=\"Deadline: Test\" /><ref name=\"THR: Test\" /> On March 4, 2020, Reeves released an image of the film's [[Batmobile]]. Dino-Ray Ramos of ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' opined that it \"seems sexier and more streamlined than Batmobiles from the past\" and \"gives off some serious [[James Bond]]-meets-''[[Fast and Furious]]'' energy and seems right on point for Pattinson.\"<ref name=\"Batmobile\" />\n\n== Release ==\n''The Batman'' is scheduled to be released by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] in the United States on October 1, 2021. It was originally scheduled to be released on June 25, 2021, but was pushed back as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.<ref name=\"NewReleaseDates\" />\n\n== Future ==\n''The Batman'' is intended to be the first of a Batman film trilogy.<ref name=\"PattinsonDeadline\" /> In November 2019, Kroll and Brent Lang of ''Variety'' reported that key cast members are signed on to reprise their roles in

The 1905 unrest in Russia led to the November Manifesto by the Czar, reintroducing freedom of the speech and press. With independence, freedom of speech and press was reaffirmed in the new constitution and generally respected. The major exception was wartime censorship during World War II.
