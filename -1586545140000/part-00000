He released his first mixtape, entitled ''The War Mixtape'', in 2004.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn 2006 he released his first album \u2013 ''It's Not a Rumour''. This proved to be his breakthrough album, containing the single \"Shakespeare\" \u2013 a reference to his self-proclaimed title \"The Black Shakespeare\" \u2013 which made the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist. His work was recognised with the [[Music of Black Origin Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best Hip Hop Act. Additionally in 2006, a mixtape, ''A Little Darker'', was released under the name \"Illa State\", featuring Akala and his sister, [[Ms. Dynamite]], as well as cameo appearances by many other artists.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAkala appeared for a live session on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] where he was challenged to come up with a rap containing as many Shakespeare play titles as he could manage. Akala wrote and performed a minute-long rap containing 27 different Shakespeare play titles in under half an hour. He later recorded these lyrics in the studio and turned it into the single \"Comedy Tragedy History\". In 2007 Akala followed up his breakthrough album with his ''[[Freedom Lasso]]'' album, containing the \"Comedy Tragedy History\" track. The song \"Love in my Eyes\" heavily sampled  [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' song \"[[Mittageisen|Love in a void]]\" with the voice of [[Siouxsie Sioux]]. 2008 saw ''The War Mixtape Vol. 2'' released along with an EP of acoustic remixes.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===2010\u2013present: ''Doublethink'', ''Knowledge Is Power'', and beyond===\n[[File:Akala Hull Jazz Festival 2015.jpg|thumb|Akala at the [[Hull Jazz Festival]] 2015.]]\nAkala's third album ''Doublethink'' was released in 2010, and holds a strong theme of [[George Orwell]]'s popular novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. ''Doublethink'' contained tracks such as \"Find No Enemy\" and \"Yours and My Children\" detailing some of the sights he saw on his trip to Brazil. In November 2010, Akala headlined a live performance at the [[British Library]], to launch the \"Evolving English\" exhibition and featured performances by British poet [[Zena Edwards]], comedian [[Doc Brown (rapper)|Doc Brown]] and British rapper/activist [[Lowkey]].\n\nThe live event also included Akala taking part in a hip-hop panel discussion alongside [[Saul Williams]], U.S professor [[MK Asante]] and Lowkey. Akala appeared on [[Charlie Sloth]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|Radio 1Xtra]] on 18 July 2011, performing \"Fire in the Booth\", and after the great reception it received (over 4,000,000 hits on YouTube<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOKgjoxoto|title=Akala \u2013 Fire in the Booth|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>), he returned again in May 2012 and provided \"Part 2\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJOp1CqzaSg|title=Akala \u2013 Fire in the Booth Part 2|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, Akala released a two-part mixtape, ''Knowledge Is Power'', containing \"Fire in the Booth\", and followed the release with a promotional tour in the autumn of 2012. In March 2013, Akala announced via his social media feeds that his fourth album, ''The Thieves Banquet'', would released in May 2013, pushing back the future EP ''The Ruin of Empires'' to later in 2013. His fourth album, ''[[The Thieves Banquet]]'', was released on 27 May 2013, including the songs \"Malcolm Said It\", \"Maangamizi\" and \"Lose Myself\" (feat.

In August 2012, he performed at the [[Outlook Festival]] and in November 2012, he performed at the second edition of NH7 Weekender music festival in Pune, [[India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Writing==\n\n===Natives===\nIn May 2018, Akala published ''Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire''. The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nAkala takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Akala asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]].

He wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"So why will I be voting now? Jeremy Corbyn. It's not that I am na\u00efve enough to believe that one man (who is, of course, powerless without the people that support him) can fundamentally alter the nature of British politics, or that I think that if Labour wins that the UK will suddenly reflect his personal political convictions, or even that I believe that the prime minister actually runs the country.

He released his first mixtape, entitled ''The War Mixtape'', in 2004.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nIn 2006 he released his first album \u2013 ''It's Not a Rumour''. This proved to be his breakthrough album, containing the single \"Shakespeare\" \u2013 a reference to his self-proclaimed title \"The Black Shakespeare\" \u2013 which made the [[BBC Radio 1]] playlist. His work was recognised with the [[Music of Black Origin Awards|MOBO Award]] for Best Hip Hop Act. Additionally in 2006, a mixtape, ''A Little Darker'', was released under the name \"Illa State\", featuring Akala and his sister, [[Ms. Dynamite]], as well as cameo appearances by many other artists.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nAkala appeared for a live session on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] where he was challenged to come up with a rap containing as many Shakespeare play titles as he could manage. Akala wrote and performed a minute-long rap containing 27 different Shakespeare play titles in under half an hour. He later recorded these lyrics in the studio and turned it into the single \"Comedy Tragedy History\". In 2007 Akala followed up his breakthrough album with his ''[[Freedom Lasso]]'' album, containing the \"Comedy Tragedy History\" track. The song \"Love in my Eyes\" heavily sampled  [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]' song \"[[Mittageisen|Love in a void]]\" with the voice of [[Siouxsie Sioux]]. 2008 saw ''The War Mixtape Vol. 2'' released along with an EP of acoustic remixes.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===2010\u2013present: ''Doublethink'', ''Knowledge Is Power'', and beyond===\n[[File:Akala Hull Jazz Festival 2015.jpg|thumb|Akala at the [[Hull Jazz Festival]] 2015.]]\nAkala's third album ''Doublethink'' was released in 2010, and holds a strong theme of [[George Orwell]]'s popular novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. ''Doublethink'' contained tracks such as \"Find No Enemy\" and \"Yours and My Children\" detailing some of the sights he saw on his trip to Brazil. In November 2010, Akala headlined a live performance at the [[British Library]], to launch the \"Evolving English\" exhibition and featured performances by British poet [[Zena Edwards]], comedian [[Doc Brown (rapper)|Doc Brown]] and British rapper/activist [[Lowkey]].\n\nThe live event also included Akala taking part in a hip-hop panel discussion alongside [[Saul Williams]], U.S professor [[MK Asante]] and Lowkey. Akala appeared on [[Charlie Sloth]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|Radio 1Xtra]] on 18 July 2011, performing \"Fire in the Booth\", and after the great reception it received (over 4,000,000 hits on YouTube<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEOKgjoxoto|title=Akala \u2013 Fire in the Booth|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>), he returned again in May 2012 and provided \"Part 2\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJOp1CqzaSg|title=Akala \u2013 Fire in the Booth Part 2|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, Akala released a two-part mixtape, ''Knowledge Is Power'', containing \"Fire in the Booth\", and followed the release with a promotional tour in the autumn of 2012. In March 2013, Akala announced via his social media feeds that his fourth album, ''The Thieves Banquet'', would released in May 2013, pushing back the future EP ''The Ruin of Empires'' to later in 2013. His fourth album, ''[[The Thieves Banquet]]'', was released on 27 May 2013, including the songs \"Malcolm Said It\", \"Maangamizi\" and \"Lose Myself\" (feat.

In August 2012, he performed at the [[Outlook Festival]] and in November 2012, he performed at the second edition of NH7 Weekender music festival in Pune, [[India]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Writing==\n\n===Natives===\nIn May 2018, Akala published ''Natives: Race and Class in the Ruins of Empire''. The book is part biography, and part polemic on race and class. The overall ideological framework of the book is a pragmatic, socialist-oriented Pan-Africanism that seeks the liberation of all humanity from oppression and exploitation. At the same time, it highlights the shared problems faced by African communities worldwide in a global system of imperialism.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\nAkala takes his escape from poverty not as proof of personal exceptionalism but of the vagaries and chaotic injustice of race, class and privilege. There is no blindness to the fact that a different fall of the dice might have led to a radically different outcome.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/natives-race-class-ruins-empire-akala-review</ref> Akala asserts that Britain is not a meritocracy where the barriers of race and class can be simply overcome through hard work and perseverance. He explains his success as the absurd and unexpected consequence of an unequal system that allows the rise of a few while leaving behind the many, no matter how brilliant they are. He points out several times that some of his friends could have been academics or scientists if the obstacles of structural racism and class oppression had not been there.<ref>http://socialistreview.org.uk/438/natives</ref>\n\nOne important idea that emerges from Natives is that, in spite of Britain's record of violence, slavery, genocide and colonialism, there is nonetheless a longstanding progressive trend that is \u201crooted in ideas of freedom, equality and democracy\u201d.<ref>https://www.invent-the-future.org/2018/05/book-review-akala-natives/</ref>\n\n==Political views==\nIn June 2016, Akala supported [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] leader [[Jeremy Corbyn]] after mass resignations from his cabinet and a [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|leadership challenge]].

He wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'': \"So why will I be voting now? Jeremy Corbyn. It's not that I am na\u00efve enough to believe that one man (who is, of course, powerless without the people that support him) can fundamentally alter the nature of British politics, or that I think that if Labour wins that the UK will suddenly reflect his personal political convictions, or even that I believe that the prime minister actually runs the country.

His murder and its aftermath were chronicled by [[Galbert of Bruges]].\n\n==Life==\nCharles was born in [[Denmark]], only son of the three children of [[Canute IV of Denmark|King Canute IV]] (Saint Canute) and [[Adela of Flanders]].{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|p=56}} His father was [[assassination|assassinated]] in [[Odense Cathedral]] in 1086,{{sfn|Hundahl|Kj\u00e6r|Lund|2016|p=87}} and Adela fled back to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], taking the very young Charles with her but leaving her twin daughters Ingeborg and Cecilia in Denmark. Charles grew up at the comital court of his grandfather [[Robert I of Flanders|Robert I]] and uncle [[Robert II of Flanders|Robert II]]. In 1092 Adela went to southern [[Italy]] to marry [[Roger Borsa]], duke of [[Apulia]], leaving Charles in Flanders.\n\nCharles travelled to the Holy Land in 1107 or 1108 with a fleet of English, Danes and Flemings.{{sfn|Galbert of Bruges|2013|p=25}}  This is possibly the fleet of [[Guynemer of Boulogne]], described similarly.  He was offered the crown of the Kingdom of Jerusalem but refused for reasons unknown.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1997|p=176}}\n\nIn 1111 Robert II died, and Charles' cousin [[Baldwin VII of Flanders|Baldwin VII]] became count. Charles was a close advisor to the new count (who was several years younger), who around 1118 arranged Charles' marriage to the heiress of the count of [[Amiens]], [[Marguerite of Clermont|Margaret of Clermont]], daughter of [[Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Renaud II, Count of Clermont]].{{sfn|Galbert de Bruges|2013|p=42}} The childless count Baldwin was wounded fighting at the Battle of Bures-en-Brai in September 1118, and he designated Charles as his successor before he died on 17 July 1119.{{sfn|Paul|2012|p=43-44}}\n\nIn 1125 Charles expelled [[Jews]] from Flanders, attributing their [[price gouging]] as a cause of additional suffering during the famine which afflicted his domains in that year.{{sfn|Deutsch|Bloch|1906}} During the famine, Charles distributed bread to the poor, and took action to prevent grain from being hoarded and sold at excessively high prices.{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|62}} Prodded by his advisors, he also began proceedings to reduce the influential Erembald family, which was heavily engaged in this activity, to the status of [[serfs]].

His murder and its aftermath were chronicled by [[Galbert of Bruges]].\n\n==Life==\nCharles was born in [[Denmark]], only son of the three children of [[Canute IV of Denmark|King Canute IV]] (Saint Canute) and [[Adela of Flanders]].{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|p=56}} His father was [[assassination|assassinated]] in [[Odense Cathedral]] in 1086,{{sfn|Hundahl|Kj\u00e6r|Lund|2016|p=87}} and Adela fled back to [[County of Flanders|Flanders]], taking the very young Charles with her but leaving her twin daughters Ingeborg and Cecilia in Denmark. Charles grew up at the comital court of his grandfather [[Robert I of Flanders|Robert I]] and uncle [[Robert II of Flanders|Robert II]]. In 1092 Adela went to southern [[Italy]] to marry [[Roger Borsa]], duke of [[Apulia]], leaving Charles in Flanders.\n\nCharles travelled to the Holy Land in 1107 or 1108 with a fleet of English, Danes and Flemings.{{sfn|Galbert of Bruges|2013|p=25}}  This is possibly the fleet of [[Guynemer of Boulogne]], described similarly.  He was offered the crown of the Kingdom of Jerusalem but refused for reasons unknown.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1997|p=176}}\n\nIn 1111 Robert II died, and Charles' cousin [[Baldwin VII of Flanders|Baldwin VII]] became count. Charles was a close advisor to the new count (who was several years younger), who around 1118 arranged Charles' marriage to the heiress of the count of [[Amiens]], [[Marguerite of Clermont|Margaret of Clermont]], daughter of [[Renaud II, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis|Renaud II, Count of Clermont]].{{sfn|Galbert de Bruges|2013|p=42}} The childless count Baldwin was wounded fighting at the Battle of Bures-en-Brai in September 1118, and he designated Charles as his successor before he died on 17 July 1119.{{sfn|Paul|2012|p=43-44}}\n\nIn 1125 Charles expelled [[Jews]] from Flanders, attributing their [[price gouging]] as a cause of additional suffering during the famine which afflicted his domains in that year.{{sfn|Deutsch|Bloch|1906}} During the famine, Charles distributed bread to the poor, and took action to prevent grain from being hoarded and sold at excessively high prices.{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|62}} Prodded by his advisors, he also began proceedings to reduce the influential Erembald family, which was heavily engaged in this activity, to the status of [[serfs]]. As a result, Fr. Bertulf FitzErembald, provost of the [[St Donatian's Cathedral|church of St. Donatian]], masterminded a conspiracy to assassinate Charles and his advisors.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:KareldeGoede.jpg|thumb|Relief of the murder of Count [[Charles the Good]], in 1127.]]\nOn the morning of 2 March 1127, as Charles knelt in prayer in the church of St. Donatian, a group of knights answering to the Erembald family entered the church and hacked him to death with [[Arming sword|broadswords]].{{sfn|Davies|1997|p=10}}{{sfn|Nicholas|1992|p=63}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe brutal and sacrilegious murder of the popular count provoked widespread public outrage, and he was almost immediately regarded popularly as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]], although not formally [[beatification|beatified]] until 1882.{{efn|At the [[Petit Palais]] Museum in Paris there is a remarkable painting of his funeral by the Belgian artist [[Jan van Beers (artist)|Jan van Beers]] (1852\u20131927).}}\n[[File:Sint-Salvatorskathedraal - Bruges - IMG 4774.JPG|thumb|Image of Charles I on his reliquary in the Sint-Salvatorskathedraal, Bruges, Belgium]]\nThe Erembalds, who had planned and carried out the murder of Charles, were besieged inside the castle of Bruges by the enraged nobles and commoners of Bruges and [[Ghent]].
