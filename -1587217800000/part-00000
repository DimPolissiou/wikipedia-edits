Prior to becoming an island it was connected to the African region. During the tertiary period this island was separated from the Asian mainland by a shallow sea. The Himalayan region and the greater part of Tibet lay under this sea. The movement of the Indian subcontinent into the Asian landmass created the great Himalayan ranges and raised the sea bed into what is today the plains of northern India.\n\nOnce connected to the Asian mainland, many species moved into India. The Himalayas were created in several upheavals. The Siwaliks were formed in the last and the largest number of fossils of the Tertiary period are found in these ranges.<ref name=\"prater\">Prater, S. H. (1971) The Book of Indian Animals.

Prior to becoming an island it was connected to the African region. During the tertiary period this island was separated from the Asian mainland by a shallow sea. The Himalayan region and the greater part of Tibet lay under this sea. The movement of the Indian subcontinent into the Asian landmass created the great Himalayan ranges and raised the sea bed into what is today the plains of northern India.\n\nOnce connected to the Asian mainland, many species moved into India. The Himalayas were created in several upheavals.

In favourable habitats and/or areas with low hunting pressure, subordinate foxes may be present in a range. Subordinate foxes may number one or two, sometimes up to eight in one territory. These subordinates could be formerly [[dominance (ethology)|dominant]] animals, but are mostly young from the previous year, who act as helpers in rearing the breeding vixen's kits. Alternatively, their presence has been explained as being in response to temporary surpluses of food unrelated to assisting reproductive success.

Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the [[Sexual behavior of wolves|burrows of wolves]], porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40\u201345\u00b0) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from {{convert|0.5|\u2013|2.5|m}}, rarely extending to [[ground water]]. The main passage can reach {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} in length, standing an average of {{convert|5|\u2013|7|m|abbr=on}}. In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may share their dens with woodchucks<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> or badgers.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.<ref name=\"dale\"/>{{rp|15\u201317}}> The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.<ref name=\"Holland 2011\">{{cite journal |author=Holland, Jennifer S. |title=40 winks? |journal=National Geographic |volume=220 |issue=1 |date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n===Body language===\n[[File:Lis (Vulpes vulpes) WOB.JPG|thumb|left|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an inquisitive posture]]\n[[File:Fox study 6.jpg|thumb|right|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an alert posture]]\nRed fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42\u201343}}\n[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]\nInquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/>\n\n===Vocalisations===\nRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five [[octave]]s, which grade into each other.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}} Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> The majority of sounds can be divided into \"contact\" and \"interaction\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n*'''Contact calls:''' The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \"''wow wow wow''\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of [[tawny owl]]s). The \"''wow wow wow''\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \"''wow wow wow''\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n*'''Interaction calls:''' When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], called \"gekkering\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n[[File:Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (W1CDR0001529 BD12).ogg|thumb|left|Fox barks, UK, January 1977]]\n\nAnother call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \"''waaaaah''\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet, hunting and feeding behaviour===\n[[File:Red fox with nutria.jpg|thumb|Red fox with [[coypu]]]]\nRed foxes are [[omnivore]]s with a highly varied diet.

Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Alexander Archipelago]] during the 1830s\u20131930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866.<ref name=rwf1987/> Where they are [[sympatry|sympatric]], Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on [[lemming]]s and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Red foxes are serious competitors of [[corsac fox]]es, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents.

Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites.<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> [[Grey fox]]es are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes.

In [[London]], [[arthritis]] is common in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> Foxes may be infected with [[leptospirosis]] and [[tularemia]], though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from [[listeriosis]] and [[intestinal spirochetosis|spirochetosis]], as well as acting as [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] in spreading [[erysipelas]], [[brucellosis]] and tick-borne [[encephalitis]]. A mysterious fatal disease near [[Lake Sartlan]] in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of [[encephalomyelitis]], which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' are known.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nRed foxes are not readily prone to infestation with [[flea]]s. Species like ''[[Spilopsyllus cuniculi]]'' are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like ''[[Archaeopsylla erinacei]]'' are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include ''[[Pulex irritans]]'', ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Paraceras melis]]''. [[Tick]]s such as ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' and ''[[Ixodes hexagonus|I.&nbsp;hexagonus]]'' are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The [[louse]] ''[[Trichodectes vulpis]]'' specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' is the most important cause of [[mange]] in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the [[epizootic]] phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection. Other endoparasites include ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'', ''[[Notoderes]]'', ''[[Otodectes cynotis]]'' (which is frequently found in the [[ear canal]]), ''[[Linguatula serrata]]'' (which infects the nasal passages) and [[ringworm]]s.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nUp to 60 [[helminth]] species are known to infect foxes in [[fur farm]]s, while 20 are known in the wild.

[[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name=\"potts\">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name=\"potts\"/>\n\n{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement.

Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166\u2013167}}\n\nRed foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens.

Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection.

In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.\n\n====Behaviour====\nUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Urban fox control====\nUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/> In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method.<ref name=Fieldsportschannel>{{cite web|title=Fieldsports Britain: How to call in great big bucks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3doTc9A31Y|publisher=Fieldsports Channel |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====\nIn January 2014 it was reported that \"Fleet\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county. He was still continuing his journey when the [[GPS]] collar stopped transmitting, due to suspected water damage.

Red foxes prefer to dig their burrows on well drained soils. Dens built among tree roots can last for decades, while those dug on the steppes last only several years.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may permanently abandon their dens during mange outbreaks, possibly as a defence mechanism against the spread of disease.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> In the Eurasian desert regions, foxes may use the [[Sexual behavior of wolves|burrows of wolves]], porcupines and other large mammals, as well as those dug by gerbil colonies. Compared to burrows constructed by Arctic foxes, badgers, marmots and corsac foxes, red fox dens are not overly complex. Red fox burrows are divided into a den and temporary burrows, which consist only of a small passage or cave for concealment. The main entrance of the burrow leads downwards (40\u201345\u00b0) and broadens into a den, from which numerous side tunnels branch. Burrow depth ranges from {{convert|0.5|\u2013|2.5|m}}, rarely extending to [[ground water]]. The main passage can reach {{convert|17|m|abbr=on}} in length, standing an average of {{convert|5|\u2013|7|m|abbr=on}}. In spring, red foxes clear their dens of excess soil through rapid movements, first with the forepaws then with kicking motions with their hind legs, throwing the discarded soil over {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} from the burrow. When kits are born, the discarded debris is trampled, thus forming a spot where the kits can play and receive food.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> They may share their dens with woodchucks<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> or badgers.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Unlike badgers, which fastidiously clean their earths and defecate in [[latrine (animal)|latrine]]s, red foxes habitually leave pieces of prey around their dens.<ref name=\"dale\"/>{{rp|15\u201317}}> The average sleep time of a captive red fox is 9.8 hours per day.<ref name=\"Holland 2011\">{{cite journal |author=Holland, Jennifer S. |title=40 winks? |journal=National Geographic |volume=220 |issue=1 |date=July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Communication==\n===Body language===\n[[File:Lis (Vulpes vulpes) WOB.JPG|thumb|left|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an inquisitive posture]]\n[[File:Fox study 6.jpg|thumb|right|A European red fox (''V. vulpes crucigera'') in an alert posture]]\nRed fox body language consists of movements of the ears, tail and postures, with their body markings emphasising certain gestures. Postures can be divided into aggressive/dominant and fearful/submissive categories. Some postures may blend the two together.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|42\u201343}}\n[[File:Red foxes fighting.jpg|thumb|A pair of Wasatch mountain foxes (''V. v. macroura'') squabbling]]\nInquisitive foxes will rotate and flick their ears whilst sniffing. Playful individuals will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, and raise their tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways.<ref name=rwf1987/> During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/>\n\n===Vocalisations===\nRed foxes have a wide vocal range, and produce different sounds spanning five [[octave]]s, which grade into each other.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}} Recent analyses identify 12 different sounds produced by adults and 8 by kits.<ref name=\"mammals-of-the-brit-isles\"/> The majority of sounds can be divided into \"contact\" and \"interaction\" calls. The former vary according to the distance between individuals, while the latter vary according to the level of aggression.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n*'''Contact calls:''' The most commonly heard contact call is a three to five syllable barking \"''wow wow wow''\" sound, which is often made by two foxes approaching one another. This call is most frequently heard from December to February (when they can be confused with the territorial calls of [[tawny owl]]s). The \"''wow wow wow''\" call varies according to individual; captive foxes have been recorded to answer pre-recorded calls of their pen-mates, but not those of strangers. Kits begin emitting the \"''wow wow wow''\" call at the age of 19 days, when craving attention. When red foxes draw close together, they emit trisyllabic greeting warbles similar to the clucking of chickens. Adults greet their kits with gruff huffing noises.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n*'''Interaction calls:''' When greeting one another, red foxes emit high pitched whines, particularly submissive animals. A submissive fox approached by a dominant animal will emit a ululating siren-like shriek. During aggressive encounters with conspecifics, they emit a throaty rattling sound, similar to a [[Ratchet (instrument)|ratchet]], called \"gekkering\". Gekkering occurs mostly during the courting season from rival males or vixens rejecting advances.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n[[File:Red Fox (Vulpes vulpes) (W1CDR0001529 BD12).ogg|thumb|left|Fox barks, UK, January 1977]]\n\nAnother call that does not fit into the two categories is a long, drawn out, monosyllabic \"''waaaaah''\" sound. As it is commonly heard during the breeding season, it is thought to be emitted by vixens summoning males. When danger is detected, foxes emit a monosyllabic bark. At close quarters, it is a muffled cough, while at long distances it is sharper. Kits make warbling whimpers when nursing, these calls being especially loud when they are dissatisfied.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|28}}\n\n==Ecology==\n===Diet, hunting and feeding behaviour===\n[[File:Red fox with nutria.jpg|thumb|Red fox with [[coypu]]]]\nRed foxes are [[omnivore]]s with a highly varied diet.

Arctic foxes generally escape competition from red foxes by living farther north, where food is too scarce to support the larger-bodied red species. Although the red species' northern limit is linked to the availability of food, the Arctic species' southern range is limited by the presence of the former. Red and Arctic foxes were both introduced to almost every island from the [[Aleutian Islands]] to the [[Alexander Archipelago]] during the 1830s\u20131930s by fur companies. The red foxes invariably displaced the Arctic foxes, with one male red fox having been reported to have killed off all resident Arctic foxes on a small island in 1866.<ref name=rwf1987/> Where they are [[sympatry|sympatric]], Arctic foxes may also escape competition by feeding on [[lemming]]s and flotsam, rather than voles, as favoured by red foxes. Both species will kill each other's kits, given the opportunity.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/> Red foxes are serious competitors of [[corsac fox]]es, as they hunt the same prey all year. The red species is also stronger, is better adapted to hunting in snow deeper than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} and is more effective in hunting and catching medium to large-sized rodents.

Red foxes will kill both species, and compete for food and den sites.<ref name=\"mammals-of-na\"/> [[Grey fox]]es are exceptional, as they dominate red foxes wherever their ranges meet. Historically, interactions between the two species were rare, as grey foxes favoured heavily wooded or semiarid habitats as opposed to the open and mesic ones preferred by red foxes.

A mysterious fatal disease near [[Lake Sartlan]] in the [[Novosibirsk Oblast]] was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of [[encephalomyelitis]], which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. Individual cases of foxes infected with ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' are known.<ref name=\"mammals-of-ussr\"/>\n\nRed foxes are not readily prone to infestation with [[flea]]s. Species like ''[[Spilopsyllus cuniculi]]'' are probably only caught from the fox's prey species, while others like ''[[Archaeopsylla erinacei]]'' are caught whilst travelling. Fleas that feed on red foxes include ''[[Pulex irritans]]'', ''[[Ctenocephalides canis]]'' and ''[[Paraceras melis]]''. [[Tick]]s such as ''[[Ixodes ricinus]]'' and ''[[Ixodes hexagonus|I.&nbsp;hexagonus]]'' are not uncommon in foxes, and are typically found on nursing vixens and kits still in their earths. The [[louse]] ''[[Trichodectes vulpis]]'' specifically targets foxes, but is found infrequently. The [[mite]] ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'' is the most important cause of [[mange]] in red foxes. It causes extensive hair loss, starting from the base of the tail and hindfeet, then the rump before moving on to the rest of the body. In the final stages of the condition, foxes can lose most of their fur, 50% of their body weight and may gnaw at infected extremities. In the [[epizootic]] phase of the disease, it usually takes foxes four months to die after infection.

[[Xenophon]], who viewed hunting as part of a cultured man's education, advocated the killing of foxes as pests, as they distracted hounds from hares. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] were hunting foxes by 80&nbsp;AD. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] in Europe, foxes were considered secondary quarries, but gradually grew in importance. [[Cnut the Great]] reclassed foxes as Beasts of the Chase, a lower category of quarry than Beasts of Venery. Foxes were gradually hunted less as vermin and more as Beasts of the Chase, to the point that by the late 1200s, [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] had a royal [[pack (canine)|pack]] of foxhounds and a specialised fox huntsman. In this period, foxes were increasingly hunted above ground with hounds, rather than underground with terriers. [[Edward of Norwich, 2nd Duke of York|Edward, Second Duke of York]] assisted the climb of foxes as more prestigious quarries in his ''[[The Master of Game]]''. By the [[Renaissance]], fox hunting became a traditional sport of the nobility. After the [[English Civil War]] caused a drop in deer populations, fox hunting grew in popularity. By the mid-1600s, Britain was divided into fox hunting territories, with the first fox hunting clubs being formed (the first was the [[Charlton Hunt Club]] in 1737). The popularity of fox hunting in Britain reached a peak during the 1700s.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|21}} Although already native to North America, red foxes from England were imported for sporting purposes to Virginia and [[Maryland]] in 1730 by prosperous tobacco planters.<ref name=\"potts\">{{cite book|last1=Potts|first1=Allen|title=Fox Hunting in America|date=1912|publisher=The Carnahan Press|location=Washington|pages=[https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott/page/7 7], 38|url=https://archive.org/details/foxhuntinginamer00pott|accessdate=9 July 2016}}</ref> These American fox hunters considered the red species more sporting than grey species.<ref name=\"potts\"/>\n\n{{quote|The grays furnished more fun, the reds more excitement.

Usually, lambs targeted by foxes tend to be physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as [[Scottish Blackface|Blackface]], are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as [[Merino]]. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making the lambs more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|166\u2013167}}\n\nRed foxes may prey on [[domestic rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s if they are kept in open runs or are allowed to range freely in gardens. This problem is usually averted by housing them in robust hutches and runs. Urban foxes frequently encounter cats and may feed alongside them. In physical confrontations, the cats usually have the upper hand. Authenticated cases of foxes killing cats usually involve kittens. Although most foxes do not prey on cats, some may do so, and may treat them more as competitors rather than food.<ref name=rwf1987/>{{rp|180\u2013181}}\n\n===Taming and domestication===\n{{Further|Domesticated red fox}}\n[[File:A tame fox cub at home with Mr and Mrs Gordon Jones, Talysarn (4478261667).jpg|thumb|right|Mr and Mrs Jones' son, Heddwyn, sitting on the kitchen table holding the cub]]\nIn their unmodified wild state, red foxes are generally unsuitable as pets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jones, Lucy |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/why-we-love-keeping-foxes-at-home---despite-the-smell/ |title=Why we love keeping foxes at home - despite the smell |website=Telegraph.co.uk |date=7 May 2016 |accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> Many supposedly abandoned kits are adopted by well-meaning people during the spring period, though it is unlikely that vixens would abandon their young.

Eventually, Belyayev's team selected only those that showed the most positive response to humans, thus resulting in a [[Domesticated silver fox|population of foxes]] whose behaviour and appearance was significantly changed. After about ten generations of controlled breeding, these foxes no longer showed any fear of humans, and often wagged their tails and licked their human caretakers to show affection. These behavioural changes were accompanied by physical alterations, which included [[piebald]] coats, floppy ears in pups, and curled tails, similar to traits that distinguish domestic dogs from wolves.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Trut, Lyudmila N. |url=http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215131052/http://www.hum.utah.edu/~bbenham/2510%20Spring%2009/Behavior%20Genetics/Farm-Fox%20Experiment.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 February 2010 |title=Early canid domestication: The farm-fox experiment |journal=American Scientist |volume=87 |issue=2 |year=1999 |pages=160\u2013169 |doi=10.1511/1999.20.813}}</ref>\n\n===Urban foxes===\n====Distribution====\nRed foxes have been exceedingly successful in colonising built-up environments, especially lower-density suburbs,<ref name=\"z132\"/> although many have also been sighted in dense urban areas far from the countryside.

In cities foxes may scavenge food from litter bins and bin bags, although much of their diet will be similar to rural foxes.\n\n====Behaviour====\nUrban red foxes are most active at dusk and dawn, doing most of their hunting and scavenging at these times. It is uncommon to spot them during the day, but they can be caught sunbathing on roofs of houses or sheds. Foxes will often make their homes in hidden and undisturbed spots in urban areas as well as on the edges of a city, visiting at night for sustenance. While foxes will scavenge successfully in the city (and the foxes tend to eat anything that the humans eat) some urban residents will deliberately leave food out for the animals, finding them endearing. Doing this regularly can attract foxes to one's home; they can become accustomed to human presence, warming up to their providers by allowing themselves to be approached and in some cases even played with, particularly young cubs.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Urban fox control====\nUrban foxes can cause problems for local residents. Foxes have been known to steal chickens, disrupt rubbish bins and damage gardens. Most complaints about urban foxes made to local authorities occur during the breeding season in late January/early February or from late April to August, when the new cubs are developing.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/> In the UK, hunting foxes in urban areas is banned, and shooting them in an urban environment is not suitable. One alternative to hunting urban foxes has been to trap them, which appears to be a more viable method.<ref name=Fieldsportschannel>{{cite web|title=Fieldsports Britain: How to call in great big bucks|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3doTc9A31Y|publisher=Fieldsports Channel |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> However, killing foxes has little effect on the population in an urban area; those that are killed are very soon replaced, either by new cubs during the breeding season or by other foxes moving into the territory of those that were killed. A more effective method of fox control is to deter them from the specific areas they inhabit. Deterrents such as creosote, diesel oil, or ammonia can be used. Cleaning up and blocking access to den locations can also discourage a fox's return.<ref name=\"Urban Foxes\"/>\n\n====Relationship between urban and rural foxes====\nIn January 2014 it was reported that \"Fleet\", a relatively tame urban fox tracked as part of a wider study by the [[University of Brighton]] in partnership with the BBC's ''[[Springwatch|Winterwatch]]'', had unexpectedly travelled 195 miles in 21 days from his neighbourhood in [[Hove]], at the western edge of [[East Sussex]], across rural countryside as far as [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], at the eastern edge of the county.
