The advantage of this design is the ability to use a smaller area, hence their popularity in car audio. The low frequency sound waves from the woofer are not reduced too much by the drivers in their path. Without time-alignment correction, the sound from the tweeter may arrive slightly before the sound from the woofer; this misalignment is not generally addressed in automobile sound systems.\n\nThis design was popularized in the 1970s with Electronic Industries, Inc. of [[South Holland, Illinois]] introducing the general concept in May 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37 |page=37 |title=Car Speakers Hi-Fi Emphasis\u2014Display Vital |work=Billboard |date=May 26, 1973 |volume=85 |number=21 |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref> and [[Jensen Loudspeakers]] introducing a retail model the next month.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 |page=68 |title=Car Stereo |work=Billboard |date=June 23, 1973 |volume=85 |number=25 |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref> This was followed by designs from Sparkomatic, [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] and others.\n\n==Professional audio==\n[[File:MCI equipped Studiod.jpg|thumb|right|The [[studio monitor]]s over the window are a pair of [[Universal Audio|UREI]] 813s, each of which has a 15-inch coaxial (below, with the blue rectangle), and a plain 15-inch driver (above).  The high frequency component of the coax is a horn, which includes blue foam rubber to attenuate undesired anomalies.]]\nCoaxial loudspeakers in professional audio enable sound from two drivers to come from one source. This characteristic allows a wider field of listening to a synchronized summation of speaker drivers than [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s containing physically separated drivers. As well, the pattern of response is symmetric around the axis of the loudspeaker.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Glen |authorlink=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers |publisher=Focal Press, Gulf Professional Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=0-240-80758-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0d9VA0lkogC&pg=PA516 |pages=514\u2013516}}</ref>\n\nSince the 1943 introduction of the [[Altec Lansing Duplex]] 601 coaxial driver, recording [[studio monitor]]s have often been coaxial loudspeaker designs. In 1945 the improved Altec 604<ref>[http://www.audioheritage.org/html/profiles/altec/duplex.htm Audioheritage.

The Altec 604 combined a {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} woofer with a [[compression driver]] attached to a [[Horn loudspeaker|horn]] to carry the high frequencies. The Tannoy also used a 15-inch woofer and a compression driver for high frequencies, but differed in that the woofer itself served as the final horn flare for the high frequency driver.<ref name=Borwick>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DeZqnsjetgC&pg=PA474 |pages=474\u2013476 |title=Loudspeaker and headphone handbook |last=Borwick |first=John |publisher=Focal Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-240-51578-1 |edition=3}}</ref> Thus, its output pattern was radially symmetric, not just mirror-image symmetric as in the Altec.

The advantage of this design is the ability to use a smaller area, hence their popularity in car audio. The low frequency sound waves from the woofer are not reduced too much by the drivers in their path. Without time-alignment correction, the sound from the tweeter may arrive slightly before the sound from the woofer; this misalignment is not generally addressed in automobile sound systems.\n\nThis design was popularized in the 1970s with Electronic Industries, Inc. of [[South Holland, Illinois]] introducing the general concept in May 1973,<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HgkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA37 |page=37 |title=Car Speakers Hi-Fi Emphasis\u2014Display Vital |work=Billboard |date=May 26, 1973 |volume=85 |number=21 |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref> and [[Jensen Loudspeakers]] introducing a retail model the next month.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68 |page=68 |title=Car Stereo |work=Billboard |date=June 23, 1973 |volume=85 |number=25 |issn=0006-2510 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref> This was followed by designs from Sparkomatic, [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Infinity (audio)|Infinity]] and others.\n\n==Professional audio==\n[[File:MCI equipped Studiod.jpg|thumb|right|The [[studio monitor]]s over the window are a pair of [[Universal Audio|UREI]] 813s, each of which has a 15-inch coaxial (below, with the blue rectangle), and a plain 15-inch driver (above).  The high frequency component of the coax is a horn, which includes blue foam rubber to attenuate undesired anomalies.]]\nCoaxial loudspeakers in professional audio enable sound from two drivers to come from one source. This characteristic allows a wider field of listening to a synchronized summation of speaker drivers than [[loudspeaker enclosure]]s containing physically separated drivers.

The Altec 604 combined a {{convert|15|in|adj=on}} woofer with a [[compression driver]] attached to a [[Horn loudspeaker|horn]] to carry the high frequencies. The Tannoy also used a 15-inch woofer and a compression driver for high frequencies, but differed in that the woofer itself served as the final horn flare for the high frequency driver.<ref name=Borwick>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9DeZqnsjetgC&pg=PA474 |pages=474\u2013476 |title=Loudspeaker and headphone handbook |last=Borwick |first=John |publisher=Focal Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-240-51578-1 |edition=3}}</ref> Thus, its output pattern was radially symmetric, not just mirror-image symmetric as in the Altec.

It is also thought to be the smallest racecourse of significance in England at 1 mile and 1 furlong (1.8&nbsp;km) long.\n\n==History==\nThe {{convert|65|acre|m2|sing=on}} racecourse lies on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The site was once a harbour during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of the city during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but was closed as the river [[silt]]ed up thus making navigation impossible. Towards the centre of the in field is a raised mound which is decorated by a small cross known as a \"[[rood]]\". It is from this that the race course derives the name \"Roodee\"; Roodee is a corruption of \"Rood Eye\", meaning \"The Island of the Cross\".\n\nAccording to legend the cross marks the burial site of a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] sentenced to hang after causing the death of Lady Trawst, the wife of the Governor of Hawarden. The legend states that she had gone to church to pray for rain but when her prayers were answered by a tremendous thunderstorm the statue was loosened and fell, killing her. As a holy object, hanging or burning the statue would be sacrilege so the statue was left by the banks of the river and the tide carried it down to Chester. The statue was found guilty by a jury of 12 men. If the legend is true, then this is the first recorded case of a jury being used in a court.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Feud, Glorious Feud|series=Tony Robinson's Crime and Punishment|airdate=2008-06-01|season=1}}</ref>\n\nIn an alternate version of the legend, the statue was instead carried to St John's Church. An ancient statue of the Virgin was recorded at the time of the reformation but may not be the same one. The statue was thrown down as a relic of popery, used as a whipping post for scholars and burned.\n\nThe site was formerly the home of the original [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]], temporarily banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] but finally abolished in 1677\n\nThe east of the race course abuts directly onto Chester's ancient [[city walls]] which were once used to moor [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trading vessels, before the course of the river changed. Spectators can watch races for free from the walls which offer a clear view of the whole circuit. The [[Grosvenor Bridge (Chester)|Grosvenor Bridge]], at one time the longest single arch bridge in the world, passes over the south-eastern corner. The north of the course is bordered by a long railway bridge carrying the [[North Wales Coast Line]] over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The course is overlooked from the opposite bank of the river by the [[mansions]] of [[Curzon Park]], which can be seen dominating the skyline from any of the three grandstands.\n\n==Horseracing==\n[[File:RoodeeAerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Racecourse.]]\nThe Chester Racecourse site was home to the famous and bloody Goteddsday [[Medi\u00e6val football|football]] match. The game was very violent and, in 1533, banned by the city, to be replaced in 1539 by horse racing. The first recorded race was held on 9 February 1539 (although other sources list this as 10 January 1511{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=108}}) with the consent of the Mayor Henry Gee, whose name led to the use of the term \"gee-gee\" for horses.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Races originally took place on Goteddsday ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) until 1609, and thereafter on [[St George's Day]], both major festivals during the [[medieval]] period. Victors were awarded the \"Chester Bells\", a set of decorative [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] for decorating the horse's [[bridle]], and from 1744 the \"[[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Grosvenor]] Gold Cup\", a small [[Cup|tumbler]] made from solid gold (later silver). In 1745, the meeting became a four-day one, with one race on each day.{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=110}}  In 1766 a May Festival was introduced, and in 1824, the Tradesmen's Cup Race (the predecessor to the [[Chester Cup]]) was also introduced.\n\nThe racecourse was at that point still just an open field, with the first [[grandstand]] finished in 1817 and the first admittance fee not being taken until 1897. The stand was rebuilt in 1899\u20131900, and was replaced after being destroyed by [[arson]] in 1985.\n\n==Today==\nThe racecourse's position in the city makes race meetings at Chester very popular as it is only a very short stroll to all the hotels, bars, shopping and restaurants. The racecourse itself is just over {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} long, flat and raced anti-clockwise or left-handed. The main characteristic of the course is the very short straight (239 yards). As such, long-strided horses, which perform better on straights, are at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nOn 19 August 2006, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Face to Face Tour]] supporting their album [[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]].\n\nIn 2008, a restaurant opened at the racecourse, named \"1539\", after the first year that horse racing took place in Chester.<ref>[http://www.restaurant1539.co.uk/ 1539 Restaurant]</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a new pub and restaurant called The White Horse was opened in the centre of the Course.\n\nThe main race meetings at Chester were often broadcast on [[Channel 4 Racing]] until 2016 and have been broadcast on [[ITV Racing]] since 2017.\n\nIn May 2012, all former [[The Tote|Tote]] betting positions were replaced by the racecourse's own in-house chesterBET betting system.\n\nThe Clerk of the Course is Andrew Morris, who is also Clerk of the Course for sister course [[Bangor-on-Dee racecourse|Bangor-on-Dee]], which is a [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] jumps course.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Notable races==\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"width:70px\" |Month\n! style=\"width:80px\" |Meeting\n! style=\"width:80px\" |DOW\n!

known as '''the Roodee''', is officially recognised by the Guinness World Records as the oldest [[racecourse]] still in operation [https://www.racingpost.com/news/chester-honoured-with-guinness-title-of-oldest-racecourse-still-in-operation/376566].<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite

Telegraph]]|author=Marcus Armytage|date=6 May 2008|accessdate=9 May 2008}}</ref> [[Horse racing]] at [[Chester]] dates back to the early sixteenth century, with 1539 cited as the year racing began. It is also thought to be the smallest racecourse of significance in England at 1 mile and 1 furlong (1.8&nbsp;km) long.\n\n==History==\nThe {{convert|65|acre|m2|sing=on}} racecourse lies on the banks of the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The site was once a harbour during the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] settlement of the city during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], but was closed as the river [[silt]]ed up thus making navigation impossible. Towards the centre of the in field is a raised mound which is decorated by a small cross known as a \"[[rood]]\". It is from this that the race course derives the name \"Roodee\"; Roodee is a corruption of \"Rood Eye\", meaning \"The Island of the Cross\".\n\nAccording to legend the cross marks the burial site of a statue of the [[Virgin Mary]] sentenced to hang after causing the death of Lady Trawst, the wife of the Governor of Hawarden. The legend states that she had gone to church to pray for rain but when her prayers were answered by a tremendous thunderstorm the statue was loosened and fell, killing her. As a holy object, hanging or burning the statue would be sacrilege so the statue was left by the banks of the river and the tide carried it down to Chester. The statue was found guilty by a jury of 12 men. If the legend is true, then this is the first recorded case of a jury being used in a court.<ref>{{cite episode|title=Feud, Glorious Feud|series=Tony Robinson's Crime and Punishment|airdate=2008-06-01|season=1|episode=1}}</ref>\n\nIn an alternate version of the legend, the statue was instead carried to St John's Church. An ancient statue of the Virgin was recorded at the time of the reformation but may not be the same one. The statue was thrown down as a relic of popery, used as a whipping post for scholars and burned.\n\nThe site was formerly the home of the original [[Chester Midsummer Watch Parade]], temporarily banned by [[Oliver Cromwell]] but finally abolished in 1677\n\nThe east of the race course abuts directly onto Chester's ancient [[city walls]] which were once used to moor [[Roman Empire|Roman]] trading vessels, before the course of the river changed. Spectators can watch races for free from the walls which offer a clear view of the whole circuit. The [[Grosvenor Bridge (Chester)|Grosvenor Bridge]], at one time the longest single arch bridge in the world, passes over the south-eastern corner. The north of the course is bordered by a long railway bridge carrying the [[North Wales Coast Line]] over the [[River Dee, Wales|River Dee]]. The course is overlooked from the opposite bank of the river by the [[mansions]] of [[Curzon Park]], which can be seen dominating the skyline from any of the three grandstands.\n\n==Horseracing==\n[[File:RoodeeAerial.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of the Racecourse.]]\nThe Chester Racecourse site was home to the famous and bloody Goteddsday [[Medi\u00e6val football|football]] match. The game was very violent and, in 1533, banned by the city, to be replaced in 1539 by horse racing. The first recorded race was held on 9 February 1539 (although other sources list this as 10 January 1511{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=108}}) with the consent of the Mayor Henry Gee, whose name led to the use of the term \"gee-gee\" for horses.<ref name=\"telegraph\"/> Races originally took place on Goteddsday ([[Shrove Tuesday]]) until 1609, and thereafter on [[St George's Day]], both major festivals during the [[medieval]] period. Victors were awarded the \"Chester Bells\", a set of decorative [[Bell (instrument)|bells]] for decorating the horse's [[bridle]], and from 1744 the \"[[Richard Grosvenor, 1st Earl Grosvenor|Grosvenor]] Gold Cup\", a small [[Cup|tumbler]] made from solid gold (later silver). In 1745, the meeting became a four-day one, with one race on each day.{{sfn|Saunders, Otley|1863|page=110}}  In 1766 a May Festival was introduced, and in 1824, the Tradesmen's Cup Race (the predecessor to the [[Chester Cup]]) was also introduced.\n\nThe racecourse was at that point still just an open field, with the first [[grandstand]] finished in 1817 and the first admittance fee not being taken until 1897. The stand was rebuilt in 1899\u20131900, and was replaced after being destroyed by [[arson]] in 1985.\n\n==Today==\nThe racecourse's position in the city makes race meetings at Chester very popular as it is only a very short stroll to all the hotels, bars, shopping and restaurants. The racecourse itself is just over {{convert|1|mi|km|sing=on}} long, flat and raced anti-clockwise or left-handed. The main characteristic of the course is the very short straight (239 yards). As such, long-strided horses, which perform better on straights, are at a distinct disadvantage.\n\nOn 19 August 2006, Irish vocal pop band [[Westlife]] held a concert for their [[Face to Face Tour]] supporting their album [[Face to Face (Westlife album)|Face to Face]].\n\nIn 2008, a restaurant opened at the racecourse, named \"1539\", after the first year that horse racing took place in Chester.<ref>[http://www.restaurant1539.co.uk/ 1539 Restaurant]</ref>\n\nIn 2013 a new pub and restaurant called The White Horse was opened in the centre of the Course.\n\nThe main race meetings at Chester were often broadcast on [[Channel 4 Racing]] until 2016 and have been broadcast on [[ITV Racing]] since 2017.\n\nIn May 2012, all former [[The Tote|Tote]] betting positions were replaced by the racecourse's own in-house chesterBET betting system.\n\nThe Clerk of the Course is Andrew Morris, who is also Clerk of the Course for sister course [[Bangor-on-Dee racecourse|Bangor-on-Dee]], which is a [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt]] jumps course.\n\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n==Notable races==\n{| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\"\n! style=\"width:70px\" |Month\n! style=\"width:80px\" |Meeting\n! style=\"width:80px\" |DOW\n!
