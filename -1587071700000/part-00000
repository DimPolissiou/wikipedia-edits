His father worked as an electronics engineer at [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. His mother later became a teacher. The family had left Scotland in part because work for his father's engineering skills was in short supply and in part because of the tensions in the extended family caused by his parents' \"[[Interfaith marriage|mixed marriage]]\", his father being Catholic and his mother Presbyterian. Byrne recounted these events when he appeared on ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' on [[BBC Radio 4]] on 18 March 2018.<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09vz6r1|title=BBC Radio 4 \u2013 Desert Island Discs, David Byrne|website=BBC|accessdate=23 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nBefore high school, Byrne already knew how to play the guitar, accordion, and violin. He was rejected from his [[middle school]]'s choir because they claimed he was \"off-[[Key (music)|key]] and too withdrawn\". From a young age, he had a strong interest in music. His parents say that he would constantly play his [[phonograph]] from age three and he learned how to play the harmonica at age five.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C962640-8%2C00.html |title=\"Rock's Renaissance Man.\" TIME Magazine.

He started his musical career in a high school band called Revelation, then between 1971 and 1972, he was one half of a duo named Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as \"[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]\", \"[[96 Tears]]\", \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling (1930 song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" and [[Frank Sinatra]] songs. Byrne attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (during the 1970\u201371 term) and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (during the 1971\u201372 term) before dropping out. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student [[Chris Frantz]].<ref>Gittins, Ian, ''Talking Heads: Once in a Lifetime : the Stories Behind Every Song'', [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2004, p. 140 {{ISBN|0-634-08033-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08033-3}}.</ref> The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to [[New York City]] in May that year, and in September of that year,  Frantz and his girlfriend [[Tina Weymouth]] followed suit. Unable to find a bass player in New York, Frantz and Byrne persuaded Weymouth to learn to play the bass guitar. Byrne gave her lessons. While working day jobs in late 1974, they were contemplating a band.\n\n===Talking Heads: 1975\u20131991===\n{{main|Talking Heads}}\nBy January 1975, they were practicing and playing together, while still working normal day jobs.

Retrieved 15 May 2013</ref> Byrne quit his day job in May 1976 and the three-piece band signed to [[Sire Records]] in November. Multi-instrumentalist [[Jerry Harrison]] joined the band in 1977. The band released eight studio albums before going into hiatus in 1988. Byrne desired to go solo, but it took three years until 1991 to announce that the band was breaking up. A brief reunion for a single \"[[Sax and Violins]]\" in 1991 occurred before dissolving again. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2002, when they reunited to play four tracks, including \"[[Psycho Killer]]\" and \"[[Burning Down the House]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ceremonies/2002/|title=2002 Induction Ceremony|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Solo album career: 1979\u20131981, 1989\u2013present===\nDuring his time in the band, Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with [[Brian Eno]] during 1979 and 1981 on the album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', which attracted considerable critical acclaim due to its early use of analogue [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Found object|found sounds]]. Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, [[stem (audio)|stems]] for two of the songs' component tracks were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses and a remix contest site was launched.\n\n''[[Rei Momo]]'' (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles including popular dances such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[son cubano]], [[samba]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cumbia]], [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]. His third solo album, ''[[Uh-Oh (David Byrne album)|Uh-Oh]]'' (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as \"Girls on My Mind\" and \"The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\". His fourth solo album, titled ''[[David Byrne (album)|David Byrne]]'' (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. \"Angels\" and \"Back in the Box\" were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort the emotional ''[[Feelings (David Byrne album)|Feelings]]'' (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth ''[[Look into the Eyeball]]'' (2001) continued the same musical exploration of ''Feelings'', but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on ''Uh-Oh''.\n\n''[[Grown Backwards]]'' (2004), released by [[Nonesuch Records]], used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic [[aria]]s as well as a rework of [[X-Press 2]] collaboration \"[[David Byrne#Other musical contributions: 1990\u2013present|Lazy]]\". He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and New York shows in August 2005.

He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' in 1984.\n\nByrne was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s. He collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on \"The Knee Plays\" and \"The Forest\", and invited [[Spalding Gray]] (of The Wooster Group) to act in ''True Stories'', while Meredith Monk provided a small part of that film's soundtrack. Byrne provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis' film \"Dead End Kids\", made after a Mabou Mines theatre production.

Byrne added \"Loco de Amor\" with [[Celia Cruz]] to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1986 film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.\n\nByrne wrote the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]-inspired score for [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s Opera ''[[Music for \"The Knee Plays\"|The Knee Plays]]'' from ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''. Some of the music from Byrne's orchestral album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'' was originally used in a Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. ''The Forest'' premiered at the ''Theater der Freien Volksb\u00fchne'', Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM).

He started his musical career in a high school band called Revelation, then between 1971 and 1972, he was one half of a duo named Bizadi with Marc Kehoe. Their repertoire consisted mostly of songs such as \"[[April Showers (song)|April Showers]]\", \"[[96 Tears]]\", \"[[Dancing on the Ceiling (1930 song)|Dancing on the Ceiling]]\" and [[Frank Sinatra]] songs. Byrne attended the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (during the 1970\u201371 term) and the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] (during the 1971\u201372 term) before dropping out. He returned to Providence in 1973 and formed a band called the Artistics with fellow RISD student [[Chris Frantz]].<ref>Gittins, Ian, ''Talking Heads: Once in a Lifetime : the Stories Behind Every Song'', [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2004, p. 140 {{ISBN|0-634-08033-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08033-3}}.</ref> The band dissolved in 1974. Byrne moved to [[New York City]] in May that year, and in September of that year,  Frantz and his girlfriend [[Tina Weymouth]] followed suit. Unable to find a bass player in New York, Frantz and Byrne persuaded Weymouth to learn to play the bass guitar. Byrne gave her lessons. While working day jobs in late 1974, they were contemplating a band.\n\n===Talking Heads: 1975\u20131991===\n{{main|Talking Heads}}\nBy January 1975, they were practicing and playing together, while still working normal day jobs.

The band released eight studio albums before going into hiatus in 1988. Byrne desired to go solo, but it took three years until 1991 to announce that the band was breaking up. A brief reunion for a single \"[[Sax and Violins]]\" in 1991 occurred before dissolving again. The band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2002, when they reunited to play four tracks, including \"[[Psycho Killer]]\" and \"[[Burning Down the House]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/ceremonies/2002/|title=2002 Induction Ceremony|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|accessdate=15 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Solo album career: 1979\u20131981, 1989\u2013present===\nDuring his time in the band, Byrne took on outside projects, collaborating with [[Brian Eno]] during 1979 and 1981 on the album ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'', which attracted considerable critical acclaim due to its early use of analogue [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[Found object|found sounds]]. Following this record, Byrne focused his attention on Talking Heads. ''My Life in the Bush of Ghosts'' was re-released for its 25th anniversary in early 2006, with new bonus tracks. In keeping with the spirit of the original album, [[stem (audio)|stems]] for two of the songs' component tracks were released under [[Creative Commons]] licenses and a remix contest site was launched.\n\n''[[Rei Momo]]'' (1989) was the first solo album by Byrne after leaving Talking Heads, and features mainly Afro-Cuban, Afro-Hispanic, and Brazilian song styles including popular dances such as [[merengue music|merengue]], [[son cubano]], [[samba]], [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cumbia]], [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|cha-cha-ch\u00e1]], [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[Charanga (Cuba)|charanga]]. His third solo album, ''[[Uh-Oh (David Byrne album)|Uh-Oh]]'' (1992), featured a brass section and was driven by tracks such as \"Girls on My Mind\" and \"The Cowboy Mambo (Hey Lookit Me Now)\". His fourth solo album, titled ''[[David Byrne (album)|David Byrne]]'' (1994), was a more proper rock record, with Byrne playing most of the instruments on it, leaving percussion for session musicians. \"Angels\" and \"Back in the Box\" were the two main singles released from the album. The first one entered the US [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, reaching No. 24. For his fifth studio effort the emotional ''[[Feelings (David Byrne album)|Feelings]]'' (1997), Byrne employed a brass orchestra called Black Cat Orchestra. His sixth ''[[Look into the Eyeball]]'' (2001) continued the same musical exploration of ''Feelings'', but was compiled of more upbeat tracks, like those found on ''Uh-Oh''.\n\n''[[Grown Backwards]]'' (2004), released by [[Nonesuch Records]], used orchestral string arrangements, and includes two operatic [[aria]]s as well as a rework of [[X-Press 2]] collaboration \"[[David Byrne#Other musical contributions: 1990\u2013present|Lazy]]\". He also launched a North American and Australian tour with the Tosca Strings. This tour ended with [[Los Angeles]], [[San Diego]] and New York shows in August 2005.

Byrne also directed the documentary ''\u00cele Aiye'' and the concert film of his 1992 Latin-tinged tour titled ''Between the Teeth''. He was chiefly responsible for the stage design and choreography of ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' in 1984.\n\nByrne was impressed by the experimental theatre that he saw in New York City in the 1970s. He collaborated with several of its best-known representatives. He worked with Robert Wilson on \"The Knee Plays\" and \"The Forest\", and invited [[Spalding Gray]] (of The Wooster Group) to act in ''True Stories'', while Meredith Monk provided a small part of that film's soundtrack. Byrne provided a soundtrack for JoAnne Akalaitis' film \"Dead End Kids\", made after a Mabou Mines theatre production. Byrne's artistic outlook has a great deal in common with the work of these artists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenstra|first1=Sytze|title=Song and Circumstance|date=2010|publisher=Continuum Books|location=New York and London|isbn=978-08264-4168-3|pages=93\u2013137}}</ref>\n\nIn 1991, Byrne released a classical instrumental album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'', where some of the tracks were already featured as a score for 1988 Robert Wilson theatre piece of the same name.\n\nHis work has been extensively used in film [[soundtrack]]s, most notably in collaboration with [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Cong Su]] on [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Last Emperor]]'', which won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]]. In 2004, ''[[Lead Us Not into Temptation]]'' included tracks and musical experiments from his score to ''[[Young Adam (film)|Young Adam]]''. Byrne added \"Loco de Amor\" with [[Celia Cruz]] to [[Jonathan Demme]]'s 1986 film ''[[Something Wild (1986 film)|Something Wild]]''.\n\nByrne wrote the [[Dirty Dozen Brass Band]]-inspired score for [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]]'s Opera ''[[Music for \"The Knee Plays\"|The Knee Plays]]'' from ''[[The Civil Wars: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down]]''. Some of the music from Byrne's orchestral album ''[[The Forest (album)|The Forest]]'' was originally used in a Wilson-directed theatre piece with the same name. ''The Forest'' premiered at the ''Theater der Freien Volksb\u00fchne'', Berlin, in 1988. It received its New York premiere in December 1988 at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] (BAM). The Forestry Maxi-single contained dance and industrial remixes of pieces from ''The Forest'' by [[Jack Dangers]], Rudy Tambala, and Anthony Capel.\n\nIn late 2005, Byrne and [[Norman Cook|Fatboy Slim]] began work on ''[[Here Lies Love]]'', a [[disco]] opera or [[song cycle]] about the life of [[Imelda Marcos]], the controversial former First Lady of the [[Philippines]].

{"title_page": "Investigative journalism", "text_new": "{{broader|Watchdog journalism}}\n{{other uses|Investigative Journalism (disambiguation)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2012}}\n\n{{Journalism sidebar}}\n'''Investigative journalism''' is a form of [[journalism]] in which reporters deeply investigate a single topic of interest, such as serious crimes, [[political corruption]], or corporate wrongdoing. An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms \"watchdog reporting\" or \"accountability reporting\".\n\nMost investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by [[newspaper]]s, [[News agency|wire service]]s, and [[Freelancer|freelance]] journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, which is time-consuming and therefore expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]]), or by organizations such as [[ProPublica]], which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work.\n\nThe growth of [[media conglomerate]]s in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded \"that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st century|url=https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch|url-access=registration|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58367-105-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch/page/81 81]|authorlink=Robert W.

The major media conglomerates have found ways to retain their audience without the risks of offending advertisers inherent in investigative journalism.\n\n== Professional definitions ==\n[[University of Missouri]] journalism professor Steve Weinberg defined investigative journalism as: \"Reporting, through one's own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers, viewers, or listeners.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|title=The Reporter's Handbook: An Investigator's Guide To Documents and Techniques|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-13596-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/reportershandboo0000wein}}</ref> In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed. There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism.

An investigative journalist may spend months or years researching and preparing a report. Practitioners sometimes use the terms \"watchdog reporting\" or \"accountability reporting\".\n\nMost investigative journalism has traditionally been conducted by [[newspaper]]s, [[News agency|wire service]]s, and [[Freelancer|freelance]] journalists. With the decline in income through advertising, many traditional news services have struggled to fund investigative journalism, which is time-consuming and therefore expensive. Journalistic investigations are increasingly carried out by news organizations working together, even internationally (as in the case of the [[Panama Papers]] and [[Paradise Papers]]), or by organizations such as [[ProPublica]], which have not operated previously as news publishers and which rely on the support of the public and benefactors to fund their work.\n\nThe growth of [[media conglomerate]]s in the U.S. since the 1980s has been accompanied by massive cuts in the budgets for investigative journalism. A 2002 study concluded \"that investigative journalism has all but disappeared from the nation's commercial airwaves\".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Problem of the Media: U.S. Communication Politics in the 21st century|url=https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch|url-access=registration|last=McChesney|first=Robert W.|publisher=Monthly Review Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58367-105-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemofmediaus00mcch/page/81 81]|authorlink=Robert W.

The major media conglomerates have found ways to retain their audience without the risks of offending advertisers inherent in investigative journalism.\n\n== Professional definitions ==\n[[University of Missouri]] journalism professor Steve Weinberg defined investigative journalism as: \"Reporting, through one's own initiative and work product, matters of importance to readers, viewers, or listeners.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steve|title=The Reporter's Handbook: An Investigator's Guide To Documents and Techniques|year=1996|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-13596-6|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/reportershandboo0000wein}}</ref> In many cases, the subjects of the reporting wish the matters under scrutiny to remain undisclosed. There are currently university departments for teaching investigative journalism. Conferences are conducted presenting peer reviewed research into investigative \n\nBritish media theorist [[Hugo de Burgh]] (2000) states that: \"An investigative journalist is a man or woman whose profession  is to discover the truth and to identify lapses from it in whatever media may be available. The act of doing this generally is called investigative journalism and is distinct from apparently similar work done by police, lawyers, auditors, and regulatory bodies in that it is not limited as to target, not legally founded and closely connected to publicity.\"<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=de Burgh|editor-first=Hugo|title=Investigative Journalism: Context and Practice|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-415-19054-1}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n{{main article|Muckraker}} \nAmerican journalism textbooks point out that muckraking standards promoted by ''[[McClure's|McClure's Magazine]]'' around 1902,  \"Have become integral to the character of modern investigative journalism.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sloan|first1=W.

Johnson]] & Morgan Cloud, Criminal Law: Cases, Materials, and Text (7th ed. West Group 2002) p. 124.</ref>\n\n==Factual background==\nThe defendants, Michael H. Weitzenhoff and Thomas W. Mariani, were managers at East Honolulu Community Services [[sewage treatment plant]] in [[Hawaii]]. Weitzenhoff and Mariani were indicted for 31 counts of conspiracy and violating the [[Clean Water Act]]. Evidence showed that non-biodegradable waste from the treatment plant was dumped into the ocean 40 times from April 1988 to June 1989,<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1527\">''Weitzenhoff'', 1 F.3d at 1527\u201328</ref> grossly exceeding the permit that limited the amount of waste allowed to be dumped into the ocean. Employees testified that they dumped the waste into the ocean during the middle of the night on orders from Weitzenhoff and Mariani.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1527\"/> The waste was removed at a point that bypassed the system that kept track of the amount of dumped waste, causing a misrepresentation of waste that was actually being dumped by the treatment plant. The waste that bypassed a part of the system was not being calculated in the total amount of waste being dumped, and was not reported to the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] or the [[United States Department of Health]]. Also, the treatment plant repeatedly denied the floating debris in the nearby ocean came from them as more and more surfers complained.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1527\"/> The two managers admitted to ordering the dumping of the waste, but claimed they thought they had a permit allowing them to dump waste into the ocean.\n\nThe District Court, Judge David Alan Ezra, instructed the jury that \"knowingly\" meant that Weitzenhoff and Mariani knew they were dumping waste into the ocean.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1529\">''Weitzenhoff'', 1 F.3d at 1529</ref> If the jury believed that, then they would be found guilty. The jury found Weitzenhoff and Mariani guilty of six of the thirty one charges. Weitzenhoff was sentenced to 21 months in prison, and Mariani was to serve 33 months.\n\n==Ninth Circuit's opinion: the issue of intent==\nOn [[appeal]], the defendants argued that the judged erred in his/her interpretation of the statute and in the instruction of the jury. They argued that the judge was wrong to instruct the jury that no proof was needed to show they knew their act was unlawful, and that the judge failed to instruct the jury that the Defendants mistakenly thought they were authorized to dump the waste under a permit.\n\nThe defendants relied on ''Liparota v. United States''<ref>471 U.S. 419, 105 S.Ct. 2084, 85 L.Ed.2d 434 (1985)</ref> in their defense, case involving the fraudulent use of food stamps. There the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] had interpreted the word \"knowingly\" in the statute as implying actual knowledge of the legal violation. The Ninth Circuit distinguished ''Liparota'' on the grounds that it did not pertain to acts that cause public endangerment, and therefore criminal liability needed to be used more sparingly.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 1 F.3d 1523, 1530.</ref> The Ninth Circuit found more applicable the case ''United States v. International Minerals & Chem. Corp.'',<ref>402 U.S. 558, 91 S.Ct. 1697, 29 L.Ed.2d 178 (1971)</ref> in which the Supreme Court had held that when one handles wastes and dangerous materials, knowledge of the regulations is assumed.\n\nThe Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment of the district Court.\n\n==Ninth Circuit's opinion: other issues==\nThe Ninth Circuit also addressed a few other legal issued raised by Weitzenhoff and Mariani.\n\n===Expert testimony===\nThe trial court had allowed government expert witnesses to testify at the trial about the technical terms of the treatment plant's permit, including the limitations on waste discharge into the ocean.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1287\">''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1287</ref> Weitzenhoff and Mariani argued that such testimony defining key terms of the permit, and explaining its prohibitions, amounted to an impermissible delegation of the trial judge's duties\u2014it amounted to having these witnesses instruct the jury on the law rather than the judge.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1287\"/> The Ninth Circuit agreed with this argument, but held that this was [[harmless error]] on the part of the trial judge, \"because, under a proper interpretation of the permit, the discharges admitted to by Weitzenhoff and Mariani necessarily violated the permit.\"<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1288\">''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1288</ref>\n\n===Statutory vagueness===\nThe defendants also argued that the statute must be unconstitutionally vague, because of the absence of a requirement that they knew they were violating the law, and the fact that key provisions of the permit, in particular those that were debated at trial, have no established meaning.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1289\">''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1289</ref> The Ninth Circuit considered this issue but concluded that the defendants had adequate knowledge of the illegality of their dumping, and this made the vagueness issue irrelevant as the defendants had adequate notice.<ref name=\"Weitzenhoff1289\"/>\n\n===Other claims===\nIn the appeal, Weitzenhoff and Mariani also challenged the exclusion of certain evidence at trial,<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1291; the defendants wanted to introduce an excerpt from the [[Federal Register]] about amendments to the regulation that the EPA had proposed but never adopted.</ref> entrapment by ''[[estoppel]]'',<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1291. The court of appeals found no evidence to support such a claim.</ref> prosecutorial misconduct,<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1291. This allegation was connected to the prosecutor's use of expert testimony mentioned above.</ref> and a prolonged sentence imposed on Mariani for perjuring himself when he testified at trial.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1292.</ref>\n\n==Request for rehearing (denied) and dissenting opinion==\nWeitzenhoff and Mariani requested a rehearing before the Ninth Circuit ''[[en banc]]'', which the Court of Appeals denied,<ref name=\"EnBanc\"/> affirming its previous decision by a three-judge panel and making minor revisions in its legal opinion.\n\nSeveral judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals took this opportunity to collaborate on a dissenting opinion against the decisions to deny a rehearing ''en banc''.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1293</ref> Circuit Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]] authored the legal opinion for this dissent, arguing that imposing criminal liability in this case would deter others from useful careers in the public utilities.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1293 (\"We have now made felons of a large number of innocent people doing socially valuable work. They are innocent, because the one thing which makes their conduct felonious is something they do not know.\")</ref> Joining in this dissenting opinion were Circuit Judges [[Alex Kozinski]], Stephen S. Trott, and T.G. Nelson.\n\n==Rejected appeal to the supreme court==\nMariani and Weitzenhoof appealed their case to the United States Supreme Court, but the Court denied ''[[certiorari]]'',<ref>''Mariani v. U.S.''513 U.S. 1128, 115 S.Ct. 939 (1995)(Mem.)</ref> refusing to hear the appeal.

This allegation was connected to the prosecutor's use of expert testimony mentioned above.</ref> and a prolonged sentence imposed on Mariani for perjuring himself when he testified at trial.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1292.</ref>\n\n==Request for rehearing (denied) and dissenting opinion==\nWeitzenhoff and Mariani requested a rehearing before the Ninth Circuit ''[[en banc]]'', which the Court of Appeals denied,<ref name=\"EnBanc\"/> affirming its previous decision by a three-judge panel and making minor revisions in its legal opinion.\n\nSeveral judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals took this opportunity to collaborate on a dissenting opinion against the decisions to deny a rehearing ''en banc''.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1293</ref> Circuit Judge [[Andrew Kleinfeld]] authored the legal opinion for this dissent, arguing that imposing criminal liability in this case would deter others from useful careers in the public utilities.<ref>''Weitzenhoff'', 35 F.3d at 1293 (\"We have now made felons of a large number of innocent people doing socially valuable work. They are innocent, because the one thing which makes their conduct felonious is something they do not know.\")</ref> Joining in this dissenting opinion were Circuit Judges [[Alex Kozinski]], Stephen S. Trott, and T.G. Nelson.\n\n==Rejected appeal to the supreme court==\nMariani and Weitzenhoof appealed their case to the United States Supreme Court, but the Court denied ''[[certiorari]]'',<ref>''Mariani v. U.S.''513 U.S. 1128, 115 S.Ct. 939 (1995)(Mem.)</ref> refusing to hear the appeal.
