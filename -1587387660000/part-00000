It is arguably world's oldest known temple.]]\nA '''temple''' (from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[templum]]}}) is a building reserved for [[religious]] or spiritual rituals and activities such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]].  It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as [[church (building)|church]], [[mosque]] or [[synagogue]] is not generally used in English.  These include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] among religions with many modern followers, as well as other ancient religions such as [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].\n\nThe form and function of temples is thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the \"house\" of one or more [[Deity|deities]].  Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals enacted, and a special group of [[clergy]] maintain, and operate the temple.  The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts or even the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy.  Temples typically have a main building and a larger [[religious precinct|precinct]], which may contain many other buildings, or may be a dome shaped structure, much like an igloo.\n\nThe word comes from [[Ancient Rome]], where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or [[augur]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = University of Notre Dame | date = 26 May 2009 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Templum&ending= | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref> It has the same root as the word \"template\", a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the [[augur]]. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the word, it has now become widely used to describe a house of [[worship]] for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.\n\n==Mesopotamian temples==\n[[File:Ziggarat of Ur 001.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ziggurat of Ur]], [[Iraq]]]]\nThe temple-building tradition of [[Mesopotamia]] derived from the cults of gods and deities in the [[Mesopotamian religion]]. It spanned several civilizations; from [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Babylonia]]n. The most common temple architecture of Mesopotamia is the structure of sun-baked bricks called a [[Ziggurat]], having the form of a terraced [[step pyramid]] with a flat upper terrace where the shrine or temple stood.\n\n==Egyptian temples==\n{{main|Egyptian temple}}\n[[File:Luxor, Luxor Temple, inside, at night, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Luxor Temple]], [[Egypt]]]]\n[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were meant as places for the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deities]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''\u1e25wt-n\u1e6fr'', means \"mansion (or enclosure) of a god\".<ref>Spencer 1984, p. 22, 44; Snape 1996, p. 9</ref>\n\nA god's [[Divine presence|presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were, therefore, a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.<ref>Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 89\u201391</ref> Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],<ref>Assmann 2001, p. 4</ref> and thus it was the purpose of a temple as well.<ref>Shafer, Byron E., \"Temples, Priests, and Rituals: An Overview\", in Shafer 1997, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were also of economic significance to Egyptian society. The temples stored and redistributed grain and came to own large portions of the nation's arable land (some estimate as much as 33% by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period).<ref>Andr\u00e9 Dollinger. The Ancient Egyptian Economy. pp. 5 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Ancient-Egyptian-Economy.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012</ref> In addition, many of these Egyptian temples utilized the Tripartite Floor Plan in order to draw visitors to the center room.\n\n==Greco-Roman temples==\n{{Main|Greek temple|Roman temple}}\n[[File:Acropolis wide view.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]]]\nThough today we call most Greek religious buildings \"temples,\" the ancient Greeks would have referred to a [[temenos]], or sacred precinct. Its sacredness, often connected with a holy grove, was more important than the building itself, as it contained the open air [[altar]] on which the [[sacrifices]] were made. The building which housed the cult statue in its [[Cella|naos]] was originally a rather simple structure, but by the middle of the 6th century BCE had become increasingly elaborate. Greek temple architecture had a profound influence on ancient architectural traditions.\n\nThe rituals that located and sited Roman temples were performed by an [[augur]] through the observation of the flight of birds or other natural phenomenon. Roman temples usually faced east or toward the rising sun, but the specifics of the orientation are often not known today; there are also notable exceptions, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] which faces north. In [[ancient Rome]] only the native deities of [[Roman mythology]] had a ''templum''; any equivalent structure for a foreign deity was called a ''fanum''.\n\n==Pagan temples==\n{{See also|List of modern pagan temples}}\n[[File:Templo de Garni, Armenia, 2016-10-02, DD 94.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Temple of Garni]], [[Armenia]]]]\nThe Romans usually referred to a holy place of a [[pagan]] religion as ''fanum''; in some cases this referred to a sacred grove, in others to a temple. Medieval Latin writers also sometimes used the word ''templum'', previously reserved for temples of the ancient Roman religion. In some cases it is hard to determine whether a temple was a building or an outdoor shrine. For temple buildings of the Vikings, the [[Old Norse]] term ''[[Heathen hofs|hof]]'' is often used.\n\n==Zoroastrian temples==\n{{Main|Fire temple}}\n[[File:Yazd fire temple.jpg|thumb|200px|The Yazd Atash Behram]]\nA [[Zoroastrian]] temple may also be called a ''Dar-e-mehr'' and an ''[[Fire temple|Atashkadeh]]''. A fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere [[fire]] in any form, and their temples contains an [[eternal flame]], with [[Atash Behram]] (Fire of Victory) as the highest grade of all, as it combines 16 different types of fire gathered in elaborate rituals.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian religion, fire (Atar), together with clean water (Aban), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life,\" which, \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\".\n\n==Hindu temples==\n{{Main|Hindu temple}}\n{{see also|List of Hindu temples}}\n[[File:New Delhi Temple.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham Temple]], a Hindu temple in [[New Delhi]], [[India]].]]\nHindu temples are known by many different names, varying on region and language, including Alayam,<ref>ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 1</ref> ''Mandir'', ''Mandira'', ''Ambalam'', ''Gudi'', ''Kavu'', ''Koil'', ''Kovil'', ''D\u00e9ul'', ''Raul'', ''Devasthana'', Degul, Deva Mandiraya and ''Devalaya''.\n\nA Hindu temple is a symbolic house, the seat and dwelling of [[Hindu gods]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C|year=1946|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=135, context: 40\u201343, 110\u2013114, 129\u2013139 with footnotes}}, Quote: \"The [Hindu] temple is the seat and dwelling of God, according to the majority of the [Indian] names\" (p. 135); \"The temple as Vimana, proportionately measured throughout, is the house and body of God\" (p. 133).</ref> It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together according to [[Hinduism|Hindu faith]]. Inside its [[Garbhagriha]] innermost sanctum, a Hindu temple contains a [[Murti]] or Hindu god's image. Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. There is evidence of use of sacred ground as far back as the [[Bronze Age]] and later during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].\n\nOutside of the Indian subcontinent ([[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), Hindu temples have been built in [[List of Hindu temples outside India|various countries around the world]]. Either following the [[Indianized kingdom|historic diffusion of Hinduism across Asia]] (e.g. ancient stone temples of [[Cambodia]] and [[List of Hindu temples in Indonesia|Indonesia]]), or following the migration of the [[Indian diaspora|Indian Hindus' diaspora]]; to Western Europe (esp. [[Great Britain]]), North America (the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]), as well as  Australia, [[Malaysia]] and Singapore, Mauritius and [[South Africa]].\n\n==Buddhist temples==\n{{main|Buddhist temple}}\n[[File:Mahabodhitemple.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mahabodhi]] temple, [[Bihar, India]]]]\nBuddhist temples include the structures called [[stupa]], [[wat]] and [[pagoda]] in different regions and languages. A Buddhist temple might contain a [[meditation]] hall hosting [[Buddharupa]], or the image of [[Buddha]], as the object of concentration and veneration during a meditation. The stupa domed structures are also used in a circumambulation ritual called ''[[Pradakshina]]''.\n\nTemples in [[Buddhism]] represent the pure land or pure environment of a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]].

They are more akin to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia than to Egyptian ones. A single or several flight(s) of steep steps from the base lead to the temple that stood on the plateau on top of the pyramid. The stone temple might be a square or a rounded structure with a door opening leading to a cella or inner sanctum. The plateau on top of the pyramid in front of the temple is where the ritualistic sacrifice took place.\n\nSome classic Mesoamerican pyramids are adorned with stories about the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Mesoamerican creation myths]], written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs |last = Koontz|first = Rex |publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 2013 |isbn = 9780500290767 |location = New York, New York|pages = }}\n</ref> Notable example include [[Aztec]] [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan|Acatitlan]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[Chichen Itza]], [[Uxmal]] and [[Tikal]].\n\n==Jewish synagogues and temples==\n[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|thumb|200px|A model of [[Herod's Temple]] adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]\n[[File:Kenessa Vilnius (5970197134).jpg|thumb|200px|The Kenesa in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]].]]\n\nIn [[Judaism]], the ancient Hebrew texts refer not to temples, the word having not existed yet, but to a \"sanctuary\", \"palace\" or \"hall\". Each of the two ancient temples in Jerusalem was called in the [[Tanakh]] ''Beit YHWH'', which translates literally as \"YHWH's House.\"\n\nThe [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] is the site where the [[First Temple]] of Solomon and the [[Second Temple]] were built. At the center of the structure was the [[Holy of Holies]] where only the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] could enter. The Temple Mount is now the site of the [[Islamic]] edifice, the [[Dome of the Rock]] (c. 690).\n\nThe Greek word ''[[synagogue]]'' came into use to describe Jewish (and [[Samaritanism|Samaritan]]) places of worship during [[Hellenistic]] times and it, along with the Yiddish term ''[[shul]]'', and the original Hebrew term ''[[Synagogue|Beit Knesset]]'' (\"House of meeting\") are the terms in most universal usage.\n\nSince the 18th Century, Jews in Western and Central Europe began to apply the name \"temple\", borrowed from the French where it was used to denote all non-Catholic prayerhouses, to synagogues. The term became strongly associated with [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] institutions, in some of which both congregants and outsiders associated it with the elimination of the prayers for the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple, though this was not the original meaning\u2014traditional synagogues named themselves \"temple\" over a century before the advent of Reform, and many continued to do so after.<ref>Michael A. Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State University Press, 1995. p. 42.</ref> In American parlance, \"temple\" is often synonymous with \"synagogue\", but especially non-Orthodox ones.\n\nThe term ''[[kenesa]]'', from the Aramaic for \"assembly\", is used to describe the places of worship of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Christian temples==\n===Orthodox Christianity===\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-8.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].]]\nThe word ''temple'' is used frequently in the tradition of [[Eastern Christianity]]; particularly the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], where the principal words used for houses of worship are ''temple'' and ''church''. The use of the word ''temple'' comes from the need to distinguish ''a building of the church'' vs. ''the church seen as the Body of Christ''. In the [[Russian language]] (similar to other [[Slavic languages]]), while the general-purpose word for \"church\" is ''[[Russian church architecture|tserkov]]'', the term ''khram'' (\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c), \"temple\", is used to refer to the church building as a temple of [[God]] (''Khram Bozhy''). The words \"church\" and \"temple\", in this case are interchangeable; however, the term \"church\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}) is far more common. The term ''temple'' ({{lang-grc|\u03bd\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2}}) is also commonly applied to larger churches. Some famous churches which are referred to as temples include the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] and the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur IMG 1271.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur]] in [[Paris]]]]\nThe word ''temple'' has traditionally been rarely used in the English-speaking [[Western Christian tradition]]. In [[Irish language|Irish]], some [[East\u2013West Schism|pre-schism]] churches use the word ''[[wiktionary:teampall|teampall]]''. The usual word for ''church'' in the [[Hungarian language]] is ''[[wiktionary:templom|templom]]'', also deriving from the same Latin root.  [[Spanish language|Spanish]] distinguishes between the temple being the physical building for religious activity, and the church being both the physical building for religious activity and also the congregation of religious followers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baldayac|first1=Rafael|title=Iglesia y templo: diferencia|url=http://www.lainformacion.com.do/noticias/opinion/columnas/869/iglesia-y-templo:-diferencia|website=La Informacion|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe principal words typically used to distinguish houses of worship in Western Christian architecture are ''[[abbey]]'', ''[[basilica]]'', ''[[cathedral]]'', ''[[chapel]]'' and ''[[Church (building)|church]]''. The Catholic Church has used the word temple in reference of a place of worship on rare occasions. An example is the Roman Catholic [[Sagrada Familia]] Temple in Barcelona, Spain and the Roman Catholic [[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] Temple in Paris, France. Another example is the Temple or Our Lady of the pillar, a church in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]]. Also, some Protestant churches use this term; above main entrance of the [[Lutheran]] Gustav Vasa church in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] is a [[cartouche]] in Latin which reads \u201cthis temple (...) was constructed by king Oscar II.\u201d\n\nBeginning in the late eighteenth century, following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some Protestant denominations in France and elsewhere began to use the word ''temple'' to distinguish these spaces from Catholic churches. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and other Protestant churches make use of a wide variety of terms to designate their worship spaces, such as church, [[tabernacle]] or temple. Additionally some [[Breakaway Catholic Churches]] such as the [[Mariavite Church]] in [[Poland]] have chosen to also designate their central church building as a temple, as in the case of the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] in [[P\u0142ock]]. \n{{clear}}\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n[[File:KirtlandTemple Ohio USA.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kirtland Temple]] in Kirtland, Ohio]]\n{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nAccording to [[Latter Day Saint]]s, in 1832, [[Joseph Smith]] received a [[Revelation#Latter-day Saint concept of revelation|revelation]] to [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restore]] the practice of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]], in a \"house of the Lord\".

It is arguably world's oldest known temple.]]\nA '''temple''' (from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|[[templum]]}}) is a building reserved for [[religious]] or spiritual rituals and activities such as [[prayer]] and [[sacrifice]].  It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a more specific term such as [[church (building)|church]], [[mosque]] or [[synagogue]] is not generally used in English.  These include [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Jainism]] among religions with many modern followers, as well as other ancient religions such as [[Ancient Egyptian religion]].\n\nThe form and function of temples is thus very variable, though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the \"house\" of one or more [[Deity|deities]].  Typically offerings of some sort are made to the deity, and other rituals enacted, and a special group of [[clergy]] maintain, and operate the temple.  The degree to which the whole population of believers can access the building varies significantly; often parts or even the whole main building can only be accessed by the clergy.  Temples typically have a main building and a larger [[religious precinct|precinct]], which may contain many other buildings, or may be a dome shaped structure, much like an igloo.\n\nThe word comes from [[Ancient Rome]], where a templum constituted a sacred precinct as defined by a priest, or [[augur]].<ref>{{Cite book | title = Latin Dictionary and Grammar Aid | publisher = University of Notre Dame | date = 26 May 2009 | url = http://www.archives.nd.edu/cgi-bin/lookup.pl?stem=Templum&ending= | accessdate = 24 July 2009}}</ref> It has the same root as the word \"template\", a plan in preparation of the building that was marked out on the ground by the [[augur]]. Templa also became associated with the dwelling places of a god or gods. Despite the specific set of meanings associated with the word, it has now become widely used to describe a house of [[worship]] for any number of religions and is even used for time periods prior to the Romans.\n\n==Mesopotamian temples==\n[[File:Ziggarat of Ur 001.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ziggurat of Ur]], [[Iraq]]]]\nThe temple-building tradition of [[Mesopotamia]] derived from the cults of gods and deities in the [[Mesopotamian religion]]. It spanned several civilizations; from [[Sumer]]ian, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]], [[Assyria]]n, and [[Babylonia]]n. The most common temple architecture of Mesopotamia is the structure of sun-baked bricks called a [[Ziggurat]], having the form of a terraced [[step pyramid]] with a flat upper terrace where the shrine or temple stood.\n\n==Egyptian temples==\n{{main|Egyptian temple}}\n[[File:Luxor, Luxor Temple, inside, at night, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Luxor Temple]], [[Egypt]]]]\n[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were meant as places for the [[Ancient Egyptian deities|deities]] to reside on earth. Indeed, the term the Egyptians most commonly used to describe the temple building, ''\u1e25wt-n\u1e6fr'', means \"mansion (or enclosure) of a god\".<ref>Spencer 1984, p. 22, 44; Snape 1996, p. 9</ref>\n\nA god's [[Divine presence|presence]] in the temple linked the human and divine realms and allowed humans to interact with the god through ritual. These rituals, it was believed, sustained the god and allowed it to continue to play its proper role in nature. They were, therefore, a key part of the maintenance of ''[[maat]]'', the ideal order of nature and of human society in Egyptian belief.<ref>Dunand and Zivie-Coche 2005, pp. 89\u201391</ref> Maintaining ''maat'' was the entire purpose of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]],<ref>Assmann 2001, p. 4</ref> and thus it was the purpose of a temple as well.<ref>Shafer, Byron E., \"Temples, Priests, and Rituals: An Overview\", in Shafer 1997, pp. 1\u20132</ref>\n\n[[Ancient Egypt]]ian temples were also of economic significance to Egyptian society. The temples stored and redistributed grain and came to own large portions of the nation's arable land (some estimate as much as 33% by the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] period).<ref>Andr\u00e9 Dollinger. The Ancient Egyptian Economy. pp. 5 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/The-Ancient-Egyptian-Economy.pdf] Retrieved June 19, 2012</ref> In addition, many of these Egyptian temples utilized the Tripartite Floor Plan in order to draw visitors to the center room.\n\n==Greco-Roman temples==\n{{Main|Greek temple|Roman temple}}\n[[File:Acropolis wide view.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Parthenon]] on the [[Acropolis of Athens]]]]\nThough today we call most Greek religious buildings \"temples,\" the ancient Greeks would have referred to a [[temenos]], or sacred precinct. Its sacredness, often connected with a holy grove, was more important than the building itself, as it contained the open air [[altar]] on which the [[sacrifices]] were made. The building which housed the cult statue in its [[Cella|naos]] was originally a rather simple structure, but by the middle of the 6th century BCE had become increasingly elaborate. Greek temple architecture had a profound influence on ancient architectural traditions.\n\nThe rituals that located and sited Roman temples were performed by an [[augur]] through the observation of the flight of birds or other natural phenomenon. Roman temples usually faced east or toward the rising sun, but the specifics of the orientation are often not known today; there are also notable exceptions, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] which faces north. In [[ancient Rome]] only the native deities of [[Roman mythology]] had a ''templum''; any equivalent structure for a foreign deity was called a ''fanum''.\n\n==Pagan temples==\n{{See also|List of modern pagan temples}}\n[[File:Templo de Garni, Armenia, 2016-10-02, DD 94.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Temple of Garni]], [[Armenia]]]]\nThe Romans usually referred to a holy place of a [[pagan]] religion as ''fanum''; in some cases this referred to a sacred grove, in others to a temple. Medieval Latin writers also sometimes used the word ''templum'', previously reserved for temples of the ancient Roman religion. In some cases it is hard to determine whether a temple was a building or an outdoor shrine. For temple buildings of the Vikings, the [[Old Norse]] term ''[[Heathen hofs|hof]]'' is often used.\n\n==Zoroastrian temples==\n{{Main|Fire temple}}\n[[File:Yazd fire temple.jpg|thumb|200px|The Yazd Atash Behram]]\nA [[Zoroastrian]] temple may also be called a ''Dar-e-mehr'' and an ''[[Fire temple|Atashkadeh]]''. A fire temple in Zoroastrianism is the place of worship for Zoroastrians. Zoroastrians revere [[fire]] in any form, and their temples contains an [[eternal flame]], with [[Atash Behram]] (Fire of Victory) as the highest grade of all, as it combines 16 different types of fire gathered in elaborate rituals.\n\nIn the Zoroastrian religion, fire (Atar), together with clean water (Aban), are agents of ritual purity. Clean, white \"ash for the purification ceremonies is regarded as the basis of ritual life,\" which, \"are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple fire is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity\".\n\n==Hindu temples==\n{{Main|Hindu temple}}\n{{see also|List of Hindu temples}}\n[[File:New Delhi Temple.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Akshardham (Delhi)|Akshardham Temple]], a Hindu temple in [[New Delhi]], [[India]].]]\nHindu temples are known by many different names, varying on region and language, including Alayam,<ref>ALAYAM : The Hindu Temple;An Epitome of Hindu Culture; G.Venkataramana Reddy;  Published by Adhyaksha; Sri Ramakrishna Math; {{ISBN|978-81-7823-542-4}} ; Page 1</ref> ''Mandir'', ''Mandira'', ''Ambalam'', ''Gudi'', ''Kavu'', ''Koil'', ''Kovil'', ''D\u00e9ul'', ''Raul'', ''Devasthana'', Degul, Deva Mandiraya and ''Devalaya''.\n\nA Hindu temple is a symbolic house, the seat and dwelling of [[Hindu gods]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C|year=1946|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=135, context: 40\u201343, 110\u2013114, 129\u2013139 with footnotes}}, Quote: \"The [Hindu] temple is the seat and dwelling of God, according to the majority of the [Indian] names\" (p. 135); \"The temple as Vimana, proportionately measured throughout, is the house and body of God\" (p. 133).</ref> It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together according to [[Hinduism|Hindu faith]]. Inside its [[Garbhagriha]] innermost sanctum, a Hindu temple contains a [[Murti]] or Hindu god's image. Hindu temples are large and magnificent with a rich history. There is evidence of use of sacred ground as far back as the [[Bronze Age]] and later during the [[Indus Valley Civilization]].\n\nOutside of the Indian subcontinent ([[India]], [[Bangladesh]] and [[Nepal]]), Hindu temples have been built in [[List of Hindu temples outside India|various countries around the world]]. Either following the [[Indianized kingdom|historic diffusion of Hinduism across Asia]] (e.g. ancient stone temples of [[Cambodia]] and [[List of Hindu temples in Indonesia|Indonesia]]), or following the migration of the [[Indian diaspora|Indian Hindus' diaspora]]; to Western Europe (esp.

A Buddhist temple might contain a [[meditation]] hall hosting [[Buddharupa]], or the image of [[Buddha]], as the object of concentration and veneration during a meditation. The stupa domed structures are also used in a circumambulation ritual called ''[[Pradakshina]]''.\n\nTemples in [[Buddhism]] represent the pure land or pure environment of a [[Buddha (general)|Buddha]].

They are more akin to the ziggurats of Mesopotamia than to Egyptian ones. A single or several flight(s) of steep steps from the base lead to the temple that stood on the plateau on top of the pyramid. The stone temple might be a square or a rounded structure with a door opening leading to a cella or inner sanctum. The plateau on top of the pyramid in front of the temple is where the ritualistic sacrifice took place.\n\nSome classic Mesoamerican pyramids are adorned with stories about the feathered serpent [[Quetzalcoatl]] or [[Mesoamerican creation myths]], written in the form of hieroglyphs on the rises of the steps of the pyramids, on the walls, and on the sculptures contained within.<ref>{{Cite book |title = Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs |last = Koontz|first = Rex |publisher = Thames and Hudson|year = 2013 |isbn = 9780500290767 |location = New York, New York|pages = }}\n</ref> Notable example include [[Aztec]] [[Santa Cecilia Acatitlan|Acatitlan]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[Chichen Itza]], [[Uxmal]] and [[Tikal]].\n\n==Jewish synagogues and temples==\n[[File:Jerus-n4i.jpg|thumb|200px|A model of [[Herod's Temple]] adjacent to the [[Shrine of the Book]] exhibit at the [[Israel Museum]], Jerusalem.]]\n[[File:Kenessa Vilnius (5970197134).jpg|thumb|200px|The Kenesa in [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]].]]\n\nIn [[Judaism]], the ancient Hebrew texts refer not to temples, the word having not existed yet, but to a \"sanctuary\", \"palace\" or \"hall\". Each of the two ancient temples in Jerusalem was called in the [[Tanakh]] ''Beit YHWH'', which translates literally as \"YHWH's House.\"\n\nThe [[Temple Mount]] in [[Jerusalem]] is the site where the [[First Temple]] of Solomon and the [[Second Temple]] were built. At the center of the structure was the [[Holy of Holies]] where only the [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] could enter. The Temple Mount is now the site of the [[Islamic]] edifice, the [[Dome of the Rock]] (c. 690).\n\nThe Greek word ''[[synagogue]]'' came into use to describe Jewish (and [[Samaritanism|Samaritan]]) places of worship during [[Hellenistic]] times and it, along with the Yiddish term ''[[shul]]'', and the original Hebrew term ''[[Synagogue|Beit Knesset]]'' (\"House of meeting\") are the terms in most universal usage.\n\nSince the 18th Century, Jews in Western and Central Europe began to apply the name \"temple\", borrowed from the French where it was used to denote all non-Catholic prayerhouses, to synagogues. The term became strongly associated with [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] institutions, in some of which both congregants and outsiders associated it with the elimination of the prayers for the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple, though this was not the original meaning\u2014traditional synagogues named themselves \"temple\" over a century before the advent of Reform, and many continued to do so after.<ref>Michael A. Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State University Press, 1995. p. 42.</ref> In American parlance, \"temple\" is often synonymous with \"synagogue\", but especially non-Orthodox ones.\n\nThe term ''[[kenesa]]'', from the Aramaic for \"assembly\", is used to describe the places of worship of [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite Jews]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Christian temples==\n===Orthodox Christianity===\n[[File:Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour-8.jpg|upright|thumb|200px|[[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]].]]\nThe word ''temple'' is used frequently in the tradition of [[Eastern Christianity]]; particularly the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], where the principal words used for houses of worship are ''temple'' and ''church''. The use of the word ''temple'' comes from the need to distinguish ''a building of the church'' vs. ''the church seen as the Body of Christ''. In the [[Russian language]] (similar to other [[Slavic languages]]), while the general-purpose word for \"church\" is ''[[Russian church architecture|tserkov]]'', the term ''khram'' (\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c), \"temple\", is used to refer to the church building as a temple of [[God]] (''Khram Bozhy''). The words \"church\" and \"temple\", in this case are interchangeable; however, the term \"church\" ({{lang-grc|\u1f10\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03af\u03b1}}) is far more common. The term ''temple'' ({{lang-grc|\u03bd\u03b1\u03cc\u03c2}}) is also commonly applied to larger churches. Some famous churches which are referred to as temples include the [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]], the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (Moscow)|Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]] and the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].\n{{clear}}\n\n===Western Christianity===\n[[File:Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur IMG 1271.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-Coeur]] in [[Paris]]]]\nThe word ''temple'' has traditionally been rarely used in the English-speaking [[Western Christian tradition]]. In [[Irish language|Irish]], some [[East\u2013West Schism|pre-schism]] churches use the word ''[[wiktionary:teampall|teampall]]''. The usual word for ''church'' in the [[Hungarian language]] is ''[[wiktionary:templom|templom]]'', also deriving from the same Latin root.  [[Spanish language|Spanish]] distinguishes between the temple being the physical building for religious activity, and the church being both the physical building for religious activity and also the congregation of religious followers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baldayac|first1=Rafael|title=Iglesia y templo: diferencia|url=http://www.lainformacion.com.do/noticias/opinion/columnas/869/iglesia-y-templo:-diferencia|website=La Informacion|accessdate=23 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe principal words typically used to distinguish houses of worship in Western Christian architecture are ''[[abbey]]'', ''[[basilica]]'', ''[[cathedral]]'', ''[[chapel]]'' and ''[[Church (building)|church]]''. The Catholic Church has used the word temple in reference of a place of worship on rare occasions. An example is the Roman Catholic [[Sagrada Familia]] Temple in Barcelona, Spain and the Roman Catholic [[Basilique du Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur]] Temple in Paris, France. Another example is the Temple or Our Lady of the pillar, a church in [[Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]]. Also, some Protestant churches use this term; above main entrance of the [[Lutheran]] Gustav Vasa church in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] is a [[cartouche]] in Latin which reads \u201cthis temple (...) was constructed by king Oscar II.\u201d\n\nBeginning in the late eighteenth century, following the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], some Protestant denominations in France and elsewhere began to use the word ''temple'' to distinguish these spaces from Catholic churches. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and other Protestant churches make use of a wide variety of terms to designate their worship spaces, such as church, [[tabernacle]] or temple. Additionally some [[Breakaway Catholic Churches]] such as the [[Mariavite Church]] in [[Poland]] have chosen to also designate their central church building as a temple, as in the case of the [[Temple of Mercy and Charity]] in [[P\u0142ock]]. \n{{clear}}\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n[[File:KirtlandTemple Ohio USA.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Kirtland Temple]] in Kirtland, Ohio]]\n{{main|Temple (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nAccording to [[Latter Day Saint]]s, in 1832, [[Joseph Smith]] received a [[Revelation#Latter-day Saint concept of revelation|revelation]] to [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restore]] the practice of [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple worship]], in a \"house of the Lord\".

In just a few months, he became [[malnourished]]. In 1904, Camillo fell ill with [[typhoid fever]], and later [[gastroenteritis]]. He moved with his family first to [[Milan]], then to [[Palermo]], to [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Varallo Sesia]] and, finally, to [[Reggio Emilia]].

Three months after the wedding, he was called up for military service, however, he was removed from service due to a serious illness. After three years of military service, he was forced to leave the [[Military Academy of Modena]] because of his [[anti-militarist]] activities. Under protection, he was sent to the front and twice brought before a [[military court]]. In 1919 he was confined to the island of [[Pianosa]] because of his participation in a [[Biennio Rosso|general strike on July 20-21, 1919]]. Dismissed from the army in 1919, he began to work diligently with the [[Umanit\u00e0 Nova|anarchist press]] and participated in the creation of the [[Union of Anarchist Communist of Italy|Union of Italian Anarchists]].<ref> '' Camillo Berneri (Lodi 1897-Barcelona 1937) '', Europe of tomorrow, biographical dictionary </ref> Being a convinced anti-militarist, he wrote: \u201cslaughter, robbery, rape, this is war!

He also made friends with [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Luigi Fabbri]]. \n\nAfter the war, he graduated from the [[University of Florence]], where Camillo was a student of [[Gaetano Salvemini]]. He then became a professor of philosophy at the university and later went on to teach philosophy at [[University of Camerino|Camerino]].\n\nWhen the [[Italian fascists|fascists]] seized power, Camillo refused to be loyal to the regime. Berneri's aversion to [[fascism]] was ready and decisive, he maintained contact with the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[anti-fascists]]. Berneri's activity in the Union of Italian Anarchists was very intense in those years.

He received a residence permit in France only in 1935, shortly before leaving for Spain.

He wrote [[anti-religious]] articles and brochures as well as pieces on the [[Women's rights|emancipation of women]]. He also completed his dissertation, ''The Anti-Semitic Jew'', where he studied the forced or voluntary [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation of Jews]]. The poet [[Andre Speer]], considered this book \u201cof paramount importance\u201d. Other important writings of his during this time were ''Spying'', ''Fascist Spying Abroad'' and ''Mussolini conquering the Balearic Islands''.\n\nHe also wrote about anarchism, where he defends personal positions:\n\n{{quote|We must move away from romanticism.

Together with Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the [[Aragon front]], which were incorporated into the militia column of [[Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso]]. On August 28, 1936, Camillo Berneri took part in [[Battle of Monte Pelado]] near [[Huesca]]: \u201cWe defended our position with 130 people against 600, hardened and with strong weapons, for four hours of battle.\" He eventually needed to leave the front due to medical problems and returned to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhere he created and was editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''Class War'', also collaborating in the CNT-FAI radio station in Barcelona. During his stay in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBerneri came to be under the surveillance of [[OVRA]], the secret police of fascist Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham| first=Helen|title=The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|page=295}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was a staunch defender of the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and was one of the first to argue that only an [[anti-capitalist]] struggle can counter [[fascism]] and that the problem with [[anti-fascism]] is the rejection of the principles of the [[Social revolution]]. He constantly reiterates that revolution must be won on social, not military, grounds. Thus, he opposed the [[Militarism | militarization]] of the militias, which had brought the first victories against state forces. <ref> {{cite book| title = Guerre de Classes en Espagne et textes libertaires|publisher = [[Spartacus Editions]] | date = 1977}}</ref> He stood against those who advocated the idea of \u200b\u200b\u201cfirst beat [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\u201d, and stood for the close connection between the war and the social revolution: \u201cVictory in war is necessary; however, the war will not be won by limiting the problem to the purely military conditions of victory, but by linking them to the political and social conditions of victory.

Berneri worried about the growing isolation of the revolutionary and libertarian achievements in [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Regional Defence Council of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n|other regions]], and fought vigorously for the close connection of war and revolution. Such is the substance of many of his articles and speeches, such as of the famous open letter to the anarchist [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Minister of Health]] [[Federica Montseny]], who with three other anarchists participated in the government of [[Largo Caballero]]: <ref>Camillo Berneri, ''[http://www.theyliewedie.org/ressources/biblio/fr/Berneri_Camillo_ -_Lettre_ouverte_a_la_camarade_Frederica_Montseny.html Lettre ouverte \u00e0 la camarade Frederica Montseny]''</ref>\n\n{{quote|The time has come to understand whether the anarchists in the government are [[vestals]] of the fire, which is about to go out, or whether they now serve only as the [[Phrygian cap]] of politicians, flirting with the enemy or with the forces of restoration of the \"republic of all classes.\" The dilemma of war or revolution no longer makes sense.

On May 5, 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend [[Francesco Barbieri]] were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen.

In just a few months, he became [[malnourished]]. In 1904, Camillo fell ill with [[typhoid fever]], and later [[gastroenteritis]]. He moved with his family first to [[Milan]], then to [[Palermo]], to [[Forl\u00ec]], to [[Varallo Sesia]] and, finally, to [[Reggio Emilia]]. Here, in 1912, Berneri became a member of the ''Reggio Emilia Socialist Youth Federation''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://struggle.ws/spain/berneri.html|title=Camillo Berneri \u2013 Biography of the Italian anarchist|author=|website=struggle.ws|date=2011-05-25|publisher=}}</ref> He joined its Central Committee and collaborated with the federation's national organ. But after intense discussions, in particular with [[Torquato Gobbi]], a bookbinder and member of the ''International Committee of Anarchist Actions'', he left the federation in 1915.

It stems from the metaphysics of socialist romanticism and is not historically proven.\u201d<ref name=\"Aktion\"/> He was struck by the gesture of his comrades, who, despite leaving, wanted him to chair their last meeting in Reggio, and the gesture of his mentor [[Camillo Prampolini]], who called him to find out the reasons for their disagreement.

Three months after the wedding, he was called up for military service, however, he was removed from service due to a serious illness. After three years of military service, he was forced to leave the [[Military Academy of Modena]] because of his [[anti-militarist]] activities. Under protection, he was sent to the front and twice brought before a [[military court]]. In 1919 he was confined to the island of [[Pianosa]] because of his participation in a [[Biennio Rosso|general strike on July 20-21, 1919]]. Dismissed from the army in 1919, he began to work diligently with the [[Umanit\u00e0 Nova|anarchist press]] and participated in the creation of the [[Union of Anarchist Communist of Italy|Union of Italian Anarchists]].<ref> '' Camillo Berneri (Lodi 1897-Barcelona 1937) '', Europe of tomorrow, biographical dictionary </ref> Being a convinced anti-militarist, he wrote: \u201cslaughter, robbery, rape, this is war! To satisfy his lust, the vile person takes on the courage that leaves him when he must save his neighbor from danger or start a dangerous and painful business. In a warmed-up and blood-soaked atmosphere of war, an ordinary person falls into barbarism, and sometimes even turns into a beast.\u201d<ref name=\"Aktion\"/> In 1920, he actively participated in the seizure of factories in [[Northern Italy]]. He also made friends with [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Luigi Fabbri]]. \n\nAfter the war, he graduated from the [[University of Florence]], where Camillo was a student of [[Gaetano Salvemini]]. He then became a professor of philosophy at the university and later went on to teach philosophy at [[University of Camerino|Camerino]].\n\nWhen the [[Italian fascists|fascists]] seized power, Camillo refused to be loyal to the regime. Berneri's aversion to [[fascism]] was ready and decisive, he maintained contact with the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[anti-fascists]]. Berneri's activity in the Union of Italian Anarchists was very intense in those years. When the [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|fascist dictatorship]] intensified, in May 1926, Berneri was forced to flee the country to [[Third French Republic|France]].

On December 11, 1928, he was expelled from France and until 1930 was constantly harassed by the [[Law enforcement in Belgium|Belgian]], [[Law enforcement in France|French]], [[Law enforcement in the Netherlands|Dutch]], [[Law enforcement in Germany|German]] and [[Grand Ducal Police|Luxembourg]] police during subsequent transfers and spent a lot of time in prison. He received a residence permit in France only in 1935, shortly before leaving for Spain. However, he continued to be widely published in the anarchist press in [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Italy]], [[Switzerland]], the [[USA]] and [[Third French Republic|France]]. <ref> {{Cite web | url = http://www.anarca-bolo.ch/cbach/biografie.php? Id = 4 | title = Berneri Camillo Luigi | author = | website = anarca-bolo.ch | date = | publisher =}} </ref>\n\nDespite all his limitations, this period allowed him to read books on various topics such as [[science]], [[psychology]] and [[teleology]]. He wrote [[anti-religious]] articles and brochures as well as pieces on the [[Women's rights|emancipation of women]]. He also completed his dissertation, ''The Anti-Semitic Jew'', where he studied the forced or voluntary [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation of Jews]]. The poet [[Andre Speer]], considered this book \u201cof paramount importance\u201d. Other important writings of his during this time were ''Spying'', ''Fascist Spying Abroad'' and ''Mussolini conquering the Balearic Islands''.\n\nHe also wrote about anarchism, where he defends personal positions:\n\n{{quote|We must move away from romanticism. Look at the masses, I would say, in perspective. There are not homogeneous people, but crowds, diverse, divided into groups. There is no revolutionary will of the masses, but revolutionary moments in which the masses are a huge lever.}}\n\n{{quote|If we want to achieve a significant revision of our revolutionary power, we must get rid of ideological [[a priori]]s and conveniently postponing the solution of tactical and constructive problems for tomorrow.

Together with Rosselli, he organized the first column of Italian volunteers to fight on the [[Aragon front]], which were incorporated into the militia column of [[Joaqu\u00edn Ascaso]]. On August 28, 1936, Camillo Berneri took part in [[Battle of Monte Pelado]] near [[Huesca]]: \u201cWe defended our position with 130 people against 600, hardened and with strong weapons, for four hours of battle.\" He eventually needed to leave the front due to medical problems and returned to Barcelona, \u200b\u200bwhere he created and was editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''Class War'', also collaborating in the CNT-FAI radio station in Barcelona. During his stay in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bBerneri came to be under the surveillance of [[OVRA]], the secret police of fascist Italy.<ref>{{cite book|last=Graham| first=Helen|title=The Spanish Republic at War 1936-1939 | year = 2002 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]|page=295}}</ref>\n\nBerneri was a staunch defender of the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|Spanish Revolution]] and was one of the first to argue that only an [[anti-capitalist]] struggle can counter [[fascism]] and that the problem with [[anti-fascism]] is the rejection of the principles of the [[Social revolution]]. He constantly reiterates that revolution must be won on social, not military, grounds. Thus, he opposed the [[Militarism | militarization]] of the militias, which had brought the first victories against state forces. <ref> {{cite book| title = Guerre de Classes en Espagne et textes libertaires|publisher = [[Spartacus Editions]] | date = 1977}}</ref> He stood against those who advocated the idea of \u200b\u200b\u201cfirst beat [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]\u201d, and stood for the close connection between the war and the social revolution: \u201cVictory in war is necessary; however, the war will not be won by limiting the problem to the purely military conditions of victory, but by linking them to the political and social conditions of victory.

Berneri worried about the growing isolation of the revolutionary and libertarian achievements in [[Revolutionary Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Regional Defence Council of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Sovereign Council of Asturias and Le\u00f3n|other regions]], and fought vigorously for the close connection of war and revolution. Such is the substance of many of his articles and speeches, such as of the famous open letter to the anarchist [[Ministry of Health (Spain)|Minister of Health]] [[Federica Montseny]], who with three other anarchists participated in the government of [[Largo Caballero]]: <ref>Camillo Berneri, ''[http://www.theyliewedie.org/ressources/biblio/fr/Berneri_Camillo_ -_Lettre_ouverte_a_la_camarade_Frederica_Montseny.html Lettre ouverte \u00e0 la camarade Frederica Montseny]''</ref>\n\n{{quote|The time has come to understand whether the anarchists in the government are [[vestals]] of the fire, which is about to go out, or whether they now serve only as the [[Phrygian cap]] of politicians, flirting with the enemy or with the forces of restoration of the \"republic of all classes.\" The dilemma of war or revolution no longer makes sense. The only significant dilemma is this: either victory over Franco through a revolutionary war, or defeat. <ref> Collectif, [http://kropot.free.fr/anarchie-histoire3.htm '' Barcelone, mai 1937 - la contre-r\u00e9volution '', in '' Les Anars des origines \u00e0 hier soir ''], Alternative libertaire, 1996 </ref>}}\n\nIn his 1936 book ''Thought and Battle'', Berneri gave critical comments on the situation, warning of the danger of a [[Stalinist]] coup, and marked his surprise at the \"anarchist government.\" His political suggestions for hitting the operational bases of fascism were numerous, though unheeded, such as [[Proclamation of Independence of Morocco|proclaiming the independence of Morocco]], coordinating military efforts and gradually strengthening socialization. \n\n=== Political assassination ===\n\nBerneri was soon exposing the fierce repressions carried out by Stalinists]] that had prevailed since the advent of the government of [[Juan Negr\u00edn]]: the victims of massacres and disappearances included thousands of non-communists, anarchists and also [[Anti-Stalinist left|non-Stalinist communists]], like the [[POUM]]. On May 5, 1937, Camillo Berneri and his anarchist friend [[Francesco Barbieri]] were taken out of their apartment by a dozen plainclothes men with red armbands and policemen. The corpses of the two Italian anarchists were found riddled with bullets. [[Giovanna Berneri]] raised the children of [[Antonio Cieri]], who also fell in Spain. On Camillo Berneri's death, the [[Italian Socialist Party|socialist]] leader [[Pietro Nenni]] wrote: \"If the anarchist Berneri had fallen on a barricade in Barcelona, \u200b\u200bfighting against the popular government, we would have nothing to say, and in the severity of his destiny we would find the strict law of the revolution.

{"title_page": "Centre (ice hockey)", "text_new": "{{Center|ice hockey position}}\n{{short description|Ice hockey position}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Wayne Gretzky New York Rangers (252547547).jpg|260px|thumb|right|[[Wayne Gretzky]] played his entire NHL career as a centre.]]\nThe '''centre''' (or '''center''' in the [[United States]]) in [[ice hockey]] is a [[forward (hockey)|forward]] position of a player whose primary [[Hockey rink#Zones|zone of play]] is the middle of the ice, away from the sideboards. When he take the puck he always want to find the snuff. The referee is sick in the head, one of that is because he is blind, but he always want the snuff too. He trohws his helm on grandmas and kill to get the last snuff. Centres have more flexibility in their positioning and are expected to cover more ice surface than any other player. Centres are ideally stronger, faster skaters who can [[Checking (ice hockey)|back-check]] quickly from deep in the opposing zone. Generally, centres are expected to be gifted passers more than goal scorers, although there are exceptions.  They are also expected to have exceptional \"ice vision\", intelligence, and creativity. They also generally are the most defensively oriented forwards on the ice. Centres usually play as part of a [[line (ice hockey)|line]] of players that are substituted frequently to keep fresh and keep the game moving.\n\n==Offensive zone play==\nCentres are required to cover much of the ice in all three zones. Where the centre tends to play in the offensive zone is usually a matter of coaching and personal preference. Centres are responsible for keeping the flow of the game moving, and generally handle, and pass the puck more than any other position player. Because of this, most good centres tend to score assists rather than goals because the play goes through them as they try to find open teammates.  His responsibilities in the zone are analogous to the classic number 10 playmaker in soccer.\n\nBecause the range of offensive styles teams like to use, exactly how centres are used in the offensive zone is as varied as the players themselves.  Generally the centre's role on offence is to move the offence through himself, setting up other players, and providing support for puck battles. They roam around most areas of the ice in the zone and have a lot of freedom in decision making. They are also expected to constantly be in motion causing defenders to have a hard time tracking them.\n\n===Zone entry===\nThe matter of bringing the puck in the zone generally is accomplished in two ways. The first involves the team's best puck carrier (usually the centre) using his speed and quickness to cross the blue line with the puck and set up the offence. The second is colloquially called a \"dump in\", in which an attacking player (almost always a defenceman or centre) shoots the puck from the neutral zone into either corner behind the opposing net in hopes that the onrushing wingers can beat the opposing defenders to it and gain control. The centre's role here is to provide support for the wingers if they become engaged in a puck battle, and give the battling winger an option to try to move the puck to, or to try to scoop up loose pucks as they become available.  Once the puck is freed the offence can then set up as normal.\n\n===Behind the net===\nWhen a centre's winger is being attacked along the boards, the centre can take position behind the net to receive the pressured winger's pass. Behind the net is a natural place for some centres to play. It is a very difficult position to defend because it forces the opposing defensemen to leave the front of the net. It also gives the centre a clear view of the ice and most importantly the slot area. From here the centre has clear passing lanes and minimizes the distance and difficulty of passes to nearly any part of the slot.\n\n===In the slot===\n\nMany centres use their mobility and freedom to take advantage of the slot area, the area in between the faceoff dots, about 5 to 15 feet from the goal.  The slot area is notorious goalscoring territory because of its proximity to the net and the difficulty the opposing team has in defending it.  Centres like this area because of its openness.  Possessing the puck here gives the centre many different options, as well as a central position in the offensive play. From here he can choose to shoot the puck on net, attempt to draw defenders away from the net by skating, or find open players closer to the goal cage.\n\nAdditionally, without the puck, the centre can choose to occupy this space looking for deflections of long shots or rebounds.  Centres rarely set up directly in front of the net itself because in case of a turnover, it is much harder to get back in position defensively.\n\n===On the halfboards===\n\nSome centres will play the [[halfboards]].  This position is especially important to a centre on some powerplay sets.  Again it gives the centre a clear view of the ice surface and many different options.  From here he may choose to pass back to a defenceman on the point, go down the boards to a winger behind the net, or drive the net itself hoping to draw defenders to him.  The disadvantage of this position is that it is easily defended, and the centre generally does not have much time to survey the ice looking for an open teammate.\n\n===On the powerplay===\n{{See also|Power play (sporting term)#Ice hockey}}\nPowerplay sets are also quite varied, so the centre's role can range a lot.  Many times though the centre will choose to operate in the slot area or on the halfboards.  The halfboard position here is made easier to play because the centre has more time to look over the ice surface, and is not pressured by the defenders as much.  Again the centre's role is to move the offence through himself/herself looking for passing lanes to open players or roving the slot area looking for deflections and rebounds.\n\n==Neutral zone play==\n===Attacking===\nThe centre's role in the Neutral zone on the attacking side if he/she possesses the puck, is to bring the puck into the offensive zone by carrying or dumping the puck in.  Although any player may carry the puck into the zone, centres are most often counted on because of their speed, quickness, and ability to stickhandle.  If another player possesses the puck attacking into the zone, the centre's job is to provide support if the puck carrier needs to pass to another player across the blue line.  Once the zone has been gained the offence may proceed to set up as they see fit.\n\nOn dump ins, the centre's role is to provide support to the wingers as they battle for possession in the corners, and hunt for loose pucks.\n\n===Defending===\n\nMany different strategies have been devised to defend the neutral zone.  Often successfully defending the neutral zone leads to fewer opportunities for the opposing team to have offensive possessions.\n\nHere the centre will mainly focus on skating and shadowing opposing puck carriers to try to force turnovers.  They are responsible for the middle of the ice, and try to cut off long passing lanes to attacking players.  If the defending team successfully does force a turnover, the centre is most often responsible for turning the direction of play around or receiving the first pass from a winger who has successfully forced a turnover.\n\n====The neutral zone trap, pentagon trap, 1-2-2 trap, or zero-forecheck====\n\nWhen playing the trap, the centre typically spearheads the defence by placing himself/herself in the middle of the ice between the red line and blue line in defensive position.  This forces the puck carrier to either side board where the centre and puck side winger close him in, \"trapping\" him/her between the two defending players and the boards.  Here the attacking player has very few options, and generally must retreat to a defenceman, whereupon the defending team can reset the trap.  This tactic was pioneered by the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the late 1990s and has been used extensively in the NHL and all levels of hockey since.\n\n====The left wing lock====\n\nWhen employing the [[left wing lock]] strategy, the centre's role is typically to shadow the puck carrier or provide token pressure in the opposing team's zone to force them to try to pass the puck up ice into the lock.  This is a much older strategy and is less commonly employed at elite levels, however it was most recently used extensively by the 2006 [[Carolina Hurricanes]] on their way to their first [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==Defensive zone play==\nUnlike their offensive responsibilities, the centre's defensive responsibilities are relatively straightforward.   Again the centre must be able to use their skating ability to cover vast portions of the ice, and is responsible for the greatest percentage of ice in their own zone than of any position.\n\n===Defending the slot area===\n\nThe centre's first and foremost responsibility is defending the slot area from opposing forwards.  This is the most difficult area of the ice to defend because of its proximity to the net and its being situated in the middle of the ice.  The centre is not only responsible for the opposing centre, but other forwards who venture into the slot as well.  Like defencemen, centres are often relied upon to block long distance shots while patrolling the slot.  Because there are no boards in the slot area, it is difficult to play physically on opposing forwards so centres must be adept at using their sticks to defend via [[poke checks]], [[sweep checks]], stick lifts, and other stickwork.\n\n===Defending the perimeter===\n\nThe perimeter is an advantageous position for the defence, the boards act as an extra defender and the defending team often will try to enclose a puck carrier between the boards and two or more defenders to force turnovers.  The centre's general responsibility is to provide support to other players that engage opposing puck carriers in puck battles on the boards by giving the primary defender (normally a defenceman in the defensive zone) an outlet to move the puck to if he/she is able to win the puck from the offensive player, though the centre does on occasion participate in these puck battles if they must.\n\n===Breaking out of the zone===\n\nWhen the puck is turned over by the offensive team, the defence must be able to exit the zone fluidly.  In a basic fundamental break-out, the puck is controlled by the defence behind the net who then passes up the boards to a forward.  The centre curls at the strong side faceoff dot and begins to break out alongside the puck carrying winger.  The winger, if undefended, may skate the puck out himself/herself, in which case the centre provides a passing option in the neutral zone, or if the winger is pressured, can make the break-out pass to the centre moving up the ice.  Here the centre can carry the puck out of the zone on their own, or look for the weak side winger coming across centre ice.\n\nA quick break is sometimes used to take advantage of the opponent's sloppy transition game.  In this set, the defenceman directly passes to the centre curling at the faceoff dot.  The centre can then carry the puck out himself/herself or try to pass to the streaking weakside winger up the ice.\n\n===On the penalty kill===\n\nThe penalty killing unit normally consists of two forwards and two defencemen.  The centre's role does not differ appreciably from any other forward, though they are almost always included on the penalty killing unit for the purpose of taking the faceoff.  Depending on what formation the penalty kill uses, the centre along with the other forward on the ice will play high side defence, trying to cut off passing lanes in the slot.  Secondarily, they pressure offensive players on the boards if they do not have clear possession.\n\n== Back checking ==\n\nThe centre should always be prepared for a quick [[breakout (ice hockey)|break-out]] pass by the opposing team.  The centre is expected to play the deepest in the offensive zone but also the first of the forwards to [[Checking (ice hockey)|backcheck]].  On the backcheck, the centre should take the first opposing player not covered (usually \"the [[third man back]]\").\n\n==Faceoffs==\n\nIt is generally the centre's job to handle [[faceoff]]s for their team.  Centres employ many different tactics to win faceoffs that take advantage their strength or swiftness.\n\nFaceoff techniques and preferences vary widely from player to player depending on that player's skill at taking faceoffs, speed, strength, and agility.  Although faceoff techniques differ greatly, it is almost universal now that the centre reverses his lower hand and takes the faceoff on his backhand in order to gain more strength when pulling the puck.\n\nBigger, heavier, and stronger centres may prefer to use strength tactics such as tying up the opposing centre and winning the puck with his feet or overpowering the opponent by ripping the puck away using sheer strength.  Smaller, quicker centres may employ swiftness tactics such as trying to contact the puck before his opponent has a chance to get his stick in the dot, or the slide technique where he allows his opponent access to the dot easily so he can slide his stick underneath and pull the puck back out.\n\nFaceoffs are critical to a team's success on offence or defence. To this end, centres that may be deficient in other areas, especially offensively, can still have value to a team if they are excellent faceoff takers. Journeyman NHL centre [[Yanic Perreault]] was offensively limited for much of his career, yet was able to survive in the NHL due to his excellence in the faceoff circle. Perreault is considered one of the best faceoff men in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthenethockey.com/2010/3/22/1382835/best-and-worst-faceoff-takers|title=Winnipeg Jets Schedule, Roster, News, and Rumors - Arctic Ice Hockey|author=|date=|website=Arctic Ice Hockey}}</ref> Faceoffs are often used as a measure of defensive effectiveness, and good faceoff takers play many minutes on the penalty kill and in late game lead situations where quickly gaining possession of the puck is of vital importance.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Ice hockey centres}}\n\n*[[Defenceman]]\n*[[Winger (ice hockey)|Winger]]\n*[[Forward (ice hockey)|Forward]]\n*[[Rover (ice hockey)]]\n*[[Goaltender]]\n*[[Power forward (ice hockey)|Power forward]]\n*[[List of NHL players]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Podnieks |title=The Complete Hockey Dictionary |publisher=Fenn Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55168-309-6 |ref=harv}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{IceHockeyPositions}}\n\n[[Category:Ice hockey positions]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey strategy]]\n", "text_old": "{{Center|ice hockey position}}\n{{short description|Ice hockey position}}\n{{more citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Wayne Gretzky New York Rangers (252547547).jpg|260px|thumb|right|[[Wayne Gretzky]] played his entire NHL career as a centre.]]\nThe '''centre''' (or '''center''' in the [[United States]]) in [[ice hockey]] is a [[forward (hockey)|forward]] position of a player whose primary [[Hockey rink#Zones|zone of play]] is the middle of the ice, away from the sideboards.

Often successfully defending the neutral zone leads to fewer opportunities for the opposing team to have offensive possessions.\n\nHere the centre will mainly focus on skating and shadowing opposing puck carriers to try to force turnovers.  They are responsible for the middle of the ice, and try to cut off long passing lanes to attacking players.  If the defending team successfully does force a turnover, the centre is most often responsible for turning the direction of play around or receiving the first pass from a winger who has successfully forced a turnover.\n\n====The neutral zone trap, pentagon trap, 1-2-2 trap, or zero-forecheck====\n\nWhen playing the trap, the centre typically spearheads the defence by placing himself/herself in the middle of the ice between the red line and blue line in defensive position.  This forces the puck carrier to either side board where the centre and puck side winger close him in, \"trapping\" him/her between the two defending players and the boards.  Here the attacking player has very few options, and generally must retreat to a defenceman, whereupon the defending team can reset the trap.  This tactic was pioneered by the [[New Jersey Devils]] in the late 1990s and has been used extensively in the NHL and all levels of hockey since.\n\n====The left wing lock====\n\nWhen employing the [[left wing lock]] strategy, the centre's role is typically to shadow the puck carrier or provide token pressure in the opposing team's zone to force them to try to pass the puck up ice into the lock.  This is a much older strategy and is less commonly employed at elite levels, however it was most recently used extensively by the 2006 [[Carolina Hurricanes]] on their way to their first [[Stanley Cup]].\n\n==Defensive zone play==\nUnlike their offensive responsibilities, the centre's defensive responsibilities are relatively straightforward.   Again the centre must be able to use their skating ability to cover vast portions of the ice, and is responsible for the greatest percentage of ice in their own zone than of any position.\n\n===Defending the slot area===\n\nThe centre's first and foremost responsibility is defending the slot area from opposing forwards.  This is the most difficult area of the ice to defend because of its proximity to the net and its being situated in the middle of the ice.  The centre is not only responsible for the opposing centre, but other forwards who venture into the slot as well.  Like defencemen, centres are often relied upon to block long distance shots while patrolling the slot.  Because there are no boards in the slot area, it is difficult to play physically on opposing forwards so centres must be adept at using their sticks to defend via [[poke checks]], [[sweep checks]], stick lifts, and other stickwork.\n\n===Defending the perimeter===\n\nThe perimeter is an advantageous position for the defence, the boards act as an extra defender and the defending team often will try to enclose a puck carrier between the boards and two or more defenders to force turnovers.  The centre's general responsibility is to provide support to other players that engage opposing puck carriers in puck battles on the boards by giving the primary defender (normally a defenceman in the defensive zone) an outlet to move the puck to if he/she is able to win the puck from the offensive player, though the centre does on occasion participate in these puck battles if they must.\n\n===Breaking out of the zone===\n\nWhen the puck is turned over by the offensive team, the defence must be able to exit the zone fluidly.  In a basic fundamental break-out, the puck is controlled by the defence behind the net who then passes up the boards to a forward.  The centre curls at the strong side faceoff dot and begins to break out alongside the puck carrying winger.  The winger, if undefended, may skate the puck out himself/herself, in which case the centre provides a passing option in the neutral zone, or if the winger is pressured, can make the break-out pass to the centre moving up the ice.  Here the centre can carry the puck out of the zone on their own, or look for the weak side winger coming across centre ice.\n\nA quick break is sometimes used to take advantage of the opponent's sloppy transition game.  In this set, the defenceman directly passes to the centre curling at the faceoff dot.  The centre can then carry the puck out himself/herself or try to pass to the streaking weakside winger up the ice.\n\n===On the penalty kill===\n\nThe penalty killing unit normally consists of two forwards and two defencemen.  The centre's role does not differ appreciably from any other forward, though they are almost always included on the penalty killing unit for the purpose of taking the faceoff.  Depending on what formation the penalty kill uses, the centre along with the other forward on the ice will play high side defence, trying to cut off passing lanes in the slot.  Secondarily, they pressure offensive players on the boards if they do not have clear possession.\n\n== Back checking ==\n\nThe centre should always be prepared for a quick [[breakout (ice hockey)|break-out]] pass by the opposing team.  The centre is expected to play the deepest in the offensive zone but also the first of the forwards to [[Checking (ice hockey)|backcheck]].  On the backcheck, the centre should take the first opposing player not covered (usually \"the [[third man back]]\").\n\n==Faceoffs==\n\nIt is generally the centre's job to handle [[faceoff]]s for their team.  Centres employ many different tactics to win faceoffs that take advantage their strength or swiftness.\n\nFaceoff techniques and preferences vary widely from player to player depending on that player's skill at taking faceoffs, speed, strength, and agility.  Although faceoff techniques differ greatly, it is almost universal now that the centre reverses his lower hand and takes the faceoff on his backhand in order to gain more strength when pulling the puck.\n\nBigger, heavier, and stronger centres may prefer to use strength tactics such as tying up the opposing centre and winning the puck with his feet or overpowering the opponent by ripping the puck away using sheer strength.  Smaller, quicker centres may employ swiftness tactics such as trying to contact the puck before his opponent has a chance to get his stick in the dot, or the slide technique where he allows his opponent access to the dot easily so he can slide his stick underneath and pull the puck back out.\n\nFaceoffs are critical to a team's success on offence or defence. To this end, centres that may be deficient in other areas, especially offensively, can still have value to a team if they are excellent faceoff takers. Journeyman NHL centre [[Yanic Perreault]] was offensively limited for much of his career, yet was able to survive in the NHL due to his excellence in the faceoff circle. Perreault is considered one of the best faceoff men in history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthenethockey.com/2010/3/22/1382835/best-and-worst-faceoff-takers|title=Winnipeg Jets Schedule, Roster, News, and Rumors - Arctic Ice Hockey|author=|date=|website=Arctic Ice Hockey}}</ref> Faceoffs are often used as a measure of defensive effectiveness, and good faceoff takers play many minutes on the penalty kill and in late game lead situations where quickly gaining possession of the puck is of vital importance.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Ice hockey centres}}\n\n*[[Defenceman]]\n*[[Winger (ice hockey)|Winger]]\n*[[Forward (ice hockey)|Forward]]\n*[[Rover (ice hockey)]]\n*[[Goaltender]]\n*[[Power forward (ice hockey)|Power forward]]\n*[[List of NHL players]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |first=Andrew |last=Podnieks |title=The Complete Hockey Dictionary |publisher=Fenn Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-55168-309-6 |ref=harv}}\n{{Reflist}}\n{{IceHockeyPositions}}\n\n[[Category:Ice hockey positions]]\n[[Category:Ice hockey strategy]]\n", "name_user": "195.196.62.48", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_(ice_hockey)"}

Although there was no formal alliance between Russia and Serbia, their close bilateral links provided Russia with a route into the crumbling Ottoman Empire, where Germany also had significant interests.

The Entente was made up of [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. The Triple Alliance was originally composed of Germany, Austria\u2013Hungary and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], which remained neutral in 1914.\n\nAs the war progressed, each coalition added new members.

Although there was no formal alliance between Russia and Serbia, their close bilateral links provided Russia with a route into the crumbling Ottoman Empire, where Germany also had significant interests.
