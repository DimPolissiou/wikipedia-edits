His reign fell during the [[Time of Troubles]]. He was the only member of [[House of Shuysky]] to become Tsar and the last member of the [[Rurikid dynasty]] to rule until the end of monarchy.\n\n==Life==\nHe was a son of [[Ivan Andreyevich Shuisky]]. Born [[Knyaz|Prince]] Vasili Ivanovich [[Shuisky]], he was descended from sovereign princes of [[Nizhny Novgorod]] and a 20th generation male line descendant of the [[Varangian]] prince [[Rurik]]. He was one of the leading [[boyar]]s of [[Tsardom of Russia]] during the reigns of [[Feodor I of Russia|Feodor I]] and [[Boris Godunov]]. In all the court intrigues of the [[Time of Troubles]], Vasily and his younger brother [[Dmitry Shuisky]] usually acted together and fought as one.{{sfn|Bain|1911}}\n\nIt was he who, in obedience to the secret orders of Tsar-to-be Boris, went to [[Uglich]] to inquire into the cause of the death of the [[Tsarevich]] [[Tsarevich Dmitry Ivanovich of Russia (born 1582)|Dmitry Ivanovich]], the youngest son of [[Ivan the Terrible]], who had perished there in mysterious circumstances. Shuisky reported that it was a case of [[suicide]], though rumors abounded that the Tsarevich had been assassinated on the orders of the regent [[Boris Godunov]]. Some suspected that Dmitry escaped the assassination and that another boy was killed in his place, providing impetus for the repeated appearance of [[impostors]] (See [[False Dmitry I]], [[False Dmitry II]], and [[False Dmitry III]]). On the death of [[Boris Godunov|Boris]], who had become tsar, and the accession of his son [[Feodor II of Russia|Feodor II]], Shuisky went back upon his own words in order to gain favour with the pretender [[False Dmitriy I]], who was attempting to gain the throne by impersonating the dead Tsarevich. Shuisky recognized the pretender as the \"real\" Dmitry despite having earlier determined the boy had committed suicide, thus bringing about the assassination of the young Feodor.{{sfn|Bain|1911}}\n\nShuisky then turned against the false Dmitriy and brought about his death (in May 1606) by stating that the real Dmitriy had indeed  been slain and that the reigning tsar Dmitriy was an [[impostor]]. After Dmitriy's death Shuisky's adherents proclaimed him [[tsar]], on 19 May 1606. He reigned until 19 July 1610, but was never generally recognized. Even in [[Moscow]] itself he had little or no authority, and he only avoided deposition by the dominant [[boyar]]s because they had no one to replace him with.{{sfn|Bain|1911}}\n\nThe popularity of his cousin, Prince [[Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky]], who commanded an army aided by a small allied Swedish army led by [[Jacob de la Gardie]], demanding cessions of Russian territory in [[Karelia]] in return, allowed Shuisky, for a time, to remain on his unstable throne. In 1610, he was deposed by his former adherents Princes [[Vorotynsky]] and [[Mstislavsky]]. He was made a [[monk]] and eventually transported together with his two brothers to [[Warsaw]] by the Polish [[hetman]] [[Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski]]. He died a prisoner in the castle of [[Gostynin]], near [[Warsaw]], in 1612,{{sfn|Bain|1911}} followed soon by his brother Dmitry. The [[Romanovs]], elected in 1613, did recognize Vasili posthumously as a legal tsar, and during their negotiations with the Polish authorities constantly demanded the right to rebury his body in Russia. Following the [[Treaty of Polyanovka]] in 1635, Vasili's remains were finally returned to Moscow and laid to rest in the [[Archangel Cathedral]].\n\n==Marriages and issue==\n\nVasili Shuisky was married twice. His first wife, Elena Mikhailovna Repnina, died prior his election to tsardom, and he had no children from that marriage. After his coronation, Vasili remarried Princess [[Maria Buynosova-Rostovskaya|Ekaterina Buynosova-Rostovskaya]], whose name was changed to Maria, deemed more suitable for a tsarina consort. They had two daughters together, Princesses Anna and Anastasia of all the Russias, but both died in infancy during their father's reign, and were buried in the [[Ascension Convent|Old Maiden's Convent]] in Kremlin. As both brothers of Vasili, Princes Dmitri Shuisky and Ivan Shuisky the Button, died also childless, the Shuiskys' princely house became extinct after the death of the latter in 1638.\n\n==In literature==\nThe future Tsar Vasili IV serves as a character in [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[blank verse]] drama ''[[Boris Godunov (play)|Boris Godunov]]'' and [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s [[Boris Godunov (opera)|opera of the same name]].

Pushkin later described his intention to write further plays about the Time of Troubles.\n\nAbout Vasili Shuisky, Pushkin wrote, \"I intend to return to Shuisky also.

The film begins with Pallavaram Paranjothi Pandian ([[RJ Balaji]]) attending an interview for a clerk's post and getting rejected due to lack of money for giving bribes to the officials. Now the story shifts to Nachinarkiniyan aka Iniyan ([[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]]) attending CBI interviews and his friend ([[Kalaiyarasan]]) attending police interviews. Both get rejected due to lack of bribe money for the post. Iniyan's father Porchelvan ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) works as a CBI office clerk. He wants his son to be an officer, hence he pleads for the posting for his son to his higher officials. However, he earned the wrath of his senior official officer Uthaman ([[Suresh Chandra Menon]]), a corrupt official. Once during a raid, he asks for money. Porchelvan did not approve of this and complains about Uthaman in the form of an anonymous letter. Uthaman comes to know about this and exacts revenge by purposely rejecting and humiliating Iniyan at the interview and later asking him to bribe in order to get the job. Iniyan and his father are dejected, and Iniyan's friend is dejected due to his failure in the interview, and he later commits suicide. Iniyan is depressed after all these events and decides to loot money from the corrupted and rich people. He loots black money and tries to reform society, making sure the deserved people get posting in the government departments. He forms a gang with him and starts to heist by posing as CBI and income tax officers. The CBI appoints Kurunjivendhan ([[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]]) to investigate and capture the thieves. Meanwhile, Iniyan falls in love with Madhu ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), and she accepts his marriage proposal. One day, the gang conducts an interview for the CBI (fake). The gang plans to raid a jewelry shop. Uthaman and Kurunjivendhan come to know about this, but learn that they already came and finished the raid. Kurunjivendhan apprehends Iniyan and wants him to be a police inspector,  but he rejects the offer as he believes that even more good can be done if he continued to do his deeds. He then reveals the force with kurunjivendhan is actually the men he gave jobs using the heist money.He escapes the place with ease. Later on we see him escaping abroad with Madhu and all his other accomplices.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Suriya]] as Nachinarkiniyan (Iniyan) / Uthaman\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Madhu\n* [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] as Kurunjivendhan CBI Officer\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Azhagu Meena (Jhansi Rani)\n* [[Nandha Durairaj|Nandha]] as Vetrivel (Maanga Madaiyaa)\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Iniyan's friend\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as 'Pallavaram' Paranjothi Pandian\n* [[Senthil]] as KP\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Muthukumar \"Muthu\"\n* [[Suresh Chandra Menon]] as Uthaman (voice over by [[Gautham Menon]])\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Porchelvan\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as a Hyderabad Income Tax Officer\n* [[Anandaraj]] as Kuthalingam (Gandhi Appa)\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Narayanan\n* [[Meera Mitun]] as Iniyan's friend's wife\n* [[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]] as Azhagu Meena's husband\n* [[Nirosha]] as Kuthalingam's wife\n* [[K.

The film begins with Pallavaram Paranjothi Pandian ([[RJ Balaji]]) attending an interview for a clerk's post and getting rejected due to lack of money for giving bribes to the officials. Now the story shifts to Nachinarkiniyan aka Iniyan ([[Suriya (actor)|Suriya]]) attending CBI interviews and his friend ([[Kalaiyarasan]]) attending police interviews. Both get rejected due to lack of bribe money for the post. Iniyan's father Porchelvan ([[Thambi Ramaiah]]) works as a CBI office clerk. He wants his son to be an officer, hence he pleads for the posting for his son to his higher officials. However, he earned the wrath of his senior official officer Uthaman ([[Suresh Chandra Menon]]), a corrupt official. Once during a raid, he asks for money. Porchelvan did not approve of this and complains about Uthaman in the form of an anonymous letter. Uthaman comes to know about this and exacts revenge by purposely rejecting and humiliating Iniyan at the interview and later asking him to bribe in order to get the job. Iniyan and his father are dejected, and Iniyan's friend is dejected due to his failure in the interview, and he later commits suicide. Iniyan is depressed after all these events and decides to loot money from the corrupted and rich people. He loots black money and tries to reform society, making sure the deserved people get posting in the government departments. He forms a gang with him and starts to heist by posing as CBI and income tax officers. The CBI appoints Kurunjivendhan ([[Karthik Muthuraman|Karthik]]) to investigate and capture the thieves. Meanwhile, Iniyan falls in love with Madhu ([[Keerthy Suresh]]), and she accepts his marriage proposal. One day, the gang conducts an interview for the CBI (fake). The gang plans to raid a jewelry shop. Uthaman and Kurunjivendhan come to know about this, but learn that they already came and finished the raid. Kurunjivendhan apprehends Iniyan and wants him to be a police inspector,  but he rejects the offer as he believes that even more good can be done if he continued to do his deeds. He then reveals the force with kurunjivendhan is actually the men he gave jobs using the heist money.He escapes the place with ease. Later on we see him escaping abroad with Madhu and all his other accomplices.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Suriya]] as Nachinarkiniyan (Iniyan) / Uthaman\n*[[Keerthy Suresh]] as Madhu\n* [[Karthik (actor)|Karthik]] as Kurunjivendhan CBI Officer\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Azhagu Meena (Jhansi Rani)\n* [[Nandha Durairaj|Nandha]] as Vetrivel (Maanga Madaiyaa)\n* [[Kalaiyarasan]] as Iniyan's friend\n* [[RJ Balaji]] as 'Pallavaram' Paranjothi Pandian\n* [[Senthil]] as KP\n* [[Sathyan (Tamil actor)|Sathyan]] as Muthukumar \"Muthu\"\n* [[Suresh Chandra Menon]] as Uthaman (voice over by [[Gautham Menon]])\n* [[Thambi Ramaiah]] as Porchelvan\n* [[Brahmanandam]] as a Hyderabad Income Tax Officer\n* [[Anandaraj]] as Kuthalingam (Gandhi Appa)\n* [[Yogi Babu]] as Narayanan\n* [[Meera Mitun]] as Iniyan's friend's wife\n* [[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]] as Azhagu Meena's husband\n* [[Nirosha]] as Kuthalingam's wife\n* [[K.
