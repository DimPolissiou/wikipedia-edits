Voters chose thirty-two representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[Texas]] was won by incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 40.56% of the popular vote over [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]) with 37.08%. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 22.01% of the popular vote.<ref name=\"results\" /> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> He was the first Democrat to win a presidential election without Texas since its statehood. Despite Bush's ties to the state, this is the closest since [[1976 United States presidential election in Texas|1976]] that Texas has come to voting for a Democratic presidential candidate. This would also be the first time since [[1968 United States presidential election in Texas|1968]] when Texas would back the losing candidate in a presidential election. The same of which would also occur when Texas voted for losing Republican candidates [[Bob Dole]] in [[1996 United States presidential election in Texas|1996]], [[John McCain]] in [[2008 United States presidential election in Texas|2008]], and [[Mitt Romney]] in [[2012 United States presidential election in Texas|2012]].\n\nTexas was one of few states in the U.S where [[Ross Perot]] won any counties, namely [[Irion County, Texas|Irion]], [[Somervell County, Texas|Somervell]], [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson]], and [[Loving County, Texas|Loving]]. Perot was the first third-party candidate to win any Texas counties since [[George Wallace]] in 1968. {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last time these four aforementioned counties have not voted Republican,<ref name=\"How\" /> and the last time a third-party candidate won any of Texas\u2019 counties. Loving County gave Perot his best performance in the country, earning 46.88% of the vote. As contrast, and more typically in modern American politics, [[Starr County, Texas|Starr County]] was Clinton\u2019s strongest outside the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and one of the only two to give him over 80% of the vote, the other being [[Macon County, Alabama]], whilst the Panhandle counties of [[Hansford County, Texas|Hansford]] and [[Ochiltree County, Texas|Ochiltree]] were the third and fourth strongest for Bush nationwide behind the famous bastions of [[Jackson County, Kentucky]] and [[Sioux County, Iowa]].<ref>Dave Leip\u2019s U.S. Election Atlas; [https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/stats.php?year=1992&f=0&off=0&elect=0 1992 Presidential Election Statistics]</ref> \n\nClinton remains the last Democratic candidate to carry these counties: [[Crockett County, Texas|Crockett]], [[Concho County, Texas|Concho]], [[McCulloch County, Texas|McCulloch]], [[Coleman County, Texas|Coleman]], [[Mills County, Texas|Mills]], [[Throckmorton County, Texas|Throckmorton]], [[Briscoe County, Texas|Briscoe]], [[Hays County, Texas|Hays]], [[Hill County, Texas|Hill]], [[Freestone County, Texas|Freestone]], [[Henderson County, Texas|Henderson]], [[Jack County, Texas|Jack]], [[Clay County, Texas|Clay]], [[Montague County, Texas|Montague]], [[Franklin County, Texas|Franklin]], [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar]], [[Upshur County, Texas|Upshur]], [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina]], [[Hardin County, Texas|Hardin]], [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty]], [[Madison County, Texas|Madison]], [[Polk County, Texas|Polk]], [[San Jacinto County, Texas|San Jacinto]], and [[Houston County, Texas|Houston]].<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[George H.

Voters chose thirty-two representatives, or electors to the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], who voted for [[President of the United States|president]] and [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]].\n\n[[Texas]] was won by incumbent President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Texas]]) with 40.56% of the popular vote over [[List of governors of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Arkansas]]) with 37.08%. Businessman [[Ross Perot]] ([[Independent politician|I]]-Texas) finished in third, with 22.01% of the popular vote.<ref name=\"results\" /> Clinton ultimately won the national vote, defeating incumbent President Bush.<ref>{{cite web|title=1992 Presidential General Election Results|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=1992|publisher=U.S. Election Atlas|accessdate=10 June 2012}}</ref> He was the first Democrat to win a presidential election without Texas since its statehood. Despite Bush's ties to the state, this is the closest since [[1976 United States presidential election in Texas|1976]] that Texas has come to voting for a Democratic presidential candidate. This would also be the first time since [[1968 United States presidential election in Texas|1968]] when Texas would back the losing candidate in a presidential election. The same of which would also occur when Texas voted for losing Republican candidates [[Bob Dole]] in [[1996 United States presidential election in Texas|1996]], [[John McCain]] in [[2008 United States presidential election in Texas|2008]], and [[Mitt Romney]] in [[2012 United States presidential election in Texas|2012]].\n\nTexas was one of few states in the U.S where [[Ross Perot]] won any counties, namely [[Irion County, Texas|Irion]], [[Somervell County, Texas|Somervell]], [[Grayson County, Texas|Grayson]], and [[Loving County, Texas|Loving]]. Perot was the first third-party candidate to win any Texas counties since [[George Wallace]] in 1968. {{As of|2016|11|alt=As of the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]]}}, this is the last time these four aforementioned counties have not voted Republican,<ref name=\"How\" /> and the last time a third-party candidate won any of Texas\u2019 counties. Loving County gave Perot his best performance in the country, earning 46.88% of the vote. As contrast, and more typically in modern American politics, [[Starr County, Texas|Starr County]] was Clinton\u2019s strongest outside the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], and one of the only two to give him over 80% of the vote, the other being [[Macon County, Alabama]], whilst the Panhandle counties of [[Hansford County, Texas|Hansford]] and [[Ochiltree County, Texas|Ochiltree]] were the third and fourth strongest for Bush nationwide behind the famous bastions of [[Jackson County, Kentucky]] and [[Sioux County, Iowa]].<ref>Dave Leip\u2019s U.S. Election Atlas; [https://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/stats.php?year=1992&f=0&off=0&elect=0 1992 Presidential Election Statistics]</ref> \n\nClinton remains the last Democratic candidate to carry these counties: [[Crockett County, Texas|Crockett]], [[Concho County, Texas|Concho]], [[McCulloch County, Texas|McCulloch]], [[Coleman County, Texas|Coleman]], [[Mills County, Texas|Mills]], [[Throckmorton County, Texas|Throckmorton]], [[Briscoe County, Texas|Briscoe]], [[Hays County, Texas|Hays]], [[Hill County, Texas|Hill]], [[Freestone County, Texas|Freestone]], [[Henderson County, Texas|Henderson]], [[Jack County, Texas|Jack]], [[Clay County, Texas|Clay]], [[Montague County, Texas|Montague]], [[Franklin County, Texas|Franklin]], [[Lamar County, Texas|Lamar]], [[Upshur County, Texas|Upshur]], [[Angelina County, Texas|Angelina]], [[Hardin County, Texas|Hardin]], [[Liberty County, Texas|Liberty]], [[Madison County, Texas|Madison]], [[Polk County, Texas|Polk]], [[San Jacinto County, Texas|San Jacinto]], and [[Houston County, Texas|Houston]].<ref name=\"How\">Sullivan, Robert David; [http://www.americamagazine.org/content/unconventional-wisdom/how-red-and-blue-map-evolved-over-past-century \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019]; ''America Magazine'' in ''The National Catholic Review''; June 29, 2016</ref>\n[[File:Nafta.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[George H.

The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]]; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it.<ref name=\"hacc1\" />  Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of [[Donn F.

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\n\n=== 1800s ===\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.\u00a0 Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).\n\nHoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals \u201c A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And \u201cA New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cThe Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.\u201d London: Archibald Constable & CO.\n\n=== 1900s ===\nDuring the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or \u201cryu.\u201d<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. \n\nDuring the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of\u00a0 academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.\u00a0 One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.\u00a0 In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. \n\n=== 2000s ===\nMore recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons.

Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.\n\n==Overview==\nHoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.\n\n* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.\n*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.\n* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human\u2019s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man\u2019s evolution as a group-social animal.\n\nThere are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>\n\n* human combative behavior is rooted in man\u2019s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. \n* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. \n* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.\n\nA variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10.

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>\n\n==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==\nIn 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\n=== The Immersion Expeditions ===\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal<ref>https://em3video.com/2020-spring-issue-masters-magazine-frames-video-free-download/</ref>\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2020/03/11/field-notes-sticks-blades-and-movement-along-the-pacific-rim/</ref>\n\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

The word ''[[hoplite]]'', derived from ''hoplon'', is the term for the classical Greek [[warrior]] who carried such a shield.

It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship.\n\n==Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  ==\n\n=== 1800s ===\nSeveral pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active.\u00a0 A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution.\u00a0 Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920).\n\nHoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation. Seeking to introduce more effective forms of close quarter combat to British soldiers Burton wrote two instructional manuals \u201c A Complete System of Bayonet Fighting.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons. 1853. And \u201cA New System of Sword exercise for Infantry.\u201d London: William Clowes and Sons.1876. while the memoir by the ex-Hussar F.J Norman\u2019s\u00a0 \u201cThe Fighting Man of Japan: the training and exercise of the samurai.\u201d London: Archibald Constable & CO.\n\n=== 1900s ===\nDuring the post WWII era the International Hoplology Society (\"IHS\") was established by Major Donn F. Draeger (USMC Ret.) to study the evolution and development of human combative behavior. Draeger had prior research and personal experience of classical fighting systems. Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the [[Marine Corps Martial Arts Program]] (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\" (1963). Here he not only described the morphology of these weapons but explored how they were used by different schools or \u201cryu.\u201d<ref>Masters Magazine Spring 2019 pg 35</ref>. \n\nDuring the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of\u00a0 academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions.\u00a0 One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings.\u00a0 In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies. \n\n=== 2000s ===\nMore recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons.

Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journal<ref>The Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review</ref> focused on the study of combat.\n\n==Overview==\nHoplology encompasses the segment of human culture concerned with weapons, armor, combative accoutrements and fighting systems, in regard to their technical characteristics and the ways in which they interact with the economic, political, social and religious institutions of human societies, and  has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral.\n\n* Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created.\n*Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons.\n* Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human\u2019s combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man\u2019s evolution as a group-social animal.\n\nThere are three widely accepted axioms in hoplological studies.<ref name=\"hoplology.com\"/>\n\n* human combative behavior is rooted in man\u2019s [[Human evolution|evolution]]. \n* humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. \n* the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior.\n\nA variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat.<ref name=\"Meron Langsner\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dMUXQMBPyq4C&pg=PA112 |first=Meron |last=Langsner|title=Text & Presentation |date=2006 |publisher=McFarland |editor-first=Stratos E. |editor-last=Constantinidi |ISBN=0786455411 |chapter=Chapter 10.

The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \"\u2026the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.<ref>Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print</ref>\n\n==Current Trends - The New Hoplology==\nIn 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \"[https://www.TheImmersionMedia.com New Hoplology]\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods). They are not meant to replace longer ethnographic research but to enhance and support other forms of research. \n\n=== The Immersion Expeditions ===\nThe multidisciplinary team, under the flag of the New Hoplology has organized the following expeditions to date\n\n# Bajan Sticklicking in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# Trinidadian Kalinda and Toboggan Jab Jab in the Caribbean<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2019/03/14/the-new-hoplology-stick-machete-and-whip-fighting-in-the-caribbean/</ref>\n# [[Jogo do pau|Jogo De Pau]] expedition in Fafe, Portugal<ref>https://em3video.com/2020-spring-issue-masters-magazine-frames-video-free-download/</ref>\n# [[Arnis|Eskrima]] in  Philippines \n# Maori Wrestling arts of Rongomomau<ref>https://chinesemartialstudies.com/2020/03/11/field-notes-sticks-blades-and-movement-along-the-pacific-rim/</ref>\n\nThe first of these interdisciplinary expeditions was a roaring success in terms of collecting over 80 hours of film in a seldom seen art of  [[Bajan stick-licking|Bajan Sticklicking]].

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km|order=flip}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km|order=flip}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km|order=flip}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.

Eighty-nine of the total orders were A340 models.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\"/> At McDonnell Douglas, ongoing tests of the MD-11 revealed a significant shortfall in the aircraft's performance.

From the moment of formation, Airbus had begun studies into derivatives of the Airbus A300B in support of this long-term goal.<ref>{{harvnb|Wensveen|2007|page=63}}</ref> Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9.<ref name=\"gunston2009\">{{harvnb|Gunston|2009}}</ref> A tenth variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=18}}</ref> It was a smaller aircraft that would be developed into the long-range [[Airbus A310]]. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which resulted in the [[Airbus A320 family]], which was the first digital [[fly-by-wire]] commercial aircraft. The decision to work on the A320, instead of a four-engine aircraft proposed by the Germans, created divisions within Airbus.<ref name=\"N&W p.18\"/> As the SA or \"single aisle\" studies (which later became the successful Airbus A320) underwent development to challenge the successful [[Boeing 737]] and [[Douglas DC-9]] in the single-aisle, [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body airliner]] market, Airbus turned its focus back to the [[wide-body aircraft]] market.\n\nThe A300B11,<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/> a derivative of the A310, was designed upon the availability of \"ten ton\" thrust engines.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=23}}</ref> Using four engines, it would seat between 180 and 200 passengers, and have a range of {{Convert|6000|nmi|km|order=flip}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=59}}</ref> It was deemed a replacement for the less-efficient [[Boeing 707]]s and [[Douglas DC-8]]s still in service.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The A300B11 was joined by another design, the A300B9, which was a larger derivative of the A300. The B9 was developed by Airbus from the early 1970s at a slow pace until the early 1980s. It was essentially a stretched A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful [[turbofan engine]] available at the time.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes.<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> The B9 offered the same [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload as the [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], but it used between 25%<ref name=\"N&W p.23\"/> to 38%<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/business/11air.html?_r=1|title=To Save Fuel, Airlines Find No Speck Too Small|work=The New York Times|last=Maynard|first=Micheline|date=11 June 2008}}</ref> less fuel.

Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,\n<blockquote>North American operators were clearly in favour of a twin[jet], while Asians wanted a quad[jet]. In Europe, opinion was split between the two. The majority of potential customers were in favour of a quad despite the fact, in certain conditions, it is more costly to operate than a twin. They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'\u2014 ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Airbus A330/A340|journal=Flight International|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1997/1997%20-%202917.html|accessdate=26 January 2011|last=Kingsley-Jones|first=Max|date=4 November 1997}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pp=22\u201323}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Design effort===\nThe first specifications of the TA9 and TA11 were released in 1982.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=24}}</ref> While the TA9 had a range of {{convert|3300|nmi|km|order=flip}}, the TA11 range was up to {{Convert|6830|nmi|km|order=flip}}.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> At the same time, Airbus also sketched the TA12, a twin-engine derivative of the TA11, which was optimised for flights of a {{Convert|2000|nmi|km|order=flip}} lesser range.<ref name=\"N&W p.24\"/> By the time of the [[Paris Air Show]] in June 1985, more refinements had been made to the TA9 and TA11, including the adoption of the A320 [[Cockpit|flight deck]], [[fly-by-wire]] (FBW) [[Aircraft flight control system|flight control system]] and [[side-stick]] control.<ref name=\"N&W p.27\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=27}}</ref> Adopting a common cockpit across the new Airbus series allowed operators to make significant cost savings; flight crews would be able to transition from one to another after one week of training.<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\">{{harvnb|Lawrence|Thornton|2005|p=73}}</ref> The TA11 and TA12 would use the front and rear fuselage sections of the A310.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=24}}</ref> Components were modular and also interchangeable with other Airbus aircraft where possible<ref name=\"Lawrence p.73\"/> to reduce production, maintenance and operating costs.\n\n[[File:A340-642 flight deck.jpg|thumb|The A330/A340 shares a common flight deck with the A320.]]\nAirbus briefly considered a [[variable camber wing]]; the concept was that the wing could change its profile to produce the optimum shape for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by [[British Aerospace]] (BAe) at [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and [[Bristol]]. Airbus estimated this would yield a 2% improvement in aerodynamic efficiency.<ref>{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=26}}</ref> However, the plan was later abandoned on grounds of cost and difficulty of development.<ref name=\"Eden p.30\"/>\n\nAirbus had held discussions with [[McDonnell Douglas]] to jointly produce the aircraft, which would have been designated as the ''AM 300''.<ref name=\"N&W p.28\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=28}}</ref> This aeroplane would have combined the wing of the A330 with the fuselage of the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]].<ref name=\"N&W p.28\"/> However, talks were terminated as McDonnell Douglas insisted on the continuation of its [[trijet]] heritage.<ref name=\"auto\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=67}}</ref> Although from the start it was intended that the A340 would be powered by four [[CFM56]]-5 [[turbofan engine]]s, each capable of {{Convert|25000|lbf|kN}},<ref>{{harvnb|Gunston|2009|p=201}}</ref> Airbus had also considered developing the aircraft as a trijet due to the limited power of engines available at the time, namely the [[Rolls-Royce RB211]]-535 and [[Pratt & Whitney JT10D]]-232<ref>{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=36}}</ref> (redesignated PW2000 in December 1980).\n\nAs refinements in the A340's design proceeded, a radical new engine option was offered by International Aero Engines, a group comprising Rolls-Royce, [[Pratt & Whitney]], [[Japanese Aero Engines Corporation]], [[Fiat]] and [[MTU Aero Engines]] (MTU). The [[Nacelle|engine nacelles]] of the superfan engine consisted of provisions to allow a large fan near the rear of the engine. As a result of the superfan cancellation by IAE, the [[CFM56]]-5C4 was used as the sole engine choice instead of there being an alternate option as originally envisioned. The longer-range versions, namely the A340-500 and -600, are powered by [[Rolls-Royce Trent 500]] engines.\n\nOn 27 January 1986, the Airbus Industrie Supervisory Board held a meeting in [[Munich]], [[West Germany]], after which board-chairman [[Franz Josef Strau\u00df]] released a statement, \"Airbus Industrie is now in a position to finalise the detailed technical definition of the TA9, which is now officially designated the A330, and the TA11, now called the A340, with potential launch customer airlines, and to discuss with them the terms and conditions for launch commitments\".<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/> The designations were originally reversed because the airlines believed it illogical for a [[Twinjet|two-engine]] jet airliner to have a \"4\" in its name, whilst a quad-jet would not. On 12 May 1986, Airbus dispatched fresh sale proposals to five prospective airlines including [[Lufthansa]] and [[Swissair]].<ref name=\"N&W p.27\"/>\n\n===Production and testing===\nIn preparations for production of the A330/A340, Airbus's partners invested heavily in new facilities. [[Filton]] was the site of BAE's [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]7&nbsp;million investment in a three-storey technical centre with an extra {{Convert|15000|m2|sqft}} of floor area.<ref name=\"N&W p.51\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=51}}</ref> BAe also spent \u00a35&nbsp;million expanding the [[Broughton, Flintshire|Broughton]] wing production plant by {{cvt|14000|m2|sqft}}<ref name=\"N&W p.51\"/> to accommodate a new production line. However, France saw the biggest changes with [[A\u00e9rospatiale]] starting construction of a new [[French franc|Fr.]]2.5&nbsp;billion ($411&nbsp;million) assembly plant, adjacent to [[Toulouse-Blagnac Airport]], in [[Colomiers]].<ref name=\"N&W p.52\">{{harnvb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=52}}</ref> By November 1988, the first {{cvt|21|m|ft|adj=on}} pillars were erected for the new ''[[Cl\u00e9ment Ader]]'' assembly hall.<ref name=\"N&W p.52\"/> The assembly process, meanwhile, would feature increased automation with holes for the wing-fuselage mating process drilled by eight robots.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=53}}</ref> The use of automation for this particular process saved Airbus 20% on labour costs and 5% on time.<ref name=\"N&W p.53\"/>\n\n[[File:Airbus A340-211, Airbus Industrie AN0726637.jpg|thumb|An A340-200 demonstrator at the 1992 [[Farnborough Air Show]]]]\nBritish Aerospace accepted \u00a3450&nbsp;million funding from the UK government, short of the \u00a3750&nbsp;million originally requested.<ref name=\"N&W p.32\">{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|p=32}}</ref> Funds from the French and German governments followed thereafter.
