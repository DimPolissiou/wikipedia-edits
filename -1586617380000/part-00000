It was developed from the twin-seat [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]] in the late 1940s as an all-weather, day/night interceptor.  The aircraft reached operational service in May 1950 with [[Air Defense Command]], replacing the piston-engined [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang]] in the all-weather interceptor role.\n\nThe F-94 was the first operational USAF fighter equipped with an [[afterburner]] and was the first jet-powered all-weather fighter to enter combat during the [[Korean War]] in January 1953.  It had a relatively brief operational life, being replaced in the mid-1950s by the [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] and [[North American F-86D Sabre]]. The last aircraft left active-duty service in 1958 and [[Air National Guard]] service in 1959.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Lockheed YF94-2 USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed YF-94 (S/N 48-373). This was the second aircraft built (from TF-80C)]]\n\nBuilt to a 1948 USAF specification for a radar-equipped interceptor to replace the aging  [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow|F-61 Black Widow]] and [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang]], it was specifically designed to counter the threat of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s new [[Tupolev Tu-4]] bombers (reverse-engineered Boeing B-29). The [[Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk]] had been designated to be the USAF first jet night fighter, but its performance was subpar, and Lockheed was asked to design a jet night fighter on a crash program basis.<ref name=AMI>Coniglio, Serigio. \"F-94 Starfire (Monopama Special File).\" ''Aviation and Marine International'', Issue 34, June 1976.</ref> The F-94 was derived from the TF-80C (later [[Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star|T-33A Shooting Star]]) which was a two-seat trainer version of the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80 Shooting Star]]. A lengthened nose area with guns, radar, and automatic fire control system was added. Since the conversion seemed so simple, a contract was awarded to Lockheed in early 1949, with the first flight on 16 April 1949. The early test YF-94s used 75% of the parts used in the earlier F-80 and T-33As.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\"/>\n\nThe fire control system was the Hughes E-1, which incorporated an AN/APG-33 radar (derived from the AN/APG-3, which directed the [[Convair B-36]]'s tail guns) and a Sperry A-1C computing [[gunsight]].<ref name=\"Hallion p17\">Hallion 1980, p. 17.</ref> This short-range radar system was useful only in the terminal phases of the interception. Most of the operation would be directed using [[ground-controlled interception]], as was the case with the earlier aircraft it replaced.\n\nThe added weight of the electronic equipment required a more powerful engine, so the standard J-33 turbojet engine, which had been fitted to the T-33A, was replaced with an afterburning [[Allison J33]]-A-33. The combination reduced the internal fuel capacity. The F-94 was to be the first US production jet with an [[afterburner (engine)|afterburner]]. The J33-A-33 had standard thrust of {{convert|4,000|lbf|kN}}, and with water injection this was increased to {{convert|5400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} and with afterburning a maximum of {{convert|6,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\">\"Technical Gen\". ''RAF Flying Review'', September 1962, p. 59.</ref> The YF-94A's afterburner had many teething problems with its igniter and the flame stabilization system.<ref name=AMI/>\n\n===Production versions===\n[[File:2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94A-5-LO 49-2548 1952.jpg|thumb|F-94A 49-2548, 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, McGuire AFB, NJ]]\n\nThe initial production model was the '''F-94A''', which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) M3 Browning machine guns mounted in the fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the [[radome]]. Two {{convert|165|usgal|l|adj=on}} drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary [[fighter bomber]] role.<ref name=\"Hallion p17\"/><ref name=\"Fran Lock p294\">Francillon 1982, p. 294.</ref> 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, this was due to the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able to get in and out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.<ref name=\"Isham\">Isham and McLaren (1993)  Lockheed F-94 Starfire, A Photo Chronicale, Schiffer Publishing, Ltd, {{ISBN|0887404510}}</ref>\n\n[[File:61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B-1-LO 50-879 - Side.jpg|thumb|61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B 50-879]]\n\nThe subsequent '''F-94B''', which entered service in January 1951, was outwardly virtually identical to the F-94A.  The Allison J33 turbojet had a number of modifications made, which made it a very reliable engine; the pilot was provided with a more roomy cockpit and the canopy was replaced by a canopy with a bow frame in the center between the two crew members, as well as a new [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS). 356 of these were built. It proved in service to be a very reliable aircraft with relatively few problems.  As they replaced the F-94As in service with the active-duty squadrons, the older models were sent to Lockheed to be re-engined and modified to F-94B standards.  These upgraded F-94A/B aircraft were also modified with a pod under each wing for two additional 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, bringing the total to eight.  These aircraft were then passed along to [[Air National Guard units]] where they served until the end of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\n[[File:F-94 rockets.jpg|thumb|F-94C being armed with 2.75 in (70 mm) [[Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]]s]]\n\nThe '''F-94C Starfire''' was extensively modified from the early F-94 variants. In fact, it was initially designated '''F-97''', but it was ultimately decided to treat it as a new version of the F-94. USAF interest was lukewarm, so Lockheed funded development themselves, converting two F-94B airframes to YF-94C prototypes for evaluation. To improve performance, a completely new, much thinner wing was designed, along with a swept tail surface.  The J33 engine was replaced with a more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J48]], a license-built version of the afterburning [[Rolls-Royce Tay (turbojet)|Rolls-Royce Tay]], which dramatically increased power, producing a dry thrust of {{convert|6350|lbf|kN}} and approximately {{convert|8750|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} with afterburning.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\"/> The fire control system was upgraded to the new Hughes E-5 with an AN/APG-40 radar in a much larger nose. The guns were removed and replaced with all-rocket armament consisting of four groups of six rockets in a ring around the nose. The rockets were carried in four panels that could be hinged upwards and outwards for ground reloading. In flight these rockets were normally hidden aft of {{not a typo|four fold-in}} doors that folded inwards for combat.\n\nAccording to Lockheed test pilot [[Tony LeVier]], the F-94C was capable of supersonic flight in a steep dive with afterburner engaged.<ref>Test Pilot, edited by Harry Schmidt, Mach 2 Books, PO Box 107, Shelton, CT 06484, 1997, p.107</ref>\n\nThe F-94C was the only variant to be officially named '''Starfire'''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} With time, the entire F-94 family has adopted the name.  The first production F-94C aircraft were delivered in July 1951, 387 examples being delivered before May 1954. The largest problem discovered in service was the nose-mounted rockets, which blinded the crew with their smoke and fire.  The most severe problem associated with firing the nose-mounted rockets was that the exhaust could cause a [[flameout]] of the jet engine, which could lead to loss of the aircraft.  Mid-wing rocket pods were added, holding 12 rockets apiece. Most of the time, the nose rockets were not fitted, and the mid-wing pod rockets were the sole armament.  This version of the aircraft was extensively used within the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) air defense system.\n\n[[File:Lockheed YF-94A 48-0356 FA-356 prototype.jpg|thumb|F-94 FA-356]]\n\nAn '''F-94D''' model was proposed as a single-seat [[fighter bomber]], with bombs and rockets under the wings. A single prototype was built, but the model was not accepted for production. The prototype was later used as a testbed for the 20&nbsp;mm (0.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon subsequently used on the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and many others.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Air Defense Command===\nThe primary user of the F-94 were the squadrons of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC), eventually equipping 26 squadrons of interceptors.  The first F-94As were assigned to the [[325th Fighter-All Weather Group]] at [[McChord AFB]] and [[Moses Lake AFB]], Washington.<ref name=\"BF94A\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_1.html  Baugher Lockheed F-94A]</ref>  It replaced the propeller-driven [[F-82F Twin Mustang]]s that were in use by its 317th, 318th, and 319th squadrons.  The F-82s had been pressed into interceptor service in 1949 after the [[Soviet Union]] displayed the [[Tupolev Tu-4]] strategic bomber, a reversed-engineered version of the [[B-29 Superfortress]], some of which had landed and were impounded in the Soviet Far East during [[World War II]].   The F-82Fs proved to be an excellent day/night all-weather interceptor, with long range, but it lacked any logistics support which resulted in a chronic shortage of parts.   The jet-powered F-94As, however, had shorter legs than the F-82s and relied more on [[Ground-controlled interception|Ground Control Interception]] Radar (GCI) sites to vector them to intruding aircraft.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  \n[[File:27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94C-1-LO Starfire 51-13555.jpg|thumb|left|27th FIS F-94C 51-13555 at Griffiss Air Force Base, New York]]\nOnce the 317th was equipped in the Pacific Northwest, ADC then re-equipped its [[52d Fighter-All Weather Group]] at [[McGuire AFB]], New Jersey<ref name=\"BF94A\"/> which also flew F-82Fs and provided air defense of the Northeastern United States.   However, it was during this period that Air Defense Command began dispersing its Fighter-Interceptor squadrons away from their parent groups to individual bases.  During 1950 and 1951, ADC sent F-94As to squadrons of the [[56th Fighter Group]]<ref name=\"BF94A\"/> in the upper Midwest to replace its obsolete [[F-47 Thunderbolt]]s, [[F-51 Mustang]]s, as well as [[F-80 Shooting Star]] and [[F-86A Sabre]] day jet interceptors.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn March 1951, upgraded F-94Bs were received from Lockheed by the [[33d Fighter Wing]] at [[Otis AFB]], Massachusetts, replacing their F-86A Sabres,<ref name=\"BF94B\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_2.html Baugher Lockheed F-94B]</ref> although the last squadron of the wing didn't replace its Sabres until May 1952. Three Federalized [[Air National Guard]] units, the 121st FIS (DC ANG), 142nd FIS (Maine ANG), and 148th FIS (Pennsylvania ANG), received F-94Bs while they served on active duty during the [[Korean War]] call-up to defend the airspace over Washington, D.C. However, these F-94s were retained by the USAF when these ANG squadrons returned to State control in 1952.  Also seven more squadrons received F-94Bs as part of the roll out from Lockheed.<ref name=\"Isham\"/><ref name=\"BF94B\"/>\n\nThree additional squadrons (84th, 436th, and 479th FIS) received F-94Bs in 1953, although these were passed down from squadrons receiving F-94Cs.<ref name=\"BF94B\"/>  Beginning in the summer of 1951, the F-94Cs began coming off the production line, with six squadrons being equipped by May 1954.  Five more squadrons were equipped in FY 54-55 which ended the production run for the interceptor by Lockheed.<ref name=\"Isham\"/><ref name=\"BF94C\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_3.html Baugher Lockheed F-97/F-94C Starfire]</ref>\n\n===Far East Air Force===\nIn the Pacific, [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF) equipped three squadrons with F-94Bs, and Air Defense Command deployed the [[319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] to South Korea to provide a jet air-defense umbrella over the [[Seoul]] area.\n\nThe first shipment of F-94Bs arrived in Japan in March 1951, being assigned to the [[339th Fighter-All Weather Squadron]] at [[Johnson Air Base]].  Also arriving was a mobile training unit from [[Chanute AFB]], Illinois to provide transition training for the [[F-82G Twin Mustang]] pilots into the new jet interceptor.   In May, F-94Bs began to re-equip the 68th FAWS at [[Itazuke Air Base]], while rotating pilots and radar operators to [[Suwon Air Base]] in South Korea where they flew combat missions over [[North Korea]] with the F-82Gs as well as air defense alert over Seoul.   In July, the 4th FAWS began receiving the F-94As at [[Naha Air Base]], Okinawa.   Training for the squadrons proceeded through the summer and in August, the first [[Fifth Air Force]] Operational Readiness Test was held by the 339th FAWS with the F-94.  Various issues with the aircraft, as well as issues with the Ground Control Interception radar graded the test as \"fair\".<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  \n[[File:4th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B 4 plane formation.jpg|thumb|Formation of 4th FIS F-94Bs, Naha AB, Okinawa]]\n[[File:68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B-5-LO 51-5358.jpg|thumb|68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94B 51-5358 at Suwon AB, South Korea]]\nIn early December 1951 the appearance of Communist [[MiG-15]] jets over Seoul raised alarm bells at FEAF Headquarters.   The only interceptors over Seoul were about six F-82Gs along with some Marine Grumman [[F7F Tigercat]]s.  FEAF ordered the 68th to move two F-94Bs to Suwon to supplement the F-82Fs.   The Twin Mustangs along with the F7Fs would continue their armed reconnaissance and weather missions against North Korean targets, while the F-94s would fly interception missions over South Korea and the [[Yellow Sea]].  Care was taken to not fly the Starfires anywhere that a crash would allow the communists access to the wreck if it were shot down.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn January 1952, ADC was ordered to deploy the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the [[25th Air Division]] at [[Larson AFB]], Washington to Japan, and to relieve the 68th FIS at Itazuke.   A detachment of the ADC squadron was sent to [[Misawa AB]] to fly air defense missions over Northern [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] against any intruding Soviet aircraft from [[Sakhalin Island]] or the [[Vladivostok]] area.   At Suwon, the 68th had a total of fifty-eight interceptions during February during nighttime hours.   It was in February 1952 that the first F-94 was lost in a night interception while pursuing an unknown aircraft over the Yellow Sea.  The cause of the loss was unknown. However, a B-26 pilot observed an explosion in the air between the island of Taeyonp'yong-do and the city of Haeju in North Korea.   A search was made for the aircraft and crew,  which continued for almost three months.  It was finally concluded the aircraft had crashed and broken up over the Yellow Sea, with the wreckage settling in deep water with the classified equipment lost at sea.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn March 1952 the 319th FIS began flying operational missions at Suwon, providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) for [[B-29 Superfortress]] missions at night.   The 68th was relieved and reassigned to Japan, but would remain on one-hour alert for possible combat duty over Korea.  In June, the first F-94 contacts against enemy jets was made and the interceptor crews believed at the time that the communists were testing radar-warning equipment.  On several occasions just when they were ready to fire on the enemy aircraft, it would start evasive action that indicated the MiGs were equipped with a form of warning radar (as the F-94s were).<ref name=\"Isham\"/>   Other intercepts would take place over North Korea and the F-94 was credited with several air-to-air victories, including the first jet-vs.-jet night victory against a [[MiG-15]]. One F-94 was listed as lost due to enemy action, six more to non-enemy causes on combat missions, two were declared as missing on a combat mission and three were lost in accidents.<ref>Isham, Marty J. and David R.

Beginning in 1954, the [[F-86D Sabre]] began replacing it in operational service.  By the end of 1954, the Starfires had been returned to the United States for [[Air National Guard]] duty.\n\n===Alaskan Air Command===\nImmediately after World War II ended, most of the [[Eleventh Air Force]] in Alaska was withdrawn, and its assets were concentrated at two bases,  [[Ladd AFB]] near Fairbanks and [[Elmendorf AFB]] near Anchorage.   With the advent of the Soviet Tu-4 and its possessing the Atomic Bomb, US air defense assets were sent to Alaska to guard against a Soviet attack on the United States coming from [[Siberia]].   Chains of Ground Control Radar sites were established under [[Alaskan Air Command]] (AAC), the postwar successor to Eleventh Air Force, and [[P-61 Black Widow]]s were sent in 1948 as long distance interceptor aircraft.  The [[F-82H Twin Mustang]] replaced the war-weary P-61s in 1949.<ref name=\"AAC\">Chloe, John Hale, (1984), Top Cover for America. the Air Force in Alaska. 1920\u20131983, Pictorial Histories Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-933126-47-6}}</ref>\n\nThese propeller-driven interceptors were augmented in 1950 when the [[449th Fighter-All Weather Squadron]] at Ladd AFB began receiving F-94As in mid-1950s.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  The squadron was divided into the F-82 flight and the F-94 flight as the jet interceptors doubled the squadron in size.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, Warren E (October 2003). \"Alaskan Twin Mustangs, North American F-82 Operations in Alaska\". Wings (Sentry Books)</ref>  In Anchorage, the 57th Fighter Group at Elmendorf AFB began sending its [[F-80C Shooting Star]]s back to the Continental United States in batches of four or five as they were replaced by the F-94As.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>   Elmendorf AFB, being located close to the [[Gulf of Alaska]] in the south had much more moderate weather than Ladd AFB, located in Central Alaska where winter temperatures often fell below {{convert|-40|F}}.   Hydraulic fluids would turn to jelly, and the engines in the jets would have starting problems.   Extreme cold weather training for Air Force personnel assigned to Ladd AFB was mandatory in the event of an emergency ejection or even just being outside in the winter, losing a glove, and dropping a wrench or tool.  Skin would freeze upon touching bare metal, and mechanics would have tools \"welded\" to their fingers at times.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n[[File:449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94A-5-LO 49-2531.jpg|thumb|left|449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94A parked outside a hangar at Ladd AFB]]\nThe 449th utilized its F-82Hs as long-range reconnaissance aircraft along the Siberian coastline and the [[Chukchi Peninsula]].  Also the F-82s were flown in a ground support role during maneuvers with the Army forces.  They would also drop bombs on frozen rivers to break up [[ice floe]]s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>  For these missions, the F-94 was totally unsuitable and it also did not have the range for the long distance reconnaissance flights necessary to monitor the Siberian coast.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  Alaska was divided into two areas, the northern part under the [[11th Air Division]], headquartered at Ladd AFB, and had control of the GCI sites in the northern half of the territory.   The [[57th Fighter Group]], based at Elmendorf AFB, was responsible for everything south.<ref name=\"AAC\"/>   In April 1953, the 57th FIG was inactivated and the three squadrons F-94s at Elmendorf AFB became part of the [[10th Air Division]].  Both the 449th FIS and the 57th FIG deployed the F-94s to advance airfields at [[Marks AFB]], near Nome,  along with [[King Salmon Airport]] and [[Galena AFB]] where it stood alert to respond to GCI intruder alerts for unknown aircraft detected intruding on Alaskan airspace.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nThe F-82Hs at Ladd were retired in the summer of 1953 when due to lack of logistics support, the aircraft became too unreliable to keep in the air.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>    The 449th flew the F-94A until F-94Bs became available as hand-me-downs from Elmendorf AFB the 57th FIG was inactivated replaced by the [[10th Air Division]].  There, the 10th AD received new [[F-86D Sabre Interceptor]]s.   The 449th at Ladd sent their F-94As back to the CONUS and [[Air National Guard]] Service.   By the end of 1954, it also was being re-equipped with F-86Ds, with the last of the Starfires also being sent to the Air National Guard.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\n===Northeast Air Command===\n[[Northeast Air Command]] (NEAC) was a command formed in 1950 to administer US-controlled bases in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, that were under long-term lease going back to World War II.    It was responsible for the defense of the northern approaches to North America and also to support transient aircraft of MATS and SAC, all of which came under the collective command and control of the [[64th Air Division]].<ref name=\"NEAC\">[http://lighthousememories.ca/winhttrack_website_copier/www.pinetreeline.org/other/neac.html US Air Defense in the Northeast, Lydus H.

Thule was a staging base at the time for the SAC [[B-36 Peacemaker]] intercontinental bomber, which would proceed from there in wartime to targets in the Soviet Union using the [[great-circle navigation|great circle route]] over the North Pole.

Also in the late 1950s, F-94Cs were passed along to the Air National Guard, supplementing the F-94A/B models.

It was developed from the twin-seat [[Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star]] in the late 1940s as an all-weather, day/night interceptor.  The aircraft reached operational service in May 1950 with [[Air Defense Command]], replacing the piston-engined [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang]] in the all-weather interceptor role.\n\nThe F-94 was the first operational USAF fighter equipped with an [[afterburner]] and was the first jet-powered all-weather fighter to enter combat during the [[Korean War]] in January 1953.  It had a relatively brief operational life, being replaced in the mid-1950s by the [[Northrop F-89 Scorpion]] and [[North American F-86D Sabre]]. The last aircraft left active-duty service in 1958 and [[Air National Guard]] service in 1959.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Lockheed YF94-2 USAF.jpg|thumb|left|Lockheed YF-94 (S/N 48-373). This was the second aircraft built (from TF-80C)]]\n\nBuilt to a 1948 USAF specification for a radar-equipped interceptor to replace the aging  [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow|F-61 Black Widow]] and [[North American F-82 Twin Mustang]], it was specifically designed to counter the threat of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s new [[Tupolev Tu-4]] bombers (reverse-engineered Boeing B-29). The [[Curtiss-Wright XF-87 Blackhawk]] had been designated to be the USAF first jet night fighter, but its performance was subpar, and Lockheed was asked to design a jet night fighter on a crash program basis.<ref name=AMI>Coniglio, Serigio. \"F-94 Starfire (Monopama Special File).\" ''Aviation and Marine International'', Issue 34, June 1976.</ref> The F-94 was derived from the TF-80C (later [[Lockheed T-33A Shooting Star|T-33A Shooting Star]]) which was a two-seat trainer version of the [[Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star|F-80 Shooting Star]]. A lengthened nose area with guns, radar, and automatic fire control system was added. Since the conversion seemed so simple, a contract was awarded to Lockheed in early 1949, with the first flight on 16 April 1949. The early test YF-94s used 75% of the parts used in the earlier F-80 and T-33As.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\"/>\n\nThe fire control system was the Hughes E-1, which incorporated an AN/APG-33 radar (derived from the AN/APG-3, which directed the [[Convair B-36]]'s tail guns) and a Sperry A-1C computing [[gunsight]].<ref name=\"Hallion p17\">Hallion 1980, p. 17.</ref> This short-range radar system was useful only in the terminal phases of the interception. Most of the operation would be directed using [[ground-controlled interception]], as was the case with the earlier aircraft it replaced.\n\nThe added weight of the electronic equipment required a more powerful engine, so the standard J-33 turbojet engine, which had been fitted to the T-33A, was replaced with an afterburning [[Allison J33]]-A-33. The combination reduced the internal fuel capacity. The F-94 was to be the first US production jet with an [[afterburner (engine)|afterburner]]. The J33-A-33 had standard thrust of {{convert|4,000|lbf|kN}}, and with water injection this was increased to {{convert|5400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} and with afterburning a maximum of {{convert|6,000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} thrust.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\">\"Technical Gen\". ''RAF Flying Review'', September 1962, p. 59.</ref> The YF-94A's afterburner had many teething problems with its igniter and the flame stabilization system.<ref name=AMI/>\n\n===Production versions===\n[[File:2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94A-5-LO 49-2548 1952.jpg|thumb|F-94A 49-2548, 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, McGuire AFB, NJ]]\n\nThe initial production model was the '''F-94A''', which entered operational service in May 1950. Its armament was four 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) M3 Browning machine guns mounted in the fuselage with the muzzles exiting just behind the [[radome]]. Two {{convert|165|usgal|l|adj=on}} drop tanks, as carried by the F-80 and T-33, could be carried beneath the wingtips. Alternatively, these could be replaced by {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bombs, giving the aircraft a secondary [[fighter bomber]] role.<ref name=\"Hallion p17\"/><ref name=\"Fran Lock p294\">Francillon 1982, p. 294.</ref> 109 were produced. The F-94A was in operational service for only a brief time as it was originally built, and was not received well by its aircrews. Primarily, this was due to the unreliability of its J33 engine, which caused many ground aborts and was deemed by the crews to be unsafe. The aircraft was judged as unstable and hard to maneuver at high altitude by its pilots. The pilot and radar operator found that the cockpit was too narrow for them to be able to get in and out of the aircraft quickly during alerts and scrambles. The clearance for the ejection seats was too small, resulting in several tragic accidents during emergency ejections.<ref name=\"Isham\">Isham and McLaren (1993)  Lockheed F-94 Starfire, A Photo Chronicale, Schiffer Publishing, Ltd, {{ISBN|0887404510}}</ref>\n\n[[File:61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B-1-LO 50-879 - Side.jpg|thumb|61st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B 50-879]]\n\nThe subsequent '''F-94B''', which entered service in January 1951, was outwardly virtually identical to the F-94A.  The Allison J33 turbojet had a number of modifications made, which made it a very reliable engine; the pilot was provided with a more roomy cockpit and the canopy was replaced by a canopy with a bow frame in the center between the two crew members, as well as a new [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS). 356 of these were built. It proved in service to be a very reliable aircraft with relatively few problems.  As they replaced the F-94As in service with the active-duty squadrons, the older models were sent to Lockheed to be re-engined and modified to F-94B standards.  These upgraded F-94A/B aircraft were also modified with a pod under each wing for two additional 0.50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns, bringing the total to eight.  These aircraft were then passed along to [[Air National Guard units]] where they served until the end of the 1950s.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\n[[File:F-94 rockets.jpg|thumb|F-94C being armed with 2.75 in (70 mm) [[Mk 4/Mk 40 Folding-Fin Aerial Rocket|FFAR]]s]]\n\nThe '''F-94C Starfire''' was extensively modified from the early F-94 variants. In fact, it was initially designated '''F-97''', but it was ultimately decided to treat it as a new version of the F-94. USAF interest was lukewarm, so Lockheed funded development themselves, converting two F-94B airframes to YF-94C prototypes for evaluation. To improve performance, a completely new, much thinner wing was designed, along with a swept tail surface.  The J33 engine was replaced with a more powerful [[Pratt & Whitney J48]], a license-built version of the afterburning [[Rolls-Royce Tay (turbojet)|Rolls-Royce Tay]], which dramatically increased power, producing a dry thrust of {{convert|6350|lbf|kN}} and approximately {{convert|8750|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} with afterburning.<ref name=\"RAF Flying\"/> The fire control system was upgraded to the new Hughes E-5 with an AN/APG-40 radar in a much larger nose. The guns were removed and replaced with all-rocket armament consisting of four groups of six rockets in a ring around the nose. The rockets were carried in four panels that could be hinged upwards and outwards for ground reloading. In flight these rockets were normally hidden aft of {{not a typo|four fold-in}} doors that folded inwards for combat.\n\nAccording to Lockheed test pilot [[Tony LeVier]], the F-94C was capable of supersonic flight in a steep dive with afterburner engaged.<ref>Test Pilot, edited by Harry Schmidt, Mach 2 Books, PO Box 107, Shelton, CT 06484, 1997, p.107</ref>\n\nThe F-94C was the only variant to be officially named '''Starfire'''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} With time, the entire F-94 family has adopted the name.  The first production F-94C aircraft were delivered in July 1951, 387 examples being delivered before May 1954. The largest problem discovered in service was the nose-mounted rockets, which blinded the crew with their smoke and fire.  The most severe problem associated with firing the nose-mounted rockets was that the exhaust could cause a [[flameout]] of the jet engine, which could lead to loss of the aircraft.  Mid-wing rocket pods were added, holding 12 rockets apiece. Most of the time, the nose rockets were not fitted, and the mid-wing pod rockets were the sole armament.  This version of the aircraft was extensively used within the [[Semi Automatic Ground Environment]] (SAGE) air defense system.\n\n[[File:Lockheed YF-94A 48-0356 FA-356 prototype.jpg|thumb|F-94 FA-356]]\n\nAn '''F-94D''' model was proposed as a single-seat [[fighter bomber]], with bombs and rockets under the wings. A single prototype was built, but the model was not accepted for production. The prototype was later used as a testbed for the 20&nbsp;mm (0.79&nbsp;in) [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon subsequently used on the [[F-104 Starfighter]] and many others.\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===Air Defense Command===\nThe primary user of the F-94 were the squadrons of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC), eventually equipping 26 squadrons of interceptors.  The first F-94As were assigned to the [[325th Fighter-All Weather Group]] at [[McChord AFB]] and [[Moses Lake AFB]], Washington.<ref name=\"BF94A\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_1.html  Baugher Lockheed F-94A]</ref>  It replaced the propeller-driven [[F-82F Twin Mustang]]s that were in use by its 317th, 318th, and 319th squadrons.  The F-82s had been pressed into interceptor service in 1949 after the [[Soviet Union]] displayed the [[Tupolev Tu-4]] strategic bomber, a reversed-engineered version of the [[B-29 Superfortress]], some of which had landed and were impounded in the Soviet Far East during [[World War II]].   The F-82Fs proved to be an excellent day/night all-weather interceptor, with long range, but it lacked any logistics support which resulted in a chronic shortage of parts.   The jet-powered F-94As, however, had shorter legs than the F-82s and relied more on [[Ground-controlled interception|Ground Control Interception]] Radar (GCI) sites to vector them to intruding aircraft.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  \n[[File:27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94C-1-LO Starfire 51-13555.jpg|thumb|left|27th FIS F-94C 51-13555 at Griffiss Air Force Base, New York]]\nOnce the 317th was equipped in the Pacific Northwest, ADC then re-equipped its [[52d Fighter-All Weather Group]] at [[McGuire AFB]], New Jersey<ref name=\"BF94A\"/> which also flew F-82Fs and provided air defense of the Northeastern United States.   However, it was during this period that Air Defense Command began dispersing its Fighter-Interceptor squadrons away from their parent groups to individual bases.  During 1950 and 1951, ADC sent F-94As to squadrons of the [[56th Fighter Group]]<ref name=\"BF94A\"/> in the upper Midwest to replace its obsolete [[F-47 Thunderbolt]]s, [[F-51 Mustang]]s, as well as [[F-80 Shooting Star]] and [[F-86A Sabre]] day jet interceptors.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn March 1951, upgraded F-94Bs were received from Lockheed by the [[33d Fighter Wing]] at [[Otis AFB]], Massachusetts, replacing their F-86A Sabres,<ref name=\"BF94B\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_2.html Baugher Lockheed F-94B]</ref> although the last squadron of the wing didn't replace its Sabres until May 1952. Three Federalized [[Air National Guard]] units, the 121st FIS (DC ANG), 142nd FIS (Maine ANG), and 148th FIS (Pennsylvania ANG), received F-94Bs while they served on active duty during the [[Korean War]] call-up to defend the airspace over Washington, D.C. However, these F-94s were retained by the USAF when these ANG squadrons returned to State control in 1952.  Also seven more squadrons received F-94Bs as part of the roll out from Lockheed.<ref name=\"Isham\"/><ref name=\"BF94B\"/>\n\nThree additional squadrons (84th, 436th, and 479th FIS) received F-94Bs in 1953, although these were passed down from squadrons receiving F-94Cs.<ref name=\"BF94B\"/>  Beginning in the summer of 1951, the F-94Cs began coming off the production line, with six squadrons being equipped by May 1954.  Five more squadrons were equipped in FY 54-55 which ended the production run for the interceptor by Lockheed.<ref name=\"Isham\"/><ref name=\"BF94C\">[http://www.joebaugher.com/usaf_fighters/f94_3.html Baugher Lockheed F-97/F-94C Starfire]</ref>\n\n===Far East Air Force===\nIn the Pacific, [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF) equipped three squadrons with F-94Bs, and Air Defense Command deployed the [[319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] to South Korea to provide a jet air-defense umbrella over the [[Seoul]] area.\n\nThe first shipment of F-94Bs arrived in Japan in March 1951, being assigned to the [[339th Fighter-All Weather Squadron]] at [[Johnson Air Base]].  Also arriving was a mobile training unit from [[Chanute AFB]], Illinois to provide transition training for the [[F-82G Twin Mustang]] pilots into the new jet interceptor.   In May, F-94Bs began to re-equip the 68th FAWS at [[Itazuke Air Base]], while rotating pilots and radar operators to [[Suwon Air Base]] in South Korea where they flew combat missions over [[North Korea]] with the F-82Gs as well as air defense alert over Seoul.   In July, the 4th FAWS began receiving the F-94As at [[Naha Air Base]], Okinawa.   Training for the squadrons proceeded though the summer and in August, the first [[Fifth Air Force]] Operational Readiness Test was held by the 339th FAWS with the F-94.  Various issues with the aircraft, as well as issues with the Ground Control Interception radar graded the test as \"fair\".<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  \n[[File:4th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B 4 plane formation.jpg|thumb|Formation of 4th FIS F-94Bs, Naha AB, Okinawa]]\n[[File:68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94B-5-LO 51-5358.jpg|thumb|68th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94B 51-5358 at Suwon AB, South Korea]]\nIn early December 1951 the appearance of Communist [[MiG-15]] jets over Seoul raised alarm bells at FEAF Headquarters.   The only interceptors over Seoul were about six F-82Gs along with some Marine Grumman [[F7F Tigercat]]s.  FEAF ordered the 68th to move two F-94Bs to Suwon to supplement the F-82Fs.   The Twin Mustangs along with the F7Fs would continue their armed reconnaissance and weather missions against North Korean targets, while the F-94s would fly interception missions over South Korea and the [[Yellow Sea]].  Care was taken to not fly the Starfires anywhere that a crash would allow the communists access to the wreck if it were shot down.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn January 1952, ADC was ordered to deploy the 319th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from the [[25th Air Division]] at [[Larson AFB]], Washington to Japan, and to relieve the 68th FIS at Itazuke.   A detachment of the ADC squadron was sent to [[Misawa AB]] to fly air defense missions over Northern [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] against any intruding Soviet aircraft from [[Sakhalin Island]] or the [[Vladivostok]] area.   At Suwon, the 68th had a total of fifty-eight interceptions during February during nighttime hours.   It was in February 1952 that the first F-94 was lost in a night interception while pursuing an unknown aircraft over the Yellow Sea.  The cause of the loss was unknown. However, a B-26 pilot observed an explosion in the air between the island of Taeyonp'yong-do and the city of Haeju in North Korea.   A search was made for the aircraft and crew,  which continued for almost three months.  It was finally concluded the aircraft had crashed and broken up over the Yellow Sea, with the wreckage settling in deep water with the classified equipment lost at sea.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nIn March 1952 the 319th FIS began flying operational missions at Suwon, providing Combat Air Patrols (CAPs) for [[B-29 Superfortress]] missions at night.   The 68th was relieved and reassigned to Japan, but would remain on one-hour alert for possible combat duty over Korea.  In June, the first F-94 contacts against enemy jets was made and the interceptor crews believed at the time that the communists were testing radar-warning equipment.  On several occasions just when they were ready to fire on the enemy aircraft, it would start evasive action that indicated the MiGs were equipped with a form of warning radar (as the F-94s were).<ref name=\"Isham\"/>   Other intercepts would take place over North Korea and the F-94 was credited with several air-to-air victories, including the first jet-vs.-jet night victory against a [[MiG-15]]. One F-94 was listed as lost due to enemy action, six more to non-enemy causes on combat missions, two were declared as missing on a combat mission and three were lost in accidents.<ref>Isham, Marty J. and David R.

Beginning in 1954, the [[F-86D Sabre]] began replacing it in operational service.  By the end of 1954, the Starfires had been returned to the United States for [[Air National Guard]] duty.\n\n===Alaskan Air Command===\nImmediately after World War II ended, most of the [[Eleventh Air Force]] in Alaska was withdrawn, and its assets were concentrated at two bases,  [[Ladd AFB]] near Fairbanks and [[Elmendorf AFB]] near Anchorage.   With the advent of the Soviet Tu-4 and its possessing the Atomic Bomb, US air defense assets were sent to Alaska to guard against a Soviet attack on the United States coming from [[Siberia]].   Chains of Ground Control Radar sites were established under [[Alaskan Air Command]] (AAC), the postwar successor to Eleventh Air Force, and [[P-61 Black Widow]]s were sent in 1948 as long distance interceptor aircraft.  The [[F-82H Twin Mustang]] replaced the war-weary P-61s in 1949.<ref name=\"AAC\">Chloe, John Hale, (1984), Top Cover for America. the Air Force in Alaska. 1920\u20131983, Pictorial Histories Publishing Company, {{ISBN|0-933126-47-6}}</ref>\n\nThese propeller-driven interceptors were augmented in 1950 when the [[449th Fighter-All Weather Squadron]] at Ladd AFB began receiving F-94As in mid-1950s.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  The squadron was divided into the F-82 flight and the F-94 flight as the jet interceptors doubled the squadron in size.<ref name=\"Thompson\">Thompson, Warren E (October 2003). \"Alaskan Twin Mustangs, North American F-82 Operations in Alaska\".

Hydraulic fluids would turn to jelly, and the engines in the jets would have starting problems.   Extreme cold weather training for Air Force personnel assigned to Ladd AFB was mandatory in the event of an emergency ejection or even just being outside in the winter, losing a glove, and dropping a wrench or tool.  Skin would freeze upon touching bare metal, and mechanics would have tools \"welded\" to their fingers at times.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n[[File:449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron Lockheed F-94A-5-LO 49-2531.jpg|thumb|left|449th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-94A parked outside a hangar at Ladd AFB]]\nThe 449th utilized its F-82Hs as long-range reconnaissance aircraft along the Siberian coastline and the [[Chukchi Peninsula]].  Also the F-82s were flown in a ground support role during maneuvers with the Army forces.  They would also drop bombs on frozen rivers to break up [[ice floe]]s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>  For these missions, the F-94 was totally unsuitable and it also did not have the range for the long distance reconnaissance flights necessary to monitor the Siberian coast.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>  Alaska was divided into two areas, the northern part under the [[11th Air Division]], headquartered at Ladd AFB, and had control of the GCI sites in the northern half of the territory.   The [[57th Fighter Group]], based at Elmendorf AFB, was responsible for everything south.<ref name=\"AAC\"/>   In April 1953, the 57th FIG was inactivated and the three squadrons F-94s at Elmendorf AFB became part of the [[10th Air Division]].  Both the 449th FIS and the 57th FIG deployed the F-94s to advance airfields at [[Marks AFB]], near Nome,  along with [[King Salmon Airport]] and [[Galena AFB]] where it stood alert to respond to GCI intruder alerts for unknown aircraft detected intruding on Alaskan airspace.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\nThe F-82Hs at Ladd were retired in the summer of 1953 when due to lack of logistics support, the aircraft became too unreliable to keep in the air.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>    The 449th flew the F-94A until F-94Bs became available as hand-me-downs from Elmendorf AFB the 57th FIG was inactivated replaced by the [[10th Air Division]].  There, the 10th AD received new [[F-86D Sabre Interceptor]]s.   The 449th at Ladd sent their F-94As back to the CONUS and [[Air National Guard]] Service.   By the end of 1954, it also was being re-equipped with F-86Ds, with the last of the Starfires also being sent to the Air National Guard.<ref name=\"Isham\"/>\n\n===Northeast Air Command===\n[[Northeast Air Command]] (NEAC) was a command formed in 1950 to administer US-controlled bases in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, that were under long-term lease going back to World War II.

While there, she discovers, when hearing faint calls for help, that a woman has been buried alive on her property. Wynant tries to inform others of what she has found but nobody believes her, and her family begins to suspect a relapse in her mental condition. Because her hands are nearly crippled by arthritis, she is not able to dig the woman up herself. She tricks a local boy into assisting her by telling him she is digging for a lost earring, but when he is scared by the cries of the buried woman she is forced to tell him the truth, which results in a confrontation with the lad's angry father. While going door-to-door to seek help she encounters the buried woman's husband, who had buried her after striking her on the head with a shovel and thought her dead. Wynant is confined to her home under doctor's orders but, in a fit of desperation, experiences enough recovery from the arthritis to provide strength in her hands. She begins to dig up the buried woman, who is still alive. Just then the murderous husband arrives on the scene, intending to bury his wife's body thoroughly. He comes up behind Wynant and is about to strike her with the shovel when the buried woman grabs Wynant's hand and pulls herself up out of the ground. The husband is petrified, giving the authorities just enough time to arrive on the scene and save Wynant and the buried woman.\n\n==Cast<ref>{{Citation|title=The Screaming Woman|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067721/|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>==\n* [[Olivia De Havilland]] as Laura Wynant\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as Carl Nesbitt\n* [[Laraine Stephens]] as Caroline Wynant\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as George Tresvant\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Dr. Amos Larkin\n* [[Charles Knox Robinson]] as Howard Wynant\n* [[Alexandra Hay]] as Evie Carson\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Ken Bronson\n* Russell Wiggins as Harry Sands\n* [[Gene Andrusco]] as David\n* Joyce Cunningham as Bernice Wilson\n* Jan Arvan as Martin, the Servant\n* Jay Montgomery as Ted Wilson\n* John Alderman as Slater\n\n==Television debuts==\nThe film was first shown in the United States on January 29, 1972, in Sweden on June 23, 1973, and in Great Britain in July 1985.\n\n==Other adaptations==\nA television adaptation more faithful to the source material was broadcast as \"The Screaming Woman\", episode 5 of season 1 of ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', on February 22, 1986.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}1972 NBC show. \n<br />{{Jack Smight}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Screaming Woman, The}}\n[[Category:1972 television films]]\n[[Category:1970s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1972 horror films]]\n[[Category:ABC Movie of the Week]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Horror television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Smight]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ray Bradbury]]\n", "text_old": "{{unsourced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = The Screaming Woman\n| image                = The Screaming Woman.jpg\n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Title card\n| genre                = Horror - Thriller\n| based_on             = A short story by [[Ray Bradbury]]\n| writer               = Merwin Gerard\n| director             = [[Jack Smight]]\n| starring             = [[Olivia de Havilland]]<br>[[Ed Nelson]]<br>[[Laraine Stephens]]<br>[[Joseph Cotten]]\n| music                = [[John Williams]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| producer             = William Frye\n| editor               = Robert F.

Wynant is confined to her home under doctor's orders but, in a fit of desperation, experiences enough recovery from the arthritis to provide strength in her hands. She begins to dig up the buried woman, who is still alive. Just then the murderous husband arrives on the scene, intending to bury his wife's body thoroughly. He comes up behind Wynant and is about to strike her with the shovel when the buried woman grabs Wynant's hand and pulls herself up out of the ground. The husband is petrified, giving the authorities just enough time to arrive on the scene and save Wynant and the buried woman.\n\n==Cast<ref>{{Citation|title=The Screaming Woman|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067721/|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>==\n* [[Olivia De Havilland]] as Laura Wynant\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as Carl Nesbitt\n* [[Laraine Stephens]] as Caroline Wynant\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as George Tresvant\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Dr. Amos Larkin\n* [[Charles Knox Robinson]] as Howard Wynant\n* [[Alexandra Hay]] as Evie Carson\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Ken Bronson\n* Russell Wiggins as Harry Sands\n* [[Gene Andrusco]] as David\n* Joyce Cunningham as Bernice Wilson\n* Jan Arvan as Martin, the Servant\n* Jay Montgomery as Ted Wilson\n* John Alderman as Slater\n\n==Television debuts==\nThe film was first shown in the United States on January 29, 1972, in Sweden on June 23, 1973, and in Great Britain in July 1985.\n\n==Other adaptations==\nA television adaptation more faithful to the source material was broadcast as \"The Screaming Woman\", episode 5 of season 1 of ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', on February 22, 1986.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}1972 NBC show. \n<br />{{Jack Smight}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Screaming Woman, The}}\n[[Category:1972 television films]]\n[[Category:1970s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1972 horror films]]\n[[Category:ABC Movie of the Week]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Horror television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Smight]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ray Bradbury]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screaming_Woman"}
