The song is composed by the title of \"Chernyayev March\". The melody of the song is inspired by the musical poem \"Sunshine\".\n\nThe song \"Chernyayev March\" was first published in 1877 in the newspaper \"Sekydnevny Novinar\" by S.P.Bobekov, and then in 1878 in the collection of songs \"Gusla i pesni\".<ref name=ez>{{cite web |url=https://edinzavet.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/shumimaritsa/|title=\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\n|author=|date=February 11, 2008|website=edinzavet.wordpress.com|publisher=Edin Zavet|access-date=July 26, 2018|quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the song was later changed to \"Shumi Maritsa\", at the play \"Ilyo Voyvoda\".

Covered by the patriotic enthusiasm after the first victories during the Balkan War, the folk poet wrote almost entirely new lyrics of the song, borrowing motifs from his own poem \"''Maritsa rushes bloodily''\" (which would be the first and second line of the song). He published it for the first time on December 4, 1912 with the following editorial note:\n{{Cquote|For a long time, a necessary reference was made to the text of the historic Bulgarian march, written as it is known, by the late Nikola Zhivkov. His rhythm text, which does not always correspond to the music of a march, connects unlucky poems, and these flaws unpleasantly annoy the ear and taste of the singing of Shumi Maritza.

This has led Ivan Vazov to republish the text in his poem \"Songs for Macedonia 1913-1916\" printed in 1916 with the following remark: \n{{Cquote|Unfortunately, today, it was a habit, perhaps our unpardonable tastelessness, Shumi Maritza is sung when it becomes necessary, most of the old stupid text, which we are ashamed of foreigners when they are translated.

He created the song because of his admiration to the personality and charisma of [[Mikhail Chernyayev|General Mikhail Chernyayev]], who commands the Bulgarian volunteers. The song is composed by the title of \"Chernyayev March\". The melody of the song is inspired by the musical poem \"Sunshine\".\n\nThe song \"Chernyayev March\" was first published in 1877 in the newspaper \"Sekydnevny Novinar\" by S.P.Bobekov, and then in 1878 in the collection of songs \"Gusla i pesni\".<ref name=ez>{{cite web |url=https://edinzavet.wordpress.com/2008/02/11/shumimaritsa/|title=\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0438 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0446\u0430\n|author=|date=February 11, 2008|website=edinzavet.wordpress.com|publisher=Edin Zavet|access-date=July 26, 2018|quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe title of the song was later changed to \"Shumi Maritsa\", at the play \"Ilyo Voyvoda\".

Covered by the patriotic enthusiasm after the first victories during the Balkan War, the folk poet wrote almost entirely new lyrics of the song, borrowing motifs from his own poem \"''Maritsa rushes bloodily''\" (which would be the first and second line of the song). He published it for the first time on December 4, 1912 with the following editorial note:\n{{Cquote|For a long time, a necessary reference was made to the text of the historic Bulgarian march, written as it is known, by the late Nikola Zhivkov. His rhythm text, which does not always correspond to the music of a march, connects unlucky poems, and these flaws unpleasantly annoy the ear and taste of the singing of Shumi Maritza. With the ubiquitous admiration that today's warfare arouses on this march, its textual corrections have become imperative to have the world in the mood of its kind.\n|author=[[Ivan Vazov]]\n|source=\n}}\n[[File:Shumi Maritsa, German postcard.jpg|thumb|Shumi Maritsa in a German postcard from [[World War I]].]]\nAnother minor revision was done in 1914. The revision appeared in the poems collection \"Under the Thunder of Victories.\" Because of the [[World War I]], the revision gained small attention. This has led Ivan Vazov to republish the text in his poem \"Songs for Macedonia 1913-1916\" printed in 1916 with the following remark: \n{{Cquote|Unfortunately, today, it was a habit, perhaps our unpardonable tastelessness, Shumi Maritza is sung when it becomes necessary, most of the old stupid text, which we are ashamed of foreigners when they are translated.

During these times, the creator of the lyrics for the song, Ivan Vazov, was considered as a ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]''. In the regime, Shumi Maritsa is considered to be written by a bourgeois poet, performed in bourgeois times, and was reminiscent of the monarchical regime. Even though the anthem was considered bourgeois, there was no indication that the anthem was banned during the regime.<ref name=lnt>{{cite web |url=https://liternet.bg/publish/mdushkova/kritika/shumi.htm#6|title=\u041b\u0418\u0422\u0415\u0420\u0410\u0422\u0423\u0420\u041d\u0418 \u0422\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0421\u0424\u041e\u0420\u041c\u0410\u0426\u0418\u0418 \u041d\u0410 \u0425\u0418\u041c\u041d\u0410 \"\u0428\u0423\u041c\u0418 \u041c\u0410\u0420\u0418\u0426\u0410\"|author=Mira Dushkova|date=January 1, 2008|website=www.pamettanabulgarite.com|publisher= |access-date=August 21, 2018|quote=}}</ref>\n\n=== Proposals of the readoption of the anthem ===\nDuring the discussion for the new constitution of Bulgaria in the 7th Grand National Assembly, there are some proposals submitted for a new anthem.

When the two battalions of the Serbian Army' Danubian Regiment arrived on the battlefield, Captain Benderev as the commander of the Bulgarian Army issued order to take Serbian positions immediately. This attack of the Danube Regiment is the most glorious and most important moment in Bulgarian history.

Nevertheless, he brought with him the regimental flag and, under the sounds of \"Shumi Maritsa\", performed by the regimental music, he led his regiment forward.

The Captainmaster raises his subordinates and the boxing music starts playing \"Shumi Maritza\". This gives forces to the attackers, and the enemy begins escaping, as during the Serbian-Bulgarian War (1885).

The film begins with the title song where the three friends marry Sapna, Rekha and Nisha. They are unhappy with their marriage life because of their mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law respectively. Amar's mother-in-law wants her late husband to be reborn and on the order of a fraud [[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]. She has stopped her daughter from having any physical relations with Amar for over 6 months to achieve the rebirth of her late husband. Meet's wife is a twin and whenever he tries to go near his wife, it turns on his brother-in-law (who is a bodybuilder). The connection between the twins causes great problems like Meet's wife beating him up unintentionally when her brother is beating up some goon. Prem's sister-in-law is very hot yet very silly, she comes to live with them and wants to sleep with her elder sister, forcing Prem to sleep on the couch away from his wife.\n\nOne day they meet in a bar and decide to enjoy their lives together. They decide to go to Amar's village to sell off his family [[Haveli]] (old mansion) and meanwhile have fun with the hot and sexy ladies in the village. When they reach the village, they find out that people are scared of the Haveli. An old man tells them that there used to be a father-daughter duo who lived in the haveli 50 years ago, the daughter, Ragini was very beautiful and many boys were smitten by her beauty but her father never let any guy near her. At the age of 20, Ragini died due to snake bite but her soul still resides in the haveli in search of a man who'll do masti with her. \nThe guys laugh it off and proceed towards the haveli, there they meet a very hot girl who's been living secretly in the haveli as she is alone and has nowhere to go. The boys hire her as their maid and each one starts trying to attract her. Soon it is revealed that she is indeed Ragini and she informs the boys that one of them must have sex with her in order to free her soul and whoever does so will die. The boys get scared and try escaping the mansion but to no avail. Prem commits to doing so in front of Ragini to buy them some time and meanwhile they hire Babu Rangeela, a male prostitute to have sex with Ragini. But on the last moment their wives show up and Ragini turns Babu into a chicken. Ragini makes the boys do weird stuff in front of their wives and in-laws who join them at the haveli so they would leave. When the boys see that their wives are secretly fasting for them even when Ragini depicted them off as such perverts in front of them, they decide to confront Ragini. They meet Ragini and tell her they won't have sex with her and she can't harm them as their wives are fasting for their long lives. Ragini hurts them but they light a fire around her and call her father's spirit to help them. Rather Babu's spirit comes (who was cooked by the three wives) and has sex with Ragini hence satisfying her urge. Babu and Ragini leave the world together and the three couples live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as Amar Saxena\n* [[Vivek Oberoi]] as Meet Mehta\n* [[Aftab Shivdasani]] as Prem Chawla\n* [[Sonali Raut]] as Shiney (special appearance in the song \u201cLipstick Laga ke\u201d)\n* [[Urvashi Rautela]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/hope-ajay-devgn-likes-my-role-in-great-grand-masti-urvashi-rautela/ | title=Hope Ajay Devgn likes my role in \u2018Great Grand Masti\u2019: Urvashi Rautela | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=5 March 2016 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> as Ragini/Shabri (maid)\n* [[Pooja Bose]] as Sapna Amar Saxena\n* [[Mishti]] as Rekha Meet Mehta\n* [[Shraddha Das]] as Nisha Prem Chawla\n* [[Kangna Sharma]] as Prem's sister-in-law<ref>{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/great-grand-masti-to-be-kangna-sharmas-bollywood-debut/ | title=\u2018Great Grand Masti\u2019 to be Kangna Sharma\u2019s Bollywood debut | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=25 August 2015 | accessdate= 16 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Kangna-Sharma-to-make-her-Bollywood-debut-in-Great-Grand-Masti/articleshow/48679483.cms | title=Kangna Sharma to make her Bollywood debut in Great Grand Masti | publisher=[[The Times of India]] | date=26 August 2015 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Usha Nadkarni]] as Amar's mother-in-law\n* Ketan Karande as Meet's brother-in-law\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Antakshari Baba\n* [[Shreyas Talpade]] as Babu Rangeela (special appearance)\n* [[Sudesh Lehri]] as Ramse (cameo)\n* Ghazal Sharma as Ritu (cameo)\n\n==Music==\nThe music for ''Great Grand Masti'' is composed by [[Sanjeev-Darshan]], [[Sharib Sabri|Shaarib]]-[[Toshi Sabri|Toshi]], Superbia ([[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]], Gourov & Roshin).

The film begins with the title song where the three friends marry Sapna, Rekha and Nisha. They are unhappy with their marriage life because of their mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law respectively. Amar's mother-in-law wants her late husband to be reborn and on the order of a fraud [[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]. She has stopped her daughter from having any physical relations with Amar for over 6 months to achieve the rebirth of her late husband. Meet's wife is a twin and whenever he tries to go near his wife, it turns on his brother-in-law (who is a bodybuilder). The connection between the twins causes great problems like Meet's wife beating him up unintentionally when her brother is beating up some goon. Prem's sister-in-law is very hot yet very silly, she comes to live with them and wants to sleep with her elder sister, forcing Prem to sleep on the couch away from his wife.\n\nOne day they meet in a bar and decide to enjoy their lives together. They decide to go to Amar's village to sell off his family [[Haveli]] (old mansion) and meanwhile have fun with the hot and sexy ladies in the village. When they reach the village, they find out that people are scared of the Haveli. An old man tells them that there used to be a father-daughter duo who lived in the haveli 50 years ago, the daughter, Ragini was very beautiful and many boys were smitten by her beauty but her father never let any guy near her. At the age of 20, Ragini died due to snake bite but her soul still resides in the haveli in search of a man who'll do masti with her. \nThe guys laugh it off and proceed towards the haveli, there they meet a very hot girl who's been living secretly in the haveli as she is alone and has nowhere to go. The boys hire her as their maid and each one starts trying to attract her. Soon it is revealed that she is indeed Ragini and she informs the boys that one of them must have sex with her in order to free her soul and whoever does so will die. The boys get scared and try escaping the mansion but to no avail. Prem commits to doing so in front of Ragini to buy them some time and meanwhile they hire Babu Rangeela, a male prostitute to have sex with Ragini. But on the last moment their wives show up and Ragini turns Babu into a chicken. Ragini makes the boys do weird stuff in front of their wives and in-laws who join them at the haveli so they would leave. When the boys see that their wives are secretly fasting for them even when Ragini depicted them off as such perverts in front of them, they decide to confront Ragini. They meet Ragini and tell her they won't have sex with her and she can't harm them as their wives are fasting for their long lives. Ragini hurts them but they light a fire around her and call her father's spirit to help them. Rather Babu's spirit comes (who was cooked by the three wives) and has sex with Ragini hence satisfying her urge. Babu and Ragini leave the world together and the three couples live happily ever after.\n\n==Cast== \n* [[Ritesh Deshmukh]] as Amar Saxena\n* [[Vivek Oberoi]] as Meet Mehta\n* [[Aftab Shivdasani]] as Prem Chawla\n* [[Sonali Raut]] as Shiney (Special Appearance in Song \u201cLipstick Laga ke\u201d)\n* [[Urvashi Rautela]]<ref>{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/hope-ajay-devgn-likes-my-role-in-great-grand-masti-urvashi-rautela/ | title=Hope Ajay Devgn likes my role in \u2018Great Grand Masti\u2019: Urvashi Rautela | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=5 March 2016 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref> as Ragini/Shabri (maid)\n* [[Pooja Bose]] as Sapna Amar Saxena\n* [[Mishti]] as Rekha Meet Mehta\n* [[Shraddha Das]] as Nisha Prem Chawla\n* [[Kangna Sharma]] as Prem's sister-in-law<ref>{{cite news | url=http://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/great-grand-masti-to-be-kangna-sharmas-bollywood-debut/ | title=\u2018Great Grand Masti\u2019 to be Kangna Sharma\u2019s Bollywood debut | publisher=[[The Indian Express]] | date=25 August 2015 | accessdate= 16 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/bollywood/news/Kangna-Sharma-to-make-her-Bollywood-debut-in-Great-Grand-Masti/articleshow/48679483.cms | title=Kangna Sharma to make her Bollywood debut in Great Grand Masti | publisher=[[The Times of India]] | date=26 August 2015 | accessdate=16 July 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Usha Nadkarni]] as Amar's mother-in-law\n* Ketan Karande as Meet's brother-in-law\n* [[Sanjay Mishra (actor)|Sanjay Mishra]] as Antakshari Baba\n* [[Shreyas Talpade]] as Babu Rangeela (special appearance)\n* [[Sudesh Lehri]] as Ramse (cameo)\n* Ghazal Sharma as Ritu (cameo)\n\n==Music==\nThe music for ''Great Grand Masti'' is composed by [[Sanjeev-Darshan]], [[Sharib Sabri|Shaarib]]-[[Toshi Sabri|Toshi]], Superbia ([[Shaan (singer)|Shaan]], Gourov & Roshin).

He was three times holder of the [[Land Speed Record|World Land Speed Record]], in 1938, 1939 and 1947, set at [[Bonneville Speedway]] in [[Utah]], US. He was awarded the [[Segrave Trophy]] in 1947. He was killed in 1952 whilst piloting a jet powered speedboat attempting to break the [[Water Speed Record|World Water Speed Record]] on Loch Ness water in [[Scotland]].   \n\n==Early life==\nCobb was born in the village of [[Esher]], in the county of [[Surrey]], on 2 December 1899, near the [[Brooklands]] motor racing track which he frequented as a boy. He was the son of Florence and Rhodes Cobb, a wealthy furs broker in the City of London. He received his formal education at [[Eton College]] and [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge]], before joining his father's firm and pursuing a successful career as the managing director of a number companies in the trade, the personal financial resources from which he used to fund a passion for large capacimotor high speed racing. In 1924 he acquired a [[Royal Aero Club]] aviator's certificate, qualifying as a pilot on a [[Sopwith Grasshopper]].<ref>Profile of John Cobb, 'The Elmbridge Hundred' website (2020). https://people.elmbridgehundred.org.uk/biographies/john-cobb/</ref>\n\n==Racing and speed records career==\nCobb won his first track race in a 1911 10-litre Fiat in 1925, and raced in the [[Higham Special]] at [[Brooklands]] race track in 1926. \n\nIn 1928 he privately purchased a 10.5-litre ''[[Delage]]'' which was imported to England from the factory in Paris, which he raced at Brooklands from 1929 to 1933, breaking the flying start outer lap Record three times in these years, and being clocked at a top speed of 138.88 miles per hour on 2 July 1932. In 1932 he also won the [[British Empire Trophy]] at Brooklands.<ref>British Movietone Newsreel film of John Cobb winning the British Empire Trophy, 1932, (starts 12.34 mins on the film reel).

He commissioned from ''[[Vospers]]'' the jet-engine powered speedboat ''[[Crusader (speedboat)|Crusader]]'', and selected the long water loch of [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland for the speed trial.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:The start of John Cobb's measured mile. - geograph.org.uk - 209658.jpg|thumb|Start of John Cobb's measured mile where he lost his life]]\nCobb was killed at the age of 52 on 29 September 1952 whilst attempting to break the world Water Speed Record at Loch Ness, piloting ''Crusader'' at a speed in excess of {{cvt|200|mi/h|km/h}}.

It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] and the first mass engagement of [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] and restore a war of movement. Despite improved methods, more ammunition and better equipment, the Franco-British attacks were contained by the German armies, except for local losses of ground. British casualties at Loos were about twice as high as German losses.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic developments===\nThe battle was the British part of the [[Third Battle of Artois]], an Anglo-French offensive (known to the Germans as the {{lang|de|Herbstschlacht}} (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir  [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] (GOC [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]]), regarded the ground south of La Bass\u00e9e Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the front position. At the Fr\u00e9vent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade [[Ferdinand Foch]] that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August, with Joffre siding with Foch and the British commanders being over-ruled by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], the British [[Secretary of State for War]], on 21 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=120\u2013129}} On 3 May, the British decided to use poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate an advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes, despite the terrain, as long as the French and British were able to keep the attack secret.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\nThe battle was the third time that specialist [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]] [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies|tunnelling companies]] were used to dig under no-man's-land, to plant [[mining (military)|mines]] under the parapets of the German front line trenches, ready to be detonated at zero hour.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=162, 252\u2013263}}\n\n===British plan===\n[[File:Battle of Loos, 1915 png.png|thumb|<center>Battle of Loos, 1915</center>]]\nFrench decided to keep a reserve consisting of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]], the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] and [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard Haking]]), which consisted of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and the New Army [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] and [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]], recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). [[Archibald Murray]], the Deputy [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (DCIGS) advised French that as troops fresh from training, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare. French was doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved. Haig and Foch, commander of the {{lang|fr|groupe des arm\u00e9es du nord}} ([[Army Group North (France)|Northern Army Group]]), wanted the reserves closer, to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to move them nearer to the front but still thought they should not be committed until the second day.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=300\u2013302}}\n\nHaig was hampered by the shortage of [[artillery]] ammunition, which meant the preliminary bombardment, essential for success in trench warfare, was insufficient. Prior to the British attack, about {{convert|140|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of chlorine gas was released with mixed results; in places the gas was blown back onto British trenches, while in others it caused the Germans considerable difficulty. Due to the inefficiency of contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on, which led to some being affected by their own gas. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the First Army front. He left most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone to the First Army, which attacked at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 25 September, sending an officer by car to request the release of the reserves at {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}}{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n{{See also|Hohenzollern Redoubt}}\n\n===25 September===\n[[File:Hohenzollern Redoubt October 1915 map.jpg|thumb|<center>Map, Hohenzollern Redoubt, October 1915</center>]]\nIn many places British artillery had failed to cut the German wire before the attack.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=163\u2013167}} Advancing over open fields, within range of German machine guns and artillery, the British suffered many casualties.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=191, 207, 223, 258, 261, 264}} The British were able to break through the weaker German defences and capture the village of [[Loos-en-Gohelle]], mainly due to numerical superiority. Supply and communications problems, combined with the late arrival of reserves, meant that the breakthrough could not be exploited. Haig did not hear until {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} that the divisions were moving up to the front. French visited Haig from {{nowrap|11:00 to 11:30 a.m.}} and agreed that Haig could have the reserve but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking's headquarters and gave the order at {{nowrap|12:10 p.m.}} Haig then heard from Haking at {{nowrap|1:20 p.m.}} that the reserves were moving forward.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n===26\u201328 September===\nWhen the battle resumed the following day, the Germans had recovered and improved their defensive positions. British attempts to continue the advance with the reserves were repulsed.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=304\u2013307}} Twelve attacking battalions suffered {{nowrap|8,000 casualties}} out of {{nowrap|10,000 men}} in four hours.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}} French told Foch on 28 September, that a gap could be \"rushed\" just north of Hill 70, although Foch felt that this would be difficult to co-ordinate and Haig told him that the First Army was in no position for further attacks.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=305\u2013306}} A lull fell on 28 September, with the British having retreated to their starting positions, having lost over {{nowrap|20,000 casualties,}} including three major-generals.{{efn|[[George Thesiger]], [[9th (Scottish) Division]], [[Thompson Capper]], [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Division]] and [[Frederick Wing]] [[12th (Eastern) Division]].}}\n\n===Air operations===\nThe [[Royal Flying Corps]] (RFC) came under the command of Brigadier-General [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|Hugh Trenchard]].{{sfn|Jones|1928|p=124}} The {{nowrap|1st, 2nd and 3rd}} wings under Colonels [[Edward Ashmore (British Army officer)|E. B. Ashmore]], [[John Salmond]] and [[Sefton Brancker]] participated. As the British were short of artillery ammunition, the RFC flew target identification sorties prior to the battle, to ensure that shells were not wasted.{{sfn|Jones|1928|p=125}} During the first few days of the attack, target-marking squadrons equipped with better wireless transmitters, helped to direct British artillery onto German targets.{{sfn|Jones|1928|pp=129\u2013130}} Later in the battle, pilots carried out a [[tactical bombing]] operation for the first time in history. Aircraft of the {{nowrap|2nd and 3rd}} wings dropped many {{convert|100|lb|kg|adj=on}} bombs on German troops, trains, rail lines and marshalling yards.{{sfn|Jones|1928|pp=127\u2013128}} As the land offensive stalled, British pilots and observers flew low over German positions, providing target information to the artillery.{{sfn|Boyle|1962|pp=148\u2013150}}\n\n<!--===MID - Mentioned in Dispatches===\nMaharaja and Sir Jung Bahadur's Grandson (Maharajkumar General Padma Jung's son) was first Indian of [[Gurkha|Nepali-origin]] to be trained as commanding officer at [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|RMAS]] Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

The real tragedy of that battle was its nearness to complete success. Most of us who reached the crest of Hill 70, and survived, were firmly convinced that we had broken through on that Sunday, 26th September 1915. There seemed to be nothing ahead of us, but an unoccupied and incomplete trench system. The only two things that prevented our advancing into the suburbs of Lens were, firstly, the exhaustion of the \"Jocks\" themselves (for they had undergone a bellyfull of marching and fighting that day) and, secondly, the flanking fire of numerous German machine-guns, which swept that bare hill from some factory buildings in Cite St. Auguste to the south of us.

It was the biggest British attack of 1915, the first time that the British used [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]] and the first mass engagement of [[Kitchener's Army|New Army]] units. The French and British tried to break through the German defences in [[County of Artois|Artois]] and [[Champagne (historical province)|Champagne]] and restore a war of movement. Despite improved methods, more ammunition and better equipment, the Franco-British attacks were contained by the German armies, except for local losses of ground. British casualties at Loos were about twice as high as German losses.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Strategic developments===\nThe battle was the British part of the [[Third Battle of Artois]], an Anglo-French offensive (known to the Germans as the {{lang|de|Herbstschlacht}} (Autumn Battle). Field Marshal Sir  [[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|John French]] and [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] (GOC [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]]), regarded the ground south of La Bass\u00e9e Canal, which was overlooked by German-held slag heaps and colliery towers, as unsuitable for an attack, particularly given the discovery in July that the Germans were building a second defensive position behind the front position. At the Fr\u00e9vent Conference on 27 July, Field Marshal French failed to persuade [[Ferdinand Foch]] that an attack further north offered greater prospects for success. The debate continued into August, with Joffre siding with Foch and the British commanders being over-ruled by [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Herbert Kitchener]], the British [[Secretary of State for War]], on 21 August.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=120\u2013129}} On 3 May, the British decided to use poison gas in military operations in France. At a conference on 6 September, Haig announced to his subordinates that extensive use of chlorine gas might facilitate an advance on a line towards Douai and Valenciennes, despite the terrain, as long as the French and British were able to keep the attack secret.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=151\u2013154}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===British offensive preparations===\nThe battle was the third time that specialist [[Royal Engineers|Royal Engineer]] [[Royal Engineer tunnelling companies|tunnelling companies]] were used to dig under no-man's-land, to plant [[mining (military)|mines]] under the parapets of the German front line trenches, ready to be detonated at zero hour.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=162, 252\u2013263}}\n\n===British plan===\n[[File:Battle of Loos, 1915 png.png|thumb|<center>Battle of Loos, 1915</center>]]\nFrench decided to keep a reserve consisting of the [[Cavalry Corps (United Kingdom)|Cavalry Corps]], the [[Indian Cavalry Corps]] and [[XI Corps (United Kingdom)|XI Corps]] (Lieutenant-General [[Richard Haking]]), which consisted of the [[Guards Division (United Kingdom)|Guards Division]] and the New Army [[21st Division (United Kingdom)|21st Division]] and [[24th Division (United Kingdom)|24th Division]], recently arrived in France and a corps staff (some of whom had never worked together or served on a staff before). [[Archibald Murray]], the Deputy [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (DCIGS) advised French that as troops fresh from training, they were suited for the long marches of an exploitation rather than for trench warfare. French was doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved. Haig and Foch, commander of the {{lang|fr|groupe des arm\u00e9es du nord}} ([[Army Group North (France)|Northern Army Group]]), wanted the reserves closer, to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to move them nearer to the front but still thought they should not be committed until the second day.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=300\u2013302}}\n\nHaig was hampered by the shortage of [[artillery]] ammunition, which meant the preliminary bombardment, essential for success in trench warfare, was insufficient. Prior to the British attack, about {{convert|140|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of chlorine gas was released with mixed results; in places the gas was blown back onto British trenches, while in others it caused the Germans considerable difficulty. Due to the inefficiency of contemporary gas masks, many soldiers removed them as they could not see through the fogged-up eyepieces or could barely breathe with them on, which led to some being affected by their own gas. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than {{convert|20|mi|km|abbr=on}} behind the First Army front. He left most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone to the First Army, which attacked at {{nowrap|6:30 a.m.}} on 25 September, sending an officer by car to request the release of the reserves at {{nowrap|7:00 a.m.}}{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n==Battle==\n\n{{See also|Hohenzollern Redoubt}}\n\n===25 September===\n[[File:Hohenzollern Redoubt October 1915 map.jpg|thumb|<center>Map, Hohenzollern Redoubt, October 1915</center>]]\nIn many places British artillery had failed to cut the German wire before the attack.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=163\u2013167}} Advancing over open fields, within range of German machine guns and artillery, the British suffered many casualties.{{sfn|Edmonds|1928|pp=191, 207, 223, 258, 261, 264}} The British were able to break through the weaker German defences and capture the village of [[Loos-en-Gohelle]], mainly due to numerical superiority. Supply and communications problems, combined with the late arrival of reserves, meant that the breakthrough could not be exploited. Haig did not hear until {{nowrap|10:00 a.m.}} that the divisions were moving up to the front. French visited Haig from {{nowrap|11:00 to 11:30 a.m.}} and agreed that Haig could have the reserve but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking's headquarters and gave the order at {{nowrap|12:10 p.m.}} Haig then heard from Haking at {{nowrap|1:20 p.m.}} that the reserves were moving forward.{{sfn|Holmes|1981|pp=302\u2013305}}\n\n===26\u201328 September===\nWhen the battle resumed the following day, the Germans had recovered and improved their defensive positions.

As the British were short of artillery ammunition, the RFC flew target identification sorties prior to the battle, to ensure that shells were not wasted.{{sfn|Jones|1928|p=125}} During the first few days of the attack, target-marking squadrons equipped with better wireless transmitters, helped to direct British artillery onto German targets.{{sfn|Jones|1928|pp=129\u2013130}} Later in the battle, pilots carried out a [[tactical bombing]] operation for the first time in history.

There seemed to be nothing ahead of us, but an unoccupied and incomplete trench system. The only two things that prevented our advancing into the suburbs of Lens were, firstly, the exhaustion of the \"Jocks\" themselves (for they had undergone a bellyfull of marching and fighting that day) and, secondly, the flanking fire of numerous German machine-guns, which swept that bare hill from some factory buildings in Cite St. Auguste to the south of us.
