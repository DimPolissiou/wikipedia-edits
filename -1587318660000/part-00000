She was launched in 1794 and was in active service until 1811. Her most famous action was the capture of the French brig ''Ligurienne'' when shortly after ''Peterel'' captured two merchant ships and sent them off with prize crews, three French ships attacked her. She drove two on shore and captured the largest, the 14-gun ''Ligurienne''. The Navy converted ''Peterel'' to a receiving ship at Plymouth in 1811 and sold her in 1827.\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Peterel'' was part of the six-ship ''Pylades''-class of ship-sloops designed by [[John Henslow (Surveyor of the Navy)|Sir John Henslow]].<ref name=Winfield251>{{Harvnb|Winfield|2007|p=251}}</ref> The ship was built by John Wilson & Company of [[Frindsbury]], and measured 365 {{fract|57|94}} tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]] with a total length of 105ft 1in. She was initially armed with 16 6-pound guns and 4 \u00bd-pounder swivel guns and carried a complement of 121 men. She was later re-armed with sixteen 24-pounder [[carronade]]s on the upper deck, with six 12-pounder carronades on the [[quarterdeck]] and two 12-pounder carronades on the [[forecastle]].  The ship was ordered on 18 February 1793, laid down in May 1793 and launched on 4 April 1794. She moved to [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] to be fitted-out and have her hull [[copper sheathing|covered with copper plates]] between 4 April and July 1794; at her completion she had cost \u00a37,694 to build including fitting.<ref name=Winfield252/>\n\n==Service==\n''Peterel'' was commissioned in April 1794 under [[Commander]] Stephen Church. In October Commander [[Edward Leveson-Gower]] replaced Church, only to be replaced in turn in July 1795 by Commander [[Sir Charles Ogle, 2nd Baronet|Charles Ogle]]. ''Peterel'' was at this stage assigned to the squadron in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]].<ref name=Winfield252/> Commander John Temple succeeded Ogle in January 1796.

After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels.<ref name=Staines/>\n\nBy August Commander Thomas Caulfield had replaced Proby.

She was launched in 1794 and was in active service until 1811. Her most famous action was the capture of the French brig ''Ligurienne'' when shortly after ''Peterel'' captured two merchant ships and sent them off with prize crews, three French ships attacked her. She drove two on shore and captured the largest, the 14-gun ''Ligurienne''. The Navy converted ''Peterel'' to a receiving ship at Plymouth in 1811 and sold her in 1827.\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Peterel'' was part of the six-ship ''Pylades''-class of ship-sloops designed by [[John Henslow (Surveyor of the Navy)|Sir John Henslow]].<ref name=Winfield251>{{Harvnb|Winfield|2007|p=251}}</ref> The ship was built by John Wilson & Company of [[Frindsbury]], and measured 365 {{fract|57|94}} tons [[Builder's Old Measurement|bm]] with a total length of 105ft 1in. She was initially armed with 16 6-pound guns and 4 \u00bd-pounder swivel guns and carried a complement of 121 men. She was later re-armed with sixteen 24-pounder [[carronade]]s on the upper deck, with six 12-pounder carronades on the [[quarterdeck]] and two 12-pounder carronades on the [[forecastle]].  The ship was ordered on 18 February 1793, laid down in May 1793 and launched on 4 April 1794. She moved to [[Chatham Dockyard|Chatham]] to be fitted-out and have her hull [[copper sheathing|covered with copper plates]] between 4 April and July 1794; at her completion she had cost \u00a37,694 to build including fitting.<ref name=Winfield252/>\n\n==Service==\n''Peterel'' was commissioned in April 1794 under [[Commander]] Stephen Church. In October Commander [[Edward Leveson-Gower]] replaced Church, only to be replaced in turn in July 1795 by Commander [[Sir Charles Ogle, 2nd Baronet|Charles Ogle]]. ''Peterel'' was at this stage assigned to the squadron in [[The Downs (ship anchorage)|the Downs]].<ref name=Winfield252/> Commander John Temple succeeded Ogle in January 1796. By 31 May ''Peterel'' had joined [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson's]] squadron patrolling off [[Genoa]]. On that day ''Peterel'' was part of a small squadron under Nelson in {{HMS|Agamemnon|1781|2}} that captured six French vessels that were carrying military supplies from Toulon to St. Piere d'Acena for the [[Siege of Mantua (1796-1797)|siege of Mantua]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=13912|page=682|date=16 July 1796}}</ref> In July she was under the command of Captain Stuart.

The landing party attacked a [[Martello tower]], which they captured, and threw its gun, a long 32-pounder, over the cliff.<ref name=Staines>''The Gentleman's magazine'', (September 1830), pp.277-80.</ref>\n\n''Peterel''{{'}}s next captain, Commander [[William Proby, Lord Proby|William Proby]], took over in March 1797. In June 1797 Proby authorised Staines to take 20 men in two of the ship's boats to cut out a French privateer that had been preying on merchant vessels off the coast of Tuscany. After a skirmish in which the British had five men wounded and the French lost several dead and wounded, the British took the privateer, which had a crew of 45 men and was armed with two long guns and several swivels.<ref name=Staines/>\n\nBy August Commander Thomas Caulfield had replaced Proby. Under Caulfield's command ''Peterel'' was involved in the capture of the French [[privateer]] ''L\u00e9opard'' on 30 April 1798. ''Leopard'' was armed with twelve 6-pounder guns and 14 swivel guns.
