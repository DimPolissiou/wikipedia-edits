On his death, the property transferred to his daughter, the then Mrs. David Castleman who eventually built a mansion on the horse farm site and gave it the family name. Under Mr. & Mrs. Castleman, Castleton Farm continued as a Thoroughbred operation, but would add the breeding of [[American Saddlebred]]s as well as [[Standardbred horse|Standardbreds]] for [[harness racing]].\n\nThe original property changed hands several times, occasionally small parts being divied up and sold to multiple different parties.

(formerly '''LynuxWorks''') is a [[San Jose, California]] software company founded in 1988. Lynx Software Technologies specializes in secure virtualization and open and reliable real-time operating system (RTOS). Originally known as Lynx Real-Time Systems, the company changed its name to LynuxWorks in 2000 after acquiring, and merging with, ISDCorp (Integrated Software & Devices Corporation) a nine-year-old embedded systems company with a strong [[Linux]] background. In May 2014, the company changed its name to Lynx Software Technologies as a representation of the company\u2019s forward direction as the LynxOS RTOS family of products and the LynxSecure hypervisor continued to gain increased traction both with current customers and markets, and with the new Internet connected embedded world.\n\nLynx Software Technologies has created technology that has been successfully deployed in thousands of designs and millions of products made by leading communications, industrial, transportation, avionics, aerospace/defense and consumer electronics companies. In 1989, [[LynxOS]], the company's flagship [[real-time operating system]], was selected for use in the NASA/IBM [[Space Station Freedom]] project.<ref>{{cite web |title=LynuxWorks CEO ascends to visionary role |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7302136246.html |work=[[LinuxDevices.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022120310/http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7302136246.html |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Lynx Software Technologies operating systems are also used in medical, industrial and communications systems around the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Embedded OS: Embedded Operating Systems Applications |url=http://www.lynuxworks.com/embedded-os.php3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219154535/http://www.lynuxworks.com/embedded-os.php3 |archive-date=December 19, 2012 |work=LynuxWorks |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2020, Lynx announced that the TR3 modernization program for the joint strike fighter had adopted Lynx\u2019s MOSA.ic software framework. The company\u2019s technology is also used in medical, industrial and communications systems around the world by companies like Airbus, Bosch, Denso, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Rohde and Schwartz and Toyota.[2]\n\n==Operating system evolution and history==\n\n[[LynxOS]] is the company's real-time operating system. It is UNIX-compatible and [[POSIX]]-compliant.  It features predictable worst-case response time, preemptive scheduling, real-time priorities, ROMable kernel, and memory locking. LynxOS 7.0 is marketed as a \"military grade\", general purpose multi-core hard real-time operating system, and is intended for developers to embed security features during the design process, rather than adding security features after development. \n\nIn 2003, the company introduced the LynxOS-178 [[real-time operating system]], a specialized version of LynxOS geared toward avionics applications that require certification to industry standards such as [[DO-178B]]. LynxOS-178 is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RTOS that fully satisfies the objectives of the DO-178B level A specification and meets requirements for Integrated Modular Avionics developers.\n\nThe [[LynxSecure]] [[Hypervisor]] (\"bare metal,\" type 1) and [[separation kernel]] was released in 2005.

It was announced in February 2019, is designed to help system developers build comprehensible software systems out of independent application modules, delivering the vision of the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). Its focus is to enable developers to collapse existing development cycles to create, certify, and deploy robust, secure platforms for manned and unmanned autonomous systems. It achieves this by giving developers deeper insights.\nIt is founded on the LynxSecure\u00ae separation kernel hypervisor and supports a variety of operating systems such as LynxOS-178\u00ae, Linux, Windows, third-party RTOSes and bare metal applications such as Lynx Simple Applications (LSAs).\nIn contrast to traditional RTOS platforms, where hardware control, real-time scheduling, security, multimedia, and application runtime services are integrated into a common stack servicing all applications on all CPU cores, LYNX MOSA.ic allows system architects to subdivide systems into smaller, independent stacks which include only the dependencies required.\n\nOne of the most visible public endorsements is from Lockheed Martin, who are responsible for the Technical Refresh Program (TR3) for the Joint Strike Fighter\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lynx Software Technologies}}\n[[Category:Software companies based in California]]\n[[Category:Linux companies]]\n[[Category:Computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Real-time operating systems]]\n[[Category:Embedded operating systems]]\n[[Category:Companies based in San Jose, California]]\n[[Category:Software companies of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox company |\n  name   = Lynx Software Technologies, Inc |\n  type   = [[Private company|Private]] |\n  company_slogan =  |\n  foundation     = 1988 |\n  location       = [[San Jose, California]] |\n  industry       = [[Embedded software]]|\n  products       = Operating Systems, Separation Kernel (Hypervisor), Tools|\n  key_people     = Gurjot Singh, CEO,<br>Flavio Bonami, Adviser to CEO<br>Will Keegan, CTO<br>Inder Singh, Chairman|\n  homepage       = [https://www.lynx.com/ www.lynx.com]\n}}\n\n'''Lynx Software Technologies, Inc.''' (formerly '''LynuxWorks''') is a [[San Jose, California]] software company founded in 1988. Lynx Software Technologies specializes in secure virtualization and open and reliable real-time operating system (RTOS). Originally known as Lynx Real-Time Systems, the company changed its name to LynuxWorks in 2000 after acquiring, and merging with, ISDCorp (Integrated Software & Devices Corporation) a nine-year-old embedded systems company with a strong [[Linux]] background. In May 2014, the company changed its name to Lynx Software Technologies as a representation of the company\u2019s forward direction as the LynxOS RTOS family of products and the LynxSecure hypervisor continued to gain increased traction both with current customers and markets, and with the new Internet connected embedded world.\n\nLynx Software Technologies has created technology that has been successfully deployed in thousands of designs and millions of products made by leading communications, industrial, transportation, avionics, aerospace/defense and consumer electronics companies. In 1989, [[LynxOS]], the company's flagship [[real-time operating system]], was selected for use in the NASA/IBM [[Space Station Freedom]] project.<ref>{{cite web |title=LynuxWorks CEO ascends to visionary role |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7302136246.html |work=[[LinuxDevices.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022120310/http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS7302136246.html |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref> Lynx Software Technologies operating systems are also used in medical, industrial and communications systems around the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Embedded OS: Embedded Operating Systems Applications |url=http://www.lynuxworks.com/embedded-os.php3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121219154535/http://www.lynuxworks.com/embedded-os.php3 |archive-date=December 19, 2012 |work=LynuxWorks |accessdate=May 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2020, Lynx announced that the TR3 modernization program for the joint strike fighter had adopted Lynx\u2019s MOSA.ic software framework. The company\u2019s technology is also used in medical, industrial and communications systems around the world by companies like Airbus, Bosch, Denso, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Rohde and Schwartz and Toyota.[2]\n\n==Operating system evolution and history==\n\n[[LynxOS]] is the company's real-time operating system. It is UNIX-compatible and [[POSIX]]-compliant.  It features predictable worst-case response time, preemptive scheduling, real-time priorities, ROMable kernel, and memory locking. LynxOS 7.0 is marketed as a \"military grade\", general purpose multi-core hard real-time operating system, and is intended for developers to embed security features during the design process, rather than adding security features after development. \n\nIn 2003, the company introduced the LynxOS-178 [[real-time operating system]], a specialized version of LynxOS geared toward avionics applications that require certification to industry standards such as [[DO-178B]]. LynxOS-178 is a commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) RTOS that fully satisfies the objectives of the DO-178B level A specification and meets requirements for Integrated Modular Avionics developers.\n\nThe [[LynxSecure]] [[Hypervisor]] (\"bare metal,\" type 1) and [[separation kernel]] was released in 2005. It acts as a programmable processor partitioning system that uses hardware virtualization capabilities of modern multi-core processors to isolate computing resources. The separation kernel concept enforces a simpler distributed application runtime model on a processor by way of provably separating processor-controlled resources, such that independent applications execute on their own allocation of resources.

Bentley Publishers, 2001, pp. 121\u2013123, {{ISBN|0-8376-0220-3}}</ref>\n\nThe body shape for the M3 has been changed significantly, among other things to further improve the [[torsional rigidity]], the {{Cd|link=car}} and the driving dynamics. The suitability for racing was in the foreground, therefore sacrifices in comfort and production costs could be made. The modifications included eye-catching fender flares to allow a wider track.\n\nThe front spoiler, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the trunk lid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window has been flattened and the tailgate made of light, glass fiber reinforced plastic and raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes in the rear area resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in - and not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.33}} instead of 0.38 as in the normal model. Among other things, the subsequent conversions of normal 3s to the M3 version can usually be identified on the C-pillar. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and door inner panels.\n\nThe brake calipers, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.\n\nThe transmission was a ''[[Getrag]] 265'' 5-speed manual.

These include the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution, with upgrades including weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (to allow 18-inch wheels to be used in DTM racing), bigger brake ducts and more power.

With a power output of {{convert|240|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, the M3-R is the most powerful production E36 M3. Four of the cars were used for the race series. The remaining eleven were sold to the general public, however, buyers were required to possess a [[Confederation of Australian Motor Sport|CAMS]] motorsport licence in order to purchase an M3-R.\n\nThe cars were delivered to the workshop of the [[Frank Gardner (racing driver)|Frank Gardner]] racing team for final preparation. A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was a factory option. Suspension upgrades consisted of new springs, adjustable struts and rear perches. Engine upgrades consisted of [[AC Schnitzer]] camshafts, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head and a cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing the left hand fog light.\n\nOther changes included four piston front brake calipers, a shorter (3.25:1) differential ratio, the driveshaft from the M5, a twin-plate clutch, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete, deeper front splitter and a larger rear spoiler. The cars were individually numbered with a plaque fitted to centre console near the handbrake.\n\n==== M3 GTR (Germany) ====\nThe E36 M3 GTR is the road-going version of the competition machine built to compete in the 1994 ADAC German GT Cup Touring Car series.<ref>{{cite web |title=M3 E36 Gtr |url=https://www.bmwfaq.org/threads/m3-e36-gtr.123443/ |website=www.bmwfaq.org |accessdate=26 April 2019 |language=es-ES}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=bmw m3 gtr 1994 Barbuza |url=http://www.bmwcase.com/d7827cdb0f146ca4.html |website=www.barbuza.com |accessdate=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Production ===\nProduction of the E36 M3 began in September 1992<ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/september-1991/42/road-test-bmw-325-i</ref><ref>https://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=14</ref> and was discontinued in August 1999.<ref>https://bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15</ref>\n\nThe majority of cars were produced at the BMW Regensburg factory in Germany; however, a small number of low compression right hand drive cars were assembled at BMW's plant in Rosslyn, South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15#2 |title=FAQ E36 M3 3.2 |publisher=BMW M Registry |date= |accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616151345/http://www.bmwmregistry.com/model_faq.php?id=15| archivedate= 16 June 2009 |url-status = live}}</ref> In total, 46,525 coup\u00e9s, 12,114 convertibles and 12,603 sedans were produced.<ref name=regE36>{{cite web|url= http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/10/16/the-history-of-bmw-m3/ |title=The History Of BMW M3|date=16 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161227205202/http://www.bmwblog.com/2015/10/16/the-history-of-bmw-m3/ |archive-date=27 December 2016 |url-status = live}}</ref> The sedan ceased production in December 1997, the coup\u00e9 ceased production in late 1998, and the convertible ceased production in December 1999.<ref name=\"Kittler 2001 130\"/>\n\n===North American models===\nDespite being released in other countries in 1992, the E36 M3 was not sold in the United States until 1995.

However, the straight-six engine was viewed as uncompetitive compared to the [[Porsche 911 GT3#996 GT3|Porsche 996 GT3]], therefore BMW began to develop a new M3 racing car based around a more powerful engine.

The ALMS homologation rules for 2001 required the [[#GTR road car|M3 GTR road car]] to be sold on at least two continents within twelve months of the rules being issued, which BMW claimed to fulfill by stating that 10 GTR road cars were available for sale. The ALMS rules were altered for 2002, now requiring that 100 cars and 1,000 engines must be built for the car to qualify without penalties. The GTR road car was never intended for production on this scale, so BMW withdrew the GTR from competition at this point.\n\nIn 2003, the M3 GTR returned to competition at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], with two cars run by [[Schnitzer Motorsport]].

The suitability for racing was in the foreground, therefore sacrifices in comfort and production costs could be made. The modifications included eye-catching fender flares to allow a wider track.\n\nThe front spoiler, the rear apron, sill panels, as well as changes to the body in the area of the rear window (C-pillar) and the trunk lid improved the aerodynamics. For aerodynamic reasons, the rear window has been flattened and the tailgate made of light, glass fiber reinforced plastic and raised by approximately 40 mm for better air flow. The changes in the rear area resulted in lower lift forces and better straight-line stability. In addition, the windscreen was glued in - and not, as with the other E30 models, framed with a window rubber and piping. As a result, the M3 achieved a relatively low {{Cd|long=yes|link=car|0.33}} instead of 0.38 as in the normal model. Among other things, the subsequent conversions of normal 3s to the M3 version can usually be identified on the C-pillar. The only exterior body panels the regular 3 Series and the M3 shared were the bonnet, roof panel, sunroof and door inner panels.\n\nThe brake calipers, rotors and master cylinder were unique to the M3 model.\n\nThe transmission was a ''[[Getrag]] 265'' 5-speed manual. European models were outfitted with a [[Dog-leg gearbox|dogleg]] version with close ratios and a 1:1 ratio for fifth gear. North American models used a traditional shift pattern and had wider gear spacing with an overdriven fifth gear. A clutch-type limited-slip differential was standard equipment.\n\nThe official curb weights of the 1986 M3 coupe was {{convert|1165|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and the 1988 M3 convertible was {{convert|1360|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=56155|title=1986 BMW M3|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=170775|title=1988 BMW M3 Cabrio|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> The kerb weight for the US specification M3 was {{convert|1240.6|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mandel |first1=Dutch |title=M Times Three = Performance |journal=Autoweek |date=20 July 1987 |pages=29-31 |url=https://s3-prod.autoweek.com/s3fs-public/TBT%20BMW%20M3.pdf |accessdate=11 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004, ''[[Sports Car International]]'' named the E30 M3 car number six on the list of [[Sports Car International Top Sports Cars|Top Sports Cars of the 1980s]].

The E30 M3 road car was [[homologation (motorsport)|homologated]] for [[Group A]] racing, to compete against models such as the [[Mercedes-Benz W201]] 190E. In full race trim, the 1988 M3's {{convert|2.3|L|cuin|0|abbr=on}} naturally aspirated 2.3 L engine was rated at approximately {{convert|300|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1988%20Cars.html|title=1988 Cars|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> The E30 M3 won the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] five times (1989, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1994) and the [[Spa 24 Hours]] four times ([[1987 Spa 24 Hour|1987]], 1988, 1990 and 1992), other competing against cars with significantly larger or turbocharged engines.\n\nTo keep the car competitive in racing following year-to-year homologation rules changes, homologation specials were produced and sold in limited volumes. These include the Evo 1, Evo 2, and Sport Evolution, with upgrades including weight reduction, improved aerodynamics, taller front wheel arches (to allow 18-inch wheels to be used in DTM racing), bigger brake ducts and more power. With the introduction of the 2.5 L evolution engine into racing in 1990, power increased to approximately {{convert|380|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://touringcarracing.net/Pages/1991%20Cars.html|title=1991 Cars|publisher=|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe M3 also competed as a rally car, with [[Prodrive]]-prepared examples contesting several national championships and selected rounds of the [[World Rally Championship]] between 1987 and 1989. By the latter year, the cars, based on the regular M3, were equipped with six-speed gearboxes and produced {{convert|300|PS|kW PS hp|0|abbr=on|order=out}}. The M3 was not very competitive with the four-wheel-drive cars on loose surfaces, but a very effective car on asphalt. Its most notable success was victory on the [[Tour de Corse]] in 1987, driven by [[Bernard Beguin]].\n\n==== Championships ====\n* [[World Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1987 World Touring Car Championship season|1987]])\n* [[European Touring Car Championship]]; 2 titles (1987 and 1988)\n* [[British Touring Car Championship]]; 2 titles (1988 and 1991)\n* [[Italia Superturismo Championship]]; 4 titles (1987, 1989, 1990 and 1991)\n* [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]]; 2 titles (1987 and 1989)\n* [[Australian Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1987 Australian Touring Car Championship|1987]])\n* [[Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship]]; 1 title ([[1993 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship|1993]])\n* [[Australian Manufacturers' Championship]]; 2 titles ([[1987 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1987]] and [[1988 Australian Manufacturers' Championship|1988]]  \u2013 both shared)\n* [[Better Brakes AMSCAR Series|AMSCAR Series]]; 2 titles (1987, 1991)\n* [[Irish Tarmac Rally Championship]]; 1 title (1990)\n\n== E36 generation (1992\u20131999) {{anchor|E36}} ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name         = BMW M3 (E36)\n| image        = 1998 BMW M3 Coupe 3.2.jpg\n| production   = 1992\u20141999\n| body_style   = {{unbulleted list\n| 2-door [[coup\u00e9]]\n| 2-door [[convertible (car)|convertible]]\n| 4-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]\n}}\n| engine       = {{unbulleted list\n| 3.0-3.2&nbsp;L ''[[BMW M50#S50|S50]]''/''[[BMW M52#S52|S52]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n}}\n| transmission = {{Unbulleted list |5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] |5-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]] |6-speed manual |6-Speed [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission#Use in road cars|SMG]] }}\n| wheelbase    = {{convert|2700|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| length       = {{convert|4430|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| width        = {{convert|1710|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n| height       = {{convert|1370|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe M3 model of the [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|E36 3 Series]] was released in November 1992 and was initially available as a coup\u00e9 only, with a convertible version added in 1994.

A bolt-in FIA-approved roll cage was a factory option. Suspension upgrades consisted of new springs, adjustable struts and rear perches. Engine upgrades consisted of [[AC Schnitzer]] camshafts, dual pickup sump, an oil restrictor in the head and a cold air snorkel into air filter box replacing the left hand fog light.\n\nOther changes included four piston front brake calipers, a shorter (3.25:1) differential ratio, the driveshaft from the M5, a twin-plate clutch, non-functional rear seat, air conditioner delete, deeper front splitter and a larger rear spoiler.

The ALMS homologation rules for 2001 required the [[#GTR road car|M3 GTR road car]] to be sold on at least two continents within twelve months of the rules being issued, which BMW claimed to fulfill by stating that 10 GTR road cars were available for sale. The ALMS rules were altered for 2002, now requiring that 100 cars and 1,000 engines must be built for the car to qualify without penalties. The GTR road car was never intended for production on this scale, so BMW withdrew the GTR from competition at this point.\n\nIn 2003, the M3 GTR returned to competition at the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]], with two cars run by [[Schnitzer Motorsport]].
