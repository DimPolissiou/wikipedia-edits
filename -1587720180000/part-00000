It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref> The area remained home to chicken and [[mink]] farms well into the 1950s.<ref name=\"PI-Bailey1998\">{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Gil |date=April 18, 1998 |title=Mountlake Terrace: This bedroom community has some living room |page=D1 |work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The initial stage of development had over 200 homes priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4999|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Alice |date=September 18, 1949 |title=$4,999 Two-Bedroom Home Draws Interest |page=25 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One resident, Patrick McMahan, became frustrated by these conditions, and organized a campaign to incorporate the community after [[Edmonds, Washington|Edmonds]] declined to study an annexation.<ref>{{cite book |page=301 |ref=harv |last1=Cameron |first1=David A. |last2=LeWarne |first2=Charles P. |last3=May |first3=M.

Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />\n\n===Early growth===\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref>{{cite news |date=December 2014 |title=Mountlake Terrace Looking Back 60 Years & Beyond |url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/Archive/ViewFile/Item/2850 |work=City Happenings |publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Slowing of development===\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a \"stand-alone\" development with an economically vital downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall.<ref name=History />  However, this development halted in the 1980s. [[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area. West Plaza was out of business for 20 months; East Plaza was permanently shut down, replaced with a gymnastics center.}} In 1981, Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was repeatedly trimmed, but Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.<ref name=HistoryLink /> A planned hotel and office development was put on hold after complications with planning around streams and demolition of 14 homes from the original development.<ref>{{cite news |last=Aweeka |first=Charles |date=May 29, 1985 |title=Mountlake Terrace block houess are bleak but cheap |page=H2 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Recent history===\n[[Image:Mountlake Terrace 236th&56th.JPG|thumb|right|Intersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.]]\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize the downtown area and encourage economic activity.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />{{efn|The council approved design standards requiring that new developments be built with wide sidewalks, lots of windows, awnings, and interesting architectural details.}} As of 2013 the town's largest employer was [[Premera Blue Cross]], which employs some 3,000 people.<ref name=CAFR>[http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf City of Mountlake Terrace CAFR 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120444/http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.{{cn|date=April 2020}} The initial stage of development had over 200 homes priced at a minimum of $4,999 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US-GDP|4999|1949|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars).{{inflation-fn|US-GDP}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Staples |first=Alice |date=September 18, 1949 |title=$4,999 Two-Bedroom Home Draws Interest |page=25 |work=The Seattle Times}}</ref>\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems.

Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed.

Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959.

[[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area.

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

Satellite orbital position errors, induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction among others, had to be resolved. A team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970\u20131973, used real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation to do so, reducing systematic and residual errors to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation.<ref>Jury, HL, 1973, Application of Kalman Filter to Real-Time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceedings of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945\u2013952.</ref>\n\nDuring Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about twelve military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''.

The directive was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], in view of the widespread growth of [[differential GPS]] services by private industry to improve civilian accuracy.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges plus time difference between the receiver and GPS satellites multiplied by speed of light, which are called as pseudo-ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]].

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823013233/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|archive-date=August 23, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed. In that case each of the equations describes a [[spherical cone]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=GPS Solutions: Closed Forms, Critical and Special Configurations of P4P | doi=10.1007/PL00012897 | volume=5|issue=3 |journal=GPS Solutions|pages=29\u201341 | last1 = Grafarend | first1 = Erik W.|year=2002 }}</ref> with the cusp located at the satellite, and the base a sphere around the satellite.

The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation. Also we define three functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, which return differences between receivers, satellites, and time points, respectively. Each function has variables with three subscripts as its arguments. These three functions are defined below. If <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math> is a function of the three integer arguments, ''i, j,'' and ''k'' then it is a valid argument for the functions, :<math>\\ \\Delta^r, \\Delta^s, \\Delta^t </math>, with the values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i+1,j,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j+1,k} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) = \\alpha_{i,j,k+1} - \\alpha_{i,j,k} </math>&nbsp;.\n\nAlso if <math>\\  \\alpha_{i,j,k}\\ and\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} </math> are valid arguments for the three functions and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants then\n<math>\\ ( a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} ) </math> is a valid argument with values defined as\n\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^r(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n}) = a \\ \\Delta^r(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^r(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>,\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^s(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^s(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^s(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>, and\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(a\\ \\alpha_{i,j,k} + b\\ \\beta_{l,m,n} )= a \\ \\Delta^t(\\alpha_{i,j,k}) +  b \\ \\Delta^t(\\beta_{l,m,n})</math>&nbsp;.\n\nReceiver clock errors can be approximately eliminated by differencing the phases measured from satellite&nbsp;1 with that from satellite&nbsp;2 at the same epoch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |title=Between-Satellite Differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051358/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/633.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> This difference is designated as <math>\\ \\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}) =  \\phi_{1,2,1} - \\phi_{1,1,1}</math>\n\nDouble differencing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |title=Double differencing |publisher=Gmat.unsw.edu.au |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306051809/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap6/635.htm |archivedate=March 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> computes the difference of receiver&nbsp;1's satellite difference from that of receiver&nbsp;2.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time. Thus the triple difference result eliminates practically all clock bias errors and the integer ambiguity. Atmospheric delay and satellite ephemeris errors have been significantly reduced. This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

Limitations of these systems drove the need for a more universal navigation solution with greater accuracy.\n\nAlthough there were wide needs for accurate navigation in military and civilian sectors, almost none of those was seen as justification for the billions of dollars it would cost in research, development, deployment, and operation of a constellation of navigation satellites. During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat to the existence of the United States was the one need that did justify this cost in the view of the United States Congress. This deterrent effect is why GPS was funded. It is also the reason for the ultra-secrecy at that time. The [[nuclear triad]] consisted of the United States Navy's [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) along with [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[strategic bomber]]s and [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (ICBMs). Considered vital to the [[nuclear strategy|nuclear deterrence]] posture, accurate determination of the SLBM launch position was a [[force multiplication|force multiplier]].\n\nPrecise navigation would enable United States [[ballistic missile submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}</ref> The USAF, with two thirds of the nuclear triad, also had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system. The Navy and Air Force were developing their own technologies in parallel to solve what was essentially the same problem.\n\nTo increase the survivability of ICBMs, there was a proposal to use mobile launch platforms (comparable to the Russian [[RT-23 Molodets|SS-24]] and [[RT-2PM Topol|SS-25]]) and so the need to fix the launch position had similarity to the SLBM situation.\n\nIn 1960, the Air Force proposed a radio-navigation system called MOSAIC (MObile System for Accurate ICBM Control) that was essentially a 3-D&nbsp;[[LORAN]]. A follow-on study, Project&nbsp;57, was worked in 1963 and it was \"in this study that the GPS concept was born.\" That same year, the concept was pursued as Project&nbsp;621B, which had \"many of the attributes that you now see in GPS\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|title=Charting a Course Toward Global Navigation|publisher=The Aerospace Corporation|accessdate=October 14, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021101215923/http://www.aero.org/publications/crosslink/summer2002/01.html|archivedate=November 1, 2002<!--, 01:01:18-->}}</ref> and promised increased accuracy for Air Force bombers as well as ICBMs.\n\nUpdates from the Navy TRANSIT system were too slow for the high speeds of Air Force operation.

Satellite orbital position errors, induced by variations in the gravity field and radar refraction among others, had to be resolved. A team led by Harold L Jury of Pan Am Aerospace Division in Florida from 1970\u20131973, used real-time data assimilation and recursive estimation to do so, reducing systematic and residual errors to a manageable level to permit accurate navigation.<ref>Jury, H L, 1973, Application of Kalman Filter to Real-Time Navigation using Synchronous Satellites, Proceeding of the 10th International Symposium on Space Technology and Science, Tokyo, 945\u2013952.</ref>\n\nDuring Labor Day weekend in 1973, a meeting of about twelve military officers at the Pentagon discussed the creation of a ''Defense Navigation Satellite System (DNSS)''.

This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing on May 1, 2000 a policy directive to turn off Selective Availability to provide the same accuracy to civilians that was afforded to the military. The directive was proposed by the U.S. Secretary of Defense, [[William Perry]], in view of the widespread growth of [[differential GPS]] services by private industry to improve civilian accuracy. Moreover, the U.S. military was actively developing technologies to deny GPS service to potential adversaries on a regional basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=NOAA] |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nSince its deployment, the U.S. has implemented several improvements to the GPS service, including new signals for civil use and increased accuracy and integrity for all users, all the while maintaining compatibility with existing GPS equipment.

The satellites carry very stable [[atomic clocks]] that are synchronized with one another and with the ground clocks. Any drift from time maintained on the ground is corrected daily. In the same manner, the satellite locations are known with great precision. GPS receivers have clocks as well, but they are less stable and less precise.\n\nEach GPS satellite continuously transmits a radio signal containing the current time and data about its position.  Since the speed of [[radio wave]]s is constant and independent of the satellite speed, the time delay between when the satellite transmits a signal and the receiver receives it is proportional to the distance from the satellite to the receiver.  A GPS receiver monitors multiple satellites and solves equations to determine the precise position of the receiver and its deviation from true time. At a minimum, four satellites must be in view of the receiver for it to compute four unknown quantities (three position coordinates and clock deviation from satellite time).\n\n=== More detailed description ===\nEach GPS satellite continually broadcasts a signal ([[carrier wave]] with [[modulation]]) that includes:\n* A [[Pseudorandom binary sequence|pseudorandom]] code (sequence of ones and zeros) that is known to the receiver. By time-aligning a receiver-generated version and the receiver-measured version of the code, the time of arrival (TOA) of a defined point in the code sequence, called an epoch, can be found in the receiver clock time scale\n* A message that includes the time of transmission (TOT) of the code epoch (in GPS time scale) and the satellite position at that time\n\nConceptually, the receiver measures the TOAs (according to its own clock) of four satellite signals. From the TOAs and the TOTs, the receiver forms four [[time of flight]] (TOF) values, which are (given the speed of light) approximately equivalent to receiver-satellite ranges plus time difference between the receiver and GPS satellites multiplied by speed of light, which are called as pseudo-ranges. The receiver then computes its three-dimensional position and clock deviation from the four TOFs.\n\nIn practice the receiver position (in three dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] with origin at the Earth's center) and the offset of the receiver clock relative to the GPS time are computed simultaneously, using the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] to process the TOFs.\n\nThe receiver's Earth-centered solution location is usually converted to [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and height relative to an ellipsoidal Earth model. The height may then be further converted to height relative to the [[geoid]], which is essentially mean [[sea level]]. These coordinates may be displayed, such as on a [[moving map display]], or recorded or used by some other system, such as a vehicle guidance system.\n\n=== User-satellite geometry ===\nAlthough usually not formed explicitly in the receiver processing, the conceptual time differences of arrival (TDOAs) define the measurement geometry. Each TDOA corresponds to a [[hyperboloid]] of revolution (see [[Multilateration]]). The line connecting the two satellites involved (and its extensions) forms the axis of the hyperboloid. The receiver is located at the point where three hyperboloids intersect.<ref name=\"Abel1\">Abel, J.S. and Chaffee, J.W., \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 26, no. 6, pp. 748\u201353, Sept. 1991.</ref><ref name=\"Fang\">Fang, B.T., \"Comments on \"Existence and uniqueness of GPS solutions\" by J.S. Abel and J.W. Chaffee\", ''IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems'', vol. 28, no. 4, Oct. 1992.</ref>\n\nIt is sometimes incorrectly said that the user location is at the intersection of three spheres. While simpler to visualize, this is the case only if the receiver has a clock synchronized with the satellite clocks (i.e., the receiver measures true ranges to the satellites rather than range differences). There are marked performance benefits to the user carrying a clock synchronized with the satellites. Foremost is that only three satellites are needed to compute a position solution. If it were an essential part of the GPS concept that all users needed to carry a synchronized clock, a smaller number of satellites could be deployed, but the cost and complexity of the user equipment would increase.\n\n=== Receiver in continuous operation ===\nThe description above is representative of a receiver start-up situation. Most receivers have a [[track algorithm]], sometimes called a ''tracker'', that combines sets of satellite measurements collected at different times\u2014in effect, taking advantage of the fact that successive receiver positions are usually close to each other. After a set of measurements are processed, the tracker predicts the receiver location corresponding to the next set of satellite measurements. When the new measurements are collected, the receiver uses a weighting scheme to combine the new measurements with the tracker prediction. In general, a tracker can (a) improve receiver position and time accuracy, (b) reject bad measurements, and (c) estimate receiver speed and direction.\n\nThe disadvantage of a tracker is that changes in speed or direction can be computed only with a delay, and that derived direction becomes inaccurate when the distance traveled between two position measurements drops below or near the [[random error]] of position measurement. GPS units can use measurements of the [[Doppler shift]] of the signals received to compute velocity accurately.<ref>{{cite book |title=Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration |edition=2nd |first1=Mohinder S. |last1=Grewal |first2=Lawrence R. |last2=Weill |first3=Angus P. |last3=Andrews |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-470-09971-1 |pages=92\u201393 |url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C}}}}, {{google books|plainurl=y|id=6P7UNphJ1z8C|page=92 |title=Extract of pages 92\u201393}}</ref> More advanced navigation systems use additional sensors like a [[compass]] or an [[inertial navigation system]] to complement GPS.\n\n=== Non-navigation applications ===\n{{for|a list of applications|#Applications}}\nGPS requires four or more satellites to be visible for accurate navigation. The solution of the [[#Navigation equations|navigation equations]] gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a more precise and possibly impractical receiver based clock. Applications for GPS such as [[time transfer]], traffic signal timing, and [[IS-95#Physical layer|synchronization of cell phone base stations]], [[#Timekeeping|make use of]] this cheap and highly accurate timing. Some GPS applications use this time for display, or, other than for the basic position calculations, do not use it at all.\n\nAlthough four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known [[altitude]], [[dead reckoning]], [[inertial navigation system|inertial navigation]], or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.<ref>{{cite web|title=Continuous Navigation Combining GPS with Sensor-Based Dead Reckoning|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111202317/http://www.gpsworld.com/gpsworld/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=154870&pageID=6|archivedate=November 11, 2006|date=April 1, 2005|author1=Georg zur Bonsen |author2=Daniel Ammann |author3=Michael Ammann |author4=Etienne Favey |author5=Pascal Flammant |publisher=GPS World}}</ref><ref name=\"NAVGPS\">{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|publisher=United States Government|access-date=August 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910184805/http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf|archive-date=September 10, 2008|url-status=live}} Chapter 7</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=GPS Support Notes|url=http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|date=January 19, 2007|accessdate=November 10, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327051208/http://www.navmanwireless.com/uploads/EK/C8/EKC8zb1ITsNwDqWcqLQxiQ/Support_Notes_GPS_OperatingParameters.pdf|archivedate=March 27, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2015}}\nThe current GPS consists of three major segments.

What is more, the OMA SUPL A-GPS standard has enabled lower cost deployment of A-GPS services that ensure a better and more consistent user experience necessary for the mass consumer market. The SUPL A-GPS standard allows network operators or handset manufacturers to deploy assistance services that reduce the time to first fix, lowers the power consumption, and enhances the sensitivity of the GPS receiver. The SUPL standard uses User Plane communication channels such as SMS and GPRS to transport the aiding data, as opposed to the control plane channels in networks, thereby reducing the load on the networks, as well as complexity and cost of service deployment. New business models have also become possible, ranging from hosted services for operators that want to minimize capital investments, to services deployed by handset vendors for end-users that cannot get similar services from their network operator yet.\n\nThe major handset software platforms and operating systems are evolving, ensuring easier integration of GPS functionality for handset manufacturers and more powerful features for application developers. Along with the improving performance of handsets, in terms of screen size, processing power and memory size, current handsets thus provide much better platforms for location-enabled applications and services than before.\n\nThe GPS value-chain was reshaped considerably in 2007 as several specialist GPS technology developers were acquired by wireless chipset vendors. These transactions are likely to enhance the possibilities to meet handset manufacturers' demand for integrated connectivity solutions that include GPS at ever lower price points to enable true mass market deployment.\n\nSales of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets grew to about 24.5 million units in 2007 according to independent analyst firm Berg Insight. Although the number is very small in comparison with the 150 million GPS-enabled CDMA handsets sold, the number is growing rapidly. Berg Insight estimates that shipments of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handsets will grow to 370&nbsp;million units in 2012, the equivalent of more than 26 percent of all GSM/WCDMA handsets sold that year. Including CDMA handsets, GPS-enabled handsets sales are estimated to reach about 560&nbsp;million, or 35&nbsp;percent of total handset shipments in 2012.\n\n-->\n\n==== Restrictions on civilian use ====\nThe U.S. government controls the export of some civilian receivers.

The week number is transmitted as a ten-[[bit]] field in the C/A and P(Y) navigation messages, and so it becomes zero again every 1,024&nbsp;weeks (19.6&nbsp;years). GPS week zero started at 00:00:00&nbsp;UTC (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI) on January 6, 1980, and the week number became zero again for the first time at 23:59:47&nbsp;UTC on August 21, 1999 (00:00:19&nbsp;TAI on August 22, 1999). It happened the second time at 23:59:42&nbsp;UTC on April 6, 2019. To determine the current Gregorian date, a GPS receiver must be provided with the approximate date (to within 3,584&nbsp;days) to correctly translate the GPS date signal. To address this concern in the future the modernized GPS civil navigation (CNAV) message will use a 13-bit field that only repeats every 8,192&nbsp;weeks (157&nbsp;years), thus lasting until 2137 (157&nbsp;years after GPS week zero).\n\n== Communication ==\n{{Main|GPS signals}}\n\nThe navigational signals transmitted by GPS satellites encode a variety of information including satellite positions, the state of the internal clocks, and the health of the network. These signals are transmitted on two separate carrier frequencies that are common to all satellites in the network. Two different encodings are used: a public encoding that enables lower resolution navigation, and an encrypted encoding used by the U.S. military.\n\n=== Message format ===\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 0.5em 1em;\" border=\"1\"\n|+ {{nowrap|GPS message format}}\n!

Each complete message takes 750 seconds (12 1/2 minutes) to complete. The message structure has a basic format of a 1500-bit-long frame made up of five subframes, each subframe being 300 bits (6 seconds) long. Subframes 4 and 5 are [[commutation (telemetry)|subcommutated]] 25 times each, so that a complete data message requires the transmission of 25 full frames. Each subframe consists of ten words, each 30 bits long. Thus, with 300 bits in a subframe times 5 subframes in a frame times 25 frames in a message, each message is 37,500 bits long. At a transmission rate of 50-bit/s, this gives 750 seconds to transmit an entire [[GPS signals#Almanac|almanac message (GPS)]]. Each 30-second frame begins precisely on the minute or half-minute as indicated by the atomic clock on each satellite.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |title=Satellite message format |publisher=Gpsinformation.net |accessdate=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101021138/http://gpsinformation.net/gpssignal.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe first subframe of each frame encodes the week number and the time within the week,<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter H.

Thus, to obtain an accurate satellite location from this transmitted message, the receiver must demodulate the message from each satellite it includes in its solution for 18 to 30 seconds. To collect all transmitted almanacs, the receiver must demodulate the message for 732 to 750 seconds or 12 1/2 minutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |title=Interface Specification IS-GPS-200, Revision D: Navstar GPS Space Segment/Navigation User Interfaces |publisher=Navstar GPS Joint Program Office |page=103 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120908003700/http://www.losangeles.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-070803-059.pdf |archivedate=September 8, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nAll satellites broadcast at the same frequencies, encoding signals using unique [[code division multiple access]] (CDMA) so receivers can distinguish individual satellites from each other.

Although LightSquared had applied for a license to operate in the 1525 to 1559 band as early as 2003 and it was put out for public comment, the FCC asked LightSquared to form a study group with the GPS community to test GPS receivers and identify issue that might arise due to the larger signal power from the LightSquared terrestrial network. The GPS community had not objected to the LightSquared (formerly MSV and SkyTerra) applications until November 2010, when LightSquared applied for a modification to its Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) authorization. This filing (SAT-MOD-20101118-00239) amounted to a request to run several orders of magnitude more power in the same frequency band for terrestrial base stations, essentially repurposing what was supposed to be a \"quiet neighborhood\" for signals from space as the equivalent of a cellular network. Testing in the first half of 2011 has demonstrated that the impact of the lower 10&nbsp;MHz of spectrum is minimal to GPS devices (less than 1% of the total GPS devices are affected). The upper 10&nbsp;MHz intended for use by LightSquared may have some impact on GPS devices. There is some concern that this may seriously degrade the GPS signal for many consumer uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |title=Federal Communications Commission Presented Evidence of GPS Signal Interference |publisher=GPS World |accessdate=November 6, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011082258/http://www.gpsworld.com/gnss-system/news/data-shows-disastrous-gps-jamming-fcc-approved-broadcaster-11029 |archivedate=October 11, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saveourgps.org/studies-reports.aspx|title=Coalition to Save Our GPS|publisher=Saveourgps.org|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030072958/http://saveourgps.org/studies-reports.aspx|archivedate=October 30, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> ''[[Aviation Week]]'' magazine reports that the latest testing (June 2011) confirms \"significant jamming\" of GPS by LightSquared's system.<ref name=\"aviationweek1\">{{cite magazine|title=LightSquared Tests Confirm GPS Jamming |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awx/2011/06/09/awx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |magazine=Aviation Week |accessdate=June 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812045607/http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news%2Fawx%2F2011%2F06%2F09%2Fawx_06_09_2011_p0-334122.xml&headline=LightSquared%20Tests%20Confirm%20GPS%20Jamming&channel=busav |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n=== Demodulation and decoding ===\n<!-- Demodulation is done with carrier frequency; decoding is done with Gold Code. -->\n\n[[File:gps ca gold.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Demodulating and decoding GPS satellite signals|Demodulating and Decoding GPS Satellite Signals using the Coarse<!-- \"Coarse\" is correct, as in \"not precision\"-->/Acquisition [[Gold code]].]]\n\nBecause all of the satellite signals are modulated onto the same L1 carrier frequency, the signals must be separated after demodulation.

If the almanac information is not in memory, the receiver enters a search mode until a lock is obtained on one of the satellites. To obtain a lock, it is necessary that there be an unobstructed line of sight from the receiver to the satellite. The receiver can then acquire the almanac and determine the satellites it should listen for. As it detects each satellite's signal, it identifies it by its distinct C/A&nbsp;code pattern. There can be a delay of up to 30&nbsp;seconds before the first estimate of position because of the need to read the ephemeris data.\n\nProcessing of the navigation message enables the determination of the time of transmission and the satellite position at this time.

Receivers usually calculate a running estimate of the error in the calculated position. This is done by multiplying the basic resolution of the receiver by quantities called the [[Dilution of precision (navigation)|geometric dilution of position]] (GDOP) factors, calculated from the relative sky directions of the satellites used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|title=Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP) and Visibility|first=Peter H.|last=Dana|publisher=University of Colorado at Boulder|accessdate=July 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050823013233/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#Gdop|archive-date=August 23, 2005|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The receiver location is expressed in a specific coordinate system, such as latitude and longitude using the [[WGS 84]] [[datum (geodesy)|geodetic datum]] or a country-specific system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/gps/gps.html#PosVelTime|title=Receiver Position, Velocity, and Time|author=Peter H.

Geometrical interpretations can enhance the understanding of these solution methods.\n\n==== Spheres ====\nThe measured ranges, called pseudoranges, contain clock errors. In a simplified idealization in which the ranges are synchronized, these true ranges represent the radii of spheres, each centered on one of the transmitting satellites. The solution for the position of the receiver is then at the intersection of the surfaces of these spheres. Signals from at minimum three satellites are required, and their three spheres would typically intersect at two points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|title=Modern navigation|work=math.nus.edu.sg|access-date=December 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226024421/http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/gem-projects/hm/0203-1-10-instruments/modern.htm|archive-date=December 26, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> One of the points is the location of the receiver, and the other moves rapidly in successive measurements and would not usually be on Earth's surface.\n\nIn practice, there are many sources of inaccuracy besides clock bias, including random errors as well as the potential for precision loss from subtracting numbers close to each other if the centers of the spheres are relatively close together. This means that the position calculated from three satellites alone is unlikely to be accurate enough. Data from more satellites can help because of the tendency for random errors to cancel out and also by giving a larger spread between the sphere centers. But at the same time, more spheres will not generally intersect at one point. Therefore, a near intersection gets computed, typically via least squares. The more signals available, the better the approximation is likely to be.\n\n==== Hyperboloids ====\nIf the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''i'' and the pseudorange between the receiver and satellite ''j'' are subtracted, {{nobreak|1=''p<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''p<sub>j</sub>''}}, the common receiver clock bias (''b'') cancels out, resulting in a difference of distances {{nobreak|1=''d<sub>i</sub>'' \u2212 ''d<sub>j</sub>''}}. The locus of points having a constant difference in distance to two points (here, two satellites) is a [[hyperbola]] on a plane and a [[hyperboloid of revolution]] in 3D space (see [[Multilateration]]). Thus, from four pseudorange measurements, the receiver can be placed at the intersection of the surfaces of three hyperboloids each with [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] at a pair of satellites. With additional satellites, the multiple intersections are not necessarily unique, and a best-fitting solution is sought instead.<ref name=\"Abel1\" /><ref name=\"Fang\" /><ref>{{cite book|author1=Gilbert Strang|author2=Kai Borre|title=Linear Algebra, Geodesy, and GPS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MjNwWUY8jx4C&pg=PA449|year=1997|publisher=SIAM|isbn=978-0-9614088-6-2|pages=448\u2013449}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Audun Holme|title=Geometry: Our Cultural Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXwQGo8jyHUC&pg=PA338|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14441-7|page=338}}</ref><ref name=\"HWLW\">{{cite book|author1=B.

This produces large errors in the computed distances to the satellites. Therefore, in practice, the time difference between the receiver clock and the satellite time is defined as an unknown clock bias ''b''. The equations are then solved simultaneously for the receiver position and the clock bias.  The solution space [''x, y, z, b''] can be seen as a four-dimensional geometric space, and signals from at minimum four satellites are needed. In that case each of the equations describes a [[spherical cone]],<ref>{{cite journal|title=GPS Solutions: Closed Forms, Critical and Special Configurations of P4P | doi=10.1007/PL00012897 | volume=5|issue=3 |journal=GPS Solutions|pages=29\u201341 | last1 = Grafarend | first1 = Erik W.|year=2002 }}</ref> with the cusp located at the satellite, and the base a sphere around the satellite.

Such augmentation systems are generally named or described based on how the information arrives. Some systems transmit additional error information (such as clock drift, ephemera, or [[ionospheric delay]]), others characterize prior errors, while a third group provides additional navigational or vehicle information.\n\nExamples of augmentation systems include the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS), [[European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service]] (EGNOS), [[Differential GPS]] (DGPS), [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS) and [[Assisted GPS]]. The standard accuracy of about {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} can be augmented to {{convert|3|\u2013|5|m|ft|sp=us}} with DGPS, and to about {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with WAAS.<ref>{{cite book |title=GPS For Dummies |first1=Joel |last1=McNamara |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-470-45785-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |page=59 |access-date=May 22, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704164219/http://books.google.com/books?id=Hbz4LYIrvuMC&pg=PA59 |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Precise monitoring ===\nAccuracy can be improved through precise monitoring and measurement of existing GPS signals in additional or alternative ways.\n\nThe largest remaining error is usually the unpredictable delay through the [[ionosphere]]. The spacecraft broadcast ionospheric model parameters, but some errors remain. This is one reason GPS spacecraft transmit on at least two frequencies, L1 and L2. Ionospheric delay is a well-defined function of frequency and the [[total electron content]] (TEC) along the path, so measuring the arrival time difference between the frequencies determines TEC and thus the precise ionospheric delay at each frequency.\n\nMilitary receivers can decode the P(Y) code transmitted on both L1 and L2. Without decryption keys, it is still possible to use a ''codeless'' technique to compare the P(Y) codes on L1 and L2 to gain much of the same error information. This technique is slow, so it is currently available only on specialized surveying equipment. In the future, additional civilian codes are expected to be transmitted on the L2 and L5&nbsp;frequencies (see [[GPS modernization]]). All users will then be able to perform dual-frequency measurements and directly compute ionospheric delay errors.\n\nA second form of precise monitoring is called ''Carrier-Phase Enhancement'' (CPGPS). This corrects the error that arises because the pulse transition of the [[pseudorandom noise|PRN]] is not instantaneous, and thus the [[cross-correlation|correlation]] (satellite\u2013receiver sequence matching) operation is imperfect. CPGPS uses the L1 carrier wave, which has a [[frequency|period]] of <math> \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1575.42 \\times 10^6} = 0.63475\\,\\mathrm{ns} \\approx 1\\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, which is about one-thousandth of the C/A&nbsp;Gold code bit period of <math> \\frac{1\\, \\mathrm{s}}{1023 \\times 10^3} = 977.5 \\, \\mathrm{ns}   \\approx 1000 \\, \\mathrm{ns} \\ </math>, to act as an additional [[clock signal]] and resolve the uncertainty. The phase difference error in the normal GPS amounts to {{convert|2|\u2013|3|m|ft|sp=us|sigfig=1}} of ambiguity. CPGPS working to within 1% of perfect transition reduces this error to {{convert|3|cm|in|sp=us}} of ambiguity. By eliminating this error source, CPGPS coupled with DGPS normally realizes between {{convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|sp=us}} of absolute accuracy.\n\n''[[Relative Kinematic Positioning]]'' (RKP) is a third alternative for a precise GPS-based positioning system. In this approach, determination of range signal can be resolved to a precision of less than {{convert|10|cm|in|0|sp=us}}. This is done by resolving the number of cycles that the signal is transmitted and received by the receiver by using a combination of differential GPS (DGPS) correction data, transmitting GPS signal phase information and ambiguity resolution techniques via statistical tests\u2014possibly with processing in real-time ([[Real Time Kinematic|real-time kinematic positioning]], RTK).\n\n=== Carrier phase tracking (surveying) ===\n{{main|GNSS enhancement#Carrier-phase tracking (surveying)}}\nAnother method that is used in surveying applications is carrier phase tracking. The period of the carrier frequency multiplied by the speed of light gives the wavelength, which is about {{cvt|0.19|m|||}} for the L1&nbsp;carrier. Accuracy within 1% of wavelength in detecting the leading edge reduces this component of pseudorange error to as little as {{cvt|2|mm|||}}. This compares to {{cvt|3|m||}} for the C/A code and {{cvt|0.3|m|in|1|}} for the P&nbsp;code.\n\n{{convert|2|mm|spell=In|adj=on|sp=us}} accuracy requires measuring the total phase\u2014the number of waves multiplied by the wavelength plus the fractional wavelength, which requires specially equipped receivers. This method has many surveying applications. It is accurate enough for real-time tracking of the very slow motions of [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]], typically {{convert|0|-|100|mm|in|0|abbr=in}} per year.\n\nTriple differencing followed by numerical root finding, and a mathematical technique called [[least squares]] can estimate the position of one receiver given the position of another. First, compute the difference between satellites, then between receivers, and finally between epochs. Other orders of taking differences are equally valid. Detailed discussion of the errors is omitted.\n\nThe satellite carrier total phase can be measured with ambiguity as to the number of cycles. Let <math>\\ \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> denote the phase of the carrier of satellite ''j'' measured by receiver ''i'' at time <math>\\ \\ t_k </math>. This notation shows the meaning of the subscripts ''i, j,'' and ''k.'' The receiver (''r''), satellite (''s''), and time (''t'') come in alphabetical order as arguments of <math>\\ \\phi </math> and to balance readability and conciseness, let <math>\\ \\phi_{i,j,k} = \\phi(r_i, s_j, t_k) </math> be a concise abbreviation.

This eliminates the ambiguity associated with the integral number of wavelengths in carrier phase provided this ambiguity does not change with time.

This triple difference is:\n:<math>\\ \\Delta^t(\\Delta^r(\\Delta^s(\\phi_{1,1,1}))) </math>\n\nTriple difference results can be used to estimate unknown variables. For example, if the position of receiver&nbsp;1 is known but the position of receiver&nbsp;2 unknown, it may be possible to estimate the position of receiver&nbsp;2 using numerical root finding and least squares. Triple difference results for three independent time pairs may be sufficient to solve for receiver&nbsp;2's three position components. This may require a numerical procedure.<ref name=\"NR1\">chapter on root finding and nonlinear sets of equations</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=William H.

This initial value can probably be provided from the navigation message and the intersection of sphere surfaces. Such a reasonable estimate can be key to successful multidimensional root finding. Iterating from three time pairs and a fairly good initial value produces one observed triple difference result for receiver&nbsp;2's position. Processing additional time pairs can improve accuracy, overdetermining the answer with multiple solutions. Least squares can estimate an overdetermined system. Least squares determines the position of receiver&nbsp;2 that best fits the observed triple difference results for receiver&nbsp;2 positions under the criterion of minimizing the sum of the squares.\n\n== Regulatory spectrum issues concerning GPS receivers ==\nIn the United States, GPS receivers are regulated under the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s (FCC) [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|Part 15]] rules.

The origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], as it lies on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. The town grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place, now lined with historic buildings. It was a centre for the wool and cloth trades. In the [[English Civil War]], it was besieged by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary forces]] and [[Relief of Newark|relieved]] by [[Cavaliers|Royalist forces]] under [[Prince Rupert]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:UK NewarkonTrent.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost in Newark-on-Trent]]\n\n===Early history===\nThe place-name Newark is first attested in the [[Cartulary]] of [[Eynsham Abbey]] in Oxfordshire, where it appears as ''Newercha'' in about 1054\u20131057 and ''Niweweorche'' in about 1075\u20131092. It appears as ''Newerche'' in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. The name means 'New work', with the apparent meaning of \"New fort\".<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p. 339.</ref>\n\nThe origins of the town are possibly [[Roman Britain|Roman]], due to its position on an important Roman road, the [[Fosse Way]]. In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent. There cremated remains were buried in pottery urns.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Anglo-Saxon Cemetery at Millgate, Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription. The [[Newark wapentake]] in the east of Nottinghamshire was established in the period of [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] rule (10th\u201311th centuries).\n\n===Medieval to Stuart period===\n[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] was originally a [[Saxon]] fortified [[manor house]] founded by King Edward the Elder. In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint. [[John, King of England|King John]] died of [[dysentery]] in Newark Castle in 1216.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Greig |title=King John: Dysentery and the death that changed history |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 November 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111204955/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-37641202 |archivedate=11 November 2017 |df=dmy-all|date=19 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe town became a local centre for the wool and cloth trade \u2013 by the time of [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] a major market was established.

The dissolution affected Newark's political landscape, and even more radical changes came in 1547, when the [[Bishop of Lincoln]] exchanged ownership of the town with the Crown. Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829.

Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N.

These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands.\n\n==Geography==\nNewark lies on the River Trent, with the [[River Devon, Nottinghamshire|River Devon]] also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the [[Fosse Way]], Newark originally grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.\n\nNewark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of [[Balderton]] to the south-east. To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673. It was the last borough to be created before the Reform Act. [[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.

In a document which purports to be a charter of AD 664, Newark is mentioned as having been granted to the [[Peterborough Cathedral|Abbey of Peterborough]] by King [[Wulfhere of Mercia]]. An [[Anglo-Saxon pagan]] cemetery, used from the early 5th to early 7th centuries, has been found in Millgate, Newark, close to the Fosse Way and the River Trent.

After the [[Norman Conquest]] Stow Minster retained the revenues of Newark, but it came under the control of the Norman Bishop [[Remigius de F\u00e9camp]]. After his death, control passed to the Bishops of Lincoln from 1092 until the reign of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]. There were [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]] in Newark at the time of the [[Domesday]] survey, and in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] there is evidence that it had long been a [[borough]] by prescription.

In 1073, [[Robert Bloet]], Bishop of Lincoln, founded an [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthwork]] [[motte and bailey|motte-and-bailey]] fortress on the site. The river bridge was built about this time under a charter from [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], as was St Leonard's Hospital. The bishop also gained from the king a charter to hold a five-day fair at the castle each year, and under King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] to establish a mint.

Newark was incorporated under an [[alderman]] and twelve assistants in 1549, and the charter was confirmed and extended by [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].\n\n[[Charles I of England|Charles I]] reincorporated the town under a [[mayor]] and aldermen, owing to its increasing commercial prosperity. This charter, except for a temporary surrender under [[James II of England|James II]], continued to govern the corporation until the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]].\n\n===The Civil War===\n[[File:Siege piece shilling from Newark-on-Trent.JPG|thumb|right|A makeshift royalist [[Shilling (English coin)|shilling]] (siege piece) made from silver plate during the siege]]\n{{See also|Relief of Newark|Siege money (Newark)}}\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], Newark was a mainstay of the Royalist cause, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] having raised his standard in nearby [[Nottingham]]. \"Newark was besieged on three occasions and finally surrendered only when ordered to do so by [[Charles I of England|the King]] after his own surrender.\"<ref>[http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF Newark Civil War Trail] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613195933/http://www.newark-sherwooddc.gov.uk/ppimageupload/Image36882.PDF |date=13 June 2011}}.</ref> It was attacked in February 1643 by two troops of horsemen, but beat them back. The town fielded at times as many as 600 soldiers, and raided [[Nottingham]], [[Grantham]], [[Northampton]], [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] and other places with mixed success, but enough to cause it to rise to national notice. At the end of 1644 it was besieged by forces from Nottingham, [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and [[Derby]], until relieved in March by [[Prince Rupert]].\n\nParliament commenced a new siege towards the end of January 1645 after more raiding, but this was relieved about a month later by Sir [[Marmaduke Langdale]]. Newark cavalry fought with the king's forces, which were decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Naseby]], near [[Leicester]] in June 1645.\n\nThe final siege began in November 1645, by which time the town's defences had been greatly strengthened. Two major forts had been constructed just outside the town, one called the [[Queen's Sconce]] to the south-west, and another, the King's Sconce, to the north-east, both close to the river, with defensive walls and a water-filled ditch of 2\u00bc miles around the town. The King's May 1646 order to surrender was only accepted under protest by the town's garrison. After that, much of the defences was destroyed, including the Castle, which was left in essentially the state it can be seen today. The Queen's Sconce was left largely untouched and its remains are in [[Sconce and Devon Park]].\n\n===Georgian era and early 19th century===\n[[File:Newark Castle and bridge London Published by J Deeley, 95 Bewick St Soho, 1812 Coloured aquatint.jpg|thumb|[[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]] c. 1812]]\nAround 1770 the [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]] around Newark (now the [[A1 road (Great Britain)|A1]]) was raised on a long series of arches to ensure it remained clear of the regular floods. A special [[Act of Parliament]] in 1773 allowed the creation of a town hall next to the Market Place. Designed by [[John Carr (architect)|John Carr of York]] and completed in 1776, Newark Town Hall is now a Grade I listed building. In 1775 the [[Duke of Newcastle]], at the time the Lord of the Manor and a major landowner in the area, built a new brick bridge with stone facing to replace a dilapidated one next to the Castle. This is still one of the town's major thoroughfares today.\n\nA noted 18th-century advocate of reform in Newark was the local printer and newspaper owner Daniel Holt (1766\u20131799). He was imprisoned for printing a leaflet advocating parliamentary reform, and for selling a pamphlet by [[Thomas Paine]].<ref>An account of Holt's life by Alan Dorling appears in the ''Nottinghamshire Historian'' journal, spring/summer 2000, pp. 9\u201315, with further detail in the autumn/winter edition of 2003, pp. 8\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a milieu of parliamentary reform, the Duke of Newcastle evicted over a hundred tenants at Newark whom he believed to support directly or indirectly at the 1829 elections the Liberal/Radical candidate (Wilde), rather than his candidate, (Michael Sadler, a progressive Conservative).<ref>See the report in Cornelius BROWN 1907, ii, 243 following; and the report in the ''Times'' for 7 October 1829. A report in the ''Times'' of 10 September 1832 lists ten of the evicted people by name and address.</ref>\n\nJ. S. Baxter, a schoolboy in Newark in 1830\u20131840, contributed to ''The Hungry Forties: Life under the Bread Tax'' (London, 1904), a book about the [[Corn Laws]]: \"Chartists and rioters came from Nottingham into Newark, parading the streets with penny loaves dripped in blood carried on pikes, crying 'Bread or blood'.\"\n\n===19th\u201321st centuries===\nMany new buildings and much industry appeared in the [[Victorian era]]. The new buildings included the Independent Chapel (1822), Holy Trinity (1836\u20131837), Christ Church (1837), Castle Railway Station (1846), the Wesleyan Chapel (1846), the Corn Exchange (1848), the Methodist New Connexion Chapel (1848), W. N. Nicholson Trent Ironworks (1840s), Northgate Railway Station (1851), North End Wesleyan Chapel (1868), St Leonard's Anglican Church (1873), the Baptist Chapel (1876), the Primitive Methodist Chapel (1878), [[Newark Hospital]] (1881), Ossington Coffee Palace (1882), Gilstrap Free Library (1883), the Market Hall (1884), the Unitarian Chapel (1884), the Fire Station (1889), the Waterworks (1898), and the School of Science and Art (1900). These changes and associated industrial expansion raised the population from under 7,000 in 1800 to over 15,000 by the end of the 19th century.

A special plot was set aside in Newark Cemetery for RAF burials and this is now the war graves plot, where all but ten of the 90 Commonwealth and all of the 397 Polish burials were made. The cemetery also contains 49 scattered burials from the [[First World War]].

Earnings are 7 per cent above the average in the surrounding East Midlands.\n\n==Geography==\nNewark lies on the River Trent, with the [[River Devon, Nottinghamshire|River Devon]] also running through the town. Standing at the intersection of the Great North Road and the [[Fosse Way]], Newark originally grew around [[Newark Castle, Nottinghamshire|Newark Castle]], now ruined, and a large market place now lined with historic buildings.\n\nNewark forms a continuous built-up area with the neighbouring parish of [[Balderton]] to the south-east. To the south, along the [[A46 road]], is [[Farndon, Nottinghamshire|Farndon]], and to the north [[Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire|Winthorpe]].\n\nNewark's growth and development have both been enhanced by having one of few bridges over the River Trent, by the navigability of the river, by the presence of the Great North Road (the A1, etc.), and later by the advance of the railways, bringing a junction between the [[East Coast Main Line]] and the [[Nottingham]] to [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] route. \"Newark became a substantial inland port, particularly for the wool trade,\"<ref>Andrew Nicholson, [http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm ''Newark-on-Trent''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030075724/http://www.nottsheritagegateway.org.uk/places/newark.htm |date=30 October 2009}} at Nottinghamshire Heritage Gateway.</ref> though it industrialised to some extent in the Victorian era, and later with an ironworks, engineering, brewing, and a sugar refinery.\n\nThe A1 [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/77611 bypass] was opened in 1964 by the then Minister of Transport, [[Ernest Marples]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1|title=The A1 By-Pass |website=Winthorpe Village, Nottinghamshire |accessdate=5 May 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028043328/https://www.winthorpe.org.uk/the-a1-by-pass1 |archivedate=28 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The single-carriageway, \u00a334-million A46 opened in October 1990.\n\n==Governance==\n{{main|Newark (UK Parliament constituency)}}\nNewark returned two representatives to the [[Unreformed House of Commons]] from 1673.

[[William Ewart Gladstone]], later [[Prime Minister]], became its [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in 1832 and was re-elected in 1835, 1837 and 1841 (twice), but possibly due to his support of the [[repeal]] of the [[Corn Laws]] and other issues he stood elsewhere after that time.\n\nRecently, Newark elections have been central to two interesting legal cases. In 1945, a challenge to [[Harold Laski]], the Chairman of the [[National Executive Committee]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], led Laski to sue the ''[[Daily Express]]'' when it reported him as saying that Labour might take power through violence if defeated at the polls. Laski vehemently denied saying this, but lost the libel action. In the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Newark returned [[Fiona Jones]] of the Labour Party.

These devices are used to display the rank of his office and are used on special occasions.\n\n===Chain of office===\n{{multiple image\n | height = 123\n | width = 123\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | image1 = Russia president emblem.jpg\n | caption1 = Chain of office\n | image2 = Standart of the President RF.png\n | caption2 = Presidential standard\n | footer = \n}}\nThe first insignia that is issued is the [[livery collar|chain of office]] with an emblem. The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia. A 2:3 ratio version of the flag is used when the President is at sea. This is the most used symbol to denote the presence of the Russian President.\n\n===Special copy of the Constitution===\nThe President also has a special copy of the [[Constitution of Russia|Russian Constitution]] that is used during the inauguration. This copy has a hard, red cover with gold lettering. An image of the Russian coat of arms appears in silver. The special copy is kept in the Presidential Library.\n\n===Legal basis of the insignia===\nThese insignia and the procedure were established by the [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 1138 from 5 August 1996,<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 1996, \u211633, ar. 3976</ref> and modified by decree 832 from 6 May 2000.<ref>Co\u0431pa\u043d\u0438e \u0437a\u043ao\u043do\u0434a\u0442e\u043b\u044cc\u0442\u0432a \u0420occ\u0438\u0439c\u043ao\u0439 \u0424e\u0434epa\u0446\u0438\u0438 2000, \u211619, ar. 2068</ref> In the new decree the special copy of the Constitution was removed as the third symbol of the Russian Presidency; the other two symbols remained intact because they were and are regulated by separate decrees.

He nominates candidates for official state positions, who must ultimately be appointed based on parliamentary vote.

In practice, he determines it with the Prime Minister and the Government of the Federation. They are to be implemented both by the President himself and by the [[Government of Russia]] within the bounds of their authority. The President\u2019 fundamental positions on domestic policy issues are expressed in his written decisions regarding draft federal constitutional laws and draft federal laws, as well as his letters explaining the reasons for rejecting draft federal laws.\n\nWithin the bounds of the authority granted to the head of state by the Constitution and other laws, the President also shapes the basic domestic policy guidelines by issuing legal regulations and through organizational and regulatory activity, such as issuing decrees and executive orders. Each year the President is required to make an Address to the Federal Assembly regarding the situation in the country and the internal and foreign policy of the state.\n\n===Foreign policy===\n[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Barack Obama 7 July-3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Then-President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] with Then-[[US President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009.]]\nThe President is invested with extensive rights to implement the state's foreign policy.

The President appoints and recalls [[diplomatic representative]]s of Russia to foreign states and [[international organization]]s. These appointments are preceded by consultations with the respective committees or commissions of the [[bicameralism|two houses]] of the Federal Assembly. The President signs [[international treaty|international treaties]].\n\n===Ceremonial duties===\nAn important ceremonial role of the President is awarding state awards. [[List of orders, decorations, and medals of the Russian Federation|State Awards of the Russian Federation]] are the highest form of official recognition given to individuals for service to the nation in the fields of defense, state-building, economics, science, culture, art, education, health care, public safety, rights advocacy and charity. The state awards of the Russian Federation include the title of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]], [[Hero of Labour of the Russian Federation]] as well as orders, medals, emblems and honorary titles. New state honors and awards can be established by the President, who also presents these honors to the recipients in an official ceremony.

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

The pension has increased numerous times. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the government. All former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 are protected by the [[Federal Protective Service (Russia)|Federal Protective Service]] until the president's death.

The central emblem is the red cross of the [[Order \"For Merit to the Fatherland\"]], with arms in equal size, charged with the [[Coat of Arms of Russia|Russian coat of arms]]. On the reverse of the cross, the words \"Benefit, Honor and Glory\" appear in the form of a circle. A golden wreath is used to connect the cross with the rest of the chain. There are 17 \"links\" in the emblem, with nine consisting of the Russian coat of arms. The other eight consist of a rosette, also bearing the motto \"Benefit, Honor and Glory.\" At the inauguration of Vladimir Putin, the emblem was placed on a red pillow, positioned on the left side of the podium. According to the Presidential website, the emblem is placed inside the Kremlin and is used only on certain occasions.\n\n===Standard (flag)===\nThe standard is a square version of the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]], charged in the center with the Russian coat of arms. Golden fringe is added to the standard. Copies of the standard are used inside his office, at the Kremlin, other state agencies, and while the president is traveling in a vehicle inside Russia.

On 11 November 1999 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the implementation of the amended decree of 15 June 1999.\n\nOn 31 December 1999, the day of the resignation of Boris Yeltsin, the president issued a decree \"On guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stop exercising his powers, and his family,\" and the eponymous federal law was adopted by 25 January 2001.\n\nThis law establishes the legal, social and other guarantees of the Russian Federation President, stops the execution of its powers in connection with the expiration of his term of office or in advance in the event of his resignation or permanent incapacity for health reasons to exercise the powers belonging to him and his family:\n\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, regardless of age, is entitled to a monthly lifetime pay of 75% of the monthly remuneration of the President of Russia.\n*In the case of the President's death his family members are entitled to a monthly allowance in the amount equal to six times the minimum old-age pension, established by the federal law on the day of his death.\n*President of Russia, ceased to carry out its mandate, has immunity.

The pension has increased numerous times. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the government.

''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n<blockquote>The Russians living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to an even greater degree than does that of the ''Alraune'' or [[Mandragora]] and one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; the which fact has led to its being given the most apposite name of ''Muzhik koren'' or \"Man root\" by the Russians.</blockquote>\nThe plant is virulently poisonous and has caused fatalities both in humans and in [[livestock]].

''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'' is a [[perennial]] plant with heads of white, pink or yellow flowers, grown as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s.\n\n==Description==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is a [[herbaceous perennial]]. Unbranched stems, 20\u201330&nbsp;cm tall, emerge in a cluster from an underground [[rhizome]]. Narrow, overlapping leaves are borne along the stems. Individual leaves are narrow and pointed, up to 2&nbsp;cm long. The flowers are grouped into rounded tightly packed terminal heads. Flowers lack [[petal]]s, instead having petaloid [[sepal]]s forming a tube up to 1.5&nbsp;cm long with usually five (but possibly four or six) short lobes at the end. The flower colour varies from shades of pink and white to yellow. There are twice as many stamens as calyx lobes, in two series. The ovary has a single chamber ([[locule]]). The fruit is a dry [[drupe]], enclosed by the remains of the calyx.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_S/>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe genus ''Stellera'' was first described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753.<ref name=IPNI_39323-1/>  He recognized two species: ''Stellera passerina'', now placed in the genus ''[[Thymelaea]]'' as ''[[Thymelaea passerina|T.&nbsp;passerina]]'', and ''Stellera chamaejasme''.<ref name=Linn53/> Many species names were later created in the genus, but all are now usually considered synonyms of other species, including ''S.&nbsp;chamaejasme'',<ref name=TPL_Stellera/> although the ''Flora of China'' states that there are 10 to 12 species.<ref name=FoC_S/>\n\nStudies in 2002 and 2009, based on [[chloroplast DNA]], placed ''Stellera'' in a small group of related genera, either as sister to ''[[Wikstroemia]]'' or embedded within it; however for most genera only one species was included.<ref name=BankFayChas02/><ref name=BeauEdwaMannMaur09/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''[[Edgeworthia]]''\n   |2={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1=''[[Wikstroemia]]''\n         |2=''Stellera''\n         }}\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=''[[Diarthron]]''\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''[[Thymelaea]]''\n            |2=''[[Daphne (plant)|Daphne]]''\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is native to northern China, Tibet, the Himalayas (Nepal, Bhutan), Uttar Pradesh in India, and Russia and Mongolia.<ref name=Beck94/><ref name=FoC_Sc/> In China, it is found on sunny dry slopes and sandy places between 2600 and 4200&nbsp;m.<ref name=FoC_Sc/>\n\n==Cultivation==\n''Stellera chamaejasme'' is cultivated as an ornamental plant in [[rock garden]]s and [[alpine house]]s. It is considered difficult to grow, needing a sunny position and gritty soil if grown outside, or a large pot if grown under cover. It is propagated by seed.<ref name=Beck94/>\n\n==Toxicity==\n<blockquote>The Russians living in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] still hold Stellera in high esteem on account of its root, despite the fact that its violent effects have already dispatched a good many people to the afterlife. This root resembles a crudely-carved human figure to an even greater degree than does that of the ''Alraune'' or [[Mandragora]] and one can often distinguish clearly in its form a head, arms and legs; the which fact has led to its being given the most apposite name ''Muzkik koren'' or \"Man root\" by the Russians.</blockquote>\nThe plant is virulently poisonous and has caused fatalities both in humans and in [[livestock]]. The powdered roots have been used as a pesticide and have also been used in small doses as a drastic anthelmintic for sheep and goats.<ref>\nQuattrocchi, Umberto (2012).

The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. \n\nRabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men. (Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\nThe [[Hardal]] (\u200e \u05d7\u05e8\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05d0\u05d5\u05de\u05d9 \u1e24aredi Le'umi, lit.\u2009\"Nationalist [[Haredi]]\") are a sub-community; stricter in observance, and more \"statist\" in their politics.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. \n\nRabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.
