These were committed mainly by the [[Moroccan Goumier]]s, [[colonial troops]] of the [[French Expeditionary Corps (1943-1944)|French Expeditionary Corps]] (FEC),<ref>{{lang-fr|Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais}}'' (CEF) or ''{{lang|fr| Corps Exp\u00e9ditionaire Fran\u00e7ais en Italie}}'' (CEFI)</ref> commanded by General [[Alphonse Juin]], and mostly targeted civilian women and girls (as well as a few men and boys) in the rural area between Naples and Rome, traditionally known in Italian as ''[[Ciociaria]]''.\n\nThe monument \"Mamma Ciociara\" was erected in remembrance of the Marocchinate women, particularly those who were killed during the military campaign.\n\n==Background==\n''[[Goumiers]]'' were [[colonial troops|colonial irregular troops]] forming the ''Goums Marocains'', which were approximately company-sized units rather loosely grouped in ''Tabors'' ([[battalion]]s) and ''Groupes'' ([[regiment]]s). Three of the units, the 1st, 3rd and 4th ''Groupements de Tabors'', served in the FEC along with the four regular [[Division (military)|division]]s: the [[1st Free French Division]], the [[2nd Moroccan Infantry Division]], the [[3rd Algerian Infantry Division]] and the [[4th Moroccan Mountain Division]]. The ''Goums Marocains'' were commanded by General [[Augustin Guillaume]].\n\nRegular Moroccan troops (''[[tirailleurs]] marocains'') also served in Italy but under tighter discipline and with a higher proportion of officers than the irregular goumiers.\n\nOn May 14, 1944, the Goumiers travelled over seemingly impassable terrain in the [[Aurunci Mountains]], outflanked the German defence in the adjacent Liri valley, materially assisting the [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] of the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]], to break the [[Winter Line|Gustav Line]] and advance to the next [[Wehrmacht]] prepared defensive position, the [[Hitler Line]].\n\nAn alleged statement by General [[Alphonse Juin]] before the battle said: \"For fifty hours you will be the absolute masters of what you will find beyond the enemy. Nobody will punish you for what you will do, nobody will ask you about what you will get up to.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dalvolturnoacassino.it/asp/doc.asp?where=Lettura&id=019|title=Crimini di Guerra in Ciociaria|trans-title=War Crimes in Ciociaria|work=Dal Volturno a Cassino|language=it}}</ref>.
