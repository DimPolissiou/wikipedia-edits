If the length of a ball is stretched vertically, its width (in three dimensions, also its depth) needs to contract correspondingly horizontally.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 49.</ref>\n\n===Anticipation===\n[[File:Baseball pitching motion 2004.jpg|thumb|300px|Anticipation: a baseball player making a [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] prepares for the action by winding his arm back.]][[Anticipation (animation)|Anticipation]] is used to prepare the audience for an action, and to make the action appear more realistic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/anticipa.html|title=Anticipation|last=De Stefano|first=Ralph A|publisher=Electronic Visualization Laboratory, [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=June 27, 2008}}</ref> A dancer jumping off the floor has to bend the knees first; a golfer making a swing has to swing the club back first.

Sequence of photos taken by [[Eadweard Muybridge]].]]\n[[Follow through and overlapping action]] is a general heading for two closely related techniques which help to render movement more realistically, and help to give the impression that characters follow the [[Physical law|laws of physics]], including the [[inertia|principle of inertia]]. \"Follow through\" means that loosely tied parts of a body should continue moving after the character has stopped and the parts should keep moving beyond the point where the character stopped only to be subsequently \"pulled back\" towards the [[center of mass]] or exhibiting various degrees of [[oscillation]] [[damping]]. \"Overlapping action\" is the tendency for parts of the body to move at different rates (an arm will move on different timing of the head and so on). A third, related technique is \"drag\", where a character starts to move and parts of them take a few frames to catch up.<ref name=\"AT\"/> These parts can be inanimate objects like clothing or the antenna on a car, or parts of the body, such as arms or hair. On the human body, the torso is the core, with arms, legs, head and hair appendices that normally follow the torso's movement. Body parts with much tissue, such as large stomachs and breasts, or the loose skin on a dog, are more prone to independent movement than bonier body parts.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 59\u201362.</ref> Again, exaggerated use of the technique can produce a comical effect, while more realistic animation must time the actions exactly, to produce a convincing result.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 60.</ref>\n\nThe \"moving hold\" animates between two very similar positions; even characters sitting still, or hardly moving, can display some sort of movement, such as breathing, or very slightly changing position. This prevents the drawing from becoming \"dead\". <ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 61\u20132.</ref>\n\n===Slow in and slow out===\nThe movement of objects in the real world, such as the human body, animals, vehicles, etc. needs time to accelerate and slow down. For this reason, more pictures are drawn near the ''beginning'' and ''end'' of an action, creating a ''slow in'' and ''slow out'' effect in order to achieve more realistic movements. This concept emphasizes the object's extreme poses. Inversely, fewer pictures are drawn within the ''middle'' of the animation to emphasize faster action.<ref name=\"AT\"/> This principle applies to characters moving between two extreme poses, such as sitting down and standing up, but also for inanimate, moving objects, like the bouncing ball in the above illustration.<ref name=\"IPA SI&SO\">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Slow_In_and_Slow_Out |title=Slow In and Out |last=Willian |date=July 5, 2006 |publisher=Blender |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216173559/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Slow_In_and_Slow_Out |archive-date=February 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Arc===\nMost natural action tends to follow an arched [[trajectory]], and animation should adhere to this principle by following implied \"arcs\" for greater realism.  This technique can be applied to a moving limb by rotating a joint, or a thrown object moving along a [[parabola|parabolic]] trajectory.  The exception is mechanical movement, which typically moves in straight lines.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nAs an object's speed or momentum increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, a fastball would tend to move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed would be unable to turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.\n\nAn object in motion that moves out of its natural arc for no apparent reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later.\n\n===Secondary action===\n\nAdding secondary actions to the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 63\u20134.</ref> The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take attention away from the main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out.<ref name=\"PoA SA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/secondar.html|title=Secondary Action|last=De Stefano|first=Ralph A|publisher=Electronic Visualization Laboratory, [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed.

Inversely, fewer pictures are drawn within the ''middle'' of the animation to emphasize faster action.<ref name=\"AT\"/> This principle applies to characters moving between two extreme poses, such as sitting down and standing up, but also for inanimate, moving objects, like the bouncing ball in the above illustration.<ref name=\"IPA SI&SO\">{{cite web |url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Slow_In_and_Slow_Out |title=Slow In and Out |last=Willian |date=July 5, 2006 |publisher=Blender |accessdate=June 28, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216173559/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Slow_In_and_Slow_Out |archive-date=February 16, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Arc===\nMost natural action tends to follow an arched [[trajectory]], and animation should adhere to this principle by following implied \"arcs\" for greater realism.  This technique can be applied to a moving limb by rotating a joint, or a thrown object moving along a [[parabola|parabolic]] trajectory.  The exception is mechanical movement, which typically moves in straight lines.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 62\u20133.</ref>\n\nAs an object's speed or momentum increases, arcs tend to flatten out in moving ahead and broaden in turns. In baseball, a fastball would tend to move in a straighter line than other pitches; while a figure skater moving at top speed would be unable to turn as sharply as a slower skater, and would need to cover more ground to complete the turn.\n\nAn object in motion that moves out of its natural arc for no apparent reason will appear erratic rather than fluid. For example, when animating a pointing finger, the animator should be certain that in all drawings in between the two extreme poses, the fingertip follows a logical arc from one extreme to the next. Traditional animators tend to draw the arc in lightly on the paper for reference, to be erased later.\n\n===Secondary action===\n\nAdding secondary actions to the main action gives a scene more life, and can help to support the main action. A person walking can simultaneously swing their arms or keep them in their pockets, speak or whistle, or express emotions through facial expressions.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), pp. 63\u20134.</ref> The important thing about secondary actions is that they emphasize, rather than take attention away from the main action. If the latter is the case, those actions are better left out.<ref name=\"PoA SA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.evl.uic.edu/ralph/508S99/secondar.html|title=Secondary Action|last=De Stefano|first=Ralph A|publisher=Electronic Visualization Laboratory, [[University of Illinois at Chicago]]|accessdate=June 28, 2008}}</ref> For example, during a dramatic movement, facial expressions will often go unnoticed. In these cases, it is better to include them at the beginning and the end of the movement, rather than during.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 64.</ref>\n\n===Timing===\n{{Redirect|Timing (animation)|the animation technique|Blocking (animation)|sheet timing|Exposure sheet}}\nTiming refers to the number of drawings or frames for a given action, which translates to the speed of the action on film.<ref name=\"AT\"/> On a purely physical level, correct timing makes objects appear to obey the laws of physics.

The classical definition of exaggeration, employed by Disney, was to remain true to reality, just presenting it in a wilder, more extreme form.<ref>Johnston & Thomas (1981), p. 65-6.</ref> Other forms of exaggeration can involve the supernatural or surreal, alterations in the physical features of a character; or elements in the storyline itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|title=Exaggeration|last=Willian|date=June 29, 2006|publisher=Blender|accessdate=June 28, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207202658/http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/BSoD/Introduction_to_the_Principles_of_Animation/Principles/Exaggeration|archive-date=February 7, 2009|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is important to employ a certain level of restraint when using exaggeration.

A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. In late 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the \"[[Ramadan Offensive (2003)|Ramadan Offensive]]\", as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]].\n\nTo counter this offensive, coalition forces began to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion, by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam's birthplace of [[al-Auja]] and the small town of [[Abu Hishma]], were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.\n\n====Coalition Provisional Authority and the Iraq Survey Group====\n{{See also|Iraqi Governing Council|International Advisory and Monitoring Board|Coalition Provisional Authority Program Review Board|l3=CPA Program Review Board|Development Fund for Iraq|Reconstruction of Iraq}}\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA; {{lang-ar|\u0633\u0644\u0637\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0626\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062d\u062f\u0629}}), based in the [[Green Zone]], as a [[transitional government]] of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483]] (22 May 2003) and the [[laws of war]], the CPA vested itself with executive, [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on 21 April 2003 until its dissolution on 28 June 2004.\n\n[[File:Iraq 2003 occupation.png|thumb|left|Occupation zones in [[Coalition Provisional Authority|Iraq]] as of September 2003]]\nThe CPA was originally headed by [[Jay Garner]], a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted only until 11 May 2003, when President Bush appointed [[L.&nbsp;Paul Bremer]]. On 16 May 2003, his first day on the job, Paul Bremer issued [[Coalition Provisional Authority Order 1]] to exclude from the new Iraqi government and administration members of the Baathist party. This policy, known as [[De-Ba'athification]], eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their job,<ref>[http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders,%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf \"US Blunders in Iraq\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181004/http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders%2C%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf |date=29 November 2016}} ''Intelligence and National Security'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 76\u201385, February 2010.</ref> including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to keep their jobs. U.S. army general [[Ricardo Sanchez]] called the decision a \"catastrophic failure\".<ref>Sanchez, Wiser in Battle, p.185.</ref> Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.\n\nIn May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, [[Walter B. Slocombe]], advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased.<ref>\"Reintegration of Regular [IRAQ] Army\", DDR Tasks \u2013 The Army, 3 July 2003 10:03 AM</ref> At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Despite advice from U.S. Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the U.S. policy. Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy. Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army, no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq; the week after, five U.S. soldiers were killed. Then, on 18 June 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad who were throwing rocks at coalition forces. The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.<ref>America vs. Iraq, 26 August 2013, National Geographic, Television Production, Documentary</ref>\n\nAnother group created by the [[multinational force in Iraq]] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [[Iraq Survey Group]], who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs.

Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.\n\nShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an [[Iraqi Interim Government]].

An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia [[Mahdi Army]] also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\nThe most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when [[Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] ambushed a [[Blackwater&nbsp;USA]] convoy led by four U.S. [[private military contractor]]s who were providing security for food caterers [[Eurest Support Services]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/contractors/highrisk.html |title=frontline: private warriors: contractors: the high-risk contracting business |publisher=PBS |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> The four armed contractors, [[Scott Helvenston]], Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire.

This policy, known as [[De-Ba'athification]], eventually led to the removal of 85,000 to 100,000 Iraqi people from their job,<ref>[http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders,%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf \"US Blunders in Iraq\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129181004/http://pfiffner.gmu.edu/files/pdfs/Articles/CPA%20Orders%2C%20Iraq%20PDF.pdf |date=29 November 2016}} ''Intelligence and National Security'' Vol. 25, No. 1, 76\u201385, February 2010.</ref> including 40,000 school teachers who had joined the Baath Party simply to keep their jobs. U.S. army general [[Ricardo Sanchez]] called the decision a \"catastrophic failure\".<ref>Sanchez, Wiser in Battle, p.185.</ref> Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in June 2004.\n\nIn May 2003, the US Advisor to Iraq Ministry of Defense within the CPA, [[Walter B. Slocombe]], advocated changing the pre-war Bush policy to employ the former Iraq Army after hostilities on the ground ceased.<ref>\"Reintegration of Regular [IRAQ] Army\", DDR Tasks \u2013 The Army, 3 July 2003 10:03 AM</ref> At the time, hundreds of thousands of former Iraq soldiers who had not been paid for months were waiting for the CPA to hire them back to work to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Despite advice from U.S. Military Staff working within the CPA, Bremer met with President Bush, via video conference, and asked for authority to change the U.S. policy. Bush gave Bremer and Slocombe authority to change the pre-war policy. Slocombe announced the policy change in the Spring of 2003. The decision led to the alienation of hundreds of thousands of former armed Iraq soldiers, who subsequently aligned themselves with various occupation resistance movements all over Iraq. In the week before the order to dissolve the Iraq Army, no coalition forces were killed by hostile action in Iraq; the week after, five U.S. soldiers were killed. Then, on 18 June 2003, coalition forces opened fire on former Iraq soldiers protesting in Baghdad who were throwing rocks at coalition forces. The policy to disband the Iraq Army was reversed by the CPA only days after it was implemented. But it was too late; the former Iraq Army shifted their alliance from one that was ready and willing to work with the CPA to one of armed resistance against the CPA and the coalition forces.<ref>America vs. Iraq, 26 August 2013, National Geographic, Television Production, Documentary</ref>\n\nAnother group created by the [[multinational force in Iraq]] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [[Iraq Survey Group]], who conducted a fact-finding mission to find Iraq weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs.

In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\n\nMost significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003, on a farm near [[Tikrit]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pentagon: Saddam is POW|publisher=CNN|date=10 January 2004|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/01/09/sprj.nirq.saddam/}}</ref> The operation was conducted by the [[United States Army]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] and members of [[Task Force 121]].

The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}} in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.\n\nShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an [[Iraqi Interim Government]]. Most prominent among these was the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] cleric [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]]. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Why the U.S. is Running Scared of Elections in Iraq |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=19 January 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jan/19/usa.iraq|accessdate=21 November 2006}}</ref> The insurgents stepped up their activities.

Insurgent forces reorganised during this time, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive. However, violence did increase during the [[Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004]] with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]], an affiliated [[al-Qaeda]] group led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], helping to drive the insurgency.{{Citation needed|reason=What is that about?

An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia [[Mahdi Army]] also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\n\nThe most serious fighting of the war so far began on 31 March 2004, when [[Iraqi insurgency (2003\u201311)|Iraqi insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] ambushed a [[Blackwater&nbsp;USA]] convoy led by four U.S. [[private military contractor]]s who were providing security for food caterers [[Eurest Support Services]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/contractors/highrisk.html |title=frontline: private warriors: contractors: the high-risk contracting business |publisher=PBS |accessdate=23 October 2010}}</ref> The four armed contractors, [[Scott Helvenston]], Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire.

Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.\n\nThe summer of 2005 saw fighting around [[Baghdad]] and at [[Tall Afar]] in northwestern Iraq as U.S. forces tried to seal off the Syrian border.

He noted the Iraq War \"will always be clouded by how it began\" regarding Saddam Hussein's supposed [[weapons of mass destruction]], which were never confirmed to have existed. Gates continued, \"This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html?hp|work=The New York Times |title=U.S. Formally Begins a New Era in Iraq |first=Michael |last=Gordon |date=1 September 2010}}</ref> On the same day Gen.

{"title_page": "Minor league", "text_new": "{{short description|Professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Minor leagues''' are professional [[sports league|sports leagues]] which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those [[sports]]. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets.  This term is used in [[North America]] with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.\n\nThe minor league concept is a manifestation of the [[professional sports league organization|franchise system]] used in North American sports, whereby the group of [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, the football leagues have many divisions below the ''top-flight'' as part of the [[promotion and relegation|football pyramid]]. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual [[promotion and relegation]], meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.\n\n== American football ==\nWhile there are various semi-professional [[American football|football]] leagues, none have any affiliation with the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]], the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]], and most recently, the league owned-and-operated [[NFL Europe]]. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team's [[practice squad]].\n\nSeveral NFL owners had purchased teams in the [[Arena Football League]] in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. [[Arena football]] is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, [[af2]], until 2009. Several other independent [[indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues that play a similar game exist.\n\nSimilarly, the [[Canadian Football League]], though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of [[Canada]].\n\nSeveral minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone. Some, such as the [[Alliance of American Football]] and [[Fall Experimental Football League]] (along with the FXFL's successor, the still extant but non-paying [[The Spring League]]), have explicit minor league and developmental aspirations. Others, such as the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] and both the [[XFL (2001)|2001]] and [[XFL (2020)|2020]] incarnations of the XFL, have sought to maintain independence and maintain a national profile while acknowledging the lack of funds (particularly from television, which is by far the NFL's largest revenue stream) that would be needed to compete for NFL-caliber talent. The UFL during its existence was recognized and accepted as the second tier of professional football behind the NFL, with several former NFL stars playing in the UFL near the ends of their careers.\n\n== Association football (soccer) ==\nBelow [[Major League Soccer]] several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border as part of the [[United States soccer league system|American]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canadian]] soccer pyramids. As is standard for [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|sports in both countries]], the formal [[promotion and relegation]] system is not used, although teams have been informally \"promoted\" from lower leagues up to Major League Soccer. As of the current 2019 U.S.\u2013Canada soccer season, the second level is the [[USL Championship]] (USLC; previously the United Soccer League, or USL). The [[North American Soccer League]] had previously been the second level, sharing that status with the USL in 2017, but major instability in the NASL led to the loss of that league's second-division status and ultimately its demise. The USL Championship's parent organization, known as the [[United Soccer League]] (originally \"Leagues\"), also operates [[USL League Two]] (formerly the Premier Development League, or PDL), a semi-professional league that has some age restrictions. The [[National Premier Soccer League]] operates at approximately the same level as USL League Two. In the spring of 2019, the USL organization launched [[USL League One]] (USL 1),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uslleagueone.com/news_article/show/964558-usl-league-one-unveils-2019-season-structure|title=USL League One Unveils 2019 Season Structure|date=2018-11-17|website=USL League One|language=en-us|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> which is sanctioned as a third-level professional league, and another third-level circuit, the [[National Independent Soccer Association]], also began play in 2019. \n\nIn 2013 Major League Soccer announced a partnership with the USL organization which began formal affiliation between some USL teams and MLS teams.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/690369.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014213131/http://www.uslsoccer.com/home/690369.html |archivedate=2014-10-14 }}</ref> The partnership has continued to deepen; most MLS teams now field their own reserve teams in the USLC, while a few have their reserve sides in USL 1 instead of the USLC.

Soon, [[scout (sport)|scouts]] for the National League were traveling to watch minor league teams play and attempting to sign the more talented ones away. Soon [[Major League Baseball]] began formal developmental agreements with some minor league teams, while others remained [[independent league baseball|independent]]. \n\nSince it was first developed in the 1920s by St. Louis Cardinals executive [[Branch Rickey]], the formal developmental affiliations have come to dominate minor league baseball, and the majority of minor leagues are part of the affiliated system. A general decline in minor league attendance occurred following the advent of television; minor league clubs only survived in many markets because their major league affiliations included financial support. The trend began to reverse in the 1990s, as new independent minor leagues began for the first time in decades and have become successful to varying levels.\n\n== Basketball ==\nThe [[National Basketball Association]] has an affiliated minor league: the [[NBA G League]] (formerly called the \"NBA D-League\"). The now-defunct [[Continental Basketball Association]] (CBA) served some of the purposes of a minor league for the NBA for many years.  However, there were no direct developmental agreements between CBA and NBA teams the way that there are between Major League Baseball and National Hockey League teams and their minor league affiliates.\n\n== Ice hockey ==\nThe sport with the next most extensive system of minor league teams other than baseball is [[ice hockey]].  In North America, between 1988 and 2005, 233 [[minor ice hockey]] teams played in a total of 160 cities in 13 minor professional leagues. The vast majority of these teams played in the United States, with only 21 of these teams based in Canadian cities. 123 of these minor professional teams played in the southern United States.<ref name=\"scott2006\">{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Scott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|pages=vii|isbn=1-894974-21-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/hockeynightindix0000stot}}</ref> One reason given for the large number of American-based teams is that minor league franchises will frequently move from city to city, and even between leagues.<ref name=\"scott2006\"/> In contrast, Canadian cities more commonly host [[junior ice hockey|major junior]] teams, which develop teenage prospects prior to their move to the professional leagues.\n\nThe [[American Hockey League]] is the most prominent of the minor hockey leagues in North America.\n\n'''Current minor leagues'''\n*[[American Hockey League]] (AHL)\n*[[ECHL]] (formerly known as the ''East Coast Hockey League'')\n*[[Federal Prospects Hockey League]] (FPHL)\n*[[Ligue Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine de Hockey]] (LNAH)\n*[[Southern Professional Hockey League]] (SPHL)\n\n'''Former minor leagues'''\n*[[Atlantic Coast Hockey League (2002\u201303)|Atlantic Coast Hockey League]] (ACHL), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]\n*[[Central Hockey League]] (CHL), merged into the [[ECHL]]\n*[[International Hockey League (1945\u20132001)|International Hockey League]] (IHL), merged into the [[American Hockey League]] \n*[[International Hockey League (2007-2010)|International Hockey League (2007)]] (IHL), formerly the ''[[United Hockey League]]'' and ''[[Colonial Hockey League]]'', merged into the [[Central Hockey League]] \n*[[South East Hockey League]] (SEHL), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]\n*[[West Coast Hockey League]] (WCHL), merged into the [[ECHL]]\n*[[Western Hockey League (1952\u201374)]] (WHL), merged into the [[Central Hockey League (1963-1984)]]\n*[[Western Professional Hockey League]] (WPHL), merged into the [[Central Hockey League]]\n*[[World Hockey Association 2]] (WHA2), now part of the [[Southern Professional Hockey League]]\n\nAll [[National Hockey League]] teams have a [[farm team]] in the [[American Hockey League]] and often have a secondary affiliated team in the [[ECHL]]. On \"the farm\", the NHL team will develop young players, occasionally rehabilitate older players who are injured or whose quality of play has slumped.  These teams, in turn, have lower-level minor leagues to draw players from and pass players down to.  Minor professional ice hockey leagues should not be confused with [[Junior ice hockey|Junior]] (amateur players) or [[Senior ice hockey|Senior]] (semi-professional to amateur) ice hockey leagues.\n\n== Other sports ==\nOther sports organizations considered to be minor leagues are golf's [[Korn Ferry Tour]] and [[Symetra Tour]], respectively affiliated with the [[PGA Tour]] and [[LPGA]]; [[NASCAR]]'s [[NASCAR Xfinity Series|Xfinity Series]], [[NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series|Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series]] and [[Whelen All-American Series]] (and to a lesser extent [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] and it's [[ARCA Menards Series]] due to ARCA's buyout by NASCAR in 2018); [[Monster Jam]]'s Triple Threat Series; and various other affiliated satellite tours of other individual sports, including the Challengers Tour of Professional Tennis.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]]\n* [[List of top level minor league sports teams in the United States by city]]\n* [[Minor ice hockey]]\n* [[Minor League Baseball]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Sport}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Minor League}}\n\n[[Category:Terminology used in multiple sports]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Professional sports leagues which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those sports}}\n{{Refimprove|date=April 2016}}\n\n'''Minor leagues''' are professional [[sports league|sports leagues]] which are not regarded as the premier leagues in those [[sports]]. Minor league teams tend to play in smaller, less elaborate venues, often competing in smaller cities/markets.  This term is used in [[North America]] with regard to several organizations competing in various sports. They generally have lesser fan bases and smaller budgets.\n\nThe minor league concept is a manifestation of the [[professional sports league organization|franchise system]] used in North American sports, whereby the group of [[major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major league]] teams in each sport is fixed for long periods between expansions or other adjustments, which only take place with the consent of the major league owners. In Europe, and many other parts of the world, the football leagues have many divisions below the ''top-flight'' as part of the [[promotion and relegation|football pyramid]]. In other parts of the world there is usually either a system of annual [[promotion and relegation]], meaning that clubs have no fixed status in the hierarchy, or there is only one professional league per country in each sport, rendering the major/minor distinction irrelevant.\n\n== American football ==\nWhile there are various semi-professional [[American football|football]] leagues, none have any affiliation with the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The NFL and its teams have had working relationships with several independent leagues in the past, including the [[Association of Professional Football Leagues]], the [[Atlantic Coast Football League]], and most recently, the league owned-and-operated [[NFL Europe]]. In modern times, the NFL has developed players not ready for the active roster through each team's [[practice squad]].\n\nSeveral NFL owners had purchased teams in the [[Arena Football League]] in the mid-2000s, prior to its bankruptcy and restructuring. [[Arena football]] is played under very different conditions, and the AFL had its own minor league, [[af2]], until 2009. Several other independent [[indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues that play a similar game exist.\n\nSimilarly, the [[Canadian Football League]], though it has developed ties with the NFL in recent years and has moved away from competing with the NFL for talent, plays a visibly different game than the American game, and the two sports favor different types of skills; the CFL arguably holds major league status in its home territory of [[Canada]].\n\nSeveral minor or developmental leagues, independent of the NFL, have come and gone. Some, such as the [[Alliance of American Football]] and [[Fall Experimental Football League]] (along with the FXFL's successor, the still extant but non-paying [[The Spring League]]), have explicit minor league and developmental aspirations. Others, such as the [[United Football League (2009\u20132012)|United Football League]] and both the [[XFL (2001)|2001]] and upcoming [[XFL (2020)|2020]] incarnations of the XFL, have sought to maintain independence and maintain a national profile while acknowledging the lack of funds (particularly from television, which is by far the NFL's largest revenue stream) that would be needed to compete for NFL-caliber talent. The UFL during its existence was recognized and accepted as the second tier of professional football behind the NFL, with several former NFL stars playing in the UFL near the ends of their careers.\n\n== Association football (soccer) ==\nBelow [[Major League Soccer]] several lower-level leagues operate on both sides of the U.S.\u2013Canada border as part of the [[United States soccer league system|American]] and [[Canadian soccer league system|Canadian]] soccer pyramids.
