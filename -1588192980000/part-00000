As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

The 3DO code was then [[Porting|ported]] to PC as ''The Ur-Quan Masters''. A sequel, ''[[Star Control 3]]'', was released in 1996.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:StarControl2 Entering Sol System.png|thumb|left|The Captain's ship enters the [[Sol System]] at the beginning of the game. (In The Ur-Quan Masters.)]]\n[[File:StarControlII Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Discussion with various characters is an important aspect in the game. Here the player is speaking with Commander Hayes at the Earth starbase.]]\n''Star Control II'' added a large number of [[species]] and ship types to the already diverse cast and replaced the first game's strategy-based scenarios with a story-driven space exploration [[adventure game]] that included diplomacy with the inhabitants of the galaxy, some [[resource gathering]] sub-sections, and instances of the space combat of the first game whenever diplomacy fails.\n\nAs typical of the adventure game genre, the player must explore the game world with little direction and make discoveries and connections independently. Interaction with the various alien species is a chief part of the adventure game; the backstory of both the species from the first games and new ones were fleshed out considerably. There are hours of dialogue, each species bringing out their characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.\n\nA two-player mode is available, named Super Melee, consisting solely of the ship-to-ship combat. All ships from the first game are available, even if they made no appearance in the story, along with a number of new ones.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition's Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.<ref>Star Control II Manual, available at [http://www.abandonia.com/files/extras/Star%20Control%202_Manual.zip Abandonia].</ref>\n\nThe player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth's caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what's happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans' allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an [[internecine war]] with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans' distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the invincible Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.\n\nThe Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan's hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan.\n\n==Development==\n''Star Control II'' began as a more ambitious project than the original Star Control, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a \"science fiction adventure role-playing game\".<ref name=\"Barton2016\"/> Reiche and Ford heavily credit the ''[[Starflight]]'' game series as an influence, \"in large part because the designer of Starflight, Greg Johnson, was one of the most significant contributors to Star Control II\".<ref name=gamespotinterview>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305195839/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/starcon22.html | publisher = GameSpot | author = Greg Kasavin | title = Greatest Games of All Time - Star Control II (Interview Feature) | date = 2003-06-27 }}</ref> Reiche also cited the influence of fiction writers such as [[Jack Vance]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Robert Heinlein]], [[David Brin]], and [[Andre Norton]].<ref name=gamespotinterview/> [[David Brin]]'s science fiction series about the [[Uplift Universe]] is also often mentioned as inspiration for the ''Star Control II'' universe, as well as [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stars and planets were created through a combination of [[procedural generation]] and handcrafted assets.<ref name=\"Bycer2018\"/> Ford and Reiche initially tried to simulate the generation of planets more accurately,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/video-how-star-control-ii-was-almost-a-much-more-boring-game/ | author = Lee Hutchinson | title = \"How Star Control II was almost a much more boring game\" | publisher = Ars Technica | date = 2018-12-27 }}</ref> but ultimately decided to bypass some details of the simulation, to create more interesting and distinct worlds.<ref name=\"DeMaria2018\"/>  \n\nThe story for Star Control II expands on the characters first created in the original Star Control.<ref name=\"Barton2016\">{{cite book|author=Matt Barton|title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV7OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA203|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6754-2|pages=203\u2013}}</ref> Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them.

Musicians were searched by posting a contest to [[Amiga]] users' [[newsgroup]] because mostly Amiga hobbyists were making sample-based [[tracker music]] those days.<ref>Skrolli magazine, Issue 3/2014, page 37</ref> Music is in [[Protracker]]-[[MOD (file format)|MOD]] format which uses digitized instrument samples while most of the PC game music still relied on FM-synthesis-based instruments at the time.

(In The Ur-Quan Masters.)]]\n[[File:StarControlII Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Discussion with various characters is an important aspect in the game. Here the player is speaking with Commander Hayes at the Earth starbase.]]\n''Star Control II'' added a large number of [[species]] and ship types to the already diverse cast and replaced the first game's strategy-based scenarios with a story-driven space exploration [[adventure game]] that included diplomacy with the inhabitants of the galaxy, some [[resource gathering]] sub-sections, and instances of the space combat of the first game whenever diplomacy fails.\n\nAs typical of the adventure game genre, the player must explore the game world with little direction and make discoveries and connections independently. Interaction with the various alien species is a chief part of the adventure game; the backstory of both the species from the first games and new ones were fleshed out considerably. There are hours of dialogue, each species bringing out their characteristic conversational quirks, music, and even display fonts.\n\nA two-player mode is available, named Super Melee, consisting solely of the ship-to-ship combat. All ships from the first game are available, even if they made no appearance in the story, along with a number of new ones.\n\n== Plot ==\nIn the last phase of the war between the Alliance of Free Stars and the Hierarchy of Battle Thralls, an Earthling ship discovered an ancient [[Precursor (Star Control)|Precursor]] subterranean installation in the Vela star system. A massive Hierarchy offensive forced the Alliance fleets to retreat beyond Vela, stranding the science expedition, who went in to hiding. Decades later, with the help of a genius child born on the planet, the colonists activated the Precursor machinery and found out that it was programmed to build a highly advanced but unfinished starship, which could be piloted only by the now grown genius child, who alone could interact with the Precursor central computer. The new ship set out to Sol to make contact with Earth, but shortly before reaching Sol the little fleet was attacked by an unknown probe; The expedition commander, captaining the expedition's Earthling Cruiser, intercepted the alien ship before it could damage the defenseless Precursor starship, but was killed in the short fight, leaving the genius young man in command.<ref>Star Control II Manual, available at [http://www.abandonia.com/files/extras/Star%20Control%202_Manual.zip Abandonia].</ref>\n\nThe player begins the game as the commander of the Precursor starship, who returns to Earth to find it enslaved by the Ur-Quan. The Captain gains the support of the skeleton crew of Earth's caretaker starbase and ventures out to contact the other races to find out what's happened since the end of the war and try to recruit allies in to a New Alliance of Free Stars against the Ur-Quan. The Captain quickly discovers that the rest of the humans' allies in the war against the Ur-Quan have either been eradicated, put under slave shields, or put into service as Ur-Quan battle thralls. As the player progresses, it is revealed that the Ur-Quan are fighting an [[internecine war]] with the Kohr-Ah, a subspecies of Ur-Quan who believe in eradicating all life in the galaxy, as opposed to enslaving it. The winner of this war will gain access to the Sa-Matra, a Precursor battle platform of unparalleled power. The player must take advantage of the Ur-Quans' distraction to contact and recruit alien races into a new alliance, gather resources and build a fleet, and find a way to destroy the invincible Sa-Matra, before the Ur-Quan finish their war and become unstoppable.\n\nThe Captain resolves issues several of the races are facing, or exploits their weaknesses, to get them on side. Notably the Captain finds the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm on Procyon undergoing their own plan to merge in to a composite species powerful enough to defeat the Ur-Quan, and captures a psychic alien Dnyarri, which the Captain discovers is a member of the race that brutally enslaved the galaxy millennia ago, causing the Ur-Quan's hegemonic and genocidal rampage around the galaxy. The Captain uses a precursor Sun Device to accelerate the merging of the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm to create the Chmmr, who amplify a precursor terraforming bomb, allowing the Captain to sacrifice his ship to destroy the Sa-Matra and defeat the Ur-Quan.\n\n==Development==\n''Star Control II'' began as a more ambitious project than the original Star Control, with Reiche and Ford hoping to go beyond ship combat to develop a \"science fiction adventure role-playing game\".<ref name=\"Barton2016\"/> Reiche and Ford heavily credit the ''[[Starflight]]'' game series as an influence, \"in large part because the designer of Starflight, Greg Johnson, was one of the most significant contributors to Star Control II\".<ref name=gamespotinterview>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050305195839/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/all/greatestgames/starcon22.html | publisher = GameSpot | author = Greg Kasavin | title = Greatest Games of All Time - Star Control II (Interview Feature) | date = 2003-06-27 }}</ref> Reiche also cited the influence of fiction writers such as [[Jack Vance]], [[Orson Scott Card]], [[Robert Heinlein]], [[David Brin]], and [[Andre Norton]].<ref name=gamespotinterview/> [[David Brin]]'s science fiction series about the [[Uplift Universe]] is also often mentioned as inspiration for the ''Star Control II'' universe, as well as [[Larry Niven]]'s [[Known Space]] universe.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe stars and planets were created through a combination of [[procedural generation]] and handcrafted assets.<ref name=\"Bycer2018\"/> Ford and Reiche initially tried to simulate the generation of planets more accurately,<ref>{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/video-how-star-control-ii-was-almost-a-much-more-boring-game/ | author = Lee Hutchinson | title = \"How Star Control II was almost a much more boring game\" | publisher = Ars Technica | date = 2018-12-27 }}</ref> but ultimately decided to bypass some details of the simulation, to create more interesting and distinct worlds.<ref name=\"DeMaria2018\"/>  \n\nThe story for Star Control II expands on the characters first created in the original Star Control.<ref name=\"Barton2016\">{{cite book|author=Matt Barton|title=Honoring the Code: Conversations with Great Game Designers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UV7OBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA203|date=19 April 2016|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-6754-2|pages=203\u2013}}</ref> Paul Reiche III describes this creative process, \"I know it probably sounds weird, but when I design a game like this, I make drawings of the characters and stare at them.

Covering {{Convert|16401|km2|abbr=on}}, Styria is the second largest of the nine component states of Austria (also sometimes referred to as provinces in English), after [[Lower Austria]]. Styria's neighbor to the South is [[Slovenia]] ([[Carinthia Statistical Region]], [[Drava Statistical Region]] and [[Mura Statistical Region]]). Within Austria, the contiguous states are [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and [[Burgenland|The Burgenland]]. <!-- The population (as of {{EWD|AT|6}}) was {{EWZ|AT|6}}. --> The state capital is [[Graz]], which had 276,526 inhabitants at the beginning of 2015.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe [[March of Styria]] derived its name from the original seat of its ruling [[Otakars|Otakar]] dynasty: [[Steyr]], in today's [[Upper Austria]]. In German, the area is still called \"Steiermark\" while in English the Latin name \"Styria\" is used. The ancient link between Steyr and Styria is also apparent in their nearly identical coats of arms, a white [[Panther (legendary creature)|Panther]] on a green background.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gr\u00fcner See.jpg|thumb|[[Gr\u00fcner See (Styria)|Gr\u00fcner See]]]]\n* The term \"'''[[Upper Styria]]'''\" ({{lang-de|Obersteiermark}}) refers to the northern and northwestern parts of the federal-state (districts [[Liezen (district)|Liezen]], [[Murau (district)|Murau]], [[Murtal District|Murtal]], [[Leoben (district)|Leoben]], [[Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag (district)|Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag]]).\n* The term \"'''Western Styria'''\" (''Weststeiermark'') is used for the districts to the west of Graz ([[Voitsberg (district)|Voitsberg]], [[Deutschlandsberg (district)|Deutschlandsberg]], western part of the district [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz]]).\n* The districts east of Graz ([[Weiz (district)|Weiz]], [[Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld District|Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld]], and [[S\u00fcdoststeiermark District|S\u00fcdoststeiermark ]]) are referred to as \"'''Eastern Styria'''\" (''Oststeiermark'').\nThe western and eastern parts of the district [[Graz-Umgebung (district)|Graz-Umgebung]] (literally, ''surroundings'' of Graz) may or may not be considered parts of West and East Styria, respectively. The southern parts of the [[Styria (duchy)|Duchy of Styria]], which formed part of former [[Yugoslavia]] and later [[Slovenia]] (with the exception of World War II), were (and sometimes colloquially still are) referred to as \"'''[[Lower Styria]]'''\" (''Untersteiermark''; {{lang-sl|\u0160tajerska}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:07 Graz, Austria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Graz]], the capital of Styria]]\n[[File:023 Grenzmaut zwischen K\u00e4rnten und Steiermark bei der Ruine D\u00fcrnstein - J.F.Kaiser Lithografirte Ansichten der Steiermark 1825.jpg|thumb|Historical view of the border between Styria and Carinthia, 1830]]\n{{main|History of Styria}}\nDuring early [[ancient Rome|Roman times]], Styria was inhabited by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes. After its conquest by the Romans, the eastern part of what is now Styria was part of [[Pannonia]], while the western one was included in [[Noricum]]. During the [[Barbarian invasions]], it was conquered or crossed by the [[Visigoths]], the [[Huns]], the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Rugii]], and the [[Lombards]]. [[Slavs]], who first were under the domination of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], settled in the valleys of this country (around 600 and onwards). At the same time Bavarian people (under [[Franks|Frankish]] domination) began to expand their area to the south and east and absorbed the Slavic population.\n\nIn 1180 Styria separated from the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and became a Duchy of its own; in 1192 the Austrian Duke Leopold V became also Duke of Styria. Later, Styria formed the central part of [[Inner Austria]].\n\nStyria developed culturally and economically under [[Archduke John of Austria]] between 1809 and 1859.\n\nIn 1918, after [[World War I]], it was divided into a northern section (forming what is the current Austrian state), and a southern one, called [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]], now inhabited by Slovenians, and which was annexed to Yugoslavia, and later became part of Slovenia. As a result of the turbulence of the two world wars, the German-speaking population of [[Untersteiermark|Lower Styria]], which had been concentrated in the cities, migrated out of the region or was expelled.   \n\n==Economy==\n[[file:S\u00fcdsteiermark.JPG|thumb|View over the vineyards of South-Styria]]\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 49.6 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 12.9% of the Austria's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 35,400 \u20ac or 118% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAs elsewhere in the developed world, there has been a shift away from the [[manufacturing sector]] towards the [[service sector]] in Styria. This has had negative consequences for the industrial regions of upper Styria, which have suffered a steady decline in population in recent years.\n\nIn 2004 Styria had the strongest [[economic growth]] rate in Austria at 3.8%\u2014mainly due to the Graz area which saw strong economic growth that year and has continued to grow in economic and population terms since then.\n\nStyria is home to more than 150 [[clean technology]] companies, of which one dozen are world technology leaders in their field. The revenue of Styrian cleantech companies totals \u20ac2.7 billion. This equals to 8 percent of the Gross Regional Product (GRP), and is one of the highest concentrations of leading clean technology companies in Europe. The companies have an average (real) growth rate of 22 percent per year\u2014well above the worldwide cleantech market growth of 18 percent per year. The region created roughly 2,000 additional green jobs in 2008 alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Shawn|title=Top 10 cleantech cluster organizations for 2010|url=http://cleantech.com/news/5640/top-10-cleantech-clusters|publisher=Clean Tech Group|access-date=14 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522014603/http://cleantech.com/news/5640/top-10-cleantech-clusters|archive-date=22 May 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe state is divided into 13 [[districts of Austria|districts]] (''Bezirke''), one of them a [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory city]].\n\n[[File:Karte Aut Stmk Bezirke.png|right|500px|StyriaL\u00e4nd Bezirke]]\n\n===Statutory city===\n* [[Graz]]\n\n===Districts===\n* [[Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag District|Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag]]\n* [[Deutschlandsberg (district)|Deutschlandsberg]]\n* [[Graz-Umgebung]]\n* [[Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld District|Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld]]\n* [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz]]\n* [[Leoben (district)|Leoben]]\n* [[Liezen (district)|Liezen]] (with the subdistrict [[Gr\u00f6bming]])\n* [[Murau (district)|Murau]]\n* [[Murtal District|Murtal]]\n* [[S\u00fcdoststeiermark District|S\u00fcdoststeiermark]]\n* [[Voitsberg (district)|Voitsberg]]\n* [[Weiz (district)|Weiz]]\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Crucifix.JPG|thumb|An enshrined [[crucifix]] amidst cornfields near [[Mureck]] in rural Styria, attesting to enduring Catholic faith]]\nThe state had been a stronghold of the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) since 1945. Graz however is more left leaning than the more rural parts of the province, with strong representation of the Green Party in local politics and elections, and a less-than-marginal presence of the far left [[Communist Party of Austria|Communist Party]] (KP\u00d6). \n\nThe governor (Austrian political term: ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'') has usually been a member of the \u00d6VP.\n\n===Recent elections===\nIn the 2005 elections for state parliament the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]] (SP\u00d6) under their regional chairman [[Franz Voves]] won the majority after the \u00d6VP had damaged its credibility through scandals and the secession of a high-ranking party member who took part in the 2005 elections after setting up his own party. In these elections, the KP\u00d6 also received many votes after it had gained much popularity through its role in local politics in Graz during the preceding few years. The two [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] parties, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6) and the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6), failed to win seats.\n\nIn subsequent elections in 2010 and 2015, the Social Democrats, the Austrian People's Party, and the Communist Party each lost between one fourth and one third of their shares of the vote relative to 2005. The Freedom Party grew from 4.6 percent to 26.8 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.verwaltung.steiermark.at/cms/dokumente/11680452_74837281/c79d024a/Tableau_endg%C3%BCltig_2010_grafik.pdf | title = Landtagswahl 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.verwaltung.steiermark.at/cms/dokumente/11680452_74837281/cb9cd634/Tableau_2015_endg%C3%BCltig.pdf | title = Landtagswahl 2015 }}</ref>\nThe current government of Styria is a coalition of Social Democrats and People's Party, with each party holding 4 seats of the 8 seats available.

Covering {{Convert|16401|km2|abbr=on}}, Styria is the second largest of the nine component states of Austria (also sometimes referred to as provinces in English), after [[Lower Austria]]. Styria's neighbor to the South is [[Slovenia]] ([[Carinthia Statistical Region]], [[Drava Statistical Region]] and [[Mura Statistical Region]]). Within Austria, the contiguous states are [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], and [[Burgenland|The Burgenland]]. <!-- The population (as of {{EWD|AT|6}}) was {{EWZ|AT|6}}. --> The state capital is [[Graz]], which had 276,526 inhabitants at the beginning of 2015.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe [[March of Styria]] derived its name from the original seat of its ruling [[Otakars|Otakar]] dynasty: [[Steyr]], in today's [[Upper Austria]]. In German, the area is still called \"Steiermark\" while in English the Latin name \"Styria\" is used. The ancient link between Steyr and Styria is also apparent in their nearly identical coats of arms, a white [[Panther (legendary creature)|Panther]] on a green background.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Gr\u00fcner See.jpg|thumb|[[Gr\u00fcner See (Styria)|Gr\u00fcner See]]]]\n* The term \"'''[[Upper Styria]]'''\" ({{lang-de|Obersteiermark}}) refers to the northern and northwestern parts of the federal-state (districts [[Liezen (district)|Liezen]], [[Murau (district)|Murau]], [[Murtal District|Murtal]], [[Leoben (district)|Leoben]], [[Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag (district)|Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag]]).\n* The term \"'''Western Styria'''\" (''Weststeiermark'') is used for the districts to the west of Graz ([[Voitsberg (district)|Voitsberg]], [[Deutschlandsberg (district)|Deutschlandsberg]], western part of the district [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz]]).\n* The districts east of Graz ([[Weiz (district)|Weiz]], [[Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld District|Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld]], and [[S\u00fcdoststeiermark District|S\u00fcdoststeiermark ]]) are referred to as \"'''Eastern Styria'''\" (''Oststeiermark'').\nThe western and eastern parts of the district [[Graz-Umgebung (district)|Graz-Umgebung]] (literally, ''surroundings'' of Graz) may or may not be considered parts of West and East Styria, respectively. The southern parts of the [[Styria (duchy)|Duchy of Styria]], which formed part of former [[Yugoslavia]] and later [[Slovenia]] (with the exception of World War II), were (and sometimes colloquially still are) referred to as \"'''[[Lower Styria]]'''\" (''Untersteiermark''; {{lang-sl|\u0160tajerska}}).\n\n==History==\n[[File:07 Graz, Austria.jpg|thumb|right|[[Graz]], the capital of Styria]]\n[[File:023 Grenzmaut zwischen K\u00e4rnten und Steiermark bei der Ruine D\u00fcrnstein - J.F.Kaiser Lithografirte Ansichten der Steiermark 1825.jpg|thumb|Historical view of the border between Styria and Carinthia, 1830]]\n{{main|History of Styria}}\nDuring early [[ancient Rome|Roman times]], Styria was inhabited by [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes. After its conquest by the Romans, the eastern part of what is now Styria was part of [[Pannonia]], while the western one was included in [[Noricum]]. During the [[Barbarian invasions]], it was conquered or crossed by the [[Visigoths]], the [[Huns]], the [[Ostrogoths]], the [[Rugii]], and the [[Lombards]]. [[Slavs]], who first were under the domination of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], settled in the valleys of this country (around 600 and onwards). At the same time Bavarian people (under [[Franks|Frankish]] domination) began to expand their area to the south and east and absorbed the Slavic population.\n\nIn 1180 Styria separated from the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] and became a Duchy of its own; in 1192 the Austrian Duke Leopold V became also Duke of Styria. Later, Styria formed the central part of [[Inner Austria]].\n\nStyria developed culturally and economically under [[Archduke John of Austria]] between 1809 and 1859.\n\nIn 1918, after [[World War I]], it was divided into a northern section (forming what is the current Austrian state), and a southern one, called [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]], now inhabited by Slovenians, and which was annexed to Yugoslavia, and later became part of Slovenia. As a result of the turbulence of the two world wars, the German-speaking population of [[Untersteiermark|Lower Styria]], which had been concentrated in the cities, migrated out of the region or was expelled.   \n\n==Economy==\n[[file:S\u00fcdsteiermark.JPG|thumb|View over the vineyards of South-Styria]]\n\nThe [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the state was 49.6 billion \u20ac in 2018, accounting for 12.9% of the Austria's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 35,400 \u20ac or 118% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=Eurostat|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\nAs elsewhere in the developed world, there has been a shift away from the [[manufacturing sector]] towards the [[service sector]] in Styria. This has had negative consequences for the industrial regions of upper Styria, which have suffered a steady decline in population in recent years.\n\nIn 2004 Styria had the strongest [[economic growth]] rate in Austria at 3.8%\u2014mainly due to the Graz area which saw strong economic growth that year and has continued to grow in economic and population terms since then.\n\nStyria is home to more than 150 [[clean technology]] companies, of which one dozen are world technology leaders in their field. The revenue of Styrian cleantech companies totals \u20ac2.7 billion. This equals to 8 percent of the Gross Regional Product (GRP), and is one of the highest concentrations of leading clean technology companies in Europe. The companies have an average (real) growth rate of 22 percent per year\u2014well above the worldwide cleantech market growth of 18 percent per year. The region created roughly 2,000 additional green jobs in 2008 alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lesser|first=Shawn|title=Top 10 cleantech cluster organizations for 2010|url=http://cleantech.com/news/5640/top-10-cleantech-clusters|publisher=Clean Tech Group|access-date=14 April 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522014603/http://cleantech.com/news/5640/top-10-cleantech-clusters|archive-date=22 May 2011|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThe state is divided into 13 [[districts of Austria|districts]] (''Bezirke''), one of them a [[statutory city (Austria)|statutory city]].\n\n[[File:Karte Aut Stmk Bezirke.png|right|500px|StyriaL\u00e4nd Bezirke]]\n\n===Statutory city===\n* [[Graz]]\n\n===Districts===\n* [[Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag District|Bruck-M\u00fcrzzuschlag]]\n* [[Deutschlandsberg (district)|Deutschlandsberg]]\n* [[Graz-Umgebung]]\n* [[Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld District|Hartberg-F\u00fcrstenfeld]]\n* [[Leibnitz (district)|Leibnitz]]\n* [[Leoben (district)|Leoben]]\n* [[Liezen (district)|Liezen]] (with the subdistrict [[Gr\u00f6bming]])\n* [[Murau (district)|Murau]]\n* [[Murtal District|Murtal]]\n* [[S\u00fcdoststeiermark District|S\u00fcdoststeiermark]]\n* [[Voitsberg (district)|Voitsberg]]\n* [[Weiz (district)|Weiz]]\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Crucifix.JPG|thumb|An enshrined [[crucifix]] amidst cornfields near [[Mureck]] in rural Styria, attesting to enduring Catholic faith]]\nThe state had been a stronghold of the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) since 1945. Graz however is more left leaning than the more rural parts of the province, with strong representation of the Green Party in local politics and elections, and a less-than-marginal presence of the far left [[Communist Party of Austria|Communist Party]] (KP\u00d6). \n\nThe governor (Austrian political term: ''[[Landeshauptmann]]'') has usually been a member of the \u00d6VP.\n\n===Recent elections===\nIn the 2005 elections for state parliament the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]] (SP\u00d6) under their regional chairman [[Franz Voves]] won the majority after the \u00d6VP had damaged its credibility through scandals and the secession of a high-ranking party member who took part in the 2005 elections after setting up his own party. In these elections, the KP\u00d6 also received many votes after it had gained much popularity through its role in local politics in Graz during the preceding few years. The two [[right-wing populism|right-wing populist]] parties, the [[Freedom Party of Austria]] (FP\u00d6) and the [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]] (BZ\u00d6), failed to win seats.\n\nIn subsequent elections in 2010 and 2015, the Social Democrats, the Austrian People's Party, and the Communist Party each lost between one fourth and one third of their shares of the vote relative to 2005. The Freedom Party grew from 4.6 percent to 26.8 percent.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.verwaltung.steiermark.at/cms/dokumente/11680452_74837281/c79d024a/Tableau_endg%C3%BCltig_2010_grafik.pdf | title = Landtagswahl 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.verwaltung.steiermark.at/cms/dokumente/11680452_74837281/cb9cd634/Tableau_2015_endg%C3%BCltig.pdf | title = Landtagswahl 2015 }}</ref>\nThe current government of Styria is a coalition of Social Democrats and People's Party, with each party holding 4 seats of the 8 seats available.
