The discovery of another body at a farmhouse owned by one of the possible suspects leads Morse right into the path of the killer.

Her fellow guests on the show, pop group The Wildwood, whose record Pettybon has tried to get banned from the airwaves, are prime suspects for sending the threats - and when one of Pettybon's closest allies, Reverend Golightly, is poisoned shortly after her appearance on the show, suspicions on the tearaway group begin to grow. When one of the group's founding members disappears during a writing session, Morse and Thursday are thrust out into the dark cold Oxford night to try and find him. When he finally reappears, they discover he too has been given a concoction of mysterious poison. When further tests are carried out on Barry Finch's corpse, traces of the poison are once again discovered, and Morse finds himself on the trail of a possible triple murderer.\n |Aux4=7.18\n |LineColor= 0C5083\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=16\n |EpisodeNumber2=3\n |Title=Lazaretto\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2017|1|22|df=y}}\n |DirectedBy=B\u00f6rkur Sig\u00fe\u00f3rsson\n |WrittenBy=Russell Lewis\n |ShortSummary=Morse is called to deal with the death of an elderly Oxford resident, Mrs Zacharides, who appears to have died of natural causes.

Back at the station, Thursday finds Bright collapsed in his office, having seemingly suffered from a perforated ulcer. Back on the ward, Morse catches an armed intruder who is trying to get to Bakewell, and gives pursuit. Following the breach of security, Bakewell is moved to the uninhabited Bed 10. The next morning, as the ward staff arrive on shift, they discover that Bakewell, who appeared to have been in recovery, has died.

The discovery of a body on an archaeological dig sends Morse to the village of Bramford, where botanist Matthew Laxman disappeared five years earlier and where pagan customs are upheld for the forthcoming Autumn equinox. All the locals, including reclusive clairvoyant Dowsabelle Chattox, deny seeing Laxman until Selina Berger, whose brother is a doctor, recalls seeing the missing man's car in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant nearby. While its director Elliot Blake assures Morse that it poses no danger, it is not a welcome presence in the village, the proposed site of a new reservoir. Morse believes the locals are lying when Laxman's jacket is found on a scarecrow and Dowsabelle and others admit that he came to Bramford and to the power station. As the celebrations begin Morse and Thursday rush to the station to prevent an aggrieved avenger destroying the whole area before unmasking Laxman's killer. \n |Aux4=6.76\n |LineColor= 0C5083\n}}\n}}\n\n===Series 5 (2018)===\n\n{{Episode table |background=#2D5A88 |overall= |series= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |viewers= |viewersT=UK viewers (millions)<ref name=\"barb.co.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">based on 28 day data from BARB for ITV and ITV+1 and 7 day data for ITV HD</ref><br /> <small>includes ITV HD and ITV+1</small> |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber=18\n |EpisodeNumber2=1\n |Title=Muse\n |OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2018|2|4|df=y}}\n |DirectedBy=Brady Hood\n |WrittenBy=Russell Lewis\n |ShortSummary=April 1968.

When yet another woman, Petra Connelly a student at an all female college Lady Matilda, is found dead on the towpath. Morse and Thursday have a public fall out in front of pathologist Max DeBryn and Strange, making his working as Thursday's 'bagman' untenable. Morse returns to Lucy Tate, the gifted ESP student, who is haunted by her childhood past and blamed for a fire that killed her family. Ludo seeks Morse's advice concerning his belief that his wife is seeing another man and arranges a meeting of all three at a restaurant. The teachers and students of Lady Matilda lay a trap to catch the towpath killer. A fatal accident at Lady Matilda's is added by Morse to a number of fatal accidents brought to his attention by presswoman Dorethea Frazil. Chief Superintendent Bright's wife is fatally electrocuted in a freak accident and Morse's claim that an insurance fraud is behind the accidents is dismissed by Thursday and Bright. Strange assists Morse with his theory and both end up at the house occupied by Carl Sturgis and discover Lucy Tate is being held prisoner.

The fifth generation descendant of the owner of the large family home, now the school for girls, thinks he might finally inherit with a change in laws for a bastard child. He murders those in his way, worked out by Morse by reading Weiss's detailed files.

The body of a scientist, who disappeared over a month previously, is found floating in a local river. The initial suspected cause of death is accidental drowning, but Morse is unconvinced. When a second victim is found drowned at the local swimming baths, Morse begins to recognise a pattern. He connects the victims to a university science group who are undertaking work on one of the first working computer systems. The death of a third victim sways Morse to convince a skeptical Thursday to use the computer technology to identify a possible list of suspects, connected in particular to the second victim. The discovery of another body at a farmhouse owned by one of the possible suspects leads Morse right into the path of the killer. Meanwhile, Morse is shocked by the news that his sergeant's exam papers have gone astray.

When one of the group's founding members disappears during a writing session, Morse and Thursday are thrust out into the dark cold Oxford night to try and find him.

Ludo seeks Morse's advice concerning his belief that his wife is seeing another man and arranges a meeting of all three at a restaurant. The teachers and students of Lady Matilda lay a trap to catch the towpath killer. A fatal accident at Lady Matilda's is added by Morse to a number of fatal accidents brought to his attention by presswoman Dorethea Frazil.

Newer archaeological evidence shows the presence of a people who lived in an area called Gungywump, somewhat northwest of the Mystic River, which suggests that the Pequots may have been indigenous to southeastern Connecticut prior to the 16th century.

They were in control of a considerable amount of territory, extending toward the [[Pawcatuck River]] to the east and the [[Connecticut River]] to the west.\n\nTo the northwest, the Five Nations of the [[Iroquois]] dominated the land linked by the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Hudson River]], allowing trading to occur between the Iroquois and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]].  The Pequots were settled just distant enough to be secure from any danger that the Iroquois posed.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\">Leigh Fought, ''A History of Mystic Connecticut: From Pequot Village to Tourist Town''. Charleston, North Carolina: www.historypress.net, 2007.</ref> The [[Pequot War]] profoundly affected the Mystic area between 1636 and 1638. In May 1637, captains John Underhill and John Mason led a mission through Narragansett land, along with their allies the Narragansetts and Mohegans, and struck the Pequot Indian settlement in Mystic in the event which came to be known as the [[Mystic massacre]].<ref name=\"accessed October 12, 2008\">The Pequot War. {{cite web |url=http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315215644/http://www.dowdgen.com/dowd/document/pequots.html |archivedate=2007-03-15 }} (accessed October 12, 2008).</ref> On September 21, 1638, the colonists signed the [[Treaty of Hartford (1638)|Treaty of Hartford]], officially ending the Pequot War.<ref name=\"accessed November 11, 2008\">[http://www.colonialwarsct.org/1637.htm \"1637 \u2013 The Pequot War\"] (2007).

Accessed November 11, 2008.</ref>\n\n===English settlement===\nAs a result of the Pequot War, Pequot control of the Mystic area ended and English settlements increased in the area. By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

By the 1640s, Connecticut Colony began to grant land to the Pequot War veterans. [[John Winthrop the Younger]], the son of the governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, was among those to receive property, much of which was in southeastern Connecticut. Other early settlers in the Mystic area included Robert Burrows and George Denison, who held land in the Mystic River Valley.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\">''Mystic: An American Journey''. Mystic: Mystic River Historical Society, 2004.</ref>\n\nSettlement grew slowly. The [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut government]] and Massachusetts Bay government began to quarrel over boundaries, thus causing some conflicting claims concerning governmental authority between the Mystic River and the [[Pawcatuck River]]. In the 1640s and 1650s, \"Connecticut\" referred to settlements located along the Connecticut River, as well as its claims in other parts of the region.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\">Mystic River Historical Society. ''Images of America: Mystic''. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Arcadia Publishing, 2004.</ref>  Massachusetts Bay, however, claimed to have authority over Stonington and even into Rhode Island.\n\nConnecticut did not have a royal charter that separated it from the Massachusetts Bay Colony; the Connecticut General Court was formed by leaders of the settlements. The General Court claimed rule of the area by right of conquest, but the Massachusetts Bay Colony saw matters differently. The Bay Colony had contributed to the war by sending a militia under captains John Underhill and Thomas Stoughton, which they argued gave territorial rights and authority to the Massachusetts Bay Colony rather than the Connecticut Court.<ref name=\"Society, Mystic River Historical 2004\"/>\n\nWith conflicting views, both colonies turned to the [[New England Confederation|United Colonies of New England]] to resolve the dispute. The United Colonies of New England was formed in 1643, established to settle disputes such as this one. They voted to establish the boundary between the claims of the Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut at the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]]. As a result, Connecticut would be positioned west of the river, and Massachusetts Bay could have the land to the east, including the Mystic River.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThroughout the next decade, colonists were beginning to settle around the Mystic River. John Mason, one of the captains who led the colonists against the Pequots, had previously been granted {{convert|500|acre|km2|0}} on the eastern banks of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\">Mystic River Historical Society. http://mystichistory.org/about_mrhs.htm (accessed November 13, 2008).</ref>  He also received the island that now bears his name, though he never lived on the property. In 1653, John Gallup, Jr. was given {{convert|300|acre|km2}} approximately midway up the east part of the Mystic River.\n\nWithin the same year, others joined John Gallup and began to settle around the Mystic River. George Denison, a veteran of [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s army, was given his own strip of {{convert|300|acre|km2}}, just south of Gallup's land in 1654.  Thomas Miner had immigrated to Massachusetts with John Winthrop and was granted many land plots, the main one lying on Quiambaug Cove, just east of the Mystic River.<ref name=\"accessed November 13, 2008\"/>  Other families granted land at their arrival were Reverend Robert Blinman, the Beebe brothers, Thomas Parke, and Connecticut Governor John Hayne.\n\nLike Captain John Mason, not all these men actually lived on their land. Many sold it to profit from or employed an overseer to cultivate their property. Many men, however, actually brought their wives and children, which indicated their plans on forming a community in the Mystic River Valley.\n\nThere was one recorded case of a woman who did not come to the Mystic River Valley as a wife. Widow Margaret Lake received a grant from the Massachusetts Bay authority and was the only woman to receive a land grant in her own name.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/> She also did not live on her land but hired other people to maintain it. She took up residence in what is now called Lakes Pond. Her daughter was married to John Gallup, while her sister was married to Massachusetts Bay Governor John Winthrop.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nBy 1675, settlement had grown tremendously in the Mystic River Valley, and infrastructure was beginning to appear as well as an economy. The Pequot Trail was used as a main highway to get around the Mystic River and played a vital role in the settlers' lives, allowing them to transport livestock, crops, furs, and other equipment to and from their farm lands. However, those families living on the east side of the Mystic River were unable to make any use of the Pequot Trail. As early as 1660, Robert Burrows was authorized to institute a ferry somewhere along the middle of the river's length. This earned his home the name of \"Half-way House\".<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nThe Pequot Trail also connected the settlers to their church. [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] residents found it difficult to attend church in Mystic or Groton, and this led to the creation of their own church. The town of Stonington was then established as separate from Mystic in regards to church attendance and was granted leave to build a church of their own. The building became known as the Road Church.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>\n\nColonists began public schools in this area around 1679, and John Fish became the first schoolmaster in Stonington, conducting classes and lessons in his home.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Education was a very important thing to the New England colonists, enabling boys, girls, African Americans, Indians, and servants to learn literacy skills. Most families throughout New England had six or more children in each household, giving Fish plenty of students.\n\nFish also gave lectures and insights about marriage and maintenance of a solid family. [[Divorce]] was very uncommon in those days; however, John Fish's wife ran off with Samuel Culver. In the case of a runaway spouse, the abandoned spouse was not allowed to file for divorce until six years had passed. This law ensured that the spouse was actually gone and not intending to come back.<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>  Fish was eventually allowed to divorce in 1680, but this had no impact on his reputation as a school teacher, and parents continued to allow their children to attend his classes.\n\n===18th century===\n[[File:Mystic, Connecticut (circa 1901).jpg|thumb|right|Main Street (circa 1901)]]\nBy the first decade of the 18th century, three villages had begun to develop along the Mystic River. The largest village was called Mystic (now [[Old Mystic]]), also known as the Head of the River because it lay where several creeks united into the Mystic River estuary.<ref name=\"American Journey 2004\"/>  Two villages lay farther down the river. One was called Stonington and was considered to be Lower Mystic, consisting of twelve houses by the early 19th century. These twelve houses lay along Willow Street, which ended at the ferry landing. On the opposite bank of the river in the town of [[Groton, Connecticut|Groton]] stood the village that became known as [[Portersville, Connecticut|Portersville]].<ref name=\"Fought, Leigh 2007\"/>\n\nThrough the 18th century, Mystic's economy was composed of [[manufacturing]], [[road building]], and [[seafaring|maritime trades]]. [[Agriculture]] was the main component of their economy, since most of the citizens were farmers.  In turn, the colonists provided their mother country with raw material resources that led to the emergence of a colonial manufacturing system. Land remained an essential source of wealth, though some land was very rocky and prevented early farmers from producing crops. This, however, did not necessarily lead to poverty. They grew corn, wheat, peas, potatoes, and a variety of fruits. They raised cattle, chicken, pigs, and sheep. They were hunters and fishermen and were generally able to sustain themselves. With an average household of about nine children, labor was easily provided in the fields.\n\n===National Register of Historic Places===\nMystic has three [[historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s: the [[Mystic Bridge Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 27, [[Rossie Velvet Mill Historic District]] between Pleasant Street and Bruggerman Place, and the [[Mystic River Historic District]] around U.S. Route 1 and Route 215.

Her mother Bonnie Plunkett ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering addict. Christy's daughter, Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]), who was born when Christy was 17, has also become a teen mother by her boyfriend, Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]). Christy also has a young son, Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband, Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), a deadbeat but likable pothead.\n\nChristy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly-emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouthed but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mom episodes}}\n{{:List of Mom episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Christy Jolene Plunkett: a single narcissist mother who has gone six years without drinking and is still struggling with sobriety and a concurrent addiction to gambling. Now sober, she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe, and regain the trust of her daughter Violet, who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode. In addition, she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie, who she still struggles to forgive after a tumultuous childhood and long estrangement. Christy later finds out that her biological father, Alvin, ran out on Bonnie after she was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Eve after giving birth to Christy. She locates Alvin and finds out that he is a married father of two sons and runs an auto repair shop. Christy eventually develops a bond with Alvin, whom she introduces to her family, and comes to see him as the father she needs in her life. Like her mother, Christy also became a teenage mother when she had Violet at age 16\u201317. Violet's father Butch was horribly [[Domestic violence|physically abusive]] to Christy, who tried to leave him on numerous occasions, only to get cold feet. Christy finally worked up the courage to leave him in order to protect Violet. A former stripper, Christy is mostly seen working as a waitress. She is briefly promoted to manager (after Claudia divorces Gabriel), but eventually goes back to being a waitress. Christy later decides that she wants to go back to school to eventually become a lawyer, and she takes a second job working as an assistant for Steve Casper, eventually earning her bachelor's degree and then being accepted to law school. \n* [[Allison Janney]] as Bonnie Plunkett: Christy's mother, a joyful if cynical recovering addict. She tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter, whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child. She was given up for adoption at age four and was in the foster care system, being passed around from house to house where she eventually ran off with Alvin at age 15. She ended up pregnant and had Christy at age 17. Alvin abandoned both of them at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Bonnie has said that she almost aborted Christy and wanted to put Christy up for adoption. A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her, yet Bonnie could not go through with the adoption. From that point on, she attempted her best to raise Christy. However, Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie preferred to party and drink rather than stay home. With time and much therapy, Bonnie managed to find the balance and now wants to catch up, revealing to Christy her past, including who her real father is and how to find him, as well as her past side career as a drug dealer. She suffered a relapse in season 1 after losing her job and apartment and had to move in with Christy, Violet, and Roscoe. After Christy reconnected with her biological father Alvin, Bonnie slowly realized that she still had feelings for him, and the two began to date at the beginning of season 2. This was cut short after Alvin suffered a heart attack and died, leaving his family shocked. After suffering from a back injury, Bonnie became hooked on pain medication prescribed to her, which led to another relapse. In season 3, she met her biological mother, and in season 4 she met her half-brother Ray after their mother died. She currently manages the apartment building where she and Christy live. In season 6, she was diagnosed with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and began seeing a therapist to deal with it. \n* [[Sadie Calvano]] as Violet Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, season 6): Christy's daughter and older half-sister of Roscoe. A senior in high school at the beginning of the series, Violet is hardworking, smart and sure of herself, though upset with her mother, who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time. After having her boyfriend Luke's baby, Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than herself, her mother, or her grandmother ever had. Violet's father was physically abusive to Christy, and Christy has lied to Violet concerning his whereabouts, taking her to a random man's grave and telling Violet that her father is dead. During season 2, in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior, Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her. She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik, a much older psychology professor at her university, but he breaks the engagement after she begins to party too hard, leaving her mother and grandmother wondering if she was just experiencing young life or developing a problem. Violet moves back in with Christy and Bonnie after her break up and after demanding that she get a job, Violet moves to Lake Tahoe to become a blackjack dealer at [[Harrah's]]. Violet, yet again, moves back to her mother and grandmother after wrecking her life in Lake Tahoe and gets back together and moves in with Luke after seeing that he has improved his life. Violet returns in Season 6 as the host of a successful podcast called \"The Mother of all Problems\" where she outlines in great detail all of Christy's terrible past actions; it is revealed that Christy and Violet haven't talked in over a year (though she remains in contact with Bonnie), and while Violet lets Christy on her podcast and gives her credit for turning her life around, she bluntly says that the past can't be changed and she thinks it's healthier to have no relationship with Christy in the future. In Season 7, Christy sadly confirms to Bonnie's new sponsee that she doesn't have a relationship at present with Violet.\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as Gabriel (main, seasons 1\u20132): the manager of the restaurant where Christy works. Married to a domineering woman who scares him somewhat, Gabriel and Christy are carrying on an affair which Christy later ends but which Gabriel himself frequently and desperately tries to renew: they briefly resume their affair in season 2 when Christy is promoted as his replacement. He is a hardworking, competent manager, but often put in his place by his subordinates, particularly Chef Rudy.\n* [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]] as Baxter (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, seasons 5\u20136): Christy's ex-husband and the father of Roscoe. Sweet and charming, but very unstable, he is unable to maintain a serious relationship or steady work for much longer than a month. Loves easy life and frequently gets into fraudulent deals to make money. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father who usually comes through for his son. During season 2, under the influence of his wealthy new girlfriend Candace, Baxter gives up his slacker ways and becomes a car salesman, and is content to be an ersatz \"trophy husband\".\n* [[French Stewart]] as Chef Rudy (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, seasons 3, 5\u20137): the head chef for the Rustic Fig restaurant where Christy works as a waitress. A dominant and difficult [[self-made man]], Rudy acts superior in his relationships with others. He sells drugs out of the freezer and is boastful and arrogant, often yelling at his subordinates without mincing words and will not hesitate to humiliate anyone who opposes him. He is secretive about his past and distant from people, but briefly dates Bonnie and is revealed to be a [[bisexual]] fetishist with expensive tastes and hobbies who steals food from the restaurant. Tammy is his most recent love interest.\n* [[Spencer Daniels]] as Luke (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, season 4): a young student who loves to enjoy life and adventure. He had been dating Violet for a little over a year and got her pregnant. Luke is considerably airheaded, smoking marijuana often, but always tries to prove to Christy that he is not as crazy as he appears: he seems to genuinely love Violet, staying beside her and supporting her throughout her pregnancy, and he is often more sensitive towards Christy than her own children are, perhaps because his parents are religious fundamentalists with whom he does not connect. In season 2, Violet, during her downward spiral, cheated on Luke and he broke up with Violet. By season 4, Luke has apparently cleaned himself up and got a high-paying job with a video game company, driving Violet to get back together with him. Violet reveals in season 6 that she and Luke have ended their relationship.\n* Blake Garrett Rosenthal as Roscoe Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4): Christy's son by Baxter and half-brother of Violet. He experimented with marijuana at age twelve. He has not appeared since season 4, and it is stated he went to live with Baxter and his new wife Candace (which Christy confirms in season 7). However, in \"Beef Baloney Dan and a Sarcastic No\", it is heavily implied that Christy still has an on-going relationship with her son as it is revealed that he still texts her.  \n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian (recurring, season 1; main, season 2\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-mom-promotes-mimi-kennedy-698933|title=CBS' 'Mom' Promotes Mimi Kennedy to Series Regular (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> Christy's and Bonnie's AA sponsor who loves [[cat|cats]]. She had problems with alcohol and drugs in the past, spent some time in prison, and is a mother to a son whom she had no relationship or contact with for years, until Christy convinced him to reconnect with Marjorie following her cancer diagnosis. She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in season 1, and after extensive treatment finally beats it at the end of season 2. Through Christy she meets Victor Perugian, Christy's former landlord, whom she eventually weds and then cares for after he suffers a stroke. When Victor dies, her vulnerable side is revealed and the  women do their best to help Marjorie cope with being widowed for the second time (her first husband having died before the start of the show, after 3 decades of marriage.)\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Jill Kendall (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/jaime-pressly-joins-mom-cast-new-regular-1201391977/|title=Jaime Pressly Named New 'Mom' Regular|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> A wealthy [[socialite]] and alcoholic. Christy first met her at an AA meeting and decided to sponsor her, however Jill suffered several relapses before becoming sober. Her mother had struggled with depression and alcoholism before committing suicide when Jill was a teenager. Jill carried this pain with her throughout her life, culminating in season 4 when she was overcome with grief on the anniversary of her mother's death. After trying to become pregnant and miscarrying, Jill decides to adopt a foster child. She is eventually given a teenage girl named Emily, however Christy helps her mother become sober at the start of season 5, leading to Emily leaving Jill. This caused Jill to over-eat, leading her to gain weight (this was to cover up Pressly's pregnancy during the fifth season). After an extended stay at a health spa, she returns in the later half of season 5 and suffers another relapse. Despite being vain and obsessed with how her peers view her, she is shown to genuinely care about her friends and use her experiences to help them with their own problems. In season 6 she began a relationship with Andy, a police officer and former Marine.\n* [[Beth Hall]] as Wendy Harris (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2015/05/29/mom-season-3-cast-changes-beth-hall-wendy/|title=Mom Season 3: Who's In?

She is a [[registered nurse]] (with a hidden sadistic streak that emerges when in uniform) and a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]]. The running joke in the series is that no one, including her friends, listens much to her or wants her around more than minimally possible. In \"A Pirate, Three Frogs, and a Prince\", Wendy was revealed to be both bisexual/pansexual/bicurious, and attracted to Bonnie.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Adam Janikowski (recurring, season 3; main, season 4\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/06/24/mom-season-4-william-fichtner-series-regular-adam/|title=Mom Promotes William Fichtner to Series Regular for Season 4|last=Mason|first=Charlie|work=TV Line|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Bonnie's latest love interest and later husband, a wheelchair-bound ex-[[stuntman]], whom she met over the phone after he dialed the wrong number. He is supportive of Bonnie's recovery, though does not always fully understand it. In season 6, he uses his life savings to open a bar called AJ's Barrelworks.\n* [[Kristen Johnston]] as Tammy Diffendorf (guest, season 5; recurring, season 6; main, season 7):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2019/07/18/mom-kristen-johnston-series-regular-tammy-season-7/|title='Mom': Kristen Johnston Promoted to Series Regular for Season 7|last=Gelman|first=Vlada|work=TV Line|date=July 18, 2019|accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref> an [[ex-con]] who was Bonnie's foster sister for a short time in their teens. They reconnect after Bonnie comes across Tammy while visiting a women's prison, and Tammy joins the group's AA meetings upon being released from prison in season 6. After temporarily living in Bonnie and Christy's apartment, she moves in with Marjorie. When she returns to her old foster home where she lived with Bonnie, it is revealed that her father killed her mother and she went into the system after that.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Reggie de Leon as Paul (seasons 1\u20133, 5\u20137): Chef Rudy's silent and often submissive [[sous-chef]].\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Alvin Lester Biletnikoff (seasons 1\u20132): Christy's father and Bonnie's ex-boyfriend who abandoned them when Christy was born. When Christy found Alvin he was married with two sons. Despite that, he loves Christy and does what he can to be in her life and help out, including fixing up a used car to give her and attempting to reach out to her children as a grandfather. He and Bonnie initially treated each other with contempt and hatred over the various mistakes each of them has made in their past, but they rekindled their relationship after his wife left him and he survived a heart attack. In season 2, Alvin suffers a second, fatal heart attack while in bed with Bonnie.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Regina Tompkins (seasons 1\u20133): A fellow AA member and money manager who embezzled from her clients and faces a long prison sentence. While a close if questionable friend to Christy, Regina and Bonnie typically hold each other in contempt, but beneath the surface, they bear some affection for each other. In the middle of season 2, she is given early parole and becomes a born-again Christian, eventually moving in with Jill. Regina drifts apart from her friends after she decides she is no longer an alcoholic, essentially choosing wine over her friends, and struggles alone with the dissonance after moving into her own apartment and out of Jill's mansion.\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as Claudia (seasons 1\u20133): Gabriel's wealthy and snobbish (later ex-) wife, who takes over the restaurant from him and briefly appoints Christy as manager.\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Mary (seasons 1\u20135, 7): A fellow AA member who is frequently interrupted by Bonnie when she shares her problems with the group, as her anecdotes tend to be bizarre and creepy even by the standards of addicts. Mary dies in season 7 at the AA meeting from a brain aneurysm.\n* [[Don McManus]] as Steve Casper (seasons 1\u20134): A fellow AA member, Steve is a competent but creepy lawyer and occasionally aids Christy, who becomes his intern and trainee in season 2. He has a casual sex relationship with Bonnie in season 3. In season 4, he is shown to be in Mexico, hiding from trouble with a drug cartel.\n* [[Sara Rue]] as Candace Hayes (seasons 2\u20134): Baxter's wealthy new wife, who she reformed. She delivers many subtle jabs at Christy's poverty and seems to be trying to force Christy aside to replace her as Roscoe's mother. The hostility becomes much more obvious in season 3, when Candace's wealthy father, Fred ([[Harry Hamlin]]), briefly dates Christy and Candace accuses Christy of only being with him for his money. Christy breaks up with Fred because he openly insults and mocks Candace for doing nothing but living off his wealth. When Candace (wrongly and smugly) smirks that Fred dumped her, Christy gives Candace a hug and shuts her up by saying \"I know why you're such a bitch.\"\n* [[Jonny Coyne]] as Victor Perugian (seasons 2\u20134): Christy's Armenian former landlord who becomes attracted to Marjorie, marrying her in season 3.

Her mother Bonnie Plunkett ([[Allison Janney]]) is also a recovering addict. Christy's daughter, Violet ([[Sadie Calvano]]), who was born when Christy was 17, has also become a teen mother by her boyfriend, Luke ([[Spencer Daniels]]). Christy also has a young son, Roscoe (Blake Garrett Rosenthal) by her ex-husband, Baxter ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), a deadbeat but likable pothead.\n\nChristy has gone back to school and is pursuing her dream of becoming a lawyer, while Bonnie attempts to have a healthy romantic relationship with her new husband, Adam ([[William Fichtner]]). Through it all, Christy and Bonnie rely on their support system from AA, including the wise Marjorie ([[Mimi Kennedy]]), the wealthy and sometimes misguided Jill ([[Jaime Pressly]]), the overly-emotional Wendy ([[Beth Hall]]), and the loudmouthed but sweet Tammy ([[Kristen Johnston]]). Collectively, they help each other stay sober in the face of whatever life throws at them.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Mom episodes}}\n{{:List of Mom episodes}}\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Christy Jolene Plunkett: a single narcissist mother who has gone six years without drinking and is still struggling with sobriety and a concurrent addiction to gambling. Now sober, she strives to be a good example to her son Roscoe, and regain the trust of her daughter Violet, who is revealed to be pregnant herself in the first episode. In addition, she is trying to iron out the rough edges in her relationship with her mother Bonnie, who she still struggles to forgive after a tumultuous childhood and long estrangement. Christy later finds out that her biological father, Alvin, ran out on Bonnie after she was discharged from the hospital on Christmas Eve after giving birth to Christy. She locates Alvin and finds out that he is a married father of two sons and runs an auto repair shop. Christy eventually develops a bond with Alvin, whom she introduces to her family, and comes to see him as the father she needs in her life. Like her mother, Christy also became a teenage mother when she had Violet at age 16\u201317. Violet's father Butch was horribly [[Domestic violence|physically abusive]] to Christy, who tried to leave him on numerous occasions, only to get cold feet. Christy finally worked up the courage to leave him in order to protect Violet. A former stripper, Christy is mostly seen working as a waitress. She is briefly promoted to manager (after Claudia divorces Gabriel), but eventually goes back to being a waitress. Christy later decides that she wants to go back to school to eventually become a lawyer, and she takes a second job working as an assistant for Steve Casper, eventually earning her bachelor's degree and then being accepted to law school. \n* [[Allison Janney]] as Bonnie Plunkett: Christy's mother, a joyful if cynical recovering addict. She tries to regain the love and trust of her daughter, whom she was unable to properly nurture as a child. She was given up for adoption at age four and was in the foster care system, being passed around from house to house where she eventually ran off with Alvin at age 15. She ended up pregnant and had Christy at age 17. Alvin abandoned both of them at the hospital on Christmas Eve. Bonnie has said that she almost aborted Christy and wanted to put Christy up for adoption. A pleasant Jewish couple was going to adopt her, yet Bonnie could not go through with the adoption. From that point on, she attempted her best to raise Christy. However, Christy wound up raising herself as Bonnie preferred to party and drink rather than stay home. With time and much therapy, Bonnie managed to find the balance and now wants to catch up, revealing to Christy her past, including who her real father is and how to find him, as well as her past side career as a drug dealer. She suffered a relapse in season 1 after losing her job and apartment and had to move in with Christy, Violet, and Roscoe. After Christy reconnected with her biological father Alvin, Bonnie slowly realized that she still had feelings for him, and the two began to date at the beginning of season 2. This was cut short after Alvin suffered a heart attack and died, leaving his family shocked. After suffering from a back injury, Bonnie became hooked on pain medication prescribed to her, which led to another relapse. In season 3, she met her biological mother, and in season 4 she met her half-brother Ray after their mother died. She currently manages the apartment building where she and Christy live. In season 6, she was diagnosed with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]] and began seeing a therapist to deal with it. \n* [[Sadie Calvano]] as Violet Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, season 6): Christy's daughter and older half-sister of Roscoe. A senior in high school at the beginning of the series, Violet is hardworking, smart and sure of herself, though upset with her mother, who never had time to take care of her children and failed to fulfill a true motherly role despite now being sober for some time. After having her boyfriend Luke's baby, Violet made the decision to place her baby for adoption because she felt that this was the best way to break her family's repeated cycle of poor life choices and give her child a better chance than herself, her mother, or her grandmother ever had. Violet's father was physically abusive to Christy, and Christy has lied to Violet concerning his whereabouts, taking her to a random man's grave and telling Violet that her father is dead. During season 2, in a brief downward spiral of bad behavior, Violet cheats on Luke and he breaks up with her. She later gets engaged to Gregory Munchnik, a much older psychology professor at her university, but he breaks the engagement after she begins to party too hard, leaving her mother and grandmother wondering if she was just experiencing young life or developing a problem. Violet moves back in with Christy and Bonnie after her break up and after demanding that she get a job, Violet moves to Lake Tahoe to become a blackjack dealer at [[Harrah's]]. Violet, yet again, moves back to her mother and grandmother after wrecking her life in Lake Tahoe and gets back together and moves in with Luke after seeing that he has improved his life. Violet returns in Season 6 as the host of a successful podcast called \"The Mother of all Problems\" where she outlines in great detail all of Christy's terrible past actions; it is revealed that Christy and Violet haven't talked in over a year (though she remains in contact with Bonnie), and while Violet lets Christy on her podcast and gives her credit for turning her life around, she bluntly says that the past can't be changed and she thinks it's healthier to have no relationship with Christy in the future. In Season 7, Christy sadly confirms to Bonnie's new sponsee that she doesn't have a relationship at present with Violet.\n* [[Nate Corddry]] as Gabriel (main, seasons 1\u20132): the manager of the restaurant where Christy works. Married to a domineering woman who scares him somewhat, Gabriel and Christy are carrying on an affair which Christy later ends but which Gabriel himself frequently and desperately tries to renew: they briefly resume their affair in season 2 when Christy is promoted as his replacement. He is a hardworking, competent manager, but often put in his place by his subordinates, particularly Chef Rudy.\n* [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]] as Baxter (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4; guest, seasons 5\u20136): Christy's ex-husband and the father of Roscoe. Sweet and charming, but very unstable, he is unable to maintain a serious relationship or steady work for much longer than a month. Loves easy life and frequently gets into fraudulent deals to make money. Despite his flaws, he is a loving father who usually comes through for his son. During season 2, under the influence of his wealthy new girlfriend Candace, Baxter gives up his slacker ways and becomes a car salesman, and is content to be an ersatz \"trophy husband\".\n* [[French Stewart]] as Chef Rudy (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, seasons 3, 5\u20137): the head chef for the Rustic Fig restaurant where Christy works as a waitress. A dominant and difficult [[self-made man]], Rudy acts superior in his relationships with others. He sells drugs out of the freezer and is boastful and arrogant, often yelling at his subordinates without mincing words and will not hesitate to humiliate anyone who opposes him. He is secretive about his past and distant from people, but briefly dates Bonnie and is revealed to be a [[bisexual]] fetishist with expensive tastes and hobbies who steals food from the restaurant. Tammy is his most recent love interest.\n* [[Spencer Daniels]] as Luke (main, seasons 1\u20132; guest, season 4): a young student who loves to enjoy life and adventure. He had been dating Violet for a little over a year and got her pregnant. Luke is considerably airheaded, smoking marijuana often, but always tries to prove to Christy that he is not as crazy as he appears: he seems to genuinely love Violet, staying beside her and supporting her throughout her pregnancy, and he is often more sensitive towards Christy than her own children are, perhaps because his parents are religious fundamentalists with whom he does not connect. In season 2, Violet, during her downward spiral, cheated on Luke and he broke up with Violet. By season 4, Luke has apparently cleaned himself up and got a high-paying job with a video game company, driving Violet to get back together with him. Violet reveals in season 6 that she and Luke have ended their relationship.\n* Blake Garrett Rosenthal as Roscoe Plunkett (main, seasons 1\u20133; recurring, season 4): Christy's son by Baxter and half-brother of Violet. He experimented with marijuana at age twelve. He has not appeared since season 4, and it is stated he went to live with Baxter and his new wife Candace (which Christy confirms in season 7). However, in \"Beef Baloney Dan and a Sarcastic No\", it is heavily implied that Christy still has an on-going relationship with her son as it is revealed that he still texts her.  \n* [[Mimi Kennedy]] as Marjorie Armstrong-Perugian (recurring, season 1; main, season 2\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cbs-mom-promotes-mimi-kennedy-698933|title=CBS' 'Mom' Promotes Mimi Kennedy to Series Regular (Exclusive)|last=Goldberg|first=Lesley|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=April 25, 2014|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}</ref> Christy's and Bonnie's AA sponsor who loves [[cat|cats]]. She had problems with alcohol and drugs in the past, spent some time in prison, and is a mother to a son whom she had no relationship or contact with for years, until Christy convinced him to reconnect with Marjorie following her cancer diagnosis. She was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in season 1, and after extensive treatment finally beats it at the end of season 2. Through Christy she meets Victor Perugian, Christy's former landlord, whom she eventually weds and then cares for after he suffers a stroke. When Victor dies, her vulnerable side is revealed and the  women do their best to help Marjorie cope with being widowed for the second time (her first husband having died before the start of the show, after 3 decades of marriage.)\n* [[Jaime Pressly]] as Jill Kendall (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2015/03/jaime-pressly-joins-mom-cast-new-regular-1201391977/|title=Jaime Pressly Named New 'Mom' Regular|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=Deadline|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}</ref> A wealthy [[socialite]] and alcoholic. Christy first met her at an AA meeting and decided to sponsor her, however Jill suffered several relapses before becoming sober. Her mother had struggled with depression and alcoholism before committing suicide when Jill was a teenager. Jill carried this pain with her throughout her life, culminating in season 4 when she was overcome with grief on the anniversary of her mother's death. After trying to become pregnant and miscarrying, Jill decides to adopt a foster child. She is eventually given a teenage girl named Emily, however Christy helps her mother become sober at the start of season 5, leading to Emily leaving Jill. This caused Jill to over-eat, leading her to gain weight (this was to cover up Pressly's pregnancy during the fifth season). After an extended stay at a health spa, she returns in the later half of season 5 and suffers another relapse. Despite being vain and obsessed with how her peers view her, she is shown to genuinely care about her friends and use her experiences to help them with their own problems. In season 6 she began a relationship with Andy, a police officer and former Marine.\n* [[Beth Hall]] as Wendy Harris (recurring, season 2; main, season 3\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2015/05/29/mom-season-3-cast-changes-beth-hall-wendy/|title=Mom Season 3: Who's In?

She is a [[registered nurse]] (with a hidden sadistic streak that emerges when in uniform) and a member of [[Mensa International|Mensa]]. The running joke in the series is that no one, including her friends, listens much to her or wants her around more than minimally possible. In \"A Pirate, Three Frogs, and a Prince\", Wendy was revealed to be both bisexual/pansexual/bicurious, and attracted to Bonnie.\n* [[William Fichtner]] as Adam Janikowski (recurring, season 3; main, season 4\u2013present):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2016/06/24/mom-season-4-william-fichtner-series-regular-adam/|title=Mom Promotes William Fichtner to Series Regular for Season 4|last=Mason|first=Charlie|work=TV Line|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}</ref> Bonnie's latest love interest and later husband, a wheelchair-bound ex-[[stuntman]], whom she met over the phone after he dialed the wrong number.

When Christy found Alvin he was married with two sons. Despite that, he loves Christy and does what he can to be in her life and help out, including fixing up a used car to give her and attempting to reach out to her children as a grandfather. He and Bonnie initially treated each other with contempt and hatred over the various mistakes each of them has made in their past, but they rekindled their relationship after his wife left him and he survived a heart attack. In season 2, Alvin suffers a second, fatal heart attack while in bed with Bonnie.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Regina Tompkins (seasons 1\u20133): A fellow AA member and money manager who embezzled from her clients and faces a long prison sentence. While a close if questionable friend to Christy, Regina and Bonnie typically hold each other in contempt, but beneath the surface, they bear some affection for each other. In the middle of season 2, she is given early parole and becomes a born-again Christian, eventually moving in with Jill. Regina drifts apart from her friends after she decides she is no longer an alcoholic, essentially choosing wine over her friends, and struggles alone with the dissonance after moving into her own apartment and out of Jill's mansion.\n* [[Courtney Henggeler]] as Claudia (seasons 1\u20133): Gabriel's wealthy and snobbish (later ex-) wife, who takes over the restaurant from him and briefly appoints Christy as manager.\n* [[Mary Pat Gleason]] as Mary (seasons 1\u20135, 7): A fellow AA member who is frequently interrupted by Bonnie when she shares her problems with the group, as her anecdotes tend to be bizarre and creepy even by the standards of addicts.

In season 4, he is shown to be in Mexico, hiding from trouble with a drug cartel.\n* [[Sara Rue]] as Candace Hayes (seasons 2\u20134): Baxter's wealthy new wife, who she reformed. She delivers many subtle jabs at Christy's poverty and seems to be trying to force Christy aside to replace her as Roscoe's mother. The hostility becomes much more obvious in season 3, when Candace's wealthy father, Fred ([[Harry Hamlin]]), briefly dates Christy and Candace accuses Christy of only being with him for his money. Christy breaks up with Fred because he openly insults and mocks Candace for doing nothing but living off his wealth. When Candace (wrongly and smugly) smirks that Fred dumped her, Christy gives Candace a hug and shuts her up by saying \"I know why you're such a bitch.\"\n* [[Jonny Coyne]] as Victor Perugian (seasons 2\u20134): Christy's Armenian former landlord who becomes attracted to Marjorie, marrying her in season 3.

{"title_page": "Akin Euba", "text_new": "{{short description|Nigerian musician}}\n'''Akin Euba''' ('''Olatunji Akin Euba'''; 28 April 1935 - 14 April 2020) was a [[Nigerian]] [[composer]], [[musicologist]], and [[pianist]].\n\n==Career==\nBorn on 28 April 1935 in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]], Euba studied composition with [[Arnold Cooke]] at the [[Trinity College of Music]], [[London]], obtaining the diplomas of fellow of the Trinity College London (Composition) and fellow of the Trinity College London (Piano). He was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1962. He received B.A. and M.A. degrees from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he studied with [[Mantle Hood]], [[Charles Seeger]], Professor [[J. H. Kwabena Nketia]], [[Klaus Wachsmann]], and [[Roy Travis]]. He held a Ph.D. in [[ethnomusicology]] from the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]] (1974). While at Legon, Euba's doctoral work was supervised by Professor Nketia, and his dissertation is entitled \"Dundun Music of the Yoruba\".\n\nHe was professor and director of the Centre for Cultural Studies at the [[University of Lagos]], and also served as a senior research fellow at the University of Ife (now [[Obafemi Awolowo University]]) in Nigeria. He served as head of music at the [[Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years. He was a research scholar and artist in residence at IWALEWA House, the African studies center of the [[University of Bayreuth]] in Germany between 1986 and 1992. He was the [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]] Professor of Music at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] between 1993 and 2011 and until his death, was the Andrew W. Mellon Professor, Emeritus in music; the founder and director of the Centre for Intercultural Music Arts, [[London]] (founded in 1989), and director emeritus of the Centre for Intercultural Musicology at Churchill College, University of Cambridge.\n\nEuba's scholarly interests included the musicology and ethnomusicology of modern interculturalism. He organized regular symposia on music in Africa and the Diaspora at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] as well as the [[Central Conservatory of Music]] in [[Beijing]]. These events featured such notable composers and scholars as J. H. Kwabena Nketia and [[Halim El-Dabh]]. With his Elekoto Ensemble, he brought together musicians from Nigeria, China, India, Germany, Malta, and the United States.\n\nHis compositions involve a synthesis of African traditional material (often from his own ethnic group, the [[Yoruba people]]) and [[contemporary classical music]]. His most ambitious composition is the opera ''Chaka: An Opera in Two Chants'' (1970), which blends West African percussion and ''[[atenteben]]'' flutes with [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve tone technique]].\n\n==Works==\n*Six Yoruba Folk Songs, arranged for voice and piano\n*1956&nbsp;\u2013 Introduction and Allegro, orchestra\n*1963&nbsp;\u2013 ''Five Pieces for English Horn and Piano'' for [[Derek Bell (musician)|Derek Bell]]\n*1964&nbsp;\u2013 ''Four Pictures from Oyo Calabashes''\n*1964&nbsp;\u2013 ''Impressions From an [[Akwete cloth|Akwete Cloth]]'', piano\n*1967&nbsp;\u2013 ''Morning, Noon, and Night'', singers, dancers, and Nigerian instruments \n*1967&nbsp;\u2013 ''Olurounbi'' (or ''Olurombi''), Symphonic study for Orchestra\n*1970 (rev. 1999)&nbsp;\u2013 ''Chaka'', Opera\n*1970&nbsp;\u2013 ''Ice Cubes'', string orchestra\n*1970&nbsp;\u2013 ''Scenes From Traditional Life'', piano\n*1975&nbsp;\u2013 ''Alatangana'', ballet for singers, dancers, and Nigerian instruments\n*1979&nbsp;\u2013 ''Black Bethlehem'', soloists, chorus, Nigerian drums, and jazz ensemble\n*1987&nbsp;\u2013 ''Wakar Duru: Studies in African Pianism'' 1-3, piano\n*2003&nbsp;\u2013 ''Below Rusumo Falls'', voice, dancer, ''[[Gayageum|kayagum]]'', flute, drums, and piano (text: Olusola Oyeleye)\n\n==Discography==\n*1989&nbsp;\u2013 Piano Music of Akin Euba, performed by [[Peter Schmalfuss]] (includes ''Scenes from Traditional Life'' and ''Wakar Duru: Studies in African Pianism'')\n*1999&nbsp;\u2013 ''[http://www.music-research-inst.org/html/pubs/chaka.htm Chaka: An Opera in Two Chants]'', from an epic poem by L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.

He was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship in 1962. He received B.A. and M.A. degrees from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], where he studied with [[Mantle Hood]], [[Charles Seeger]], Professor [[J. H. Kwabena Nketia]], [[Klaus Wachsmann]], and [[Roy Travis]]. He held a Ph.D. in [[ethnomusicology]] from the [[University of Ghana]], [[Legon]] (1974). While at Legon, Euba's doctoral work was supervised by Professor Nketia, and his dissertation is entitled \"Dundun Music of the Yoruba\".\n\nHe was professor and director of the Centre for Cultural Studies at the [[University of Lagos]], and also served as a senior research fellow at the University of Ife (now [[Obafemi Awolowo University]]) in Nigeria. He served as head of music at the [[Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation]] for five years. He was a research scholar and artist in residence at IWALEWA House, the African studies center of the [[University of Bayreuth]] in Germany between 1986 and 1992. He was the [[Andrew W. Mellon|Andrew Mellon]] Professor of Music at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] between 1993 and 2011 and until his death, was the Andrew W. Mellon Professor, Emeritus in music; the founder and director of the Centre for Intercultural Music Arts, [[London]] (founded in 1989), and director emeritus of the Centre for Intercultural Musicology at Churchill College, University of Cambridge.\n\nEuba's scholarly interests included the musicology and ethnomusicology of modern interculturalism. He organized regular symposia on music in Africa and the Diaspora at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] as well as the [[Central Conservatory of Music]] in [[Beijing]]. These events featured such notable composers and scholars as J. H. Kwabena Nketia and [[Halim El-Dabh]]. With his Elekoto Ensemble, he brought together musicians from Nigeria, China, India, Germany, Malta, and the United States.\n\nHis compositions involve a synthesis of African traditional material (often from his own ethnic group, the [[Yoruba people]]) and [[contemporary classical music]]. His most ambitious composition is the opera ''Chaka: An Opera in Two Chants'' (1970), which blends West African percussion and ''[[atenteben]]'' flutes with [[Twelve-tone technique|twelve tone technique]].\n\n==Works==\n*Six Yoruba Folk Songs, arranged for voice and piano\n*1956&nbsp;\u2013 Introduction and Allegro, orchestra\n*1963&nbsp;\u2013 ''Five Pieces for English Horn and Piano'' for [[Derek Bell (musician)|Derek Bell]]\n*1964&nbsp;\u2013 ''Four Pictures from Oyo Calabashes''\n*1964&nbsp;\u2013 ''Impressions From an [[Akwete cloth|Akwete Cloth]]'', piano\n*1967&nbsp;\u2013 ''Morning, Noon, and Night'', singers, dancers, and Nigerian instruments \n*1967&nbsp;\u2013 ''Olurounbi'' (or ''Olurombi''), Symphonic study for Orchestra\n*1970 (rev. 1999)&nbsp;\u2013 ''Chaka'', Opera\n*1970&nbsp;\u2013 ''Ice Cubes'', string orchestra\n*1970&nbsp;\u2013 ''Scenes From Traditional Life'', piano\n*1975&nbsp;\u2013 ''Alatangana'', ballet for singers, dancers, and Nigerian instruments\n*1979&nbsp;\u2013 ''Black Bethlehem'', soloists, chorus, Nigerian drums, and jazz ensemble\n*1987&nbsp;\u2013 ''Wakar Duru: Studies in African Pianism'' 1-3, piano\n*2003&nbsp;\u2013 ''Below Rusumo Falls'', voice, dancer, ''[[Gayageum|kayagum]]'', flute, drums, and piano (text: Olusola Oyeleye)\n\n==Discography==\n*1989&nbsp;\u2013 Piano Music of Akin Euba, performed by [[Peter Schmalfuss]] (includes ''Scenes from Traditional Life'' and ''Wakar Duru: Studies in African Pianism'')\n*1999&nbsp;\u2013 ''[http://www.music-research-inst.org/html/pubs/chaka.htm Chaka: An Opera in Two Chants]'', from an epic poem by L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor.
