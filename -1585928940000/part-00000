At that time, the [[Newtonian theory of gravitation]] and the so-called [[corpuscular theory of light]] were dominant. In these theories, if the escape speed of an object exceeds the speed of light, then light originating inside or from it can escape temporarily but will return. In 1958, [[David Finkelstein]] used General Relativity to introduce a stricter definition of a local black hole event horizon as a boundary beyond which events of any kind cannot affect an outside observer. This led to information and [[Firewall (physics)|firewall]] paradoxes, which encouraged the re-examination of the concept of local event horizons and the notion of black holes. Several theories were subsequently developed, some with and some without event horizons. [[Stephen Hawking]], who was one of the leading developers of theories to describe black holes, suggested that an [[apparent horizon]] should be used instead of an event horizon, saying \"gravitational collapse produces apparent horizons but no event horizons\".

The speed of expansion reaches and even exceeds the speed of light, which prevents signals from travelling to some regions. A [[cosmic event horizon]] is a real event horizon because it affects all kinds of signals, including [[gravitational waves]] which travel at the speed of light.\n\nMore specific types of horizon include the related but distinct [[Absolute horizon|absolute]] and [[apparent horizon]]s found around a black hole. Other distinct types include the [[Cauchy horizon|Cauchy]] and [[Killing horizon]]s; the [[photon sphere]]s and [[ergosphere]]s of the [[Kerr solution]]; [[particle horizon|particle]] and [[cosmological horizon]]s relevant to [[cosmology]]; and [[isolated horizon|isolated]] and [[dynamical horizon]]s important in current black hole research.\n\n==Cosmic event horizon==\n{{Main|Cosmological horizon}}\n\nIn [[cosmology]], the event horizon of the [[observable universe]] is the largest [[comoving distance]] from which light emitted ''now'' can ever reach the observer in the future. This differs from the concept of the [[particle horizon]], which represents the largest comoving distance from which light emitted in the ''past'' could reach the observer at a given time. For events that occur beyond that distance, light has not had enough time to reach our location, even if it was emitted at the time the universe began. The evolution of the particle horizon with time depends on the nature of the [[expansion of the universe]]. If the expansion has certain characteristics, parts of the universe will never be observable, no matter how long the observer waits for light from those regions to arrive. The boundary beyond which events cannot ever be observed is an event horizon, and it represents the maximum extent of the particle horizon.\n\nThe criterion for determining whether a particle horizon for the universe exists is as follows. Define a [[comoving distance]] ''d<sub>p</sub>'' as\n:<math>d_p=\\int_{0}^{t_0} \\frac{c}{a(t)} \\,dt.</math>\n\nIn this equation, ''a'' is the [[scale factor (universe)|scale factor]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]], and ''t''<sub>0</sub> is the age of the Universe. If {{nowrap|''d<sub>p</sub>'' [[Limit (mathematics)|\u2192 \u221e]]}} (i.e., points arbitrarily as far away as can be observed), then no event horizon exists. If {{nowrap|''d<sub>p</sub>'' \u2260 \u221e}}, a horizon is present.\n\nExamples of cosmological models without an event horizon are universes dominated by [[matter]] or by [[light|radiation]]. An example of a cosmological model with an event horizon is a universe dominated by the [[cosmological constant]] (a [[de Sitter universe]]).\n\nA calculation of the speeds of the cosmological event and particle horizons was given in a paper on the [[FLRW]] cosmological model, approximating the Universe as composed of non-interacting constituents, each one being [[Equation of state (cosmology)|a perfect fluid]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |first1=Berta |last1=Margalef Bentabol\n |first2=Juan |last2=Margalef Bentabol\n |first3=Jordi |last3=Cepa\n |title=Evolution of the cosmological horizons in a concordance universe\n |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\n |date=21 December 2012\n |volume=2012\n |issue=12\n |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2012/12/035\n |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1475-7516/2012/12/035\n |arxiv=1302.1609\n |pages=035|bibcode = 2012JCAP...12..035M\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Evolution2\">\n{{cite journal\n |first1=Berta |last1=Margalef Bentabol\n |first2=Juan |last2=Margalef Bentabol\n |first3=Jordi |last3=Cepa\n |title=Evolution of the cosmological horizons in a universe with countably infinitely many state equations\n |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\n |date=8 February 2013\n |volume=2013\n |series=015\n |issue=2\n |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/02/015\n |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1475-7516/2013/02/015\n |arxiv=1302.2186\n |pages=015|bibcode = 2013JCAP...02..015M\n}}</ref>\n\n===Apparent horizon of an accelerated particle===\n{{See also|Hyperbolic motion (relativity)}}\n[[Image:Event-horizon-particle.svg|right|thumb|[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagram]] showing a uniformly [[acceleration|accelerated]] particle, '''P''', and an event '''E''' that is outside the particle's apparent horizon. The event's forward [[light cone]] never intersects the particle's [[world line]].]]\n\nIf a particle is moving at a constant velocity in a non-expanding universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that Universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the forward [[light cone]]s from these events intersect the particle's [[world line]]. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some situations light cones from some events never intersect the particle's world line. Under these conditions, an [[apparent horizon]] is present in the particle's (accelerating) reference frame, representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.\n\nFor example, this occurs with a uniformly accelerated particle. A [[Minkowski diagram|spacetime diagram]] of this situation is shown in the figure to the right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never reaches, the [[speed of light]] with respect to its original reference frame. On the spacetime diagram, its path is a [[hyperbola]], which [[asymptote|asymptotically approaches]] a 45-degree line (the path of a light ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, there is a boundary behind it from which no signals can escape (an apparent horizon).  The distance to this boundary is given by <math>c^2/a</math> where <math>a</math> is the constant [[proper acceleration]] of the particle.\n\nWhile approximations of this type of situation can occur in the real world {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (in [[particle accelerator]]s, for example), a true event horizon is never present, as this requires the particle to be accelerated indefinitely (requiring arbitrarily large amounts of energy and an arbitrarily large apparatus).\n\n===Interacting with a cosmic horizon===\nIn the case of a horizon perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer in empty space, the horizon seems to remain a fixed distance from the observer no matter how its surroundings move. Varying the observer's acceleration may cause the horizon to appear to move over time, or may prevent an event horizon from existing, depending on the acceleration function chosen. The observer never touches the horizon and never passes a location where it appeared to be.\n\nIn the case of a horizon perceived by an occupant of a [[de Sitter universe]], the horizon always appears to be a fixed distance away for a [[inertial frame of reference|non-accelerating]] observer. It is never contacted, even by an accelerating observer.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Event horizon of a black hole==\n{{Main|Black hole}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1ex; width:400px;\"\n|-\n| [[File:BH-no-escape-1.svg]]<br />Far away from the black hole a particle can move in any direction.

Often,  this is described as the boundary within which the black hole's [[escape velocity]] is greater than the [[speed of light]].  However,  a more detailed description is that within this horizon, all [[lightlike]] paths (paths that light could take) and hence all paths in the forward [[light cone]]s of particles within the horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate system used.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time |first1=S.

The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the [[Sun]] this radius is approximately 3 kilometers and for the [[Earth]] it is about 9 millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force, to overcome [[Electron degeneracy pressure|electron]] and [[neutron degeneracy pressure]]. The minimal mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these pressures is the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]], which is approximately three solar masses.\n\nAccording to the fundamental gravitational collapse models <ref>{{cite | author=Penrose, Roger | title=Gravitational collapse and space-time singularities | journal=Phys.

If all the stars in the Milky Way would gradually aggregate towards the galactic center while keeping their proportionate distances from each other, they will all fall within their joint Schwarzschild radius long before they are forced to collide. <ref name=Curiel></ref> Up to the collapse in far future, observers in a galaxy surrounded by an event horizon would proceed with their lives normally.\n\nBlack hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although erroneous, is the notion that black holes \"vacuum up\" material in their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of seeking out material to consume than any other gravitational attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that matter can be observed falling into a black hole. This is not possible. Astronomers can detect only [[accretion disk]]s around black holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates high-energy radiation which can be detected (similarly, some matter from these accretion disks is forced out along the axis of spin of the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed directly at Earth). Furthermore, a distant observer will never actually see something reach the horizon. Instead, while approaching the hole, the object will seem to go ever more slowly, while any light it emits will be further and further redshifted.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe black hole event horizon is [[Teleology|teleological]] in nature, meaning that we need to know the entire future space-time of the universe to determine the current location of the horizon, which is essentially impossible. Because of the purely theoretical nature of the event horizon boundary, the traveling object does not necessarily experience strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the calculatory boundary in a finite amount of [[proper time]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Joshi |first1=Pankaj |last2=Narayan |first2=Ramesh |year=2016 |title=Black Hole Paradoxes |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=759 |pages=12\u201360 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/759/1/012060  |arxiv=1402.3055v2}}</ref>\n\n===Interacting with black hole horizons===\nA misconception concerning event horizons, especially [[black hole]] event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that destroys objects that approach them. In practice, all event horizons appear to be some distance away from any observer, and objects sent towards an event horizon never appear to cross it from the sending observer's point of view (as the horizon-crossing event's [[light cone]] never intersects the observer's [[world line]]). Attempting to make an object near the horizon remain stationary with respect to an observer requires applying a force whose magnitude increases unboundedly (becoming infinite) the closer it gets.\n\nIn the case of the horizon around a black hole, observers stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The [[proper length|proper distance]] to the horizon is finite,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Misner |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles W. Misner |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |author2-link=Kip Thorne |last3=Wheeler |first3=John |author3-link=John Archibald Wheeler | title=Gravitation | publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] | year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0 |page=824|title-link=Gravitation (book) }}</ref> so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was approximately at rest in [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]), the [[proper acceleration]] ([[G-force]]) experienced by points on the rope closer and closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in [[freefall]]), then indeed the observer at the bottom of the rope can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon, since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.\n\nAssumed that the possible [[apparent horizon]] is far inside the event horizon, or there is none, observers crossing a black hole event horizon would not actually see or feel anything special happen at that moment. In terms of visual appearance, observers who fall into the hole perceive the eventual apparent horizon as a black impermeable area enclosing the singularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/schw.html|title=Journey into a Schwarzschild black hole|website=jila.colorado.edu}}</ref> Other objects that had entered the horizon area along the same radial path but at an earlier time would appear below the observer as long as they are not entered inside the apparent horizon, and they could exchange messages. Increasing [[tidal force]]s are also locally noticeable effects, as a function of the mass of the black hole. In realistic [[stellar black hole]]s, [[spaghettification]] occurs early: tidal forces tear materials apart well before the event horizon. However, in [[supermassive black hole]]s, which are found in centers of galaxies, spaghettification occurs inside the event horizon. A human astronaut would survive the fall through an event horizon only in a black hole with a mass of approximately 10,000 [[solar mass]]es or greater.<ref>{{cite book|title=General Relativity: An introduction for physicists|first1=Michael Paul\n|last1=Hobson|first2=George|last2=Efstathiou|first3=Anthony N.|last3=Lasenby|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2006|isbn=978-0-521-82951-9|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&pg=PA265\n|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&pg=PA265|chapter=11.

For [[black hole]]s, this manifests as [[Hawking radiation]], and the larger question of how the black hole possesses a temperature is part of the topic of [[black hole thermodynamics]]. For accelerating particles, this manifests as the [[Unruh effect]], which causes space around the particle to appear to be filled with matter and radiation.\n\nAccording to the controversial [[Firewall (physics)|black hole firewall]] hypothesis, matter falling into a black hole would be burned to a crisp by a high energy \"firewall\" at the event horizon.\n\nAn alternative is provided by the [[Black hole complementarity|complementarity principle]], according to which, in the chart of the far observer, infalling matter is thermalized at the horizon and reemitted as Hawking radiation, while in the chart of an infalling observer matter continues undisturbed through the inner region and is destroyed at the singularity. This hypothesis does not violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] as there is a single copy of the information according to any given observer. Black hole complementarity is actually suggested by the scaling laws of [[String Theory|strings]] approaching the event horizon, suggesting that in the Schwarzschild chart they stretch to cover the horizon and thermalize into a [[Planck length]]-thick membrane.\n\nA complete description of local event horizons generated by gravity is expected to, at minimum, require a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. One such candidate theory is [[M-theory]].  Another such candidate theory is [[Loop Quantum Gravity|loop quantum gravity]].\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please do not repeat links already present on this page -->\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force]]\n* [[Acoustic metric]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics#Beyond black holes|Beyond black holes]]\n* [[Black hole electron]]\n* [[Black hole starship]]\n* [[Cosmic censorship hypothesis]]\n* [[Dynamical horizon]]\n* [[Event Horizon Telescope]]\n* [[Hawking radiation]]\n* [[Kugelblitz (astrophysics)]]\n* [[Micro black hole]]\n* [[Rindler coordinates]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking]]\n* {{Cite book| title=Black Holes and Time Warps | author=Kip Thorne | publisher=W.

An example of a cosmological model with an event horizon is a universe dominated by the [[cosmological constant]] (a [[de Sitter universe]]).\n\nA calculation of the speeds of the cosmological event and particle horizons was given in a paper on the [[FLRW]] cosmological model, approximating the Universe as composed of non-interacting constituents, each one being [[Equation of state (cosmology)|a perfect fluid]].<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |first1=Berta |last1=Margalef Bentabol\n |first2=Juan |last2=Margalef Bentabol\n |first3=Jordi |last3=Cepa\n |title=Evolution of the cosmological horizons in a concordance universe\n |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\n |date=21 December 2012\n |volume=2012\n |issue=12\n |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2012/12/035\n |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1475-7516/2012/12/035\n |arxiv=1302.1609\n |pages=035|bibcode = 2012JCAP...12..035M\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Evolution2\">\n{{cite journal\n |first1=Berta |last1=Margalef Bentabol\n |first2=Juan |last2=Margalef Bentabol\n |first3=Jordi |last3=Cepa\n |title=Evolution of the cosmological horizons in a universe with countably infinitely many state equations\n |journal=Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics\n |date=8 February 2013\n |volume=2013\n |series=015\n |issue=2\n |doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2013/02/015\n |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/1475-7516/2013/02/015\n |arxiv=1302.2186\n |pages=015|bibcode = 2013JCAP...02..015M\n}}</ref>\n\n===Apparent horizon of an accelerated particle===\n{{See also|Hyperbolic motion (relativity)}}\n[[Image:Event-horizon-particle.svg|right|thumb|[[Minkowski diagram|Spacetime diagram]] showing a uniformly [[acceleration|accelerated]] particle, '''P''', and an event '''E''' that is outside the particle's apparent horizon. The event's forward [[light cone]] never intersects the particle's [[world line]].]]\n\nIf a particle is moving at a constant velocity in a non-expanding universe free of gravitational fields, any event that occurs in that Universe will eventually be observable by the particle, because the forward [[light cone]]s from these events intersect the particle's [[world line]]. On the other hand, if the particle is accelerating, in some situations light cones from some events never intersect the particle's world line. Under these conditions, an [[apparent horizon]] is present in the particle's (accelerating) reference frame, representing a boundary beyond which events are unobservable.\n\nFor example, this occurs with a uniformly accelerated particle. A [[Minkowski diagram|spacetime diagram]] of this situation is shown in the figure to the right. As the particle accelerates, it approaches, but never reaches, the [[speed of light]] with respect to its original reference frame. On the spacetime diagram, its path is a [[hyperbola]], which [[asymptote|asymptotically approaches]] a 45-degree line (the path of a light ray). An event whose light cone's edge is this asymptote or is farther away than this asymptote can never be observed by the accelerating particle. In the particle's reference frame, there is a boundary behind it from which no signals can escape (an apparent horizon).  The distance to this boundary is given by <math>c^2/a</math> where <math>a</math> is the constant [[proper acceleration]] of the particle.\n\nWhile approximations of this type of situation can occur in the real world {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} (in [[particle accelerator]]s, for example), a true event horizon is never present, as this requires the particle to be accelerated indefinitely (requiring arbitrarily large amounts of energy and an arbitrarily large apparatus).\n\n===Interacting with a cosmic horizon===\nIn the case of a horizon perceived by a uniformly accelerating observer in empty space, the horizon seems to remain a fixed distance from the observer no matter how its surroundings move. Varying the observer's acceleration may cause the horizon to appear to move over time, or may prevent an event horizon from existing, depending on the acceleration function chosen. The observer never touches the horizon and never passes a location where it appeared to be.\n\nIn the case of a horizon perceived by an occupant of a [[de Sitter universe]], the horizon always appears to be a fixed distance away for a [[inertial frame of reference|non-accelerating]] observer. It is never contacted, even by an accelerating observer.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Event horizon of a black hole==\n{{Main|Black hole}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin:1ex; width:400px;\"\n|-\n| [[File:BH-no-escape-1.svg]]<br />Far away from the black hole a particle can move in any direction.

It is no longer possible for the particle to escape.\n|}\nOne of the best-known examples of an event horizon derives from general relativity's description of a [[black hole]], a celestial object so dense that no nearby matter or radiation can escape its [[gravitational field]].  Often,  this is described as the boundary within which the black hole's [[escape velocity]] is greater than the [[speed of light]].  However,  a more detailed description is that within this horizon, all [[lightlike]] paths (paths that light could take) and hence all paths in the forward [[light cone]]s of particles within the horizon, are warped so as to fall farther into the hole. Once a particle is inside the horizon, moving into the hole is as inevitable as moving forward in time, and can actually be thought of as equivalent to doing so, depending on the spacetime coordinate system used.<ref>{{Cite book| title=The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time |first1=S.

The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its mass. Theoretically, any amount of matter will become a black hole if compressed into a space that fits within its corresponding Schwarzschild radius. For the mass of the [[Sun]] this radius is approximately 3 kilometers and for the [[Earth]] it is about 9 millimeters. In practice, however, neither the Earth nor the Sun has the necessary mass and therefore the necessary gravitational force, to overcome [[Electron degeneracy pressure|electron]] and [[neutron degeneracy pressure]]. The minimal mass required for a star to be able to collapse beyond these pressures is the [[Tolman\u2013Oppenheimer\u2013Volkoff limit]], which is approximately three solar masses.\n\nAccording to the fundamental gravitational collapse models <ref>{{cite | author=Penrose, Roger | title=Gravitational collapse and space-time singularities | journal=Phys. Rev. Lett. | year = 1965 | volume = 14 | page = 57|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14...57P |doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57 }}</ref>, an event horizon forms before the singularity of black hole. If all the stars in the Milky Way would gradually aggregate towards the galactic center while keeping their proportionate distances from each other, they will all fall within their joint Schwarzschild radius long before they are forced to collide. <ref name=Curiel></ref> Up to the collapse in far future, observers in a galaxy surrounded by an event horizon would proceed with their lives normally.\n\nBlack hole event horizons are widely misunderstood. Common, although erroneous, is the notion that black holes \"vacuum up\" material in their neighborhood, where in fact they are no more capable of seeking out material to consume than any other gravitational attractor. As with any mass in the universe, matter must come within its gravitational scope for the possibility to exist of capture or consolidation with any other mass. Equally common is the idea that matter can be observed falling into a black hole. This is not possible. Astronomers can detect only [[accretion disk]]s around black holes, where material moves with such speed that friction creates high-energy radiation which can be detected (similarly, some matter from these accretion disks is forced out along the axis of spin of the black hole, creating visible jets when these streams interact with matter such as interstellar gas or when they happen to be aimed directly at Earth). Furthermore, a distant observer will never actually see something reach the horizon. Instead, while approaching the hole, the object will seem to go ever more slowly, while any light it emits will be further and further redshifted.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe black hole event horizon is [[Teleology|teleological]] in nature, meaning that we need to know the entire future space-time of the universe to determine the current location of the horizon, which is essentially impossible. Because of the purely theoretical nature of the event horizon boundary, the traveling object does not necessarily experience strange effects and does, in fact, pass through the calculatory boundary in a finite amount of [[proper time]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Joshi |first1=Pankaj |last2=Narayan |first2=Ramesh |year=2016 |title=Black Hole Paradoxes |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |volume=759 |pages=12\u201360 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/759/1/012060  |arxiv=1402.3055v2}}</ref>\n\n===Interacting with black hole horizons===\nA misconception concerning event horizons, especially [[black hole]] event horizons, is that they represent an immutable surface that destroys objects that approach them. In practice, all event horizons appear to be some distance away from any observer, and objects sent towards an event horizon never appear to cross it from the sending observer's point of view (as the horizon-crossing event's [[light cone]] never intersects the observer's [[world line]]). Attempting to make an object near the horizon remain stationary with respect to an observer requires applying a force whose magnitude increases unboundedly (becoming infinite) the closer it gets.\n\nIn the case of the horizon around a black hole, observers stationary with respect to a distant object will all agree on where the horizon is. While this seems to allow an observer lowered towards the hole on a rope (or rod) to contact the horizon, in practice this cannot be done. The [[proper length|proper distance]] to the horizon is finite,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Misner |first1=Charles |author1-link=Charles W. Misner |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |author2-link=Kip Thorne |last3=Wheeler |first3=John |author3-link=John Archibald Wheeler | title=Gravitation | publisher=[[W. H. Freeman and Company]] | year=1973 |isbn=978-0-7167-0344-0 |page=824|title-link=Gravitation (book) }}</ref> so the length of rope needed would be finite as well, but if the rope were lowered slowly (so that each point on the rope was approximately at rest in [[Schwarzschild coordinates]]), the [[proper acceleration]] ([[G-force]]) experienced by points on the rope closer and closer to the horizon would approach infinity, so the rope would be torn apart. If the rope is lowered quickly (perhaps even in [[freefall]]), then indeed the observer at the bottom of the rope can touch and even cross the event horizon. But once this happens it is impossible to pull the bottom of rope back out of the event horizon, since if the rope is pulled taut, the forces along the rope increase without bound as they approach the event horizon and at some point the rope must break. Furthermore, the break must occur not at the event horizon, but at a point where the second observer can observe it.\n\nAssumed that the possible [[apparent horizon]] is far inside the event horizon, or there is none, observers crossing a black hole event horizon would not actually see or feel anything special happen at that moment. In terms of visual appearance, observers who fall into the hole perceive the eventual apparent horizon as a black impermeable area enclosing the singularity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jila.colorado.edu/~ajsh/insidebh/schw.html|title=Journey into a Schwarzschild black hole|website=jila.colorado.edu}}</ref> Other objects that had entered the horizon area along the same radial path but at an earlier time would appear below the observer as long as they are not entered inside the apparent horizon, and they could exchange messages. Increasing [[tidal force]]s are also locally noticeable effects, as a function of the mass of the black hole. In realistic [[stellar black hole]]s, [[spaghettification]] occurs early: tidal forces tear materials apart well before the event horizon. However, in [[supermassive black hole]]s, which are found in centers of galaxies, spaghettification occurs inside the event horizon. A human astronaut would survive the fall through an event horizon only in a black hole with a mass of approximately 10,000 [[solar mass]]es or greater.<ref>{{cite book|title=General Relativity: An introduction for physicists|first1=Michael Paul\n|last1=Hobson|first2=George|last2=Efstathiou|first3=Anthony N.|last3=Lasenby|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2006|isbn=978-0-521-82951-9|page=265|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&pg=PA265\n|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=5dryXCWR7EIC&pg=PA265|chapter=11.

For [[black hole]]s, this manifests as [[Hawking radiation]], and the larger question of how the black hole possesses a temperature is part of the topic of [[black hole thermodynamics]]. For accelerating particles, this manifests as the [[Unruh effect]], which causes space around the particle to appear to be filled with matter and radiation.\n\nAccording to the controversial [[Firewall (physics)|black hole firewall]] hypothesis, matter falling into a black hole would be burned to a crisp by a high energy \"firewall\" at the event horizon.\n\nAn alternative is provided by the [[Black hole complementarity|complementarity principle]], according to which, in the chart of the far observer, infalling matter is thermalized at the horizon and reemitted as Hawking radiation, while in the chart of an infalling observer matter continues undisturbed through the inner region and is destroyed at the singularity. This hypothesis does not violate the [[no-cloning theorem]] as there is a single copy of the information according to any given observer. Black hole complementarity is actually suggested by the scaling laws of [[String Theory|strings]] approaching the event horizon, suggesting that in the Schwarzschild chart they stretch to cover the horizon and thermalize into a [[Planck length]]-thick membrane.\n\nA complete description of local event horizons generated by gravity is expected to, at minimum, require a theory of [[quantum gravity]]. One such candidate theory is [[M-theory]].  Another such candidate theory is [[Loop Quantum Gravity|loop quantum gravity]].\n\n==See also==\n<!-- Please do not repeat links already present on this page -->\n{{Portal|Physics}}\n* [[Abraham\u2013Lorentz force]]\n* [[Acoustic metric]]\n* [[Black hole thermodynamics#Beyond black holes|Beyond black holes]]\n* [[Black hole electron]]\n* [[Black hole starship]]\n* [[Cosmic censorship hypothesis]]\n* [[Dynamical horizon]]\n* [[Event Horizon Telescope]]\n* [[Hawking radiation]]\n* [[Kugelblitz (astrophysics)]]\n* [[Micro black hole]]\n* [[Rindler coordinates]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking]]\n* {{Cite book| title=Black Holes and Time Warps | author=Kip Thorne | publisher=W.

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region.

It is located in the northern-central part of the province, in a region of foothills and high plains, on the eastern side of the [[Andes]]. As of the {{census-ar|2010}}, Mendoza had a population of 115,041 with a metropolitan population of 1,055,679, making [[Greater Mendoza]] the fourth largest census metropolitan area in the country.\n\n[[National Route 7 (Argentina)|Ruta Nacional 7]], the major road running between [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], runs through Mendoza. The city is a frequent stopover for climbers on their way to [[Aconcagua]] (the highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres) and for [[adventure travel]]ers interested in [[mountaineering]], [[hiking]], [[horse riding]], [[rafting]], and other sports.

The Huarpes devised a system of irrigation that was later developed by the Spanish. This allowed for an increase in population that might not have otherwise occurred. The system is still evident today in the wide trenches ([[acequia]]s), which run along all city streets, watering the approximately 100,000 trees that line every street in Mendoza.[[File:Traza de la segunda fundaci\u00f3n de Mendoza, 1562.jpg|left|thumb|Print of the second foundation of Mendoza, 1562]]It is estimated that fewer than 80 Spanish settlers lived in the area before 1600, but later prosperity increased due to the use of indigenous and slave labor, and the [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] presence in the region. When nearby rivers were tapped as a source of irrigation in 1788 agricultural production increased. The extra revenues generated from this, and the ensuing additional trade with [[Buenos Aires]], no doubt led to the creation of the state of [[Cuyo (Argentina)|Cuyo]] in 1813 with [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] as governor.
